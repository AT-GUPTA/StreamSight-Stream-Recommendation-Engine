At the time, I was a big Mass Effect fan so I was super excited about Dragon Age Origins. And let me tell you I was not wrong, this game was awesome back in the day! 

It's still very good and it definitely holds up in 2024. when it comes to the RPG genre.


When it comes to the story, it's an epic story in the fantasy universe that was developed by the OG Bioware team. What do you need more? If you are a fan of Lord of Rings books or movies or if you liked The Wheel of Time book series then this game is a must have! 

The world building and the lore of this universe is something that is mind blowing. I have spent many hours just reading codex entries about the characters and events in the world. 

Like every BioWare game, this one also is very dialogue heavy with choices that will shape the world around you. 

Gameplay is kinda mixed bag at least for me. I remember that I felt  the same way back about it when it released. It has  MMOish feel to it. At the beginning of the game it's really slow and boring. But as you progress with the game and with the leveling of your character it does get better. I really like the tactical options of the combat it gives some depth to it. 

The AI of your companions also can feel a little slow, and unresponsive but nothing major. 

When it comes to atmosphere and music, let me tell you this soundtrack by Inon Zur is still one of my favorite soundtracks in games. The only games that comes close to it when it comes to soundtrack is Gothic 3 or The Witcher 3. It really ties everything together you get immersed into the world very quickly because of it. 

The major downside of this game in 2024. and one of the reasons why I think that this game needs a remaster is, that it has a lot of technical issues to get it running properly on the modern hardware. It has a lot of crashes so my suggestion would be to save ""very frequently"". In order to decrease these problems you would need 4GB memory patch for the .exe file, and I would also recommend to download ""Qwinn's Ultimate DAO Fixpack"" from the Nexus Mods. But even with this you will still get some crashes especially in Denerim.


The main story can take you from 35 hours to complete to 50 hours depending on your approach to completing the game. And when you finish the main story you also have the Awakening expansion that is huge! It can take from 10 to 15 hours to complete. 

I would even argue that this game is one of the best RPGs of all time. And it's for sure a classic. So go play it if you haven't already!",1708472762,1708997645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age Origins is possibly the best RPG I have ever played in my entire life, it was a gem for it's time, the combat is masterfully beautiful although the combat can be repetitive at the end of a long play through, the boss fights more then make up for the repetitiveness, especially if you take the challenges.

The companions are phenomenal, it truly seems like you're getting to know them along your arduous journey through an unknown territory that you or your species might not have ever even seen before, but your companions have. And you can put a chastity belt on the horny one. ;)

By far the best part about this game is the lore, goddamn the lore is PHENOMENAL, it is by far by favorite lore for any game, they really do religion right here, and the templar and magi conflict is lightly touched in DA:O at worse, but it sets a foundation for one of the coolest fantasy conflicts out there.

I picked this one to play out of my backlog, and with some caveats and tweaking it ran perfectly fine for me on Windows 10. I'd say if you have a modern Windows setup, then look at the discussion forums or PCGamingWiki for help on how to best run it.

The choices, dynamics and quips between characters are really good, and I like the main cast of followers very much. My only major complaint outside of getting the game to run  is that some of the combat encounters, and this happens in spikes of difficulty across the game, feel incredibly unfair and pile-on overwhelming, even on medium difficulty.
Dropping difficulty at certain boss encounters, or just save-scum/cheesing your way through, seemed borderline mandatory sometimes, and it made me a bit frustrated, almost dropping the game before finishing. Luckily you have a lot of room for micromanaging what each squad member does during battle while you can pause the fight and really strategize, which is encouraged once you figure it out.

I'm glad I didn't drop it though, because it was super worthwhile playing through the main story the way I wanted to. If you can put up with my gripes then go ahead.",1698748863,1708519255,True,6,0,0.586206912994384766,0,True,False,False

My biggest problems with the game:

-Combat encounters can be poorly balanced and have weird difficulty spikes.

-The game will not work without adding a 4gb patch. You can do so here steam://openurl/https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451 (Don't worry it's super simple to install.)

-I'd say Madd's Gift Guide, 5th Dog Slot, and Bash are essential mods for new players. You'll find the game much more enjoyable having these make the game just a tiny bit more accessible without compromising the vanilla experience.

But it's not as if they don't fix bugs. They've removed all the useful bugs and glitches, such as infinite exp from Duncan for completing a quest early on repeatedly, duplicating items at vendors for infinite gold / equipment, the infinite perk point bug.. Pretty much if it was actually fun to have in the game, it was fixed, while all of the other bugs were left as is. 

If you go to one of the DLC's and side with the Mage there against a Demon, during the fight with the Demon, he will begin the fight with an Explosion spell and instantly knock you and your entire teams health to half, and even if you don't get killed by him spamming Explosion, he then instantly forces you into another room for a ritual and your health doesn't regenerate at all between fights.

[h2]POSITIVES[/h2]
First time playing this game (after Baldur's Gate 3 as well) and I love it tremendously! The story is so epic and, personally, I believe it's better than BG3 (as a standalone, not the entire Baldur's Gate lore). You're involved with politics and get to mingle with the factions that are trying to defend their skin against threats from the inside and from the second coming of the ancient demon spawns spun out of a legendary tale. I truly appreciate games that try to involve political aspects like choices that affect a kingdom. Storytelling is brilliant. It is so fleshed out that almost every aspect of the things you do throughout the game get reiterated in the end and you get to witness the implications.

One major thing that I consider the strongest point of this game is the companionship. The companion interactions in this game make BG3's feel so shallow. It is definitely the highlight of the game for me. But, it isn't fair for me to compare because BG3 truly now is like a love letter for this game with so many of its' gameplay mechanics being ""borrowed"" such as the camp, affinity, gifts, and companion epilogues. More so, there were so many cutscenes (I avoid to spoil of course) that reminded me a lot of BG3. Oh by the way, yes, the cutscenes are all rendered in-game.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]BEWARE OF TECHNICAL ISSUES[/h2]
I hope the positives should give you enough expectations of what you'll get in the game. However, I want you to consider some negatives from my experience playing the game as well. Before that, let's talk about the bane of this game's experience, technical issues. I noticed the game was shipped as a 32-bit executable which may be a problem for our current 64-bit system. My game crashed many times early on in the game and I had to install some mods to fix this. The most essential mod would be the 4 GB patcher that allows the game to access more than 2/3 GB of RAM (correct me if I'm wrong). Yes, the game hasn't been updated probably. Since this is the Steam version, the game executable is encrypted and you need some additional steps to patch the game. Be weary that the patcher will still give you crashes sometimes, but it would be very rare at least. To mitigate this, make sure to save the game frequently. SURPRISINGLY, other than the crashes, I didn't experience a single bug whatsoever. I strongly encourage you to read some guides in the Steam Community of this game to setup your game for the first time after installing or maybe after your fifth consecutive crashes. 

A small technical issue is also that I don't recommend you playing the game for too long since the game does have issue with memory leakage and your game will slow down significantly. Don't worry if you experience this. Just exit from the game and open it again to continue playing. For me, the issue seems to arise after 5 hours of non-stop session.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]NEGATIVES[/h2]
Now, let's talk about what things that annoy me a lot or aspects that I dislike from the game. The most annoying part of this game is the combination of the combat and level design. I don't want to criticize the combat alone because it is unique and fluid. It is a real time combat with touches of turn-based aspect. We get to strategize spells/attacks and move each member of the party accordingly. In this certain combat style, I don't think I could recall a game with this combat style at the moment. The same thing applies to the level design. Nothing is wrong with it alone since it does make the game feel large and expansive. Also, it gave them them the possibility to throw many side quests and variety of loot. HOWEVER, given these two aspects combined, it is super annoying. Why? You have this large dungeon or area that you get to explore and fight in, but it's the same combat encounter being repeated over and over in a single level. It's fine at first few levels, but it gets really tedious and repetitive the more you play. Like, to sum it up, it's pretty much just 20 enemies swarming you out of nowhere then you fight with the same spells or patterns for over 10+ times in a single dungeon. You turn left, you combat, you turn right, you combat, you go down, you combat, and so forth. It is super annoying and at one point made me want to quit hadn't it been for the story.

Second thing is the staircases. I'm not exaggerating when I say this, but like 90% of the staircases you face will likely get you stuck. There's this weird collision or invisible ramp on top of each staircase and since you cannot jump in this game, you will frequently get blocked from reaching the top of the staircase. Therefore, you have to be very precise when going up staircases.

My penultimate complaint would be the direction of the main quests. You aren't really told in which order should you play the first four main quests which is normal in RPG games, but it can be quite troublesome since there is a disparity of enemy placements that could easily make you feel like, ""Oh, I don't think I'm supposed to face this many enemy this early!"" Don't worry however, since the enemies are adjusted to your level so you can do the missions in any order you'd like. I accidentally completed the mission with probably the most amount of enemy first time around and the rest was a breeze.

Last thing is the loot. I'll straight on confessing that loot in chests are not worth it most of the time. Shame considering there is an entire skill tree that tricks you into thinking that lockpicking matters. Well, let me tell you it's kind of not worth it. The only reason why you should consider scaling up your lockpicking skill is to open locked doors without keys, but even then, you don't really encounter much locked doors that lead you to somewhere grand except for the last 2/3 quests.",1707222426,1707222907,True,6,0,0.563736855983734131,0,True,False,False

A rough TL;DR for all you lazy, illiterate bastards out there! You're welcome.

I don't even know where to start with this one... 'Tis awesome, for sure. Reminds me of the first time I played Mass Effect 1. I was pretty blown away by the end of it, although for this one, it was a [i] very [/i] bumpy ride.

I will start with the good stuff. 

The game has many origins for your character to start as and these all have unique beginnings/story attached to them which are also well worth experiencing alone just for the extra lore and content. I recommend playing all of them and do them all before the one you're going to play as you're main (I recommend Human Noble as you're main!). They will all help you to better understand events/people throughout the game. I also recommend doing the DLC [i] Leliana's Song [/i] before you begin you're main as well because this unlocks extra items for use in Origins and gives some nice background to one of your companions. It serves as a nice prequel.      

I recommend looking here and downloading/playing this before playing the Dwarf Noble origin. [i] It is an unvoiced storyline that serves as a prologue to the Dwarf Noble Origin... [/i]

https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/A_Tale_of_Orzammar 
(There's a link to where you can download this extra bit of content on this page).

There's an enormous amount of dialogue... Too much, maybe? Nah, you can never have enough! You can truly make your character be the person you want him/her to be. It's amazing. Throughout the game there's many references to your origin and perhaps other actions you've made so far in the game. Then there's the interaction between companions. Their banter is sometimes hilarious. The game may be rough around the edges but it's this that carries the game, in my opinion, and makes it all worth it.   

+ The story, lore and world is amazing and there's plenty of reading material to help you better understand the world you're playing in. 
+ The companions are likeable and have plenty to say. You can even romance most of them and have hot, steamy sex. You can even have a threesome with a pirate and your gay elf companion... GOTY, indeed.
+ There's so much to do. You're looking at well over 50 hours if you're a completionist.
+ Lots and lots of mods.

Memorable quote: [To a crippled old beggar.] You're pathetic. Rent yourself out as a table or something. 😂

Okay, you can stop reading now and go play this amazing game. 'Tis the year of the dragon, after all.

Now for the bad. I'll bullet point this to save time. Some are probably just nitpicks.

- It may take some work to get running smoothly (e.g. you'll probably need the 4GB patch and have to look up guides for everything else).
- Always getting stuck on the environment.
- Invisible walls REEEEEEEEEEEEE.
- No quest marker. This isn't a problem 99% of the time but for at least one quest, there wasn't even a hint as to where I had to go and the general location is packed with enemies and ugly environment. I had already been there for long enough by then but yeah, let's move on.
-  Slowdown/Memory leak - the longer you play, the worse performance gets.
- Companions don't walk with you - always running to catch up. Run. Stop. Run. Stop. REEEEEEE.
- NPCs phase out of existence sometimes.
- Too many loading screens.
- Fast travel system is poopy, especially in some areas where you just want to get the hell out.
- Companions are pretty dumb and walk into traps.
- Dialogue is great as said before but most of it is made inaccessible because once you've selected one dialogue (e.g. a question), it moves onto a totally different dialogue tree or the NPC closes dialogue and refuses to talk again. 
- Too many locked chests/doors - it's basically a requirement that you have lockpicking or a rogue in your party or have to switch to the one in your party every time you need to unlock a door/chest. Lock Bash mod works wonders.
- Too much bull shit - combat tactics, armour restrictions, etc. Just... BAH! Poop.

But worst of all is the combat. If you've ever played an MMO, it's like that. It's so slow and tedious - then on top of that, you have to micromanage your companions. A lot of places are padded out with so many enemies and waste so much of your time. I used cheats for most of my first time through (one shotting everything, for example) and look at my hours! Note: About a 100 hours by the time I was finished. I couldn't imagine doing all that without. A lot of the places I'm talking about make vanilla World of Warcraft dungeons/raids seem tame in comparison - huge, sprawling caverns and ruins that are seemingly endless with groups of enemies ready to gank you around every corner. 

'Twas a happy ending though... It grew on me. I love the game and all of its jank. 

Now for some final bits and pieces that I've not mentioned. 

The DLC order is confusing and not explained at all. I'll hopefully save you some time from having to go and Google this for yourself; Leliana's Song > Origins (the base game) > Awakening > Golems > Witch Hunt > other. 

Maybe deactivate the DLC called Feastday Gifts and Pranks because that can break companions rapport/dialogue if you use the items it adds.

[b]First of all, let me start by saying that Dragon Age: Origins is a good RPG game, particularly for its release year of 2009. 
But boy, oh boy, the game is indeed flawed, and some aspects didn't stand the test of time as well as others. [/b]
For example, the movement and combat can feel pretty clunky for the most part. I mean, you get used to it, but still... Also, my graphics were glitching out often, and I regularly got crashes (especially in Denerim). I guess the game isn't optimized for newer Windows versions. 

Aspects that I enjoyed were the graphics and a couple of smart and interestingly designed quests. Furthermore, I bonded with some characters/companions who were quite likeable and witty. 
But after about 30 hours into playing, I often caught myself wishing this game would be much shorter and more compromised as it is. 
If all areas in the game were as condensed and only filled with the good stuff as [spoiler]Brecilian Forest and Redcliffe [/spoiler]were, I would've loved the game dragging onwards. 
But sadly, this wasn't the case. 
[spoiler]Orzammar[/spoiler] was the tipping point for me in this regard. The whole area was goddamn tideous, in my opinion. It must be because the story wasn't interesting and the quests required you to go through endless tunnels and fight thousands of enemies. 
Especially from [spoiler]Orzammar[/spoiler] onwards, the game could not wait to throw combat at you at any given moment. 
[i]Kill all the monsters in the room, proceed to the next room with even more monsters to kill - and so on.[/i] 
Thinking back on it, the game just dragged out waaay too long for my taste. Maybe this was the case because I also played literally every DLC there is. Let me reassure you that only ""The Stone Prisoner"", ""Dragon Age: Awakening"" and maybe ""Witch Hunt"" are worth your precious time. You can skip all the others in good conscience. 

Despite all the complaints I've had with the game, I can't help but to think, that I would have had a more fun time if I had simply gotten more involved with a lot of things in the last 40 hours of playing, instead of trying to get through it quickly at all costs. 
But as I already explained, I didn't have the patience for that because some parts dragged on way too long. 
[b]In conclusion, for me personally, it's a 6.5/10. 
I would recommend it to fans of the RGP genre who have much time on their hands and can see past the nerve-wracking problems the game undoubtedly has.  [/b]",1706472225,1706472609,True,3,0,0.564102530479431152,0,True,False,False

I don't know why I never played this game before as I loved KOTOR 1 & 2 but for some reason I just never got around to playing this title. What can I say other than I missed out in 2009, what was I thinking? This game is superb! I took my time with it spending 170+ hours to complete the main game and loved every minute.

Now, it is not perfect by today's standards but that is to be expected. I can see how influential this game was to so many upon release with many choosing to replay the game over and over with different back stories to experience everything the game has to offer. And boy does it have a lot to offer.

The story is deep, the characters are well written and the voice acting is top tier. The game play is fun but it does get a little stale eventually. I would have liked to have had more damage spells in the game as I played as a Mage but that is a small gripe.

I can see myself playing this again but not for a little while. I will probably mod the game for a second run.

I must say that the game on purchase did crash regularly but after applying the 4gb patch and setting the game to run on one core (set affinity) I did not get any crashes except for two at the back end of the game.

I give this game a 9/10. Even with outdated graphics it just does not matter because the game is so good. A true game for the ages.

UPSIDE: 1) The story is fun, adventurous and even satisfying. The full adventure and All DLC add-ons are included here.  DOWNSIDE: It's truly sad if you're experiencing this game Here for the first time, because the interface, though workable, is a highly inefficient, cumbersome rework, and it seems only through laziness that they did not reproduce the game exactly. I spent 90 minutes trying to get over it, and couldn't. If I were playing this for the first time, I'd still have frustration with it. Had I not waited so long to actually try it out after I bought it, I'd have gotten a refund. An alternate assessment claimed that we should be happy for Steam taking the trouble adapt the game. That person was high, and Steam didn't.  SUBJECTIVE: 2010 graphics, true, but not hard to get into at all. They stand up well.  ENDGAME: Until they can 100% reproduce this game by way of Xbox controller interface the was it was on Xbox, I'd buy the game through Xbox if still available, even tho the DLC add-ons are no longer available. They are by no means needed to enjoy the game or complete the story. ((Heads-up comments now dealt with: Thanks to Walrus on a solid detail; 1) I'd called the game 1st-person mistakenly having done most combat with a just-over-the-shoulder view. 2) The other's here nor there. The game used to offer the DLC content directly through it's own interface as opposed to the Xbox store and even now all is not purchasable there))",1704565286,1704949301,False,0,0,0.449826985597610474,2,True,False,False

Key Features:

Deep Storytelling: The game's narrative intricacies, driven by player choices, plunge you into a world on the brink of chaos. Your decisions impact relationships, alliances, and the fate of the entire realm.

Diverse Characters: The companions you recruit are not mere sidekicks; they are fully realized characters with their own histories, ambitions, and conflicts. The depth of these relationships adds layers to an already immersive story.

Strategic Combat: Dragon Age: Origins introduces a tactical combat system that rewards thoughtful planning. Battles are not just hack-and-slash; they demand strategy, positioning, and a careful consideration of your party's abilities.

Intricate World-Building: Thedas comes to life with its diverse landscapes, cultures, and histories. From the towering spires of the Circle of Magi to the treacherous Deep Roads, every location is meticulously crafted.

Awakening DLC:
The Awakening expansion seamlessly extends the Dragon Age experience, taking place after the events of Origins. This expansion doesn't just add more content; it introduces a new narrative arc, compelling characters, and fresh challenges.

New Threats: Face a mysterious darkspawn uprising and navigate the political landscape as the Warden Commander. The expansion introduces a new antagonist, the Architect, and raises the stakes for the fate of Amaranthine.

Companion Dynamics: Encounter new companions, each with their own unique stories and backgrounds. The interactions between the new and existing characters deepen the narrative and keep players invested.

Expanded Gameplay: The expansion enhances gameplay with new abilities, spells, and items. The level cap is raised, providing a sense of progression for seasoned players while introducing challenges for newcomers.

Additional DLCs:
Dragon Age: Origins boasts a collection of downloadable content that further enriches the gaming experience:

Leliana's Song: Unravel the mysterious past of Leliana, one of Origins' companions, in this standalone DLC.

The Golems of Amgarrak: Delve into the mystery of an abandoned Thaig and face formidable enemies in this challenging dungeon-crawl.

Regrettably, I find myself unable to endorse this particular version of the game. It appears to be incompatible with my system, plagued by random crashes and graphic distortions that manifest as bothersome bugs.

This game is the first in the Dragon Age trilogy (soon to be quadrilogy), and in my opinion, the BEST. It is also the best all-around RPG I've ever played. Ignoring all the other aspects of its gameplay (the fact that it's topdown, real-time with pause), it has some of the best stories, lore and writing (both main questline and a ton of side-quests), characters and interactions between them and your character, well-thought out deep dialogue and options within it, multiple ways to solve most quests, interesting and sometimes unexpected/humorous scenarios (much like the DIvinity series, just mostly serious). It even has good visuals considering its release date, and the fact that it has fully voiced cutscenes and camera control really sets it apart from the rest in the genre (isometric RPGs such as Baldur's gate 1&2, Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny, Divine Divinity etc).

When it comes to gameplay, it's standard top-down turn-based/real-time with pause RPG stuff. However, you can control your character with WASD keys if you wish and zoom in a close third person view. Theoretically it's possible to only control your character as if you're playing an oldschool tab-targeting MMO, if you program the companions' AI exactly as you want it to behave, but that might take ages depending on the difficulty (the AI programming is VERY customizeable).

My favourite part about this game is how alive it feels. You WILL be surprised that that one character has something to comment on something that just happened (that you thought irrelevant), either within dialogue or seemingly out of nowhere while exploring the world. Sometimes this event that just happened might lead to an unexpected companion quest, a fun interaction, an inside joke that will linger for the rest of the game or something that will be mentioned again many hours later, even during main questline dialogue. The companion characters are full of wit and you will grow attached to (some of) them by the end of the game. [spoiler] Thankfully, some of them might follow you into the next game [/spoiler]

My only complaint about the game is its lack of balance. [spoiler] Very early on it's made clear how powerful magic is lore-wise, and this is true even gameplay-wise. Of course I was already going to make a caster, but most of the companions aren't, making some of them very weak with little incentive to keep them in party (some of their personalities are so magnetic, however, that you may want to include them regardless). [/spoiler]
One of the best features that was pretty common in RPGs of the 2000s is importing save files. This works beautifully from DA:Origins to DA:2 and DA:Inquisition. Yes, decisions in the first game impact not only the second but also the third game. By that point [spoiler] your character is a legend whose name and story is well known to most people in the continent. [/spoiler]

Commentary: The story is excellent and well-written with plenty of good voice acting, rich and understandable lore, and respectful social commentary on the conflict between religious authoritarianism and an increasingly frustrated class of oddball meatbags.

The Good:
🔥 Engaging Story: It's like being in a fantasy novel, but you get to make the plot twists!
🎉 Hilarious Banter: Your party members have the social skills of a potato, and it's fantastic.
⚔️ Tactical Combat: Plan your battles like a chess match, but with more fireballs.

The Bad:
🤷‍♂️ Fashion Dilemmas: Seriously, what's up with those elf boots?!
🚨 Occasional Crashes: The game crashes as often as your in-game relationships. Unpredictable but survivable.

Dragon Age: Origins is a rollercoaster of emotions, fashion disasters, and the occasional technical hiccup. If you can forgive the crashes, you're in for a heck of a time. Just don't get too attached to your elf boots; they might crash too.",1704146976,1704146976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

AND TO COMPLETELY PISS ME OFF, IT CRASHED RIGHT AT THE END CINEMATIC WHERE I LEARN ALL ABOUT THE FUTURE AND MY CHOICES....

Despite all this the game is literally one of the best I've ever played, the lore, story, companions, the dilemmas and all the impactful choices, it had me second guessing my choices for the greater good and all that really made it super immersive cause it made you feel like you are part of the world, simply incredible!

For that alone it gets to be on my A-TIER List and therefore one of the greatest games of all time. I'ts not a perfect game by no means, I really did not like the combat at all and some of the game design areas were dragged and never ending (I am looking at you Deep Roads) so I switched to the easiest difficulty since I just wanted to enjoy the story, but it still had some difficulty spikes that forced me to micromanage my team in order to win.

I just wish EA will optimize the game or make a remaster soon, you can't be selling a broken game.

It terms of atmosphere, lore, music, captivating storytelling, this game has it all. It's dated, sure, but it more than makes up for it in almost every other aspect. As with every other Bioware game, they first make you fall in love with the characters, not just your companions, but they give us depth, emotion, and history to the people you meet in each of the Origin stories. The music is stunning, while I normally mute most music my games, DA:O is the exception, it not only adds to the atmosphere, it injects its own array of emotions alongside the storyline.

And not to mention the sheer weight of the lore in this game? It's mind boggling to think how they could have constructed such a detailed history and timeline into a single game. But it being Bioware, I'm not surprised. Each character has it's own beautifully built past, personality, and journey that they go on. You get to watch these characters, not just your own, grow and evolve as the game(s) progress. And soon enough, you're grinning like a fool when you see them again in the future sequels.

If you're new to Bioware games, I get it, it can be intimidating when they say each choice has a consequence. But it's worth it when you see the world be shaped in each game. It's scary, it's fun, and it's at times, admittedly, a bit cheesy (ha, alistair joke), but worth it. I promise.

That is what I was promised. That is not what I received.

[b] Dialogues and companions [/b]
I'll start with something good, and something that is most important to me, not only in Dragon Age games, but games in general. The dialogues in this game are... good. Not the greatest, but enjoyable. The lore is interesting to listen to, as are your companions' stories. Some are better, some are worse. Alistair, Morrigan, Leliana, Shale, Zevran - all are good and interesting. Others - bad of mediocre. Secret companion - very, very bad, but we'll get to that soon.

There are no interesting companion quests, like in DA2 or DAI. In DAI they were one of the best things about the game. Here? ""Go talk to him"", ""Go get that"", ""Oh great you've done that, now listen to these 3 lines of dialogue, OK we're done here"". Wow. My greatest expectations were about companions. Even after beating inquisition 5 or so times, I can spend hours listening to them, their thoughts and stories. After great and memorable conversations with great and memorable people in DA2 and DAI, I expected near-perfection in DAO. That's what was promised by the fans. Once again, the game did not deliver.

[b] Story [/b]
It exists. Nothing special. Spoilers ahead, of course.
People often talked about Corypheus being caricature bad guy, but is Loghain any better? You don't learn anything about him. All he does is retreat and screw you over time and time again for no reason. I so wanted to learn what made him tick, what was his brilliant plan, why he did what he did. After all, he was describes as a great man, a leader, a brilliant strategist. I did not know that I needed to harden Alistair in order to get him to be king and spare Loghain. By the time I discovered it, I was quite furious. But ok, that may be on me for not picking a casino-based dialogue after his sister quest 30 hours ago. I had no intention of replaying this game at that point so I used some mods to harden Alistair before Landsmeet since I really wanted Loghain in my party, but didn't want Alistair dead or gone. I used them, recruited Loghain and tried to learn about him. I expected long, Inquisition-like dialogues, where he would explain his motivation in great detail. All I've got were 3 f****g lines of dialogue, and he didn't even go into detail, just said something like ""Sod off, let's get moving already"". Wow. Greatest antagonist of all time. It was definitely worth it spending hours trying to make him my companion.

And I won't even count the Archdemon as an antagonist, he has less character then Corypheus' dragon. And frankly, Loghain too has less character then most minor characters in DA2 and DAI.

I also spent quite a lot of time on Landsmeet. I couldn't figure out why, despite 90% of people present voting for me, was I outvoted. The reason was simple. The entire sequence is a charade, a scripted charade. It doesn't matter what you do prior to Landsmeet, who you save, what allies and evidence you acquire and how you use them. You either select a random ""correct"" option, or proceed to f yourself outta there. I didn't like the Winter Palace in DAI, or at least replaying it for the 5th time, but at least what you said, what you did and what you collected there mattered. In fact, everything you do there matters. Even jumping too much, as it will lower your court approval. Here - nothing matters. You either win the casino or you loose.

Another problem of the story - it is too quick for its own good. You don't get to learn about most things outside of the codex. And no, I don't need a guide to explain me everything through dialogues. But give me at least something. You're just thrown into the thick of things, deal with it. And no one will explain anything later too.

This problem is especially noticeable in Orzammar, where you don't even know who are the guys you are supposed to choose between! You are given 0 information on that. As I understand, you know more if you are a dwarf, but that doesn't excuse it one bit.

[b] Combat [/b]
Oh this will be quick. It's horrible. It aged horrendously. I played as a mage, and sure, there are a lot of spells, but what's the point? Many are almost the same, some are utterly useless and most are just boring. I've seen many people criticizing DAI for the castrated combat, lack of spells, blood magic, etc. But is it truly better here? Nope. Worse. Much worse. I could live with the same 3 animations for all spells, I've seen worse. But the entire combat is unbearably clunky, and all you do is just spam one button.

It is also great to note that despite blood magic being outlawed and condemned throughout Thedas, even in Tevinter (officially at least), nobody has any problem with the Warden wielding it in front of civilians, even during a bloody duel with Loghain. So deep, so thoughtful.

And the final boss gameplay-wise... Well, it's a bloody summoner. A giant sponge who summons minions. Even by 2009's standards, that is very, very low.

[b] Music [/b]
It's... there? It's no Elder Scrolls for sure. There are some memorable compositions, but nothing is even close to DAI.

[b] The world [/b]
It consists of a bunch of semi-open locations. Boring, generic locations. There are no distinct architectural features present here that were introduced in later games. From the gameplay perspective, things are much worse. The locations are boring to explore. They have this 2000-ish feeling to them, and not in a good way. There were no memorable locations for me personally, except maybe Ostagar. I expected Orzammar to be grand after hearing so much about it in future games, but it wasn't. It's just 3 small districts and a few building. And it's still the best city-like location in the game. Denerim was just awful. Generic fantasy streets and castles.

[b] Gameplay [/b]
Outside of combat, the overall gameplay isn't great either. You stumble around, loot random boxes, read random books (finding them and aiming to loot 'em is extremely uncomfortable, the controls are one of the worst I've seen in my life too), speak to people. By the time I reached Lothering, I was excited. I could talk to most people there, do OK-ish quests for them, explore a little. But very soon I realized there is nothing to explore, most people have nothing to say, and the quests are no better than Bethesda's randomly generated ones.

I didn't do much crafting, and didn't need to outside of that one quest in Lothering, which was supposed, I assume, to teach me how to craft potions. Outside the main story, there wasn't much to do in this world. Everything is either meaningless or too quick, like the companion quests.

[b] Conclusion [/b]
By this point you probably think I'm an Inquisition fanboy with no appreciation for classics. Maybe. But I'm not here to say that this game is awful. It isn't. But it also is not as great as most people say it is. Are they blinded by nostalgia, or 'tis I who is blinded - I do not know. I'm here to express my feelings and share my experience. I loved Dragon Age for almost 10 years now. Maybe not as much as the Elder Scrolls, but it is one of the best fantasy-series out there. And I love BioWare games with all my heart. Mass Effect is probably my favorite game trilogy.

Alas, I cannot say the same about DAO. I wanted to love this game so much, and had such high hopes... But perhaps that was my mistake. That, ironically, the community that loves this game so much did it most disservice. By making this game seem perfect, they made my experience all the more disappointing. I wanted to finish it, maybe even a few times, but barely forced myself to do it once. In the end, it wasn't even worth it. All I've got were some texts explaining what happened later. I won't play the DLCs, although I wanted to. It's better to watch them on YouTube rather than forcing myself once again and ending up straight up hating this game.",1703854632,1703854982,False,3,0,0.481355935335159302,0,True,False,False

10+ years of stagnation have only made something that was serviceable for it's time even sadder. EA clearly didn't care about this game dying beyond where their quarterly margins can see it.

BEYOND THE META REASONS, this game is extreme MID. 
Real shame there's a solid story and setting tied down by some of the worst gameplay and general design to come out of Bioware. The design philosophy behind this game is the stillborn fetus drawing lineage from both the original Baldur's Gate duology and Warcraft, which under most circumstances would be a recipe for success. Unfortunately it all falls apart in play, not for being particularly ambitious either. Exploration is an afterthought and more often than not only shows you more of the meager offerings you have to look at in the frame of play from tactics or grounded views. Combat at it's best as fine, but at it's worst is disjointed and feels like something from BG1 ten plus years prior. Between those two points, the general mechanics of interacting with the world around you are weak and don't serve to do anything than platform the typical mainstays of RPGs (gathering reagents, picking up random loot) for the sake of them being there. Beyond that, there's the odd headscratcher as a player when it comes to execution. Example: even early on in your adventure you will have to deal with the odd thug or town drunk taking umbrage with you, leading to various unexpected scuffles. Typical roleplaying stuff right? You beat the bozos, and miraculously before the enemy can go below 1hp you snap into dialogue with them and can make whatever moral decisions you would like from there. Cute set dressing, lil bit of roleplay prompt, I can dig it once in a blue moon. But no, this game decides to lean on it virtually every opportunity [b] except a few spoiler heavy choices that would actually warrant a level of second guessing, [/b] in setting and from a metagame standpoint. 

In the most succinct terms: play it on console if you have an itch to revisit or even try it out. Emulate it even, savestates seem like a clutch move here. This just isn't a well made game, especially on PC.",1703754262,1703754262,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It combines the gameplay-rich experience of Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale with the narrative focus and cinematic visuals of modern Sony games and it balances then flawlessly. Everything in this game is pretty much perfect. The gameplay, the combat, the charcaters, the art design and atmosphere, the story. Its the perfect game for newcomers to RTC RPGs and experienced players alike, as the amount of depth and complexity in the combat can be tailored to your liking through the different difficulty settings and you'll find a fair challenge in each. 

It's almost surreal to see that a game like this was actually made and released. A masterpiece.

I'm here giving my review only [b]to share the patches/mods I think new players need to install before starting your campaign for the first time[/b], which is actually quite important for DAO to provide you a better experience on today's PCs. Hopefully this will help more people.

The Mod names illustrated below are the original titles from Nexus. Also I'll provide IDs for you to directly search using URL. In addition to the 2nd mod which has its own installer, the installation of others needed just one basic step operation - [i]drag the files / folders into the directory required by the mod (most are 'override', which serves as the official mod path of the game)[/i]. Thus they will not replace your source files expect for the first one, which you will see the reason soon, making it easy to install or go.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]1.〖Must〗4GB LAA patch compatible DAorigins.exe[/h3]
ID：5989
- [b]Need to use with Large Address Aware Patch (LAA). [/b]The author has attached the url of it in the mod's description.

This mod replaces the Steam version of the exe file with an unencrypted version in order to work with the LAA patch to increase the RAM usage of DAO. Without this mod and the patch, the game may crash frequently if set to the highest graphic quality.

[h3]2.〖Highly Recommended〗Dragon Age Redesigned[/h3]
ID：686

It redesigns the WHOLE of the characters in the main campaign, Leliana's Song DLC and Awakening DLC. For NPCs they have Lore version (subtle changed and lore-friendly), Aesthetics version (but with huge difference from vanilla) and Recommended version (a carefully considered fusion of the first two versions) to choose. And there are more varied versions for companions individually.

The Lore version doesn't require any dependencies, the other two do.

To be honest although DAO and ME1 are almost the same period works (or even later), the former's character models are just ... Never mind we got creative mod authors thankfully! 'Tis a mod that will 100% enhances your play experience, I personally recommend the lore version for it matches the vanilla style more. The only little flaw is that the mod doesn't change the morph of Alistair, which may makes you wanna seek another for our beloved warden fellow separately.

[h3]3.〖Highly Recommended〗AddItem with Console Improved - Script[/h3]
ID: 3708

Unlocks the in-game console, with optimized quick command.

Especially in Awakening there are still enormous amount of bugs. So prepare a cheat console beforehand may come in handy when something unexpected happens, but remember to control yourself in normal playthrough!

[h3]4.〖Highly Recommended〗Make CONSOLE commands visible[/h3]
ID：1110

Literally, use it with the console mod above.

[h3]5.〖Highly Recommended〗Awakening Silverite Mines Bugfix[/h3]
ID: 1762

Fixes the infamous equipment glitch happening at location 'Silverite Mines' in Awakening DLC that causes you to permanently lose some/all of the equipment on your player character. Still it looks like a small number of people lost their gear even after installed the mod, so it's recommended to remember this location's name and manually save before you get down to it. It's the next box-map during the quest after the first appearance of our white-haired keeper, Velanna.

[h3]6.〖Recommended〗Vigilance weapon appearance fix alternative[/h3]
ID: 3000

Fixes the unique model of ""Vigilance"", the most famous personal sword of the protagonist in the Awakening DLC, so that it won't be the spitting image of a certain alien sword due to a bug.

[spoiler](Well in fact it really doesn't matter if this mod is installed or not, after all, the time spot getting this sword should be at the end of the whole playthrough, you won't be seeing it for long at all...) But it's still for immersion![/spoiler]

[h3]7.〖Recommended/Must for those who plan to romance Morrigan〗Morrigan Restoration Patch[/h3]
ID: 1120

Restores several missing and fully voiced scenes to the game relating to Morrigan in addition to fixing innumerable issues with various parts of her dialogue not triggering correctly. The mod also restores several new party banter dialogs involving Morrigan, Leliana & Alistair.

(Wait Bioware how could you do that to one of the most important character in DAO... Just so many bugs in this game aren't it)

[h3]8.〖Recommended〗A little leg - combined mesh version - males and females[/h3]
ID: 861

Edited armor meshes that reveal some more skin.

This is a highly customizable mod, you can choose to change a specific type of armor not affecting other armors' models.

[h3]9.〖Optional/Recommended for those who plan to romance Alistair〗Inquisition Inspired Morphs[/h3]
ID：4450

[b]Dependencies: Jenya's random hairstyles(4795), SJC's Skin Tones(4182), Pineappletree's Vibrant Colors(153).[/b] For the Without Realistic Teeth version of Alistair morph anyhow I have to install these three fully. I didn't download the other morphs, so if you want to know more about them just read the description provided by the author.

Taking back the point we mentioned above! Since Redesign mod left Alistair alone with a face in low quality mesh so I found this, and I promise it's the most lore-friendly and awesome Alistair I've ever seen in all the mods that match his model in DAI. It may be a bit too many of the dependencies but hey it's worth it for our most important bro in game [strike](That is, if we did not include the mabari anyhow)[/strike].

The mod also provide other optional files to mod Morrigan, Leliana, Isabella [spoiler](Companion in DA2)[/spoiler] and Cullen [spoiler](Companion in DAI)[/spoiler] but I didn't install them.

-- The game is a bit poorly structured imo, we run around the world for a year, and the darkspawn are just sitting around lothering and the center of the map the entire time for some reason :/ I guess they might be focusing on kidnapping people to turn into broodmothers to make their army much bigger before they start pushing into the bigger cities though, but i still think the game is at least a bit poorly structured :/

-- We can only have a 4 man party in this game, i wish we could have a 6 man party like we could in bg/iwd.

-- We can't make our own custom adventurers/companions like we could in bg/iwd.

-- The crossbows are bugged and don't scale with dex or str like they should, and because this is an ea and bioware game they never fixed it :/ You can fix that with the crossbow tweak mod though, just throw it into the override folder like you would on windows :)

-- The game has the same problem most rpg's have, there are some dumb looking creatures that don't even begin to make sense :/

-- For some reason the mages never clean up their tower after we finish the quest there, they just let their dead stay there on the ground for the rest of the game...

- There are a few side quests that have some questionable logic in them :/

Here you will create your protagonist and forge a clearer picture of just who they are with every decision they/you make.

But they won't be going it alone. A handful of diverse companions will become available as you progress, each with their own agendas and intricacies. The campfire conversations had with this bunch are among the most memorable in the game.

The gameplay is also worth noting. The selection of abilities available as characters level up means that two of the same class can be made to suit very different roles, allowing multiple playthroughs to feel genuinely unique. Combat against large numbers of powerful enemies can result in some very satisfying use of the tactical options to achieve victory, particularly in the higher difficulty settings.
 
The story's central conceit -- a shattered kingdom under siege by a great and powerful darkness -- is incredibly well written, and sets up countless opportunities for the protagonist to make defining moral choices.

Most of the main story lines are captivating. The combat allows you to find creative solutions to difficult packs of enemies. Planning battles and beating difficult enemies feels rewarding. There are tons of interesting and memorable characters.

Some nitpicks I have with it. I find the banter between companions to be annoying. There are menial side-quests that belong in MMOs and not a game like this. I understand this game was made right when WoW was a pop culture phenomenon and some aspects of it seeped into solo RPGs of that gaming era.

I would recommend this game to anyone who loves good fantasy, character building and tactical combat.

While the game is clearly showing its age both graphically and in terms of art-style, it is still worth playing to this day if people prefer game-play that they are able to take  their time with and pause in between to come up with a suitable strategy,

It is however worth pointing out that due to the game's age, launch issues, crashes, bugs and glitches are present. Therefore, I recommend that anyone who wishes to still purchase and try out this game but doesn't want to run into these kind of issues (or at the very least minimise the occurrence of such issues) would do best to consult this link here.

[++] [b] I liked the story.[/b]  It might be a classic for most gamers, nonetheless, it was entertaining considering it's a 2010 game.

The story is not only told, it is also shown with cutscenes and told even more with Codex entries that you can read upon finding them. This is a huge positive for me. And the terms used are also unique, I had never heard of them before.
Overall, the game was unique and entertaining enough to keep playing.

[++] [b] Characters personality and relationship buildup were quite good.[/b] 
You get to know every member of your team that decides to tag along with you.
Not everyone will be loyal, they will join you in different circumstances and I found this charming.

The one thing that confuses me is why [spoiler]Oghren[/spoiler] stayed.
They were rude, lacked any manner and I was this close to tell them to go.

Everyone else had a reason to be with me.

[++] [b] The music is on point.[/b]  Battle themes, location themes, I liked them all. And again this is a 2010 game. Really really really well done.

[+] [b] Easily moddable.[/b]  There is plenty of custom content to download on Nexus Mod, possibly creating new replay value. I am just at the beginning.

[h2] NEUTRAL: [/h2]

[+] [b]Graphics are fine.[/b] It's an old game and it offers in other fields.

Besides it fits.

[h2] CONS: [/h2]

[-] [b]I found the GUI to be small and the text were hard to read.[/b] The subtitles are shown to the top of the screen for whatever reason. This was easily fixed with a mod and the game became much better for me.

[-] [b]Dialogues can be too fast and new information can result to be too much to understand what's going on.[/b]

There is a chatlog in the game, however, I would have appreciated a click-to-proceed mechanic for the dialogues. (I am not english native, so I need to read texts without being in a rush to understand what's going on)
AFAIK, there is no mod for this. 

[---] [b]The game could crash.[/b]
I bought the game full knowing this could happen, and sadly it did. I found a way to fix the crashing issue by following a guide after a few attempts doing stuff I found online.

Even this fix suddenly stopped working for me and the game would keep crashing no matter what, but somehow it fixed itself.

That's all just one big multifaceted thing, but it counts for a lot; some 80% of my reason for playing this game fits within that one sentence.  

The game's flaws are legion, but most of them are effectively nitpicks, like the fact that there are a bunch of background-detail objects rendered in the game which only ever serve as decorations, when many of them logically could have been usable.  The significant flaws include an overly complected combat system, where many of the numerous abilities that you have to micromanage for optimal performance are rather petty adjustments to an inherently uninteresting swords-and-bows melee default; only mage characters are terribly enjoyable to play, and these are often just stuck healing the ""tank"" who prevents them from being stabbed, up until they gain access to the big high-level spells which allow them to utterly trivialize the frontline combatants, while possibly also killing them with friendly fire.  

The other big flaw is that inventory management is a fairly punishing process, with characters constantly unable to pick up loot unless they discard previously collected items, because you go for long periods of time not being able to find anyone you can sell your useless junk to, and are only allowed to carry a fairly tiny quantity of gear despite constantly being flooded with marginally-useful trinkets.  (The Ultimate Edition kind of adds to that problem by flooding you with Feastday Gifts and a few promo items, which are irreplaceable if sold, but onerous to haul around and impossible to store - the game badly needed an equivalent to Diablo's ""stash"" concept).

But for all that it has a ton of problems, some of which are big ones, DAO nonetheless remains an absolutely amazing interactive story, whose unnecessarily difficult combat limits your ability to progress efficiently through the plot, but also really makes you feel the apocalyptic impact of the fearsome events your characters are undergoing.  While certainly not light and fluffy ""popcorn"" entertainment, which you can use to decompress after a long day at work, Dragon Age remains an experience which every fan of the Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and other such fantasy epics MUST experience at least one time in their life.  Set the difficulty to easy, save your game often, and use a walkthrough if necessary, so you don't struggle too much...but live the Grey Warden's journey once or thrice or six times, so you can appreciate the magnificent setting this work's writers not only gave birth to, but realized in such depth and fullness that only Peter Jackson can boast of having done a better job.",1699847314,1699847314,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- played and enjoyed similar party-based RPGs of that era like Baldur's Gate 2, Neverwinter Nights 2, Drakensang: The Dark Eye;
- never played DA:O but are still considering it because everyone around keeps telling them that it was the best of the series.

First of all, you might want to install a mod called ""FtG UI Mod"". This was literally the first thing I went looking for after playing the game for 15 minutes. The reasons:
- someone decided to put cutscene/dialogue subtitles on top of the screen while keeping the dialogue choices at the bottom;
- most fonts are way too small for my bad eyesight.

[b]The Good[/b]

- [b]Character Backgrounds aka Origin Stories.[/b] This is one of the greatest unique features of DA:O. When you create your main character before the game, you choose a background matching your class and race. Unlike so many other games, which only use this for flavor and stat bonuses, DA:O gives you a completely unique playable prologue (solid 2-3 hours of gameplay if you don't rush). It establishes your place in the game world and relations with other characters which you'll meet later in the story. There are 6 ""origins"", and almost all are done extremely well. I took the time to play through all of them after finishing the game, and was very satisfied with most. I only consider the Dalish Elf origin ""weak"".

- [b]Main Story.[/b] Technically it is a standard ""save the world from evil"" fantasy. However, it is executed extremely well. Most of the game consists of doing 4 ""big main quests"" - but you can do them in any order (or mix and match). Each of these 4 directions is an ""epic story"" in its own right, complete with secrets and settings very different from the others. A couple of them intersect, so you might have to interrupt a quest to finish the other one if you want the ""best"" solution (but there is nothing to stop you from going for another one).

- [b]Cutscenes.[/b] This was one of the first Bioware games (right after the first Mass Effect) to invest a lot in the ""cinematic"" feeling for everything that happens. While most of this game's 3D visuals definitely didn't age well, the characters still look great. Facial animations may be weak by today's standards (to the point of being completely unnoticable in so many places where you'd expect them), but the narrative delivery as a whole is top-notch.

- [b]Companions.[/b] Just as one would expect from a Bioware game after BG2, your party will have  good number of unique and memorable characters with extensive dialogues, opinions on things you do (some may attack or leave if you do something they can't tolerate), lots of banter between each other and, of course, romance. There's also a relationship system which is a bit awkward/shallow because it is more affected by gifts rather than by your deeds and words. Also, one of the DLCs included in the Ultimate Edition provides you with a ton of FREE companion-specific gifts with insanely huge bonuses, meaning that you can start and, ahem, ""complete"" a romance on your very first camping night in the game, complete with the dialogue implying that you know each other for a long time already... Anyway, companions in DA:O are awesome. Some also take on major roles in the story.

- [b]Combat.[/b] It is a classic RTWP party game. DA:O uses a custom system with quite a lot of spells and talents to choose from for each character class (+ unlockable specializations). All that you learn is available at the same time (no ""spell slots"" like in D&D, just plain cooldowns) and there are things like ""sustained abilities"" (togglable passives which cost you a portion of you max mana/stamina). There is also an innovation called ""tactics"", which is a skill allowing you to set up your own AI rules for each character. It's a bit hard to get into at first (especially if you don't really want to), not as flexible as I'd like it to be, but it's good enough to automate common actions like healing or stacking debuffs on a boss. This is the first RTWP game which I played without disabling party AI completely, and it was very enjoyable. I just wish some newer RTWP RPGs would take a hint and expand on this idea.

[b]The Bad[/b]

- [b]Side quests.[/b] I am frankly not sure how Bioware got away with it, but 100% of non-story side quests in the base game are either dumb fetch/kill missions, or errands requiring you to find and click something in a 5-6 different locations (thus taking most of the game to complete, but providing no fun or challenge whatsoever). What's worse, they are all given by generic stationary ""mission board"" NPCs.

- [b]Premium cut content.[/b] It's not that relevant now that Ultimate Edition has it all, but I recall some release-day controversy over the cut content sold separately by putting ""bait"" NPCs in the base game, nagging you to buy a DLC. In fact, the only ""proper"" side quests in the game are part of such DLCs, and it feels weird even when no one is nagging to buy them.

- [b]Crafting.[/b] Herbalism, poison-making, trap-making skills are dull, unnecessary and, worst of all, designed to be money sinks, not ""enablers"". Any ""advanced"" ingredients can only be bought and they are EXPENSIVE (as are the recipes). Crafting a potion in DA:O costs more than buying it from a vendor; it's just that the ready-made potions are limited in stock, while ingredients aren't. However, there's enough of everything in the loot, so you are better off saving your gold for some unique items instead. You might occasionally want to craft the weakest 2 levels of healing/mana potions, but that's it.

- [b]Difficulty.[/b] I played on ""hard"", which is in fact ""normal"" for any RPG veteran. That much is obvious from its description, since ""hard"" is the first level with full friendly fire (cheese your way through the game by spamming fireballs/infernos without hurting your own party? no thanks). Only a few boss fights provided a decent challenge for me. In the Awakening expansion (which adds a lot of cool new talents and skills), it went even further to feeling like ""easy"": most of the fights barely needed any pausing or ability management, even the ""boss"" enemies simply died in seconds). Perhaps I should have tried ""nightmare""... However, there's one specific DLC campaign - Golems of Angarrak - which is so damn hardcore (mostly due to awful party composition) that I actually had to resort to disabling friendly fire just to finish the final battle.

- [b]Inventory limit.[/b] You inventory is shared by all party (individual characters only have equipment slots), and is very limited, considering amount of unique items in game which you don't want to just sell. The limit can be expanded several times by buying backpacks, but that's it. Worst part: there is no storage in the base game! You can get a chest from one of the ""premium"" quests, and even that will be located in a remote location instead of your camp. There's another chest in Awakening, but it also has a limit - and it does NOT share contents with the old one, so you'll lose everything that wasn't on you at the end of the base story.

- [b]Glitches and crashes.[/b] This game is pretty old and its tech didn't age well. I've had a lot of crashes. Most went away when I lowered the texture quality, but they still happened, so save often. Sometimes the glitches are persistent and keep crashing you in the same place or even on load. Multiple restarts and setting changes usually help, though.

[b]Conclusions[/b]

This is one of the best classic RPGs worth playing if you never did. I don't feel that it's Bioware's best - it's not a ""milestone"" like BG2 was, and it will certainly be hard to enjoy if you've already seen Larian's BG3 (I played DA:O right before that, which probably ""saved"" me). Still, it is a great (if somewhat flawed) game which still has something to teach the today's developers.",1699709533,1700262481,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,1,True,False,False

Story and world is dated. DnD-based games have much better mechanics and story. DLCs like witch hunt and leliana's song are uninspiring in story and add little. (These DLCs at full price are a cash grab)

Even though combat wise Awakening campaign feels fresh. it still felt like a chore to play through. Some games really do not age well. Revisiting this after some years, I determined that this is one of them.

is by far one of the best Fantasy RPGs from Bioware. Better described as one of Bioware’s Best.
In typical old fashion, the Player will be lead through a giant and very detailed Gameworld to explore, to interact and to experience Adventures while making decisions that affect various Elements and the Outcome of the Story.

Right at the beginning there is a choice to be made that also has an effect on how the Game will start and how the Player Character gets treated during the Playthrough and furthermore, which Skills a Player can obtain by leveling up after earning EXP in a lot of Combats against Hords of Enemies.
And to fight them, the Game also offers Companions to recruit, to equip, to command during the Adventures and to have dialogues with to learn more about them and their Backstories.

The Game’s absolute strength is definitely on how well it delivers on the Roleplay department and while it surely has a Main-Story the Player has to follow it is still up to them on how to handle the Situation and to be who they want to be. To build their own Character instead of having to *help a specific Person* on their Journey.
Also the Combat is a huge Plus for it to let Players control an entire Team of Companions, but also to set them up so they can act on their own as well if preferred.
And also to mention the huge Fantasy-World that is filled with lots of Story-Elements to explore.

Sadly there are also some weak Spots to mention for this Game and in Dragon Age’s Case its the Moments where the Main-Story has Points of no Return that aren’t so well pointed out during the Adventure. What sometimes can leave the bitter Taste of having to revert back to an older Safe to complete Side-Quests that otherwise would have gone lost.
Also there are some Balancing-Problems with specific Areas and Enemies from Time to Time that can lead to instant-Deaths of Characters in Combats when an Enemy all of a sudden grabs a Party member to kill them via Animation.

I recommend this Game to Players who like a good Fantasy RPG and who also want to explore a huge Gameworld.
---------------------------------
[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 8,46 / 10):[/h3]
8,2 / 10 Graphic (Old, but for the Time of Release very well made)
8 / 10 Art-Style (Different Locations are well detailed to give a unique vibe to them and have a lot of Assets to be explored)
7,3 / 10 Atmosphere (Major Locations have the perfect Atmosphere for the Story, some Side-Locations tho feel generic)
8,5 / 10 Gameplay (Easy to learn Gameplay. Gives Players a lots of Ways to handle Things, including Combat and the choice of Companions)
9,2 / 10 Main-Story (Definitly the strongest Part of the Game that drives the Motivation over all)
9 / 10 Side-Story (Lots of Side-Stories to explore as well, but some sadly don’t feel so impactfull as others and at some Points of Main-Story progress could get lost if not finished first)
8 / 10 Characters (Many Unique Characters to meet and talk to that really fit perfectly into the Stories)
9,5 / 10 Soundtracks (Well implemented Soundtracks. Soundtracks should always be used to support the Atmosphere of scenes in Games.)

*Info (Ultimate Edition): The exact same Thing as the regular Edition with all DLCs). So no difference for the Review from me. :P

I actually have way more than 4 hours but for whatever reason my WiFi turns off while playing it. This also includes needing to use a program that increases the games max RAM usage from 2 GB to 4 GB (higher graphics, no crashes)

But it has so much replay-ability: a combat system which is easy to learn, hard to master, and engaging. As the difficulty progresses your party becomes stronger and you more skilled. Theres the dynamic of using who's right in your party, and maintaining relationships with your party (even romantic ones). 

Theres so many playstyles you could choose for your character. Just one class has 4 different sword styles, and 4 specializations. I havent played Rogue or Mage yet but they have a lot of unique stuff too. Theres also different races and circumstances you could be born into, and within that a lot of choices that could differentiate even similar made characters. 

Theres a complex world full of everything you could want. Your codex or whatever its called has flavor text for pretty much everything, theres these established kingdoms with their own interpersonal dynamics, and honestly just so much to take in that I don't think I could do it justice writing this on a whim at 12 am. 


As an Aeducan I think I restarted the beginning of the game like 3 times just to see how I could have done things a little differently, or played more optimally, or see new dialogue lol. I kind of plan on doing that again in the future just to see what happens. 

Theres two more sequels to the game after this also. I highly doubt I'll be playing anything else for a long time lmfao

In the world of video games, classics often stand the test of time, and Dragon Age: Origins is no exception. Released in 2009, this epic role-playing game from BioWare continues to captivate players in 2023, offering a rich and immersive fantasy experience that few titles can match.

Graphics and Presentation (8/10):
While Dragon Age: Origins may not boast the cutting-edge visuals of more recent games, its art style and attention to detail have aged gracefully. The environments, character designs, and spell effects still hold up well, creating a believable and visually pleasing fantasy world. Thanks to mods and enhanced hardware, you can even make the game look better than it did in its original release.

Gameplay (9/10):
One of Dragon Age: Origins' strongest features is its deep and engaging gameplay. Players can choose from a variety of races and classes, each offering a unique experience. The tactical combat system is still enjoyable and offers an excellent blend of real-time action and strategic planning. The ability to pause and issue orders to your party members allows for precise control, and planning out battles is as satisfying as ever.

Story and Quests (10/10):
The heart of Dragon Age: Origins lies in its storytelling. The game's rich lore, complex characters, and branching narrative continue to set a high bar for RPGs. In 2023, the story feels just as compelling as it did in 2009, with your choices significantly impacting the game's outcome. Whether you're forging alliances, making moral decisions, or simply exploring the world, the game's narrative depth remains one of its strongest assets.

Voice Acting and Sound (9/10):
The voice acting in Dragon Age: Origins is top-notch, helping to bring the characters to life. The soundtrack, composed by Inon Zur, adds an epic and immersive layer to the game. The ambient sounds and battle music still give a sense of grandeur and tension, enhancing the overall experience.

Replayability (9/10):
Dragon Age: Origins offers substantial replay value. With multiple origins for your character, various party combinations, and choices that affect the world and character interactions, you'll want to play through the game more than once to explore all the possibilities. The modding community also continues to provide new content and enhancements, extending the game's longevity.

Conclusion:
In 2023, Dragon Age: Origins remains a shining example of classic RPG gaming. Its compelling story, deep character development, and tactical combat continue to draw players into its richly detailed world. While it may not have the graphical prowess of modern titles, its timeless gameplay and storytelling make it a must-play for RPG enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Whether you're revisiting Ferelden or experiencing it for the first time, Dragon Age: Origins is a timeless classic that deserves a spot in your gaming library.",1375204104,1698207052,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Main theme of the game is to stop a semi-demon invasion, but things dont go that smooth. You can choose several starting paths.
Gameplay revolves around managing a party of characters with their own skills to progress the story. Combat that happens is in real time, but you can pause it.
Characters are very well developed, the story is interesting, including side quests, setting is gritty and you have a lot of freedom to choose how you want to progress.

There is, however, a certain issue with overleveling. Each class has a certain number of sub-classes and you can upgrade your characters to the point where they can completely max out 2 sub-classes out of three or four. They dont compliment each other and remove somewhat the need to swap out party members and try different things. There are also a few bugs you might come a across.

Still, great isometric RPG, if you like a good adventure, you have to try this.

I did originally play it on PlayStation and it did leave such an impression that I find myself coming back to it today. In terms of graphics there is no way it could compete with modern titles but I think there is something special/charming about style and the slight chunkiness in animation. The story is straightforward and isn't ground breaking by any means but it is handled with a fineness and care that make it a really enjoyable experience. The companions that accompany you on your journey are well fleshed out and there is a wide enough range of personalities that compliment different types of play throughs and just as a warning I will say the romance sex scenes are really awkward. The combat I found can become quite repetitive, especially on higher difficulties as engagements often require similar tactics to win but winning an engagement on nightmare difficulty is rewarding enough to make the repetition worth it.

The combat is frequently tedious, with the mage just having a vastly superior toolset compared to the other classes, and some mechanics are too rarely useful unless you fully build/play around them. The writing is all over the place, for the most part pretty good but with too many tonally dissonant moments and a lack of subtlety or elegance. The pacing is wonky, with the difficulty careening wildly from encounter to encounter and the level of intrigue dropping suddenly in several sections. 

I'm still glad I beat it, just because I have such deep nostalgia for this game, and I can see how it was influential for so many games that came after.

Yes the combat seems somewhat old, but is lets you use a wide range of tactics which works very well for a squad.
The story and lore are very rich and all your choices through dialogue will have an impact on it.
You will be able to have adventures with very well made characters.
The graphics still old up, the voice acting is high quality.
In this game you are tasked with resolving the possible civil war while at the same time dealing with a threat to the very world itself, in a form of a dragon and goblin-like monsters called darkspawn.
The problem for me were the bugs, some crashes or graphical problems which made me restart the game.
Also for some reason there are some items gifts selling in the camp´s store, which if you use them break the games relationship system, don´t use them.
Another thing that puts me off in all the Dragon Age games, is the lack of armor variety, they all look the same, and a lot of them are ugly.
Besides that, it still is a masterpiece, so of course I recommend it. The games includes all dlc´s so it has a lot of content. 80 hours at least.",1697561182,1697561326,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It had been a while before I jumped back into it, I played it when it originally launched and remember loving it then and since my girlfriend was playing Baulder's Gate 3 in the same room as me I had an itch for a good RPG and boy howdy did this scratch the itch. Choices that matter, great writing, side quests that you won't find at times unless you dive into the codex (Or use the dragon age wiki walk through that helps point them out) it is a fun, fun time and makes me wish Bioware still made games like this today. 

Now with that being said there are crashes that can occur in this game, and the community has many fixes for this. The one I found that's worked for me so far is this one:
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2955967438&tscn=1696416922

It basically replaces the launcher of the game (though I and the person who wrote/created this recommends just moving the launcher to a separate folder, like your documents folder in case it doesn't work or something goes awry) and has various bug fixes along with a fix for a RAM leak that was never addressed by the devs. Now it is in Russian but honestly just copy and paste it into Google Translate and it's a pretty easy process.

The side-missions are as BORING as they could ever be. The combat, although interesting, has not aged well in any single way and is really frustrating to play at the current day and age. It's serviceable, but supbar. It's not as ""deep"" and ""tactical"" as some people say. Far from it, even on Nightmare the game is not challenging in a tactical way. There are a bazillion enemies in each area and it is just clunky, cumbersome and janky to fight hordes. The ""difficulty"" comes from the damage modifiers and such. 

WITH ALL THAT SAID, I still recommend this game strongly. Even with the aforementioned flaws and others not cited here, this game is really fun, has a nice story and the followers are spectacular. Having Morrigan and Alistair on the party is always amazing, their banter is really funny. The world building and the lore is absolutely top notch, for those who like to read codex entries and learn more about the setting, this is a prime example of lorebuilding in a game. The world and lore are nice, the characters are good and the story is enjoyable - for an RPG these are necessary things to succeed, and DA:O hits the spot on all of them.

Playing this game again after a long while is being hella fun. I remember playing it back in the day and I have a special place in my heart for it. It's flawed, aged badly, clunky and somewhat shallow in some gameplay aspects, but It's one hell of a good game.

When I first picked up DA:O, my Xbox has spun Mass Effect 2 more times than the Earth around the sun. The third-person combat felt responsive and impactful like Gears of War, yet the Sci-fi epic also provided a heavy dose of atmosphere, world-class acting performances, and emotion which pushed the critically acclaimed sequel into ‘best ever’ discussions. DA:O, a spiritual successor to Baldur’s Gate, therefore had some streamlining to do. While the concept of a tactical, point-and-click cRPG still retained a diehard audience, if Bioware were to capitalise on their opportunity to become a truly mainstream developer, they would need to find a compromise.

The idea of modernising a title’s systems to adjust well to a console audience has always carried significant baggage. Duds like Deus Ex: Invisible War (2003) still plagued people’s minds, but I think in 2023 we’re more open to the positive benefits this can bring. Writing can be rich in lore and detail, but with tact and editing, can still be direct enough to be comprehensible to new players. I’ve always been a child of Star Wars over Lord of The Rings, and so when I picked up DA:O on 360 I was the game’s precise target demographic. Someone who needed a bit of quality-of-life features, an accessible UI, and perhaps some rough edges polished. 

DA:O represents an extraordinarily successful transition to this new audience. The fantasy world requires no additional explanation or experience with tabletop board games; there’s a healthy dose of Game of Thrones-style sex and violence to liven things up, and trailers adorned with Marilyn Manson music. In most areas, this is a runaway improvement: DA:O features high-quality actors and actresses to narrate the adventure, and players can’t unforgivingly soft-lock themselves into underpowered builds.

Baldur’s Gate and Planescape Torment credited themselves with hundreds of potential consequences for every action taken by the player. DA:O is more limited in scope, but provides full voice acting for every character. My favourite is the Grand Oak, a walking tree who speaks solely in rhyme and explores some of the forest’s lore:

[i] “Elves planted the seeds, raised the forest, saw to its needs” [/i]

DA:O’s combat initially served me some humble pie. My Rogue character was repeatedly slaughtered during the first main story beat outside the prologue, causing me to completely re-think my approach. The game prefers you put all your eggs in one basket for each party member, and focus on two skill trees per companion. For example: a basic setup I found to work included one heavily armoured tank to absorb hits and distract the enemy; two mages to dish out damage; and a rogue to set traps, unlock chests and pass speech checks. From this setup, all companions served their use – however the rogue did feel noticeably less useful outside of dialogue.

The biggest drawback I found with DA:O was extensive performance and stability issues on PC. Out the box, Dragon Age limits itself to 4GB of RAM which causes frequent crashing as its systems overload itself. This is most apparent in the dense city of Denerim, but can occur in larger dungeons all the same. Fixes can be found in external launchers and patchers, but I still experienced issues. The game also requires tweaking for 1440p, not only to prevent cutting off UI elements, but also to make text legible. For this, I used the ‘FtG UI Mod - More Readable Fonts and UI’ plugin which fixed all these issues.

Technical issues aside, Dragon Age: Origins is a high-quality, well-acted and beautifully crafted world. I didn’t find it quite as compelling as Mass Effect, but it did provide a bigger sandbox and more content (and mod support!). If you’re looking to get into point-and-click cRPGs, this is a solid stepping stone before plunging into the older, more inaccessible classics of the genre.",1697209848,1697209848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are willing to spend some time to mod the game, then I can very much recommend this game.
Without mods, the game will have tons of visual glitches, many crashes and bugged questlines.
[b]You should mod it before you start playing, because you probably will lose your save file.[/b] Look around in the steam guides to find your taste of mods. (I will leave a list of the mods I personally used below, I still recommend reading the guides for a more detailed explanation on how to install them. and also read the description pages on the mods themselves)

[h2]Main Campaign[/h2]
I only modded the game to repair/restore it and fix some of the stretched textures, no gameplay changes so I could have a vanilla experience, and let me tell you, it was one of the best RPG experiences I've had in a long time.
AMAZING story-line; built with fantastic and memorable characters, betrayal, political intrigue, romance, friendships, revenge...
Incredible world-building
your choices impact the world, and how the world reacts to you
Meaningful character-customization and progression, finding a new item that is good for you or one of your companions feels amazing, enabling skills and passives has very meaningful impact on combat.
This game has given me a hunger for more of these kinds of experiences and will probably impact my next couple of months of gaming a lot.

[h2]DLC[/h2]
I am mainly talking about the main game here. The DLC's were pretty weak to me, but they are short and linear and add a little bit of worldbuilding. except for the secondary campaign, which is more like the main campaign, but way less expansive, much weaker dialogue and story, but still enjoyable and some nice touches that reflect your choices from the main campaign.
The main campaign can easily give you 60 to 80 hours of enjoyment, depending on how much you talk to others and read quest related codices.

[h2]Combat[/h2]
I don't have much to say on combat, I really liked it, but its mostly going to be personal preference I think.
the system is pretty deep, and can feel clunky if you don't try to understand it, but once you start to get the hang of it, it can feel very rewarding (experiment with the tactics system).

Despite having to mod it and weaker DLC (also Fuck EA). It seems like a pretty good deal to me when the game sells at 15% of the price during sales.

The first thing you need is patience and a good quick save finger.

Get ready for some annoying crashes = save often and do new saves instead of saving over old ones. It crashes in the base game more often than in the dlc`s, and the really problematic area is Denerim. The game might crash as you enter the tavern or a back alley, and the saves you make can be corrupt often. The best i could do was to clear all possible missions before i went to Denerim, then clear all available missions left on one go and hope it does not crash when i leave the city. If that happens, your best bet is a saved game near the situation you played. Denerim saves mid-story are always volatile to crash. The endgame in Denerim is different; i suffered no crashes there.

You will recognize the probability of a crash ( not always guaranteed though ) when you see meshes distorting ( armors of the people you talk to, blood puddles under enemies you have slain.  In Denerim area this happens more often than anywhere else, but also other areas are affected by the bug sometimes.

Other than Denerim, there are some issues with the Witch Hunt and Darkspawn Chronicles DLC`s. The Golems of Amgarrak, Lelianas Song, and the Awakening pretty much worked without crashes, although the usual bugs occurred ( blood pool mesh squares and the such ).

In WItch Hunt, frequent crashes and bugs in overall graphics, such as flickering of meshes and disappeared mission trackers. 

In Darkspawn Chronicles i cannot touch the recruit i am supposed to have in my army to continue the quest, so the DLC is pretty much useless. This same bug is in the base game in the downloaded content of Warden`s Keep, where in the end (SPOILER ALERT ! )you are supposed to fight a bunch of enemies that a cooperating mage  lets in to the room after you speak with him. When you do this, the mage just walks a few steps to the side and the quest does not continue at all. Nothing you can do.

All in all the game has a lot of content and if you can keep you interest despite these bugs then buy it. Otherwise i would suggest not to touch the steam version, but to get it on console or try the Origin version ( unsure if it has the same bugs ).",1696329053,1696329053,False,0,0,0.46742209792137146,0,True,False,False

Some bugs like traps not showing or the enemy mages auto fireball your team. Bug I say because their progression bar for said skill doesn't show. Guess that is how the difficulty bar is raised. Some tactics options will cause crash. For example if you play a human noble, the main will get free dog companion. So if you set it to use the HOWL skill when party member is flanked/clustered by said number of enemies as per option it will crash due to loop. Same if you set anyone to use range weapons on medium or long range. The loop will happen until you manually move them away from the enemy. Then it will function as intended. 

However most of these anomaly can be rectified once encountered. As I state good game. Not great but not bad either. 6/10 for me. Some people states it doesn't play well with modern rigs.

After one playthrough I recommend visiting mod sites as there is still a good community around. Also recommend the patches the community have made, for bug and cut content. 

One of the reasons that there is still a community for a 13 year old game is due to the world , characters, lore and love that those involved had making it. The sequels don't reach quite the magic as this one.  

I usually play a female noble and I do enjoy the content that comes with that origin. 

I flipping hate the fade and encourage the skip the fade mod, it gets boring quickly. As much as I love the game there are still bugs, sometimes the dialogue is off.

I adore the characters and the way they are written. Be on the watch for some of the missable companions. The world does feel alive. You are the most important character overall yet with the NPC's in particular make it feel like the world is bigger that you. They have their own priorities. It is strangely charming. 

This is one of multiple copies I own. It is a ""cozy"" game for me and something I keep going back to. Though there is only a finite amount of materials  I can still find something new after all these years. 

While the sequels are lackluster in comparison, this is something you won't regret having in your collection. 

(Also from seeing some things from other people this has the same feel as Baldur's Gate and will probably be the closest thing to a remake us DA:O fans will have for a long time. But on the flip side if you want something like BG3 this is a great choice to scratch your itch.)",1695926277,1695926277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't help that I'm playing this for the first time in 2023. It's an old game, and boy does it show. It's incredibly clunky and the writing is... well... it's clearly a 2010 fantasy game. Which means playing a non-human female character sure is... an experience. The framing of certain social issues leaves a lot to be desired.

Sometimes it's abysmal and inconsistent.

The only problem I had with this beautiful game is that the game constantly crashed on start-up or when i got into the character creator. Upon looking up the problem, it needed a fix because of memory leak issues. After that fix, the game worked 100%.

Now that you can play the game, we get on to the [u]REAL[/u] review.

[b]Dragon Age: Origins[/b] is one of the best medieval RPGs I've ever played. As soon as you hit it off with Alistair, You can already tell you're going to have a great time. It's a setting of great despair and chaos, so it's nice to have a friendly face around. That is, until Morrigan comes along. Quite unfriendly..., [i]but she's hot so who cares?[/i] Soon after, we have a band of plucky companions who will have conversations with each other. Depending on your relationships, they may grow to love you, or hate you. Should you choose to even romance a companion, someone may get jealous. Yeah, It gets real spicy in this magical world. 

As for the combat, if you've ever played anything like Runescape or World of Warcraft, you'll feel right at home. I chose a mage character, and turned out being an absolute force of destruction. Combining spells to make a magic tornado was not on my bingo card. In other games, Mages feel kind of boring or weak, but here they are essential to your team. Blasting ugly Cannibalistic Humanoid Under Dwellers with a fireball never felt so good! 

Bioware was at the top of their game for this and it shows. The whole story took me 43 hours to complete, and that was mostly after the main story, not too far into side mission territory. I got an extra 10 hours doing Awakening and Witch Hunt DLCs. When on sale, this game is probably the most bang for your buck, guaranteed.

Pros: 

1: Story & Characters

Dragon Age lore is fantastic, the story and characters are well written, a large amount of characters are fully fleshed out and the story keeps you engaged. 

There are a lot of mature themes in this game, ranging from relationships, politics, religion and philosophy.  

2: World building

The game features an open world that is separated by hub areas, although outdated in some regards, the attention and depth in some of these locations if fantastic. 

Some areas are limited and you're not able to explore every corner of the world map, specific zones you're not able to return to apart from when questing. 

The lore and background regarding locations, races and events within this universe is very intriguing and written really well, if you love Medieval fantasy this is right up your alley. 


3: RPG Mechanics

The game allows a fully fleshed dialogue system, you can be locked out of certain conversations and your companions and characters will like/dislike you based on different choices, quests will turn out differently depending on how you want to proceed and what dialogue options you choose. 

The combat system, design and mechanics have a lot of depth to it, you're able to pick from 3 major classes (Warrior, Rouge and Mage) within each class you're able to go down multiple skills and tree, eventually specialising in specific play styles.  

You have a party of over a dozen companions, you can select 3 party members at any given time, fleshing out different dynamics, personalities and a combination of dynamic power and skill combinations. 

4: Questing is fantastic

The side quests in this game are incredibly interesting, be it the concept, writing or lore behind the characters and situations you find yourself in, each side quest feels like it could be part of the main story. 

How you get from A to B can vary, quests don't feel similar and even 'fetch' quests are interesting. 

The game doesn't feel like it constantly throws the same redundant activities at you like newer open world games, missions, interactions and character placements have a purpose.

5: Art Style is beautiful

 Cons: 

1: This game feels and graphically is outdated. 

This is an old engine, game isn't 'Buggy' but borderline feels like a PS2 game at times. 

The game graphically looks really old.

Only worth it if you can get it at a huge discount! I got it for 4 or 5 EUR which is perfectly fine.
DEFINITELY not worth the full price. See below.

It's Dragon Age, so it's good. The storytelling, tons of quests, choices you have to make that could impact story and relationships. Interaction between characters (party members). 
Graphics are decent enough (considering the game's age). There is however, a big but:

While this game may have worked perfectly many years ago, it definitely doesn't on modern systems. 
Mostly game crashes and screen remaining black after certain cutscenes. 
Workaround is to put graphic options to low (atleast AA can stay maxed out, couldn't be arsed to figure out what other graphic options are safe). I haven't had any crashes since, though I did have two or three moments where I could literally see the game's grid somehow. 

Because of these severe issues I can only recommend this game if you're either using an old system (eg old hardware and OS (you shouldn't have an old OS, though) or if you can get the game with a nice discount.

NOTE: After doing this loading up the game allowed me to access the DLC by following the instructions that others have listed in these reviews: Going to the files location opening the Redist folder and clicking the Setup and Addin files, hopefully this will work for you guys too, good luck.

Even KOTOR 1, though poorly optimized, was at least able to run on Steam without much fear of crashing.

If you ultimately decide to dive into DA Origins you will find an excellent RPG definitely worth a playthrough, just be prepared for the possibility of running into issues. The fixes I did that eventually got my game working I’ll mention below:

10/10 Would bang EVERYONE again. LOL
Bioware changed my views on what an RPG should be. I have a standards when in RPGs based upon this game. 

Pros - 
Gameplay/Combat - Dark Fantasy RPG - Strategy or Action combat (depending on platform)
Companions - You can choose to Romance companions and they have reactions according to what you say and choose. They also talk amongst themselves frequently (more with mods) 
Modding - This game has a ton of mods, don't come at me with the whole ""This old piece of crap has too many bugs"" The modding community is very much alive and thriving for Dragon Age Origins because of the amount of people that remember it fondly as I do. 


Cons - 
Slow - Sometimes, it takes a while to go from point a to point b, you don't just get to skip stuff (without mods) Sometimes we like to do a lot of talking, and less killing stuff. 
'spensive - In game items are kind of pricey at first. It gets better but it feels like everything in Ostagar is like 1G+ at third level. it's rough. 




This was the first game I played from 9pm-9am when I was twelve years old. This game was my everything, it was the start to me becoming a Fantasy Novelist. It might not look it, but it can be one of the best RTS or TBS. (depending on how you play) 

Not enough action for you? Grab the PS3 or 360 Version (Game Pass) This makes pressing A your attack command, so it almost forces you to take a more ""player-centrist"" feel of the game. 

Playing on PC will make this game feel more like a strategy game within the realm of Dungeons and Dragons, you could even use a party game like WoW to build a party that works well.

You get to create a character, someone tasked with saving the world, whether they wanted to or were forced into the situation by circumstances out of their control. And in the course of doing so, encounter a myriad of characters who come and join you on your quest - from a dashing assassin, to a prickly witch, to a bard who used to be a sister at the church, and more. Along the course of your journey, you’ll help out various groups of people and make your character stronger and grow closer to your companions. Additional points for how distinct your companions all are and the voice acting all through the game. You can tell the developers put a lot of thought into the random conversations that will happen when you’re travelling, in camp, at plot points. It makes it really rewarding for when you do get closer to those companions and raises the stakes for some of the decisions you do make throughout the game. One other thing I realised at the end of DA:O was that it really is more enjoyable when a game makes it so that your decisions as the player really do matter, as it presents in an epilogue the impacts of your decisions through the game and how they have affected the world you've come to care for.

The combat system was really enjoyable as well, but there are parts of the game which are extremely grindy and monotonous where the landscapes are really repetitive.

Additionally, for a game so old, I was surprised that the graphics of the game hold up so well.

Overall 8/10.

It's a slog. And 90% of combat is auto attacking. That's right you don't just get to watch 1 character auto attack everything to death, you get to watch 4 of them do it!

I cannot express just how much I adore this game and all the content it brings to the table. From the moment I embarked on my epic journey in Thedas, I was utterly captivated by the rich storytelling, immersive world-building, and the sheer depth of gameplay this edition offers.
First and foremost, the storytelling in Dragon Age Origins is nothing short of phenomenal. The intricate and morally complex plot is full of twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your adventure. The characters are beautifully crafted, with their unique backgrounds, motivations, and personalities. Whether forming alliances with Alistair, sharing secrets with Morrigan, or engaging in witty banter with Varric, you'll find yourself deeply invested in the companions you meet.
The Ultimate Edition takes the already fantastic base game and elevates it to another level by including all of the DLC and expansions. This means even more hours of gameplay, more character development, and epic quests to undertake. The ""Awakening"" expansion alone is worth the price of admission, introducing a brand-new storyline and an array of fresh challenges to conquer.
One of the most remarkable aspects of Dragon Age Origins is its freedom in shaping your character and the world around you. Your choices genuinely matter, affecting your immediate surroundings and the overarching narrative. Whether deciding the fate of entire civilizations, forging alliances, or making heart-wrenching sacrifices, every decision you make feels significant and has consequences that ripple throughout the game.
The graphics, while not the most cutting-edge by today's standards, are still gorgeous and capture the dark, gritty, and enchanting world of Thedas perfectly. The music is hauntingly beautiful and adds an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.
What truly sets Dragon Age Origins - Ultimate Edition apart, though, is its replay ability. With the myriad of character classes and origins to choose from, the various paths your character can take, and the multitude of choices and outcomes, you'll find yourself returning to this game repeatedly, each time with a different experience.
In conclusion, Dragon Age Origins - Ultimate Edition is a timeless masterpiece in the RPG genre. It's a game that provides hundreds of hours of gameplay and delivers a deep and emotionally engaging story that stays with you long after you've put down the controller. If you haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this gem yet, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of Thedas – you won't be disappointed!

I will say this tho. If they remastered this game today with a full overhaul of everything and not just visual wise, this would be a hot seller hands down. But i doubt they will any time soon or ever really. The terrible tactics mechanic is one thing if any would be the focus point for me to change in the game. Its not as complicated but ffs is it a mess when it comes to the AI. You tell them what to do and they don't do it. There is no auto attack feature here so you have to constantly manage them for every task. Some like that sure, but if all i could get was a working tactics menu and have them auto attack when in battle unless told otherwise, it would have been a great playthrough. 

Story is good and i loved and hated the characters. Leliana is muh favorute and i would gut the maker open if it meant saving her lol. It sucks that it doesn't have enough oomf for me to replay really. I want to try other classes but man do the talents sucks. 99% of them are ""sustained"" talents, meaning you press it and it stays on like an aura that uses mana or stamina. I reverted to a healer/support because i don't have a lot of activated spells for damage casting. It was just easier to have my companions do all the work while i kept them alive and even that was a chore with the yucky AI and Tactics system. 

Is it worth it? If this is your style game, yes. Im sure you've played even older games that were a headache to play so this won't change anything. But for new people to the genre? I can't say yes. If you're use to other style games and this is your first experience, go with something else. This will turn you away imho.",1693791220,1693791220,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

ALSO, I wish I could give this game a mixed review due to all that and much more like the insane hatred towards any kind of disability? seriously, every mentally ill character you cross paths with is greeted with options like ""kill it, put it out of it's misery"" some characters you DON'T EVEN HAVE A CHOICE YOUR PARTY JUST KILLS AND HATES DISABLED PEOPLE, there's a blind guy at some point and the game is like ""oh stay here, you're old and useless"" then he dies because!?! 
I congratulate the game on allowing me to be gay but seriously, having the option to save yourself and Alistair by the end ONLY if you're a straight male is ridiculous. I survived 2 Mass effect games to get my gay moment and here I was happy until I was forced to go into Straight conversion therapy by Morrigan. Also like DA2, I don't remember seeing a black character.

Tips: To get your DLC you have to open the game main folder and install them manually LOL, try to fix the lag by making the launcher run on more than 2GB RAM, but that might F up steam it seems, Save a lot, this game is quite unforgivable either you will walk into a trap and die, choose a really bad option and regret it or the game will crash/glitch and you will have to restart

Seriously. The bugs, Morrigan became permanently stuck as a bear straight out of the exorcist, it was all folded up and nothing worked, I had to get a mod to respec her and stay away from shape shifting.
Also Summons... they can get you stuck on fight mode that means no save or changing maps, I also got a glitch where the AI would summon like 10 creatures, mind you is 1 per party.
I got stuck once and by trying to leave, the game's map would show up, I have no idea how I fixed that one, I tried console commands but I'm a casual noob, I couldn't make it work, I just pressed M and N many times and somehow I could teleport to the camp? geez.

Like all games from Dragon Age I couldn't stay away from mods, It's so easy to make mistakes! put too little or too many points here and there and you're stuck being useless, as I said unforgivable, this game begs for a wiki open at all times, you can miss quests from temporary zones and so many things, not that being a completionist means anything without steam achievements lol, this game is much better with mods, you can fix the looks, the AI, you can have a lot of convenience like respec, faster combat and so much stuff

Also like all Dragon Age games each seems to bother me with something. I played by the reverse order so, DA Inquisition was grindy and had terrible writing, very repetitive.
DA 2 was rushed and a shell of the franchise but it's my guilty pleasure lol
DAO this one, is just a pandora's box, filled with bugs and glitches, crashes, broken dialogue so and so.

Anyway, Accross the whole franchise I played mage! and I LOVE MAGE HERE! if you don't use mods in DAI or DA2 the game is so damn boring, so linear, so limited. Now DAO? OMG the freedom! guys!
I Played as a mage who wears ARMOR hits with DAGGERS and HEALS the party. WTF? DAI could NEVER! I had like a ton of skills and could swap weapons? seriously WHY DID THEY CHANGED THIS ON THE NEW GAME? my god DAI sucks, I can only bare to play that game because of mods and Dorian s2, seriously DAI with mods it's so fun, I used to zap around with the frost dash and slice enemies with a spell blade or something while also switching skills according to the situation, without mods you're stuck and a mono element mage what? here on DAO without mods you have every mage skill line, you can be anything!


Off Topic: I really, really hope that in the future they give this game the legendary edition treatment. Specially this will most likely die as a weird trilogy since the fourth game is a meme, everyone got fired from bioware, they are just copying GoW Ragnarok and now BD3, at some point it was gonna be an online lobby based game LOL, I would be surprised if we even get a gameplay trailer in years to come and in complete shock if it doesn't get cancelled, or if it's at least decent.

I played as a female character, but  I've read that a male playthrough may have different experiences.. the game also had a lot of choices.

Character Depth: The characters, beyond the generic guards and mobs, had true depth. 
for the companions, my favourite was Alistair. he was always so sweet. really glad he was with me from the beginning.

Zevran had a humorous charm and playful nature, Sten had an unexpected tender side, and Oghren is just a cute drunk dork lol. each companion had a unique side to them. Wynne had a comforting grandmotherly presence. With a mod, Mabari the dog, was always with me<3

Combat system needs loads of work, as resource is too damn small and regen slow.

Also in combat once one enemy is killed, you need to reselect next one MANUALY.

While I'm one of the seemingly few people that enjoyed Dragon Age 2, and found Inquisition to be a good game in its own right neither of them really captured the same feeling that Origins had.

To start off I will admit that on todays machines, it is not a stable game. I've had many crashes when I've tried to play it on PC and at times had saves become corrupted. I haven't really looked around but I'm sure there are mods that fix these issues but it's something to keep in mind.

Besides that the game itself is phenomenal, immediately upon getting to the main menu of the game you're greeted with a beautiful melody of a woman singing, which quickly transitions into a foreboding, almost warlike drums and horns before flowing right back into that almost hopeful and magical singing and then right back into the dark and heavy drums. The menu alone sets the tone of the game excellently with the music. A dark fantasy tale that still has glimmers of hope for a better future within the game itself.

It certainly doesn't disappoint either, as after you're done with the character creator you're brought into a world that has been carefully crafted by a Bioware that was still at their peak. World building that I personally feel none of the other Dragon Age games matched, as simply going through the game you can feel so much history that's been built into the world even with it being the first within the series. Tensions between different peoples, prejudices from centuries of war and hate between peoples that can't ever see eye to eye and a world that itself feels almost real and lived in.

Gameplay wise it might feel dated to some, and it is when compared to the later games within the same series. Though that doesn't mean that it's lackluster in any way, just that it's a more methodical and tactical game and slower paced without the refinements they made later in the series. It also bears similarities to the combat they had in Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, which are legendary games in their own right.

If you're able to bear through a somewhat unstable game, or willing to mod the game until it is stable, you'll find yourself playing an honestly enchanting game that I don't think Bioware has been able to match. With the only franchise of theirs that meets or beats it being Mass Effect or Baldur's Gate 1 and 2.

My only major complaint really is that Dragon Age changed into something else with the sequels. A few minor complaints with DAO: Movement speed should be more, battles should have more variety. NPCs should express some kind of interest in the areas that they want to go to so that it's slightly more obvious that there's a companion quest there. Alistair does that to some extent for example but Leliana surely doesn't. Or maybe Leliana just talks a lot and I wasn't paying attention. All the classes are fun to play but rogues and warriors end up having too many talent points and aren't customizable enough. All of these are minor things however.

Yes, the game has bugs, it crashes (A LOT, so make sure to save often), and sometimes the characters might say the wrong thing but this game fully dragged me into its world and I loved it. The story is great and the characters even more so. I felt like my actions made a difference and had an impact every step of the way. I also cherish all of the interactions I got to have with my party members (also the romance is superb).

The combat could at times be difficult and a bit annoying (especially if you haven't messed around with your party members' combat tactics for a while) but it was still fun and challenging.

The character customization and talent specialization really add to the game and the replay value, you can get in and customize your characters skills and abilities to a degree that it feels like making the character truly your own.

The story and character development are what make this game stand out more than anything else. The land of Fereldon is home to many many people and every one of them has a story to tell. The quests both side and main story dive deep into the story of your character and fereldon without feeling grindy or repetitive.

Summary:
The game has an enormous amount of content, mechanics, options and other things but it lacks the serving. It absolutely did not age well, from my point of view, although many may argue that. Could recommend to quickly look through the plot if you are a fan of Dragon Age universe.

I know I'm asking for a talking to because I am playing this on PC, but I prefer controller use, so if you are like me, I would just buy this for a 360 or something instead. The camera having to be manually moved with you character is ridiculous, really! I will look at the menu or mods to solve this issue but if you need buttons for that, well, the use of the keyboard is overly complex for no good reason. It just makes extra work for nothing productive, except maybe the hardcore keyboard users to mock us controller users. I did play this on the 360 but as the games link I purchased the second game on my PC as well. If I knew there was no controller, I would have hesitated the purchase, but because I purchased it in a sale ages ago, I know I cant get a refund, which I would have requested for all of them due to this issue. 
The game itself with the fighting, characters, choices and story is a solid 8.5/10 on the Xbox 360. The PC version so far is a 1/10. 
Overly complicated keyboards use, just because, is a joke, and the camera not rotating with your character is disappointing. Overall I can not recommend.

Mad props to Dragon's Dogma and Lost Odyssey too, but this one takes the crown for me. 

Its world starts off as your generic Tolkein-inspired affair (if we're being generous), but gradually opens up into a deeper and darker one than you'd expect. Its characters are well written (the likable and hateable ones both), its combat is a fantastic mix of pause and play strategy and third person action (especially if you play on a Console version of the game), and its story is overall a pretty great time (also the music's neat too).

Add onto all that the sheer size of the variety in this game, a game that I still don't believe I have seen every possible scene in to this day (despite having completed it over 6 times at this point and 100%'ing it and its dlc on the console version).

And this game is just incredibly satisfying.

Also the dlc (included in this ultimate edition) is a pretty great amount of content, ranging from fun what if challenges, to additional short stories based on the characters you've gotten to know, to full on sequel-esque expansions, and it all feels like a delightful desert.

If you're looking to get lost in a game that'll make you think both narratively and mechanically, then this is one for you.

It's been 14 years since this game came out, and while it has had official sequels, it feels to me like none of them have been sequels in more than narrative only.

Witchhunt reuses a lot of assets, and is very short, but includes a couple of new companions that only appear in the DLC. Leliana's Song also reuses assets, and introduces two other companions, in a backstory adventure explaining how the companion Leliana ended up in the main story. The Darkspawn Chronicles is a super short switch around where you play the bad guys, reused assets, no new voice assets. The Golems of Amgarrak is a sort of horror story, new location, (but only the one), and some new dwarves to party up with.

1st of all you'll want to install the 4GB patcher so the game utilises all of your Ram which drastically improves loading to the point where loading screens take less than a millisecond to load

Secondly, you'll want to limit the game to just 1 core as since the game uses all of your cores when I originally brought this game it leaks memory and that what causes the crashes to happen after doing this my game hasn't crashed since

 You'll want to got to Taskmanager > Rightclick on Dragon Age Origins Exe > Expand > go to details > Set affinity and un-tick all except 1 of your cores and this will fix the random crashes that happen

Finally and probably the most annoying thing is that the Ultimate edition content used to be gotten through redeeming through the Bioware website for this game however Bioware shut it down luckily you can still get it but it's tedious and I wish they would have fixed that you can find a YT vid easily to do it but if you don't want to do that i'll tell you how.

Open your Steam Client.
In Library view, right-click the game
Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files
Open the folder named as redist

Activating DLCs
Run following files from the redist folder.

DAUServiceSetup_Steam.exe
DAOU_UpdateAddinsXML_Steam.exe 

Once that is done simply open your game as normal and navigate to content and check installed content and if done correctly all of your content should be installed which should all be ticked.

If I could summarize my thoughts on playing Dragon Age Origins in 2023 in one concise sentence, it'd be this: A Bioware classic that's in dire need of a remake. Numerous issues are holding DAO back by modern standards, and almost all of it boils down to one problem: It's outdated to an almost shocking degree. By the time credits rolled, I had to ask myself an important question: Was this game ever as good as I thought it was? It's frustrating to admit, but I have to be truthful to myself: The answer is no. And this is coming from someone who played a version of the game that's EXTREMELY modded to make it as modern as possible. But what about the whole game? Is it good enough to warrant a playthrough despite its problems? Absolutely. Just because I was left disappointed by a game doesn't mean I'm incapable of seeing the rest of what it has to offer and its many positive qualities, of which Dragon Age Origins has many. As always, I'll start with what I love.

[b] The Positives [/b] ▼

[b] 1. Creative And Well-Written Lore [/b]
Like its sci-fi counterpart, Mass Effect, DAO has to be one of the most fascinating fictional worlds ever. Everything from its history, nations, cultures, continent, creatures, and people are well told. However, it can be overwhelming just how much there is to read. There are over 200 codex entries, and reading all of them proved to be a massive undertaking considering a handful of them are beyond trivial and don't provide much of any meaningful lore to the game. Well-written, regardless. 

[b] 2. A Strong Cast Of Characters [/b]
Depending on who you ask, DAO might be the best lineup of characters to grace any Bioware game, and that's saying something considering Mass Effect 2 is one of them. If you ask me what part of the game left the biggest impression on me, the answer is no doubt the characters. They're all incredibly well-written and expertly acted; There is not a single weak performance in the entire roster, and it's undoubtedly the most memorable quality of the game, and why so many fans continue to consider it the best in the trilogy.

[b] 3. Choices, Choices, Choices [/b]
DAO excels at providing meaningful choices the very second the campaign starts. With three different races, six backstories, three main classes, and tons of different dialogues and difficult narrative decisions, the game offers plenty of replayability and is one you can effortlessly sink hundreds of hours into. 

[b] The Negatives [/b] ▼

[b] 1. The Combat Is Boring [/b]
Speaking of sinking hundreds of hours into the game, how about I give you a good reason not to? I'm talking about the combat system and how dreadfully dull and slow it is; Lame and boring animations that take too long to finish, skills that don't feel nearly as impactful, and long cooldown on said skills that makes them even more unsatisfying to use. Here's everything else related to combat that I utterly disliked: 

‣ Consumable items are worthless because health/stamina/mana regenerate after battle, meaning outside of prolonged fights like boss battles, consumables are practically pointless. 
‣ So many weapons feel too weak and slow to play. I'm looking at you two-handed weapons, bows, and crossbows.
‣ Good items in shops are terribly unbalanced and overly expensive. Unless you're willing to use exploits or cheats to obtain more gold, I wish you good luck affording any decent items and builds for your entire squad. 
‣ AIs are terrible, especially those of your teammates. Even though you have the choice to modify how the AIs behave and what strategies and skills they can use under any given circumstances, thanks to the tactics menu, it's still a laborious process that can take hours to calibrate for all of your teammates. Even then, it's still not even that good. 
‣ Unless you're willing to use mods, the mage class, with its many elemental skills, will inflict friendly damages and side effects on your team resulting in them being less than ideal damage dealers making their only practical skills supportive ones. 

[b] 2. Technical Limitations Due To The Lack Of A Proper Budget [/b]
Playing DAO puts into perspective just how much we take for granted in our modern games, especially the little things. I can't even begin to describe the amount of corner cutting and how outdated it feels while playing. Textures and background constantly pop in, terrible graphics, ugly character models, getting stuck on geometries, poor sound mixing, and no UI scaling makes texts extremely difficult to read on 4K monitors, which creates a legitimate and concerning accessibility issue, something as mundane as turning the camera with your mouse is not as simple as it's supposed to be, and many more. Frankly, it's embarrassing how many problems stem from the development team simply not having the proper budget and time to work on the game. 

[b] 3. So Many F#cking Bugs [/b]
My experience with bugs hasn't been that bad, but that's because I used a mod that patches over 850+ of them. And even then, I ran into several nasty ones during my playthrough: Quests not submitting correctly, CTD, broken dialogues, sound bugs, and more. I can't imagine how worse it could've been without the unofficial mod.

[b] 4. Boring Side Quests [/b]
I'm merely talking about the ones that are nothing more than busywork: Chantry Board, Blackstone Irregulars, Mage's Collective, and the Blight Orfans Notis Bord. Pick a piece of paper detailing your mission, collect or kill whatever is asked, and turn it in for coins; No dialogue, no story, nothing interesting. Thankfully, most of the side quests are nothing like this and have more effort put into them. 

[b] 5. WTF is that epilogue? [/b]
Arguably, one of the worst epilogues I've ever seen. As a reward for all the hard work and emotional commitment to the game, Bioware gives us a slideshow. Not just any slideshow, though. A muted one with no narration of our exploits with the most forgettable and sterile background art imaginable. 

[b] 6. A Silent Protagonist [/b]
For the record, I'm not against using a silent protagonist. When used appropriately, it can be just as effective, if not more so, than a voiced one; Take a look at BioShock for a great example. However, DAO isn't one of them, and in my opinion, it hurts the game more than it helps. If you're going to give us the ability to play in 3rd person, custom character creation, and also voice lines, albeit extremely limited, then just go all the freaking way. Seriously, can you imagine Mass Effect without Jennifer Hale and Mark Meer? What a horrible decision. No wonder they scraped it and went with voiced protagonists in future Dragon Age games. 

[b] 7. Awful Downloadable Content [/b]
Aside from Awakening, which is okay at best, the rest of the single-player downloadable lineup for DAO are barely more than cheap lazy sweatshop DLCs. I'm talking about Leliana's Song, The Darkspawn Chronicles, The Golems of Amgarrak, Witch Hunt, and Return to Ostagar. All of which EXTENSIVELY reuses old locations while doing nothing new with it. It epitomizes greed and laziness. 

[h1] Parting Words [/h1]
I regret being so harsh on Dragon Age Origins, and the fact that it used to be one of my favorite games only made the sting even worse. But the truth had to be said, and I'm willing to bet, quite confidently, that if any returning fans were to play it in 2023, that most likely than not, many of them will arrive at a similar conclusion, if not worse. Do I regret playing it again? Maybe. Despite gaining more clarity thanks to perspective, I'd be lying if I said I don't miss my old rose-tinted memories. But what made it so timeless in the first place still holds true. Despite the myriad of technical limitations and outdated nature, its worldbuilding, characters, and storytelling continue to be one of the gold standards in the industry. Hence, my plead: Dragon Age Origins deserves a remake.",1430070840,1689988538,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are definitely a few glitches due probably to it's age, but it still lives up and is a good solid rpg with fantastic characters.

I have always liked RPG games, but very few times have I gotten engaged with the story, world or characters around me. They were simply a way to advance with the gameplay. When I played DA:O for the first time, my perspective changed drastically.

From the start of the character creation, until the end of the story, It feels we are playing a genuine and unique experience to every player. Our class, race and origin story change how we interact with multiple npc's and how certain story events are played.

This type of decision-making directly changes how the game evolves. To the point of not having a complete party in the endgame. Death, betrayal, romances and entire quest lines are different in each run.

The gameplay may feel a bit clunky by today's standards, but the tactic approach to combat gets more satisfying with time. Skill trees uniqueness makes builds feel diverse (at least for the mage) and the spell combination system is much better than the sequels.

I will not speak about the lore, in-game story/lore. DA:O is a journey that deserves to be played and is better if you know nothing about the franchise, something that I wish I could do again.",1689955570,1689955570,True,19,1,0.691967964172363281,0,True,False,False

The characters, the story, the world building, the voice acting, the environments, the incredibly memorable moments; Dragon Age: Origins is crafted with love and affection. Combat is perhaps it's weakest bit if you're not into what's essentially a turn-based system that plays out real-time, but I for one liked it for what it is.

47810,140740038,76561197968348898,0,24,1766,0,655,1690428524,"While pretty rough around some edges, this game is a gem.

I nearly gave up on this game due to how poor the initial area is (I chose to the mage path), the lack of proper explanations of the non-standard controls like the overhead view, and poor displaying of where to go for the next part of a quest. But I'm thankful that I didn't because this is one of the few RPGs I've played where you can get both a) some interesting characters and b) use a real diversity of spells in practice.

Pros:

- As a mage, you are not punished for using a diversity of spells. In fact, it's encouraged! Spells don't gain extra power by using them or by class so you're free to use other spells and spell classes. This is such a breath of fresh air compared to so many RPGs that reward you for spamming the same spell throughout the whole thing. To me this basically makes it worth playing.
- There are a lot of different ways to control things (close up 3rd person view, sky view, paused, live-time, controlling one party member at a time, controlling all party members at the same time) which each have their purpose. Once you learn to use them well you may think, ""wow, why haven't other games done it this way?""
- Several characters are fun to talk to.
- The overall story isn't too bad.
- I highly suggest making your character's face as ugly as possible in the creation stage. I giggle every time there's a close up during a dialogue or cut scene. Particularly when suitors are calling my character beautiful.

Cons:

- Getting started is rough. The start area (at least for mages) is pretty dull and you're also thrown into the large amount of ways to control things (talked about in the pros). There's a lot of ""Oh, that's what this thing is"" because of a lack of explanation.
- The controls can be confusing. I recommend never using the overhead view unless you've paused the game and need to cast an AOE spell or something like that. On rare occasions it can also help navigating to a particular area.
- It crashes fairly often (about once every half hour for me and sometimes when it's loading a save). Save pretty often. If you're getting crashes a lot, lower the graphics settings.
- This game is very sexist. There's only one body type per gender and a LOT of the women are basically topless. I guess the sexist part is kind of on theme but the topless part is a bit bizarre.
- The dialogue is audio-only until it completes, making reading quickly through it impossible. I have no idea why they did this (maybe to make it more cinematic?). I end up skipping most of the dialogue and trying to reason through what they said based on my answer choices to save time. Though this does lead me to miss some cutscenes because the difference between a cut scene and a dialogue is not always clear, which is a shame.
- It's impossible to open locked chests if you're not a rogue. Apparently the loot in them is bad anyway? I'm not sure why they were included in the game...
- After completing the main quest line in a city you gain access to the quest board. All of those quests are terrible, you can skip them.
- There's a bug that happens to nearly everyone during the Soldier's Peak DLC/quest. I recommend reading the guides/fixes before doing that quest. The only way I was able to complete it was to come back much later and force the NPC to move using fireballs because you can't learn it early on.

Once you get started and used to the controls, this is a great game.

I have meandered between main and side quests, but 10 hours in I estimate I'm probably ~20-30% of the way through the game.

Some gameplay tips:
- I recommend getting your primary party members to really like you. You can do this through dialogue and particular gifts that give you big (+50) likeability points (that's my name for them, not official) but the easiest way is to just buy ""Thoughtful gifts"" from the trader in your campsite. They each give +10 likeability points. 
- I recommend going through the Soldier's Peak DLC/quest first. It will give you access to a storage chest which can allow you to carry other things while holding onto better/more rare items. Make sure to read a guide/bug fix BEFORE doing the quest!",1687794783,1689462225,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Engaging, rich overarching story line with multiple characters, each of which has their own stories and interactions throughout the game. 
-Choices matter, with some at times unexpected results that often add to the interest in the story and the game.
-One of my favorite parts: Addition of a more robust and personal romance story to the game. I'd recommend adding onto this in all future games - it is quite a draw to the story line also, and adds a LOT to wanting to replay the game. 
-The ability to save and sometimes explore other options...and satisfy the player's curiosity of ""how could that have gone differently?""
-Personalization of the character in appearance, playing style, skills options (with many skills trees), use of different characters
-Impressive teamwork engine with use of combat tactics to set behaviors in combat, allowing the player to focus on what he or she likes to do
-Fully Immersive Choice Outcomes: Choices affect conversations, with very very identifiable areas of odd conversation
-Options for more than just trope sub stories; some options allow the player to explore many roads not often traveled
-Most of the quests do have a point or add in some subtle way to the understanding of the characters involved; very few are purely ""play fetch"" quests...and when they are there, they are a welcome change of pace 

Dislikes:
-No game is ever without a bug or a glitch that doesn't at some point interfere with game play to a degree. 
-Wish there was more to the romance stories - at some point, they plateau into repetitive scenes that no longer draw the player in further, and even limit the player at times with some options
-Some choices are not very intuitive, with little gain or even high penalty when facing a lack of information. This can be a little frustrating at times, and either lead to looking things up, some anxiety when playing, or distancing the player from the game at times.
 -Some moral conflicts are just plain annoying. The choice of character self-sacrifice vs crappy-other-options just seems a little artificial...and most people do not want to walk away from a game feel unsatisfied...this usually does not engender a desire to play another game requiring a lot of time and effort to finish. Players have lives too, and walking away from a game feeling satisfied overall is key to wanting more!
-Last point having  been said, I will probably play more of Dragon Age games because this was the first of its canon after all, and I've heard the later games are better about this issue...and as such, this game is a welcome part of an **epic** series.

OVERALL, WELL DONE (SAID WITH GRATITUDE, APPRECIATION, & ADMIRATION TO GAME DEVELOPERS AND STEAM FOR CONTINUING TO CARRY THIS GAME).

The true brilliance lies in the game's enthralling storylines. Starting with different origins based on the chosen race and class, players witness how their character's background shapes their journey. Whether you're a noble human, a downtrodden dwarf, or a mage struggling against oppression, your choices and actions have consequences that ripple throughout the game. The heart-wrenching decisions you face create a morally ambiguous world where being a hero comes at a price.

Even minor side quests present situations that carry significant weight, offering special items or unlocking crucial information. Dragon Age: Origins excels in providing meaningful choices that extend beyond the main storyline, allowing players to deeply immerse themselves in the world and its intricacies.

The playable party companions each have their own unique stories and quests, which can be influenced by the player's actions. Choosing how to assist or oppose them not only alters their individual stories but also impacts their perception of you and their willingness to aid you on your journey.

One of the game's standout features is its tactical combat system. Dragon Age Origins strikes a balance between real-time action and strategic decision-making. You can pause the game to issue orders, assess the battlefield, and plan your next move carefully.

Dragon Age Origins offers an incredible amount of replayability. With multiple origin stories, branching narratives, and various choices that impact the outcome, each playthrough feels unique and fresh.

I hate all the characters. Even Alistair, the one all the girls had a crush on, is very stupid and annoying. Also the redhead girl people like is also dense and overtly gay. Gay religious people are not edgy in worlds where homosexuality is permitted by religion. You are not being edgy.

The religion is detailed everywhere constantly, but nothing is special about this religion. You just pray to the god and be pious at church with nuns. It's the only religion in the entire world of many races and nations, it's extremely bland, and it's unlike any religion in the real world with no debatable topics, common heresies, cults, etc. They did not have to make so many codex entries about this. I already know what a generic fantasy religion is. 

The story is the worst part. It's generic. It plays hard into all the tropes without any skill, deconstruction, or self-awareness. The edgy possessed toddler boss fight was so cringy. It caused me psychic damage. I'll be kind of nice and admit the tutorial for human mage was a little interesting with a fun twist and some Bioware-tier moral quandaries, but as the tutorial is not very long, I still cannot scrounge together a full hour of entertainment from this AAA, mass-marketed game. 

Someone told me this was as good as Mass Effect but in a fantasy setting. No! Garrus and Tali are such complex and endearing characters.

From the moment I delved into the rich and immersive world of Ferelden, I was captivated by its depth, complexity, and unforgettable characters.

The first thing that struck me about Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is its remarkable storytelling. The game's narrative is masterfully crafted, with intricate branching paths and choices that have a genuine impact on the overall plot. Every decision I made felt weighty, and the consequences of my actions were often unexpected, keeping me on the edge of my seat throughout my playthrough.

The characters in Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition are incredibly well-developed and memorable. From the noble but flawed Alistair to the enigmatic and complex Morrigan, each companion has their own distinct personality and backstory. I found myself forging deep connections with them, engaging in heartfelt conversations, and even experiencing heart-wrenching moments of loss and sacrifice.

What truly sets Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition apart is its deep and strategic combat system. Battles are intense and require careful planning and tactical decision-making. Whether I was commanding my party members to flank enemies or utilizing the various spells and abilities at my disposal, each encounter felt like a satisfying test of skill and strategy.

But it's not just the main questline that kept me engrossed. The Ultimate Edition includes all the DLCs and expansions, providing hours of additional content and adventures. From exploring the mysterious Witch Hunt DLC to uncovering the dark secrets of the Golems of Amgarrak, I was constantly amazed by the sheer amount of content and the depth it added to the already expansive world of Dragon Age.

Visually, Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition may not boast the most cutting-edge graphics, but its art design and attention to detail create a visually stunning and believable world. The lush landscapes, intricate armor designs, and hauntingly beautiful music all contribute to the game's immersive atmosphere.

In conclusion, Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is an unforgettable epic that sets the standard for immersive storytelling, memorable characters, and strategic combat in the RPG genre. Its rich world, compelling narrative, and deep character development ensure that it remains a timeless masterpiece that any fan of the genre should experience.",1688220616,1688220616,True,22,1,0.59575951099395752,0,True,False,False

Took a while to learn the controls and mechanics as I prefer consoles, but I quickly fell in love with it. I'm now in the middle of inquisition, yet this still is my favorite because of the intriguing story, lovable characters and replay ability. If they ever remaster this I'd definitely buy it again. 

Only negative I could give, is that this game crashes often for me. Re-configuring my computer for it only seemed to help a little bit. And none of the other games of this franchise or other higher quality games crashed, if ever as much as this game. I saved constantly so I wouldn't have to do any difficult fight over and over again after I already beat it. 

While graphic are usually a deal breaker for me since I can't look at something for so long that is harsh to stare at for hours on end, this game really shines in giving you a great experience as you play as the Warden. I've found the other games a bit lacking when it comes to being drawn into the world and characters. This one has more choices to make for situations and didn't lead you around towards an event where your choices felt useless at the end of it. Didn't have 50 useless side quests per area to lessen the main story or terrible allies that make you regret accepting them in your party. While a few side quests were very optional, they still felt useful in giving you money to buy health/lyrium or gear you needed. 

So if you like fantasy rpg games with a fighting aspect to it, I'd seriously recommend this one. Even if you aren't that good at the tactical parts of it, just play it on casual and don't worry about figuring anything out all that much. And if you're suck at a part, look up that particular fight or situation for advice, a lot of it I found pretty helpful for winning against a more difficult boss.",1687989096,1687989096,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As to why a fan can make a fix but BIoware or Steam can't, I'm oblivious. But that's really the reason behind the downvote.

Also, Bioware shut down the support of online features for the game and the website the game links to as well.

------

The game itself:
+Good story
+Your choices influence the outcome of the game in more than 1 way
+The skill system is ok
-Poorly coded on the technical level - characters struggle to select the distance to hit each other, get entangled in terrain or other characters, very difficult to apply tactical decisions as characters will often run in random directions for no reasons or just switch from a target you assigned after a single hit to a completely random one. Most of the difficulty in battles comes from overcoming these bugs, not from the battle itself. 

*Peculiar balance - a rogue is for opening doors, a warrior for tanking. As for battle in general, a mage is worth a full party of fighters, with insane control and damage for single target and AOE alike.

1/4 tsp Cinnamon
4 oz Semi sweet chocolate
4 oz Milk chocolate (you can substitute the milk chocolate for dark if you'd like)
8 oz Extra chocolate of your choice to top your cookies with before you bake them (optional)

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (177°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper, or prep with baking spray
2. Oh? Your game is suddenly back up? Mix everything and hope for the best. You can't keep Morrigan waiting
3. Divide them into teeny tiny pieces then put them on a tray. And inside the oven they go~
4. Bake! (with prayer) Check if your game can handle a few more minutes of playtime and come back for the cookies later
5. Take out of the oven when your game crashes again and eat if it's edible. Enjoy!

There are few things that made it hard for me to like it, combat, crashing, silent protagonist.

There were also things that I rly enjoyed. Banters, learning more about companions, making difficult choices, big scale battles

I only started to truly enjoy this game towards the end. The tension, high-stakes and plot twists made me feel rly invested. I feel ready to dive deeper into the dragon age universe now.

Like the mass effect series, you will be making decisions that will shape the world and its future. You have multiple different classes to start with, abilities to learn, etc. Levels and leveling up feels rather impactful. Example, when I made an arcane mage, originally it wasn't great at all. In 7-8 more levels, I was a full fledged melee unit that was even tankier than my tanks without even using the shield which was another buff giving me 60 armor and magic resistance. Unlike in other games, you are allowed to actually kick people out of your party as well.  If you don't like someone you can quite literally, kick them to the curb. The DLCs were pretty good especially awakening which was practically half of a game.

Combat is pretty decent as well. It's a top down combat style (think diablo) but you can change the view to be more first person if you choose to do so. You  can pause the game at any point and time to issue commands to your party members and each class/specialization has a clearly defined role. This game has a great replay value, a good story, and actually gives you meaningful decisions to make that will impact your relationship with those within the world and how the war with the darkspawn occurs.

dragon age: origins - ultimate edition is a RPG developed by bioware and published by EA. the base game was released in late-2009, with the awakening expansion releasing in march of 2010. the ultimate edition which included everything in one package was finally released in october 2010. it was supposed to originally serve as bioware's spiritual successor to the likes of the baldur's gate and neverwinter nights. they decided to use the subtitle 'origins' for several reasons. one, the game was the beginning of  a new IP/franchise, two, the game features six different origin stories depending on your race/class, and finally (and most notably in my opinion), it serves as bioware's return to pc RPGs with the fantasy setting being bioware's bread and butter (or at least that's how they felt internally). 

DA:O is a hybrid of old-school and new-school RPGs. it implements old-school rpg mechanics from classics like baldurs gate, while also incorporating mechanics from more modern, action-oriented RPGs like KOTOR, fable, or morrowind/oblivion. for example, do you know the life path mechanics from cyberpunk? three backstories that change how your character starts the game and subsequently how they're viewed in the world around them throughout the entire game? well DA:O has six of them, and they are way more fleshed out here than they are in cyberpunk, a game made a decade later. there are many more examples of how they had really good ideas and implemented them well here despite development of the game taking place throughout the 2000s.

you play as a human, elf, or dwarf, and then choose either the warrior, rogue, or mage class. then from there you are eligible for one or two of the six origin stories that you begin the game as. all six eventually lead to the same place early in the story (joining the grey wardens) and all characters soon after have the game map ""open up"" for them and you can go anywhere you want. it's still cool how mid or late game, you still have things affects by/people responding to you based on your backstory. if you're a noble as one race, your family is all dead, but if your a noble for another race, your family is instead huge part of a main quest line. it is extraordinarily done and expands the game's longevity and replay-ability by a lot. 

some people may feel the combat is clunky or outdated, but i like the pausing and real-time tactical strategy. i wasn't into it at first, but i stuck it out and eventually it all connected for me as i got more familiar with the systems. you can switch in-between overhead/isometric camera view and third person action-adventure game camera view which is very useful in different scenarios. it can get repetitive, but it's still fun to micromanage everything and it's pretty challenging, even on the easiest difficulty. there are tons of little nuances with all the mechanics that actually make it extremely deep, to the point where they reportedly had to scale back the combat in future iterations. you definitely need to pay a lot of attention during combat at any difficulty, which for some can be tiresome but for me personally, i loved it. one small thing: i genuinely love how OP the mage class is, it makes you really feel the danger they represent and why people in-game want them to be locked up. 
i genuinely enjoy the story as well, with the mechanics of going to several different areas and then each area having a key plot point that you make a major decision in was a fun way to play through and it made it more fun on my subsequent playthroughs when i found that having different companions in different conversations in different settings will result in different outcomes and possibilities and just new and interesting dialogue. the story and characters are definitely the best parts of the game, as the companions and choices in the main plot lines, as well as side quest content are deep and immersive.

the best part of the game is (of course) the writing and characters/companions courtesy of bioware themselves. there's many different major plot points throughout the game and you can make many different decisions for each of them, and your companions will react to each of these decisions, with some of them even provoking them to attack you. there can be a lot of generic dialogue, but there is still a ton of unique and impactful dialogue you can have, a majority of which come from chatting with companions or major characters. the setting is pretty traditional even for a high-fantasy setting but there are unique bioware touches all throughout the world.

one awesome thing in this game is a specific background. it’s the only one of the six where your gender affects the storyline, in this particular background you’re getting married, and a noble ends up stealing your bride away if you are a male, but he ends up stealing you if you are a female instead. then what happens is you either try to break your lover out of jail or you break out yourself. not only is that in itself cool, but later you come across the kidnapper as he’s locked up and he tries to get you to let him go. well i hadn’t played this specific backstory until after like 3-4 other ones and i had encountered him in my main playthrough and thought little of it, only to find out he’s a key part in a different origin story. there is a ton of that kind of stuff in this game and it’s so satisfying finding little connections across playthroughs. 

another cool thing about this game is that it follows the footsteps of the witcher series in that you can transfer their choices from origins into dragon age II and dragon age: inquisition so that decisions made are referenced and may impact the narrative. a very cool feature that i didn't know about until well intto a second playthrough of origins. i have yet to ever even play the other games in the sereis, although that will hopefully change very soon now that i've completed origins. 

i have seen people say that the release of DA:O marked a point in which western RPGs became more mainstream, with eurogamer stating in a 2020 article titled ""remembering dragon age origins"" that ""the success of origins probed that a hardcore, older-fashioned game can still find a devoted audience"", and that it ""established a new baseline for the genre in the same way that the original baldur's gate did back in 1998"".

overall, this is a classic and amazing RPG that i sadly hadn't even played for the first time until 2023. i would easily pay the full price of $30 but you can routinely find this for somewhere between 75-85% off, making it anywhere from $7.50 to as low as $4.50, which is the price i bought it for. i definitely recommend waiting for a sale as spending well under $10, for not only an AMAZING RPG, but all nine DLC packs included AND the awakening expansion, is an incredible deal. some final notes: there's also great music, and great tactical combat. if you've ever played other bioware games, know that this is one of their best and you can not go wrong playing this, even by 2023 standards. there's easily 50+ hours of combat even if you beeline through the main story only, ignoring all the great side quests and side content. most likely you'll spend over 75-80 hours on average, with completionists taking 100 hours at least even if they just go for tall the in-game achievements. that is a ton of content for barely any money, which is even more reason why this is considered one of the better RPGs of all time.",1687003044,1687192045,True,1,0,0.509859442710876465,0,True,False,False

Rating: 9/10

Dragon Age: Origins is an unforgettable RPG experience that showcases Bioware's talent at crafting captivating and well-written games. From its engaging story to its lovable companions, this game exemplifies the pinnacle of RPG excellence.

Let's start with the positives. The companions in Dragon Age: Origins are some of the most memorable and well-developed characters in the RPG genre. Alistair, Wynne, Leliana, and Morrigan bring the game to life with their iconic moments and deep personal stories. The game's main story is exceptionally well-written and ranks among the best in any RPG. It keeps you engaged and invested throughout your journey.

Furthermore, Dragon Age: Origins offers an abundance of quality content, including side quests and DLC expansions. You'll find yourself immersed in a rich and expansive world with countless hours of gameplay. The voice acting is also top-notch, adding a layer of impeccable authenticity to the characters and dialogue.

However, the combat mechanics in Dragon Age: Origins leave something to be desired. The real-time-with-pause (RTWP) system can feel clunky and awkward, especially if you're not a fan of this particular combat style. Additionally, the AI controlling your teammates can be frustratingly unreliable at times, often failing to respond to your commands properly.

Another downside is the game's performance, considering its age. Despite performance patches and bug fix mods, Dragon Age: Origins can suffer from memory leaks at least throughout my playthrough, resulting in suboptimal performance. This issue can detract from the overall experience.

Lastly, be prepared for some difficulty spikes that may feel unfair and frustrating. Coupled with the aforementioned combat issues, these spikes can dampen an otherwise fairly enjoyable combat system.

Despite its flaws, Dragon Age: Origins is a must-play for true RPG fans. Bioware's masterpiece stands the test of time with its captivating story, immersive world, and lovable companions. If you can overlook the combat imperfections and occasional technical issues, you'll be rewarded with an unforgettable journey that will stay with you long after the game is over.",1686903717,1686903767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My only complaints is some of the minor item bugs and the crashing i had to fix.

Other than that story was pretty good i really felt like a lot of my choices mattered. 

There is a lack of guidance so sometimes you feel like crap you missed something or you fear you will or sell something you need. Its also really hard to find some items late in the game and you wont know you need things till later. 

The dlcs add much to the game but make sure you do them in the load order only some games can load into the next. It has a very specific import order i learned that the hard way.

ALSO WARNING before you complete the game or any dlc make sure you unequipped everything from you companions otherwise all that gear is lost. 

It did take me awhile to really get hooked on the story and reading all the codex stuff bored me but at the same time i wanted the knowledge and lore.

Gives you many choices to pick from, and every choice you make can affect the game in a good or bad way. And remember: it has better character customization than Elder Scroll: Oblivion...God those faces freaked me out. Game has romance routes too, but if you're just wanting to immerse yourself in the lore then I wouldn't do it, that's what I did. Maybe do that stuff after you get a good handle on the lore from your first play through since you'll have gotten used to the games mechanics and how dialogue can affect how certain characters think of you. And for people that want to be a blood mage, once you unlock it during one play through, you can use it every game. Might be useless information but I had no idea about that when I first started, so it might help. Another good bit of information is during the DLC 'Warden's Keep,' you can interact with a potion on a table. Drink it if you decided to be a rogue. It gives you a skill that can be handy if you're stuck in a bad situation and need to deal more damage, but only activate it if you are certain you'll have enough health, because it does drain your HP quite a bit, but like I said use it if you want to quickly get through low ranked mobs since it does double the damage your regular dagger would do.

Also, if you do choose to be a rogue, then if you do the 'Return to Ostagar' DLC make sure to pick up... well, your mentors sword and King Dumbo's sword. Trying to not spoil stuff here. Pick up the armor that King Dumbo had worn by defeating the darkspawn commanders, since if you don't have enough gold to get Alistair or another heavy-hitter on your team better armor, the Kings armor does a pretty good job keeping you or your teammate protected in fights.

Now the game itself is amazing, and still in my opinion the graphics are pretty great considering at what time it was released. So since everyone is rating it 1-10, I'll give this a......

...9/10.

When I first played it, I loved the plot and lore, but during the next couple of play-throughs, I thought that they could have added more dialogue options for some of the side characters, like adding a few more stories for them to tell. For example, I wished we could have heard more stories about Morrigan's childhood. From what I heard, it all sounded funny and sad, but felt like there was more that could've been added to help flesh out Morrigan's character more. Still feel like people give her unnecessary hate. And yes, I know she did some messed up crap, but in all honestly I think she tried her best to help her friends whilst also incorporating some way to benefit from it or make herself useful in someway so that she wouldn't get betrayed. Plus, I wanted to hear more about Alistairs life at the chantry and maybe more dialogue between him and Leliana talking about how the chantry operates. I know there was that one talk between the two whenever you would walk around, but I wanted there to be a bit more conflict between the two since the chantry did have a big impact on Alistair and how he joined the Grey Wardens. Leliana is one of my favorite characters because of how she had stories to tell that helped you wrap your head around the lore of the chantry. I wish I could have heard more from her since she was such an interesting character: a sister who's an ex-bandit/assassin. Thought there could have been more dialogue about their past, but maybe I'm just being nit-picky here. I love this game because of how interesting the characters stories were, including all the lore stories Leliana would tell about Andraste and the war going on with the elves and humans. Kinda thought she made the game more enjoyable because of her stories.

And if you chose an evil route, I felt like people weren't as hateful towards you as they should have been if you were so 'evil,' especially from your teammates. They felt more so annoyed rather than ""You are such a TERRIBLE person! I will KILL you!"" or ""I hope you rot. Your heart is as evil and cold as a darkspawn's, and you will pay for all you've committed."" The teammates felt more compliant with the Grey Warden's decisions then they should have been, and if you upset them or get their friendship level low, then they just leave the group. I could be wrong since I've never really tried to be incredibly evil in DAO.

But other than that I love this game and I hope people can continue giving it attention because it's story is very good and immersive.

Инквизиция у меня заняла чуть больше 100, и именно она после прохождения разожгла во мне интерес к серии. Об общих впечатлениях и субъективных плюсах с минусами далее.

[h1]Основная кампания.[/h1]

По сюжету, как зачастую бывает в РПГ, создается ноунейм персонаж, который по мере прохождения будет набирать известность в окружающем мире благодаря нарративу. Делать сложнейшие выборы в спорных и сложных ситуациях, которые по классике ведут к своим последствиям, будет так же он. Настраиваем внешность, определяемся с классом, распределяем очки навыков и выбираем стартовые способности. Всё по классике. У каждого класса свой пролог, и выбранный класс будет обговариваться в ряду диалогов.

Что привлекло в Инквизиции, и так же присутствует здесь, это затягивающий вайб. Игра неимоверно поглощает в себя с первых минут загрузки в игровой мир. Лично я могу объяснить тот самый вайб гармонично работающим комбо из офигенного саундтрека, геймплейного темпа и приятного визуала. Мир очевидно небольшой в силу своей даты релиза и имеет шовный его вариант, но исследовать его было интересно. Помимо сюжетной линии квестов в игре пруд пруди. От принеси-подай и найди-убей до действительно интересных, которые побуждают детально изучать лор локаций и персонажей в них. В общих же чертах исследование внегородских локаций - это лутинг всех видов экипировки от колец и ожерелий до мощного оружия со слотами под руны, ингредиентов для крафта и лутинг сундуков, файты с врагами, а также можно наткнуться на случайные мини-квесты. Лутинг назвал бы довольно выгодным, нередко можно наткнуться на ценную экипировку. В городах всё те же квесты и торговля. В городских локациях кстати прописаны забавные звуковые дорожки с разговорами людей, что слегка оживляет их, но в целом они не сильно населены различными НПС. Вдобавок слухи о произошедших событиях разносятся по большей части локаций, и частенько невзначай упомянутся в диалогах, что тоже хоть капельку заставляет мир казаться правдоподобнее.

Второе, что отмечу в Dragon Age, в частности при сравнении с другими РПГ, это геймплейная механика отряда. Как бывает в средне-статистической РПГ - главный герой к концу игры становится экспертом во всех сферах. Он в определенной мере и маг и воин, кузнец и травник, бесшумный вор и красноречивый оратор и т.п. В Dragon Age роли можно распределить по всему отряду и та самая классическая дилемма какой навык вкачать прямо сейчас просто напросто отпадает. Главного героя можно назначить как влиятельного оратора, который будет переубеждать или запугивать в нужных ситуациях, за крафт зелий можно назначить другого, третьего за крафт ловушек и воровство, другого за специалиста в бою и т.д. и т.п. Все на усмотрение игрока. Отряд состоит из четырех персонажей, включая главного героя, и получает опыт равномерно (даже те персонажи, которые остались в лагере). Лично я собрал стак из атакующего мага, мага полу ДД + полу баффера, мага-хиллера и разбойника. Для исследования локаций это лучший вариант имхо, т.к. только разбойник может вскрывать сундуки и имеет скиллы как для ближнего боя, так и для дальнего. Для сложных битв же разумно поменять разбойника на танка, который будет агрить врагов и впитывать большую часть урона, как делал я. Также выделю приличный объем связок между абилками персонажей. По мере прохождения и анлокинга все большего количества способностей, игроку будет приходить на ум как и где их можно выгодно скомбинировать. Главный образом это работает для магов. Более того, можно переключиться на любого члена отряда и играть за него практически полноценно как за основного, что тоже плюс. Пока вы управляете одним из персонажей, остальные будут действовать по прописанной вами тактике в отдельном меню. Танк ударит врага щитом, если вас схватили допустим, чтобы выпустить вас. Или если у одного члена отряда ХП меньше определенного уровня, то хиллер будет на автомате хилить его. Данное меню очень широкое и в нем провести не один десяток минут проще простого, если данная фича вас увлечет. Еще прикольно, что в отряде персонажи разговаривают между собой о чем-нибудь во время путешествий, правда диалоги прописаны только для конкретных пар. Беседы целого отряда бывают лишь в основных сюжетных моментах. Персонажи отряда все не скучные, все со своими историей и характером.

Никуда без раздражителей и спорных моментов в игре. Ввиду несвежести игры, она работает не всегда стабильно. Иногда у меня проседал фпс в неожиданных местах. Игру желательно не сворачивать, так как это приводит к вылетам и поломке текстур. Сильно не хватает сундука для личных вещей, хотя бы в том же лагере почему его нет? Это максимально логично было бы. Вещей в игре море и некоторые могут пригодиться на поздней стадии, но сложить их некуда. Выбор фраз в диалогах выглядел куда обширнее, сравнивания с Инквизицией, но частенько замечал, что из пяти предоставленных вариантов, собеседник отвечает необязательно на тот, что выбрали вы, особенно если диалог держит нейтральный характер. Проверку я, конечно, не проводил, но данный момент я подмечал не раз за все прохождение. Зелья защиты и смазки на оружие я посчитал абсолютно бесполезными. Импакта и разницы между слабыми и сильными я не заметил, так еще и время действия всего 30 секунд, учитывая как часто приходится переключаться между персонажами. Использовал их только чтобы опустошить инвентарь и по возможности продавал. На Full HD и выше без установки мода на увеличение HUDа и шрифта неиграбельно. Очень всё мелко и нечитабельно.

В целом, игрой я остался доволен, как можно было понять из небольшого обзора. Какая же по итогу часть вызвала больше эмоций, Origins или Inquesition? Я бы сказал, что практически в равной, но с перевесом к Origins. Она показала себя более полноценной историей, где все моменты были гармоничны между собой, когда Inquesition больше запомнилась отрывками из общего нарратива. Есть небольшое сожаление, что лично я прошел сначала Инквизицию, потому как упустил море отсылок на первую часть.

[h1]DLC[/h1]

Пробуждение. Самое крупное из предоставленных ДЛС с достаточно продолжительным хронометражем. Новая история, новые локации, новые персонажи, новое оружие и все, все, все. После прохождения основной кампании можно произвести импорт персонажа и продолжить прокачку уже здесь. Однозначно стоит прохождения.

Охота на ведьм. Назвал бы это эпилогом к основой кампании, особенно вяжущийся с концовкой игры. Так же есть импорт персонажа с возможностью продолжить прокачку. Присутствуют новые персонажи.

Песня Лелианы. Рассказ о прошлом данного персонажа, о котором было вкратце озвучено во время персонального квеста. Играем непосредственно за саму Лелиану, а также за двух ее компаньонов. Будет вдвойне интересно, если Вас заинтересовал персонаж и Вы романсили его в основной кампании.

Хроники порождений тьмы. Лично я не стал его проходить, не вызвало интереса. Это что-то вроде альтернативной концовки основной кампании. Играть за огров, которые ужасно слабые с пустым инвентарем. Такое себе.

Големы Амгаррака. Достаточно интересное дополнение за вашего персонажа, которого можно импортировать в компании с новыми, где спустимся под землю для спасения пропавшей экспедиции гномов. Небольшая история c новыми врагами и боссом, а также несложной головоломкой.

As for an actual review, the story, characters, universe, soundtrack and branching paths are all fantastic, but the only thing that holds this game back from being a 10/10, is the combat which is absolutely horrible.

It is mind numbingly boring, just click on a character, use your abilities, wait for them to come off cooldown, rinse and repeat. That wouldn't be as much of an issue if it weren't for several sections throughout the game where you're forced to do nothing but combat for literally over 90 minutes. Just an hour and a half of nearly no dialogue or story progression, just turn a corner and fight a group of enemies, turn the very next corner and fight another, and another and another and another, repeat that like 30 fucking times.

Those sections are absolutely abhorrent and the only reason I even put up with them is how good the rest of the game is and wanting to see where the story goes, if the rest of the game was anything less than fantastic, there is 0 chance I wouldn't stop playing due to the extensive combat sections.",1685327918,1686271424,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GRAB THE 4GB PATCH. IT WILL SOLVE MOST OF YOUR CRASHES! -> https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5368

Now, as for the game itself:

It is an old game. Even at its release it was technically limited in both graphics, performance, and gameplay.
In spite of it all, I am still left stunned beyond words by just how great Dragon Age: Origins is.

If you know anything about Bioware games, you'll know that what truly sells them is the cast of characters. DAO is no different. You become truly invested in these fictional characters and their stories and struggles, and as your connection to them deepens, so does their connection to you.
(Granted you can cheese the approval system with gifts)
(pls don't do that btw)

I won't spoil anything about the story, as I believe it is best experienced going blind. Just know that it's good. Really good.
It will take you accross abandoned underground roads of a fallen empire inhabited by a tainted race of mindless creatures (or are they? Play Awakening and find out!), forests filled with cursed beasts and rhyming trees, cities and prisons of men. There is no lacking variety for DAO's maps.

The lore is magnific. When you start exploring and learning about it, there is no turning back.
It takes RPG standards like elves and dwarves and gives them its own spin, making Dragon Age a truly unique gem.

I won't tell you this game has no flaws. It has many. A LOT. I spent a lot of time fixing a lot of stuff in my own modlist, from bad graphics fidelity to poor designs; of both characters, models and items.
No matter how much you try to optimize it, there's no running away from its memory leak and occasional crashes. You get used to the leak and learn to avoid the crashes, though.

If you're a fan of roleplaying open world-ish games with great characters and lore, DA Origins is a game you will most likely adore, and one of my favorite games of all time.",1686076084,1686076084,True,35,0,0.797915995121002197,3,True,False,False

Graphically it holds pretty well for it's age the main thing that you notice is that a lot of terrain is just a plain texture with no detail like grass or little bushes. It kinda feels like WoW back in the day.

A note on the EA disaster App: I got everything to fun just fine by installing the infamous EA app first and then linking my Steam account to EA through said App. If you look in the bottom right hand corner there will be an option. Click it to link your accounts and then you can open the game through the steam app with little to no issue. I hope that helps anybody having much issues! Have a great day my dudes!

How good it is to come back to this game after so long and still have as much fun as I did 12 years ago. Despite the outdated graphics and archaic mechanics, for me Dragon Age: Origins is still one of the best games of this genre. Lore of this franchise is the most unique of all I had a chance to dive into. Music in the game is really beautiful, especially main soundtrack in the menu... I'm getting chills each time i hear it. There are many amazingly written companions that do not deserve to be missed. Each one of them has its own unique story and character, which makes them question our decisions, argue with us or even rise against us if we take a step too far. The combat may be a bit uninviting at first glance. It's a weird mix of action, real time strategy and party based combat system. I personally liked it but I guess it's a matter of taste. Once you familiarize with the mechanics it gets easier but the movement stays a bit clunky. Even if you don't like the combat i think it's worth to get through it for the main plot and companions because that is the foundation of the BioWare's RPGs like Dragon Age and Mass Effect.

另外有一些反人类的地方，如自动寻路，路口窄的话，几个人一起点会因为算法问题过不去；不买dlc的话，没有储藏箱，而背包又很小，扩容极贵；10个箱子里有9个是上锁的，而且不打mod不能暴力开锁，如果队里不带盗贼的话，这东西就是存心来恶心人的——我里面有东西，但不给你拿。

The options, the choices that ive made that will have an impact to the story, for me, it was the ultimate experience in an RPG. 
I remember the first time playing RPG genre , it was with Super Nintendo (SNES) console, Final Fantasy VI. It was mindblowing experience for me, but at those times the story was understandably rather linear.

Dragon Age Origins, is the first RPG that feels ""perfect"" for me, but not for the story.
The story was rather bland, so many RPG begins with some kind of blight and disasters.

The main reason i love this game is their Characters, 
i really love them. 
The stern Sten, nagging Wynne, poetic & pure Leliana, the Royal Bastard with cheesy jokes Alistair, and of course, the sarcastic Morrigan. 
They all feel real. Many RPG have lovely characters, but this one is special.
Their banters, their interaction were so perfect. 
The Jokes, the banter between Alistair & Morrigan, OMG i love them.
The surprising plot, like... whaaa...???? i could sleep with Iona the Elf???, well, i didnt know that at my first play.
my whole family getting slaughtered? whoa i didnt expect that. It is one of the first RPG with such a dark backstory for me back then. 
And... special mention to Morrigan, I really love Her. I reallly love the cruel & sarcastic comments she made (but she kind of sweet when your male characters getting close with her and wont admit it), 
Those side boobs are also adorable.

For me, Dragon Age Origins is simply a dream came true.

The game is an action RPG where the player controls the base character plus 3 - at most - others. It has a decent character builder, and most impressevely, many different character origin stories - a sort of a prequel to the main story - which will vary according to the class - 3 available, each with their own set of subclasses - and race chosen.

The best part of the game is the well-written story and the fluidity of it - throughout the game, there are lots of ingame side quests, conversations and decisions that can be taken, that can have a very deep impact on the gameplay at hand. They can affect the plot, how other party members see the main character - eventually leading to friendships or even romances, or mutiny instead - and even the story of the subsequent sequels.

ARTWORK:

Visuals were very solid for the time, and are still pleasing to look at today. Many mods available online to further enhance that.

Sound track for combat scenes is awesome; however, the game is eeringly quiet much of the time in non-combat mode. Voice acting is superb.

CRASHES:

Unfortunately, the game has deep stability issues that make it very susceptible to random crashes. 

Screenshots either cannot be taken or will crash the game. Saves on a specific level may instant crash upon loading.

The key is to save often - basically at every new level, possibly more often. 

If a restart does not work, some troubleshooting may be in order, such as loading an older save in another map, and then trying to reload the newer save, using different characters in your party, avoiding specific spells, and so on.

In the end, I did manage to complete the base game and the DLCs come with this version, but obviously these issues seriously detract from the gameplay.

FINAL WORDS:

I also own and have completed the PS3 version as well. The game is that good. 

A true epic that is unfortunately hampered by constant crashes. 

I still recommend the Steam version as long as you are willing to spend time dealing with the crashes that are sure to occur. 7/10.",1683675445,1683675445,True,23,0,0.725183844566345215,1,True,False,False

Developed by BioWare, the game is a masterpiece of storytelling, character development, and world-building that immerses the player in a rich and complex fantasy universe.

The game takes place in the kingdom of Ferelden, where you play as a Grey Warden, a legendary order of warriors tasked with defending the land from the Blight, a horde of monstrous creatures led by the Archdemon. As you journey through the kingdom, you'll make choices that affect the game's world and its characters, forging alliances and battling enemies in an epic struggle for the fate of Ferelden.

The Ultimate Edition includes all of the game's DLC, including the Awakening expansion, which adds a new campaign, new characters, and new locations to the game. The DLC expands on the game's already-rich lore, providing even more depth to the game's world and its characters.

One of the game's standout features is its character development. The game features a robust character creation system that allows you to customize your character's appearance and abilities, and a deep leveling system that allows you to tailor your character's growth to your playstyle. The game's companions are also well-developed, with rich backstories, complex motivations, and unique personalities that make them feel like real people.

The game's combat system is also well-designed, with a tactical pause system that allows you to pause the action and issue commands to your party. This system adds a layer of strategy to the game's combat, making it more than just a hack-and-slash affair.

The game's graphics and sound design are also top-notch for the time, with stunning environments, detailed character models, and a haunting soundtrack that adds to the game's atmosphere.

In conclusion, Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is a deep and complex CRPG that offers an immersive and engaging experience that will keep you hooked for hours on end. With its rich lore, well-developed characters, and deep customization options, this game is a must-play for fans of the genre.

Addendum: While I enjoyed this title on PC immensely, I will be glad to return to my controller based gaming roots in the future. I will say that my mouse and keyboard skill has grown very slightly, but it is almost second nature gaming with a controller for me.

Dragon Age is a franchise developed by BioWare, a studio known for story and character development in the very most depth. Dragon Age enables the exploration of many different backstories and races. After the origin story, this is where the story will become similar to various play thru's. The exception being, that the experience will differ dependent upon the origin and choices made. From choice of race to origin, this is carried throughout the entire campaign and will influence certain interactions. True choice versus consequence can be experienced throughout.
Addendum: The story and experience is still impressive and I found myself immersed in the world of Dragon Age and the accompanying additional content yet again.

Graphically, this title is very easy on the eyes! There are a few glitches, when playing on a much advanced machine as compared to the hardware it was built upon, but they are easily rectified through the settings.
Addendum: I did experience an issue regarding having the settings set to maximum and while my PC is more than capable to perform the task I set upon it, the game itself appears to have issues without tinkering with some settings. The first 30 to 40 hours of my playthrough were plagued with what I assume to be memory problems (game runs fine for a certain amount of time and then begins to freeze and crash) and at one point I was nearly led to believe that my saves were corrupted. I found that this appears to be a known issue among the community and most advise either turning down certain settings or tweaking certain files or installing and applying mods. I opted for the quicker settings approach, but the game is striking when run at max prior to texture issues popping up and the freezing and crashing.

Speaking to character development, the interactions feel as though a great deal of thought are instilled to each. Non-linearly, each will feel new, as they occur. It is very clear, when speaking to the characters, that your responses to conversations do affect responses and reactions.
Addendum: The more I progressed through my campaign, the more immersed I felt in the situations that quest givers and the story sets up. I found myself saving more often than I usually do in anticipation of a conversation or choice to be made to see if the scenario played out differently had I selected an alternate route.

In summation, this experience will be something new for everyone. The controls are superb in enabling people to experience the title as completely as they wish. The content is phenomenal and has set the bar for sequels as well as future titles.
Addendum: This experience is still incredible after having completed my campaign as well as the additional content available. The vanilla textures are amazing on a capable machine, although it is a shame that setting the visuals too high appears to affect the stability of the game. From story to characters to combat to additional content tie-in, this title is a cornerstone in the portfolio of a legendary developer as well as any consumer that has the title in their library.",1671428815,1683347339,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is not without flaws, some of the DLC (excluding Awakening) is a bit expensive and doesn't get you quite as much as you want for the price. Another flaw being the very few ever persisting quest bugs but none are game breaking or obtuse. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.

You go on an epic journey to save a Kingdom from a mismanaged and belittled threat which spins out of control very fast. 
All this starts with you reaching your lowest and face betrayal after betrayal. It is a literal from zero to hero story, but told in a realistic way and it focuses on your Player Character. While pressure is enormous on your shoulders as you race with time to rally a fragmented Kingdom and build alliances. 

Thedas is a cruel place and far from perfect or harmonic, so there are times when you question everything. Is it worth to die for this Thedas? An example: you are an elf however humans rule the planet and destroyed your culture and they belittle other species. As an elf you are a 2nd rate citizen or a travelling outcast. 

You are a Hero they never asked for and who never wanted to be one. Supporting characters are amazing and you get that ragtag band feel of LETS SURVIVE together.

EA please give us a remake or remaster trilogy like ME, or at least update it.

edit:
I fixed the crashing issue using this :

so far no crashing for 5 hours

After completing the game + DLCs
Dragon Age Origins 100% worth it ☺, There are some area game will keep crashing like in Denerim, Ostagar and Blackmarsh. You can always F5 for quick save. DAO is must play game and I'm 100% sure this will be your top 5 or 10 game of all times. 
 EA need to give this masterpiece some love.
That mod i mentioned is must you reduce crashing for 90% ○○○

The game is a masterpiece of storytelling, role-playing, and world-building that immerses players in a rich and complex universe full of memorable characters, intricate plotlines, and epic battles.

One of the things that makes Dragon Age Origins so special is its ability to make players feel like they are part of the game's world. The game's attention to detail, from its intricate political intrigue to its numerous side quests, ensures that there is always something to discover, explore, or engage with. Every choice you make in the game has consequences that affect the world around you, making it feel like a living, breathing entity that you are helping to shape.

Another standout feature of Dragon Age Origins is its cast of characters, each of whom is fully fleshed out and memorable in their own right. From the gruff and stoic Alistair to the wily and cunning Morrigan, every member of your party has their own personality, backstory, and motivations that make them feel like real people rather than mere game characters. The interactions between party members are some of the most enjoyable moments in the game, and the game's dialogue system allows you to build relationships with them over time.

Of course, no review of Dragon Age Origins would be complete without mentioning its combat system. The game's combat is strategic and challenging, requiring players to carefully manage their party members' abilities and equipment in order to overcome increasingly difficult foes. Whether you prefer to play as a warrior, rogue, or mage, there is a playstyle for everyone, and the game's diverse selection of spells, weapons, and armor ensures that there is always something new to try.

In summary, Dragon Age Origins is a masterpiece of gaming that has stood the test of time. Its world-building, characters, and combat are all top-notch, and it's no wonder that you love it so much. If you haven't already, I highly recommend diving back into the game and experiencing all that it has to offer.",1682028158,1682028158,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

Even created a couple mods over the years. I play on a new computer that is far above minimum specs. This review is based on the unmodded PC version of DA:O Ultimate.

Pros: Very good story, with just a few annoying holes and problems in dialog programming. Good, neutral and evil options in many dialogs. Excellent voice acting. Interesting NPCs with lots of banter and dialog. Detailed and useful journal. Graphics are decent for such an old game. Party inventory is a great innovation. Lots of control over the camera. 

Cons: Limited character creation options; you have more control over your looks than over your race, class and stats. Poor maps -- hard to navigate, toons get stuck on meshes, only one quest marker (which might not be on your current map), can't select travel points from the map, can only fast travel from certain maps (resulting in numerous mindless treks through completed map areas). Horrendously complicated and onerous combat AI that can't be turned off. Overly tactical combat. Survival requires constant pausing and micromanagement of skills, position and inventory. This is often true even on the ""easy"" setting (contrary to the in-game description). Of the games mentioned at the beginning of this review, DA:O provides the worst combat experience. If you fail to do quests in a particular order (read blogs for the order because the game won't tell you), you won't be able to complete some of them. Not enough inventory slots and no bags of holding. Also, you can't drop or store inventory anywhere but your stash -- you have to sell or destroy what you no longer want to carry. Locks can only be opened by rogues, so keep that in mind when assembling a party. Occasionally, an NPC is required for a quest and rather than making the quest unavailable without the NPC, the game finds far more awful ways to handle the situation. For example, NPCs that aren't in your party will suddenly appear and talk, like they had been there the whole time. Or an NPC you might want to keep in the party (like a rogue) will be auto-booted and replaced by the required NPC (this may happen mid-dungeon, leaving your party seriously hampered).

Pros: 
- The characters and writing are excellent and pulls you in, wanting to explore every option.
- Very through and deep world-building. World has a very, LotR/Game of Thrones vibe.
- Music is good and memorable.
- Gameplay, while a tad dated is still quite decent with lots of playstyles and build options.
- Origin stories for player character feel unique enough to explore all and add to the worldbuilding.
- Lots of player choice in how the plot progresses and plenty of grey areas to muddle through
- The DLC is overall excellent and hours more to do outside the main game. DLC can be done at anytime too.

Cons:
- Graphics are dated. It's a game from 2009 so set expectations accordingly.
- May have some issues running stable on modern systems so be prepared for crashes.

If you've never played this, you are missing out on one of Bioware's best games ever produced. 
Highly reccomended.

One of the things that sets Dragon Age: Origins apart from other RPGs is its emphasis on player choice. The decisions you make throughout the game have real consequences on the story and the world around you, giving you a sense of agency and investment in the game's outcome. Additionally, the game boasts an impressive amount of replay value, as the various character origin stories, party compositions, and dialogue choices allow for multiple playthroughs with vastly different outcomes.

Another highlight of Dragon Age: Origins is its characters. The party members you recruit are all unique and fully-realized individuals with their own motivations and backstories. They have their own opinions on the events unfolding around them, and their interactions with each other and the player character are both entertaining and insightful. The game also allows for romantic relationships to develop between the player character and certain party members, adding another layer of depth to the characters and the overall story.

In terms of gameplay. The combat system is well-balanced and challenging, with a variety of spells and abilities to master for each class. 

Overall, Dragon Age: Origins is a must-play for any fan of RPGs. Its immersive world, complex characters, and engaging gameplay make it a standout title that is sure to provide countless hours of enjoyment.",1680632767,1680632767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have played Inquisition and heard Origins was the best in the trilogy and I'm finding that to be true. Yes the game is dated in graphics but there are mods for that if it bugs someone too much. The combat also isn't the easiest for me but that's only because I've never been good with a mouse and keyboard. 

That said, the story and companion relationships are where this game shines. There are choices that actually have an effect on what happens in the game. Most games today just give the illusion of choice or the choices given don't really affect anything overall. That's not what happens here. Certain choices will make your party members like you, hate you, stay with or leave you. Some will even attack you. 

The conversations and banter between the companions is one of my favorite things. The music is great, as is the voice acting. The story and lore are interesting and is very well written with balanced humor and sadness. This is definitely a game I will replay.

I noticed in some reviews that some were upset they couldn't romance certain characters and that the game is buggy. There are numerous mods for this game and plenty that you can choose from to help fix those issues. Want to romance anyone, there's a mod for that. Want to restore cut dialog, there's a mod for that. Want unique armors and weapons, there's a mod for that. Want to fix bugs, there's a mod for that. In short there's a mod for just about anything. The game is one of the best RPGs to date.

In fact, I would say the setting is one of the most unique takes on dark fantasy that I have ever seen. There are some truly difficult and tragic decisions in this game, that will carry over into other titles in the series. This is genius. In most sequels, your character from the previous games seems detached from the current entry. However, since the choices in DA:O are so profound on the world, the ripples that your Grey Warden takes in this game will go onto change so many plot-points, characters and story-lines in the DA2 and DA:I. I literally murdered a potentially companion in DA:O, and they never showed up again in any other games, no cheap resurrections, just gone, completely removed content. Some people may disagree, but DA:O is BioWare's masterpiece; bar-none.",1657550316,1679802040,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, it is incredible and its positive aspects absolutely outweigh the bad. If you are looking for an immersive RPG with an engaging story, enjoyable dialogue that actually feels meaningful, and tactical combat, this is it. Your intro/background chapter is completely different depending on your race/class. For me, it added a lot to the experience. It really made me invested in my character's story and how they ended up where they did.I love the dialogue the NPCs have with each other. Pairing different people up in your party creates some amusing dynamics. Your choices matter sometimes, and sometimes they don't. But it still makes every moment meaningful because you don't know what ripple effect will come from it. I love tabletop games, and the way combat and leveling is structured is quite reminiscent of that. Don't spend too much time trying to min-max or hyper-focus on making the right choices all the time. There is a lot that goes into the mechanics and you'll kill yourself trying to optimize a, frankly, sub-optimal system. I play for the story and the fantasy, not because I'm looking for the most streamlined combat system in existence. If the latter is what you're after, you may not get the right level of fun out of this. If you choose a path and either play as you wish or how you feel your character would act, you'll have an amazing time and find yourself sinking hours in equal to some of the greatest RPGs.

Interesting and original fantasy. 

- The world is the right combinations of realisticness and fantasy. There are tons of well written dialogue. Witty, funny and serious even. All the characters have masterfully created and believable personalities and talking to them feels like talking with different people. Some of them can even present ideas to think upon in real life (mostly Wynne). You are also presented with many answers and choices that will determin your relationships or even the outcomes of some events. There are many answers to choose from and you can take almost any stance towards the issue presented. Nothing feels like it is forced on you. Unlike DA Inquisition, this is a game from a time where there was very little or no influence of the sexually depressed and self righteus on media, so the authors could and did create an interesting world without the need to reflect the problems of 2018 - forward american society in it. 
- Then Awakening offers less choices and thus less freedom of expression. Especially when talking to the human-hating elf. But the expansion offers interesting new feeling when you become a lord of the castle and you have to deal with nobles, peasants and keep to the castles defences.

- World looks simple but beutifull and the great score perfectly adds to the atmosphere.

The mod community of DA:O is outstanding as well, offering a fresh take and viciously enticing replay value of all sorts of classes, dialogue options and story choices.

While it may take some patience and practice for new players of tactical RPG's (and it certainly has shown it's age graphically), this was back when visual and vocal story driven experiences in gaming were in it's golden age.  I find myself coming back to it once every couple years for another play through, trying out different mods on Nexus Mods.

As the creators didn't know they would be making sequels. Perhaps this can be blamed for much of the epilogue slides, even some direct choices from this game getting retconned. The writing is completely unoriginal, but with source material like Lord of the Rings and Warhammer, the heroes journey here feels like a proper rags to riches adventure in a dark fantasy setting.

Dragon Age: Origins is an excellent role-playing game with a truly epic campaign and great tactical gameplay. 

It offers a rich and vivid world, loads of mature themes and memorable characters. The storytelling and dialogues are witty and engaging, the music is inspiring and you will be deeply involved in the compelling gameplay. 

The different decisions and conversation options in combination with your individual character background allow you to proceed through the game in several ways resulting in a high replayability.

Where as Mass Effect is a relatively fast paced cover shooter that is very easy to get into and enjoy (or at the very least tolerate), the combat of Dragon Age is far more slow and strategic which could potentially be a turn off. 
This is especially true for Dragon Age Origins.

When I got the game last year and started playing, it took a while for me to understand the combat and what the ideal way of playing was. I actually had to watch a guide and I still didn't fully get it. 
I think if you are into methodical combat where you really have to think about positioning then you will get a ton of enjoyment out of the game. If not, then I recommend you play the game anyway, just on easy difficulty where its much more forgiving.

The reason I think this game should be experienced by all is because of the incredible story.
The entire story is a joy to go through from start to finish, presenting fun and intriguing moral dillemas and choices. It has a very interesting villain in the form of Teyrn Loghain and the Darkspawn are also a great storytelling tool as well as an intimidating foe.

By far the best part of the game is the companions. Each and every one of them are cool, interesting and very well written. Each one has their own little separate storyline that you experince through their dialogue and their personal quest. (Except for the Dog, who unfortunately doesn't have his own quest.)

Despite the complicated combat that could potentially shy people away, I absolutely recommend this game. The story is amazing, the companions are even better and if you really don't like the combat, you can always just turn on easy mode.",1678353746,1678353746,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will see strange texture glitches, random crashing, stairway pathing issues. If your game crashes and after reboot it continues to crash on your most recent save try loading an older save first then loading your newest save after. The DLC does not transfer your characters equipment from the main game correctly. Make sure to quicksave OFTEN! Before you transition to any other area and after combat map a quicksave button in case your game crashes. This will save you a lot of headache. It is still possible to play through the entire game.

But the more energy and time I spent on it, especially reading lore, the more I felt committed to it, and finally I grew to like this game, care for this game. In the end I am so happy that I didn't give up.

Now I understand why this game is called one of the greatest rpgs of all time. The choices matter in a way that you see few in modern rpgs. The endearing companion members are so entertaining, making banter and telling their interesting backgrounds. You don't really want to make wrong decisions for them. It took me a long time to get hooked to the story, but once I did, I was at the edge of my seat the rest of the time.

However, I can't recommend this game to everyone, not especially to modern gamers because It will feel very dated for them. When I say ""dated"", it includes the clunky gameplay, repetitive combat, exhaustingly long dungeons and tedious lines of enemies ready to come at you. Those elements make this game feel unnecessarily slow and it wouldn't convince me to replay for a different path. Alas, this game has a wonderful replay value. To add to that, this game uses the tactical combat mechanics that might be a drawback to those who like intuitive gameplay.

My point is this game could use a remake. For this reason I don't confidently recommend this game, but if you are PATIENT and love BioWare games, go for it. It is definitely worth all the trouble.

I know that there are thousands of reviews that will tell you such, but it is simply that praiseworthy. It has hands down the best story of all 3 games, and the most flexible dialogue in terms of player choice, which is always a plus with RPG games, and why I believe this is the only *true* RPG of the Dragon Age franchise. I also love the beginning segments for each background, and that they all tie in to the Warden leaving for Ostagar very well. I wish that they brought this back for Dragon Age: Inquisition, and I'm crossing my fingers that they will bring it to the fourth installment in Dragon Age: Dreadwolf, but only time will tell. If more linear real-time combat is what you enjoy, this game is a bit outdated in that regard, but excels in the tactical aspect and thus is great for top-down turn style gameplay. The companions are all quite intriguing and tie into the story well, and the romances are very sweet as well. My favorite companion was Zevran because he was the funniest and most charismatic, and my favorite romance was Alistair because it tied into the story well, and he had a certain awkwardness which was endearing.

This game, which was released over a decade ago, has stood the test of time and remains a shining example of what a truly great RPG can be.

The storyline is nothing short of epic, taking players on a journey through a land plagued by political intrigue, religious conflict, and demonic forces that threaten to consume everything in their path. The game is as much a political thriller as it is a fantasy adventure, with players being forced to navigate complex webs of allegiances and betrayals in order to save the world from destruction.

One of the standout features of Dragon Age Origins is its diverse cast of characters, each with their own distinct personalities, backstories, and motivations. From the brooding mage Morrigan to the noble warrior Alistair, each companion is a fully-realized individual with their own strengths and weaknesses. The player's interactions with these characters, whether through dialogue or combat, help to shape the course of the story and ultimately determine the fate of the world.

The gameplay itself is both challenging and rewarding, with players having to make strategic decisions about party composition, equipment, and tactics in order to overcome the game's many challenges. The combat system is dynamic and engaging, with players being able to pause the action at any time to issue commands to their party members. This allows for a level of strategy and control that is rarely seen in RPGs.

Overall, Dragon Age Origins is a true gem of a game, one that stands as a testament to the power of great storytelling and immersive gameplay. It is a game that rewards exploration, encourages player agency, and offers countless hours of entertainment for anyone who is willing to delve into its intricacies.

This has the classic charming clunkiness of older games that haven't been streamlined to make an easy experience, meaning you  have to focus on every character in combat and spec your character to a specific strength early on, making party cohesion crucial. The cutscenes and story moments were genuinely cool and Orzammar might be my favorite hub/combat area ever (I'm a sucker for the classic Dwarven aesthetics and environments.) After a while of playing, combat can be a slog, but the story and side content were interesting enough to be well worth the time spent; not to mention the characters. Each party member (aside from the dog) have their own stories that are very much worth the time invested which made this game one of the most memorable party-focused RPG's I've ever played. Not for everyone, but if you like old-school game difficulty and don't mind committing a lot of time to playing, it's worth a buy. Alistair, Zevran and Anders are fantastic explorations of the ""snarky companion"" archetype and I'm honestly very glad I got this game.",1677243655,1677243655,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things to note, this is an older title. The graphics and gameplay are reflective on this but neither of which bother me. If you ask old fans, origins is the best game in the series and the games slowly got worse overtime. With newer fans, inquisition is the favorite for its looks, open world, and sheer amount of things to do. I started the series with origins and I do believe it is the best game in the series and you will never get the same feeling with 2 and inquisition. There is so much character and choice and wonder that I could make another character today and still have a lot of fun experiencing the story in a slightly different way. What makes this game the most fun for me is that I feel the characters were the most interesting and entertaining compared to the other games. 
Dragon age 2 will always hold a special place in my heart because for the only time in the series, you aren't the fabled chosen one to save the land like you are in origins and inquisition. You're pretty much just a normal person trying to make something for yourself in an already crowded city where they don't want you there in the first place. By the time you do, there are challenges building up around the city that you can try your best to conquer or diffuse but in the end, you can't do much but experience the crumbling of society around you.
Dragon age inquisition is by no means a bad game, in fact its quite refreshing to explore the growing world of dragon age with far less restriction and feel the good you are doing for this land. The combat is the most fluid in this game whether you like it or not. Some people like the more rigidness of the first as you have more time to plan out each character's attack with combos and whatnot. 
Something interesting to note is that while this game is a series, each game is its own. What I mean is in a series like Mass Effect where it more or less seems like you're picking up where you left off, in Dragon age you start somewhere different and always have to make a new character. Also if you plan on playing the whole series, make sure you transfer saves over so you can actually see different events in the next game based upon what you did in the previous. 
I'll end with this: Dragon Age will always hold a special place in my heart and opened my eyes to the whole rpg genre. I used to mostly play shooters growing up but now I take chances on rpgs I'm not sure I'll like as I did with dragon age. It's what led me to the Witcher series which is quite similar in progression to Dragon age. In both series, the first game had the oldest feeling combat system that quickly changed in the second installment. The third was more of an evolution of the new combat introduced in the second and felt more refined. Where these games differ in combat, was the Witcher evolved into a more hack and slash that was quite fun to play and Dragon age became a more real time rpg with no turn base or grid system. The Witcher 3 has gotten high praise over the years where Dragon age inquisition has more or less faded into the background. I very much look forward to Dragon age 4 but I have no expectations of the game reminding me of Origins.

So I thought hey, it's on sale so might as well get it on Steam. I was scared that I wasn't gonna like it that much anymore but it still holds up so well in 2023 (especially with a couple of texture mods). 

Let's start at the beginning - despite its age, DA:O still offers a lot of choices regarding character creation. From the most hideous make-up you've ever seen (in a good but also funny way) to quite a lot of customization options regarding the shape of your face, your hair, etc., it has not everything but a lot to satisfy the cravings to create a cool (or uncool) character. Unfortunately your voice doesn't matter much as DA:O's player character obviously has dialogue but no voice. A bit sad but a minor flaw. 

The game's start is very unique as you can choose one of six origins (thus, the name) all depending on your race, your class and your social standing. All of these origins merge into the actual game that starts quite quickly before slowing down to carefully build up one of my favorite video-game worlds of all time. That world-building goes hand in hand with the main quest which makes you seek out the major races in the game. Plenty of serious main quests, goofy side quests and interesting companion quests await. And companions is where DA:O really shines. A lot of different people will join you on your mission to save the world and honestly, all of them are worth spending time on/with. While there are certainly stereotypes like the drunk stinky dwarf or the ""witch"" whose intentions aren't quite clear, these characters are one of the main reason that makes the game shine. When it comes to the story, the characters and the dialogue, this is probably one of Bioware's all time best games. And hey, all of the romances are definitely worth a shot. No pun intended. 

DA:Origins' combat is where the game might fall flat for a couple of people. It is very slow and can feel heavy and awkward since it is quite outdated. If you want to play on a higher difficulty, simply bashing through it is also not the wisest idea. Tactics are a thing and definitely need to be used on anything above Normal. The skill trees offer quite a bit of variety and while some things may look goofy (looking at you, mages), it still holds up for the most part. 

The playtime with all DLCs is probably about 40-60 hours, depending how thorough you are. The correct order is Leliana’s Song > Awakening > Golems of Amgarrak > Witch Hunt, although the first and the third one aren't as important lore-wise in my opinion. One last thing about Dragon Age is probably the thing I love the most about this series - choices do matter. A LOT. Especially main quest ones, but also side quest choices. And honestly? I'm all in for that. 

TL;DR. Absolutely fantastic world building and a unique story makes up for slow combat. Funny dialogue, important choices and endearing yet at times questionable companions make DA:Origins a very solid 9.5/10 for me, even after 10 years.",1676300650,1676300650,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

If you've played some Bioware games, you know how they're committed to giving us good products, Except for games like ME: Andromeda and Anthem.

The Warden, the hero of Ferelden (the protagonist) needs to gather forces to defeat the Archdemon and save the world, the classic story of a hero that needs to defeat a great threat. Bioware has shown us here how to make a great game. The mix of a fantastic story with excellent gameplay makes you want to stay hours through the game, your will to explore the world of Ferelden and evolve your character does not decrease, rather, you'll always want more.  

The characters with their own peculiarity, and how your relationship with them will evolve according to your choices (truly matter) in the game, some of them are lovely already on the first encounter.
Tactical combat allows you to pause, choosing which skills you will use in that situation. Though the combat seems outdated sometimes, with a few options of armor and weapons, a lot of useless talents, and some dungeons being boring and repetitive. The game has a great OST and voice acting.

First off, I HIGHLY, highly suggest this guide so you can be able to play the game properly without frequent crashes and disruptions. It helped me tremendously and I wish I found it sooner:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JL1oFoOaNwk&ab_channel=JustCallMeFrosty

After having this game on my backlog for over a decade I finally decided to go back and complete it. I'm someone that is a sl*t for graphics these days but I was able to put that in the back of my mind with how incredible this game is with it's storytelling. It's not the prettiest game ever but it doesn't look bad either, Bioware just doesn't know how to do hairstyles to save their life! Dragon Age is arguably my second most favorite series of all time so I had already played Dragon Age 2 & Inquisition prior to playing Origins. It's hard not to have been spoiled on what all happened in Origins due to all the callbacks in the sequels so I knew some things coming in but didn't mind, I love the lore regardless. But now I finally get to fully understand the history and why the Hero of Ferelden and the companions were so beloved as well as the game itself. I'm a sucker for the romance focus in these games but overall I really, really enjoyed it.

-To start with praises:
My Rogue City Elf (Probably the most fun class in the game alongside mages imo, always pick an elf) got to set the tone for the rest of the series as I play through them once more before DreadWolf comes. This game has a lot of depth and surprised me with the amount of effect your choices have on the world. You can easily get distracted for hours on interesting side quests. One of my favorite things were the fact that you can talk to a random person on the street without any sort of marker above their head and they might have a full set of dialogue about current events and etc. The companions are a blast, I enjoyed Zevran and Alistair in particular the most. The tactics system was okay and helped with not having to micromanage but tedious to set up if you're like me and enjoy using every companion now and then. 
My favorite thing is probably the origin story you can select at the start of character creation, your race, which origin you select, it feels like a tag that sticks with you throughout the game and not one of those things you pick in other games and it doesn't matter for the rest of the time you're playing. Not to mention you get an entirely unique opening to the game based on what class and origin you selected, that makes this game in the series stand out quite a bit.
(Curse them for making me play a human in DA2)

-Nitpicks:
Not a big fan of the combat and the way you have to maneuver around in it. It obviously feels a bit aged and much different from most games these days. To be fair I am used to more modern gameplay and prefer the combat to DA2 & Inquisition. And without the respec mod, I would have had a major headache setting up my class right the first go around. Blame that on me if you like. There is also only TWO recruitable mages in the base game, so if you don't make friends with one of those, you might as well say goodbye to your party's healer. Using the respec mod on Morrigan for example allowed me to make her my party's healer early on. That mod alone made the game far more enjoyable.
I also have never particularly enjoyed the Deep Roads in any of the games, this one is no different for me, but others might love them! The game also has certain sounds that will absolutely deafen you sometimes but I grew used to it after awhile. Overall I feel the positives outweighed the negatives.

Some mods i'd personally like to recommend:
-Extra Dog Slot
-Respecialization
-No Helmet Hack
-Forced Deathblows
-Morrigan Restoration Patch (For those Morrigan lovers out there like me)

-Also if you are entirely new to the series, i recommend using Dragon Age Keep to save your decisions throughout the series. Beware though, sometimes the site can spoil you on certain events if you click on them before playing through it in the game.

[b] Mid Fantasy [/b]

It's been almost a full decade since I had first tried out [b] Dragon Age: Origins [/b] on my Xbox 360, and while I found the introduction of the game to be pretty cool (differing backgrounds lead to different intros), I wondered for a while why I never ended up playing more than that. I then decided a few years ago to do a similar thing, again to no avail. As one of my final games of 2022, I decided to mod this thing up once and for all and attempt to delve deep into Ferelden in hopes of finding an experience truly worth the game's epic namesake. I have to say that after all of this time waiting, I've been disappointed again (surprise, surprise).

Maybe this game would have been better had I played it more around its release (or, you know, just was older in general), but I found so much of this game to feel far more dated than some of the other ""great"" games from 2009. Yes, the game's writing is solid enough ""character-wise"", and yes, the game contains impressively rich lore as per BioWare's typical offerings, but I just couldn't really harness any more fun out of this one outside of those aspects.

The combat is incredibly stiff and unsatisfying to me. This may have to do with the game's unimpresive animation at times, but I've seen people bring up that this system is mechanically deep (which I wouldn't argue with). Yet, I never found it *fun* to interact with. Attacks were automated and rigid, the mana/stamina systems felt overly restrictive, and in-game tactics required a constant hampering of combat pacing. For my experience in any RPG with combat, I still need to feel like I'm ""taking part"" in a battle AND have a direct way of influencing it. It's kind of the point of having diversity in builds and whatnot. In [b] Dragon Age: Origins [/b], it feels more like you come across enemies and slowly slap them around a bit with some uninteresting abilities until one side fully dies. Well, unless you're a mage that is.

See, [b] DA: Origins [/b] is absolutely clear with its intentions - in the world of Ferelden, magic is power, and everything else is just secondary. This applies both to the actual power levels of each class as well as the number of interesting things you can do with them. As a Warrior or Rogue, most skills revolve around drawing attention/distracting enemies and stunning or charging up powerful attacks. Typical stuff, but it's limited to this for a nearly fifty hour main campaign (even disregarding side content). The thing is, once you choose a class, you're stuck with them. Sorry! Better luck next time. (Unless you utilize a mod to change this, but it wouldn't really prove as a smooth transition to suddenly go from lumbering, beast warrior to fragile, reclusive mage)

If you are smart enough to play as a mage though, well, you're in for a treat. [b] Origins [/b] provides a slew of fun tools to play around with, ranging from necromancy to divination, even spells covering the whole classic catalog of fire, air, ice, electricity, etc. As a mage, you actually FEEL powerful, or at least feel like you have potential to become so. This is massive flaw since none of the other classes feel this way, and this is evident when you start to interact with the party system. Mages are awesome...except for that they're built like actual twigs, snapping at any moment of exposure to direct combat.

Now, I chose my character to be a warrior. Boo-hoo, bad choice, I guess, but at least he was a damage tank. However, in [b] Origins [/b] you can pretty much control another character in everything except direct dialogue, meaning you can have your character be the ""Frodo"" to someone else's ""Sam"" (there are still debates on who the main character is in ""LOTR""). I can switch to being a mage, or rogue, or fricking GOLEM mid-combat! It's actually a cool concept for a game to have...until you realize most other characters aren't that fun to play as.

While magic provides for interesting tools to play around with, the actual act of playing with them is very stripped back. You click a button, see an extended animation, and watch your character send their attack towards an enemy...only to miss? This game utilizes a random attack succession system and lord does it fail to make combat feel ""realistic"", nonetheless ""fun"". The game starts to feel more like a battle management simulator, and this is far different than a direct-control RPG in many elements. One of the things that suffers the most from this in my opinion is the game's immersion.

[/b] Origins [/b] does not have a strong plot. It's simple and it works for sure, but it boils down quickly to ""recruit allies, fight evil, save the world"". It is not very subtle with this either, thus much of the game's true narrative is actual within character interactions. These are very solid, hell some of the better characters I've seen in interactive fiction. Yet, the ""Alistair's"", ""Morrigan's"", and ""Zevran's"" of gaming can't fully shine without immersion, and I constantly found mine broken through the rugged simplicity of the plot and the bland combat.

What also ruined my experience was how slow the game felt. I try to be patient with games but forgive me if I don't want to spend a few hours exploring a mine for a small relic for a section of one main mission. This type of mission made the game DRAG for some many hours, and by the time I got to ""Orzammar"" and the ""Deep Roads"" I just had enough. I couldn't do any more quests like ""The Fade"" stuff either (though I'm pretty sure that was undoubtedly the worst part of the game).

To add on top of this, the Darkspawn NEVER feel like a true threat, and there's no sense of pressure through gameplay or writing that indicates this. It's only characters ""talking"" about how bad they are, but besides the early sections of the game, you can go almost to the very end without being SHOWN their tenacity. They're literally just ""evil monsters"" and that's it.

There's no doubt that [b] Origins [/b] was made with love and care, especially for the theme, genre, and lore throughout. There's an absolute truckload of material to read through in this game, and lore nerds would find much to love from the way BioWare unravels this universe. However, the game is just not very fun to play outside of dialogue interactions. Movement is cumbersome and clunky, combat lacks proper feedback and is restrictive to a key class, and the overall plot struggles with pacing and tension - one of the most important aspects of any RPG story. [b] Mass Effect [/b] may be less mechanically deep than [b] Origins [/b], but it was more fun because of its pacing.

Look, if you enjoy this game, good for you. I'm late to this party like most people, but I never really got behind the ""real-time combat"" genre. You could call me ""impatient"" (I played fifty hours, so f*ck me right?), but I think games should be a ""bit"" stronger with getting things moving along UNLESS they have a strong gameplay loop. Plus, my reviews aren't factual - look at the average review to see how people who play it feel about their experience. My experience, however, was pretty middling, so seeing people call it a masterpiece sort of causes me to scoff. Different strokes, I guess. [b] Dragon Age: Origins [/b] is, frankly, not one of those games.

[h2] Final Verdict: 5/10 (Average) [/h2]

First, the combat is generally fun. It has its downfall's, but the tactical camera, numerous amounts of perks, and ability to switch characters always breathes life into combat. The graphics actually aren't terrible considering how old the game is. If that sort of thing really matters, go to Nexus Mods and install whatever you see fit. DA:O's story is fantastic. At first, I had to push my self to keep playing, but once I got to the open world the hours just flew by. There is a considerable amount of lore that I recommend you learn (it makes the whole experience more enjoyable), but it is not required. The DLC is a blast, no problems there. If you're interested in Dragon Age: Inquisition, I STRONGLY recommend you play Dragon Age: Origins.

[b]SPOILER FREE[/b]

I beat DAO for the first time sometime after it first came out, but I had forgotten all but the highlights of the story. I'd heard good things about DAI, so I decided to do a play through of the entire series. I use Linux, and I had some difficulty getting DAO running. I almost gave up, but I'm glad I didn't. After I got it working, it ran flawlessly (maybe better than Windows if some of the reviews are accurate? Thank you Valve!).

In my opinion, the story is fantastic, and there was always something to keep me interested. At no point did I feel like it was dragging on. Building relationships with the characters was rewarding, and learning their stories was too. There was some tough decisions along the way, and sometimes someone I had grown close to broke away and ended the relationship. This genuinely upset me, and had I been smarter with saves, I would have gone back and made different choices. Still, this game seems to reward your choices with meaningful consequences, and the ""Origins system"" does a great job at making how you start out meaningful.

 The world building was great, and I can't wait to explore more of Thedas in the remaining games (""Mountains, Gandalf! I want to see mountains!"").

Combat and character progression is rewarding too, and not overwhelming. I always felt like I knew what to do with my characters stats and levels, something I sometimes struggle with in other games.

The graphics aren't great, but I was surprised at how well they've held up (although graphics don't make or break a game for me). There are some areas that are still beautiful.

But, the [i]music[/i] is incredible. I could loop the music from the title screen for a long time. I was also surprised to see that 30 Seconds to Mars wrote and sang a song that plays during the credits! And it's great! I'll be listening to the soundtrack from this game for awhile yet.

All in all, a great CRPG, and worth your time.",1674939984,1674939984,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Defiantly Bioware at its best. Cons: The gameplay can be clunky/dated, and slow to some, and takes some time to get use to. Warriors are tanks to absorb damage, but are slow and boring to play as imo. Mages are the most fun (Also imo) and are overpowered glass cannons, fun to play as, but a pain to deal with fighting against. And the biggest con would be the fact its not mentioned that much from people who praise the game is that DA:O is an unoptimized unstable mess of a game, if you intend to play this game on PC, you will most likely NEED a couple mods just to fix the glitching textures, and constant crashing, that can even hardlock your game.

I will say this. While the world of DA: Origins has held up very nicely with the musical score, the stories, the characters, etc, the graphics not so much.

I ended up beating the original campaign four times and the prologue of five of the six origins. I also played Awakening twice and my last playthrough from beginning to end. What really makes it stand out as a CRPG is it's origin system which is incredibly unique and ambitious. Minor characters like a shopkeeper in one playthrough could have a whole backstory in another. It truly gives a lot of different ways of roleplaying your character. For multiple playthroughs I highly recommend some mods to skip some parts of the game such as Ostagar, the Fade and the Deep Roads as it makes the replaying less of a chore. Don't worry, these mods keep you the option to still play the content but skip some of these parts if you prefer which get a bit long in the tooth in my mind.

The world and lore of Thedas is also quite interesting and well thought out and makes me excited to think of all the factions and kingdoms we can explore in later entries in the series. What truly makes or breaks a party based RPG like this are its companions and this came pulls no punches, having some of the best ensemble in the genre. While you make like some companions over others, they all have their interesting moments whether through battle or banter. Through different playthroughs I found myself surprised how certain characters I wrote of ended up growing on me depending on the origin I was playing. The intimacy of talking to your companions when you set up camp always brings a cozy vibe and are among the best parts in the game. The quieter moments before the dungeon crawl. There's also romances, which can be sweet minus the bizarre janky animations in the love scenes.

As for combat it's overall pretty good though it definitely shows its age, and this is someone who loves older school games. Combat flows a lot better than the KOTOR games and the amount of abilities and spells at your disposal are quite incredible. The combat is a bit on the slower, tactical side which works in its favor. That doesn't mean there aren't problems, sometimes characters will have a hard time 'locking on' to an enemy in melee. 

The skill trees I also have a mixed feelings over as some skills feel like repeats (the shield skills have multiple variations of a shield bash ability for example). Or in order to unlock a skill you want like the spell Mana Clash which is excellent for shutting down spellcasters you'd have to spend precious skill points on some underwhelming abilities you'll probably never use at all. I understand sometimes putting points in abilities to unlock the 'good stuff' but it doesn't always feel great in this game. The class specializations are also very fun such as the Blood Mage, and since you can have more than one specialization it really gives lots of options

There is a lot of content and DLC to keep you playing for a long time. There's a lot to love. It sits in a weird spot in gaming. In between the classics of old like Baldur's Gate and the more flashy streamlined cinematic experiences the Dragon Age sequels moved more towards. Warts in all, there likely will never be a game quite like Origins. I love it to pieces and is definitely worth a look.

We get so wrapped up in our traveling and fighting enemies that we don't always take the time to look around.  I found many stunning areas and marveled at how real it all looked. 

Voice Overs - 10/10

Most of the narration was spot-on for the characters and there's voice-over for every interaction.  No text to read, but you can enable sub-titles if needed.

Storyline / Plot - 9/10

As an author, this is very important to me, and one of the reasons I love RPG games.  Most of them have rich storylines.  Dragon Age Origins was exceptional with the detail in the background of the world and the people who inhabit it.  There are tones of  codex's to read.  With that said, I did find some plot holes between things I'd been told and then what actually transpired. 

And, if you're a player who loves quests, this game is for you.  I do know from watching another gaming channel that I didn't trigger all the side quests I should've.  But that's the point of RPG games.  You go where you want, interact with the PCP's and hope you did it right.  LOL. 

Party Members - 10/10

There are a lot of them and who you chooses changes the story as you go.  I found out the hard way that you need to take each of them out to get their companion quests.  I didn't and then got betrayed.  And, if you didn't buy the Ultimate Edition, you won't get Shale.  I loved her character and I'm so glad I got to met her.  

As you travel around with your party members, certain areas will trigger conversations between them.  The banter between Morrigan and Alistair was fun to listen too.  It's hard for me to chose my favorite one, but I will miss them and they will stay in my mind for a while.  I even had tears at the end, when we said good-bye.  Just like a good book.

Path Finding / Mechanics - 6/10

As much as I loved this game, I almost gave up on it several times.  The game kept crashing, over and over.  Sometimes it took ten attempts to even get the game to start.  UGH.  This is an older game and it does have issues with newer computer systems.  I play on a Windows 11 computer with all the bells and whistles for video editing, so it wasn't an issue on my end. 

As for the path finding, steps can be a problem and I got stuck on plenty of them.  In fact, during a horrendous fight in one of the DLC areas, I got stuck while disarming a trap and couldn't move.  I couldn't shot at enemies, and they couldn't attack me.  Thankfully.  But once the fight was over, I was still stuck there, hanging in the air.  I had to restart the game and redo that horrible battle.  It took me several tries just to get there the first time.  If you're on an older computer system, you should be fine.  Hopefully. ",1674312993,1674312993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like character-driven, dialogue heavy games, you will love this. This is peak Bioware.

The story is fantastic. A classic tale of good vs. evil, with just enough plot twists and surprises to keep you interested.

The sheer creativity in the writing has crafted a world so fleshed out and lived-in, you'll feel transported.

The combat may feel dated to some, but I honestly find this system more interesting and engaging than in newer Dragon Age games. I love the tactical pausing-based strategy system.

I do not know if anyone is still in need of the review for this game, but if there is a soul out there akin to little me who started with the DA spiral with DAII and took very long time to get conviced to play the Origins, maybe this review will help the all three of you out there.

First of all- does it hold up? The answer is a resounding yes! I would say that the experince is on par with newer games in the franchise, at times even exceeding the rest. The combat system is easy to grasp, graphics look suprisingly well and the world while not the most spacious or inviting feels quite fitting for the mood of the story.

There are few things that one may consider annoying however- one of them being lack of clear directionts through most of the quests. This may be a benefit to ones who feel annoyed with much more hand-holdy approach of later instalments but for the ones who dislike having to stumble through the questline and just take guesses what they should do next, this may get a bit annoying at times. Often  it's left entirely up to player what they feel like doing next and while I can imagine many will welcmoe the freedom- while there are no wrong choices there definitely are ones that will make you wish to just let 2 hours of gameplay go to waste and start over with a diffrent route,  Quests are often vague and require you to go throug mechanics that aren't always all that intuitive. Similar thing can be said about romance mechanics- as someone very much used to the clearly marked dialogue options I was suprised just how easy it is to accidentaly stumble into romatic relationship with someone in this game. I can again imagine this being a benefit to some who wish for a more immersive experince, but I do also recognize some people play DA with a very clear idea of how they want the events to play out and having to turn down Zevran may have not been part of this vision. All around be prepared for a lot more running around, and figuring things out as you go for better or worse.

Also I think it goes without saying- the game has bugs and gliches. Lots of them. From ones as innocent as characters and animals changing colors as you walk by them to quest NPCs just disappearing making it impossible to finish said quest. WhIch is then just left in that journal. Taunting you, Forever.
So as always rememberto save often- autosave is as per usual unreliable.

Now to the good stuff- the characters, worldbuilding and questlines are at their peak. Almost every part of the story is investing, almost all the characters will make you feel some type of way. There is a reason why Morrigan and Alistair remain fan favourites to this day. Admitably some get more development and quakity writing then others but in general I see no dead weight pulled around here and despite the lack of Warden's voiceacting, Origins manages to get in some of the most fun banter I've got in any game.
The plot goes to dark places but still often manages to give satysfing conclusions. Some of the choices should honestly give player a pause.
I also would like to take a moment to praise Shale specifically- despite being a DLC character, she seldom feels like an add-on. She is involved in the story, feels like unique and fun adittion to the party, her questline is not completely detached from the main plot and I can have a dialogue with her without  constant  urge to facepalm... looking at you Sebastian, the blandest piece of man-shaped pixels to ever grace a computer screen.

All in all avery solid, worthwhile if quite long experience. Highly recommend.",1673733833,1673734295,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main game is very good, amazingly good. The story is great and engaging, the characters are likable, and the dialogue is great and not nonsensical. 

The combat, however, is alright, like it was annoying and boring at first, but after a while, I got into it, near the end it started to wear off though. 
And once I got to the DLCs, the combat was so laughably easy that I could just let my companions fight on their preset behaviors. Maybe it's because I was an Arcane Warrior Blood Mage though. 
Also, the entire Orzammar section was awful, I really couldn't stand it, nothing about it was fun or engaging.

The graphics are still amazing, even after all this time. The textures don't have high fidelity or anything but the environmental details and art style are great.

The last point is going to be the technical issues which quite frankly frustrated me a lot of times, but I'm not going to enjoy this game less because of it. The main one I had an issue with was the memory leaks after a session of a couple of hours, but it was just a quick restart and all was good again. And then last the crashes, I had around 20 crashes I think, which isn't that bad for having played it for 72 hours.

Overall an amazing game that everyone who enjoys RPGs should play.

Dragon Age Origins is arguably one of the few last games that Bioware manage to produce before the eventual decline or rather demise of talent due to wonderful team leaving one by one or pushed away by EA's marketing team in the pursuit of continuous growth of money. 
This game is wonderful, blessed with a blissful and engaging soul which only a handful of games can carry. I personally fell in love with this game since 2012 when I was but a small lad trying my hand at RPGs, if my memory doesn't fail me now this was my first ever played RPG. I just felt captured by the entire narrative the game set fourth within the well crafted world of Thedas.

The Titanic struggle of the surviving Grey Wardens trying to save a blighted nation from the dreaded darkspawn and also save it from itself in the form of a mad man poised by his delusions.
The story, well...it's simply amazing to begin with something that now a days is surely missing or is rarely nailed properly and effectively, ""a beating heart"" so to speak. What do I mean by such words? The world building, the characters and nearly the entire setting down to the details of the armor make it actually pretty neat to explore. I wish they added a bit more content and didn't resort to simply to copy pasting sometimes but alas such is the world of gaming development.

Exploring this behemoth of a game was a joy to ride along and see and read about the world at large, see the various outcome of the quests and seeing the areas I missed along the way in the first play.
This game is surely worth playing for the story alone but some people might find it about clunky and old and I don't blame them, this is after all, a old game that maintain its charm but didn't hold up well in another zones though I still enjoy every aspect of this old ghost of the past.

A truly sad day when we didn't see the old glory of Bioware's writing and game building in later games alas, they started to slowly and rapidly fade out with DA 2 then become a hit or miss type of deal with DA Inquisition, let's pray Dreadwolf at least bring up some of that magic that Origins had.

Conclusion, get this game and enjoy yourself one of the last great Bioware titles before EA corrupted them.",1673525499,1673525730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DAO has an incredible story, well-written dialogue, fully fleshed out characters with unique backgrounds, loyalty missions, and motives, an extensive character creation and progression system that gives the player free rein regarding who they want to be, and countless player choices that have a real impact on the story, characters, and world of Ferelden.

But by all that is holy in this world, DAO has got to be one of, if not the buggiest game I've ever played in my life. Constant crashes, stuttering, getting stuck in quests because of NPCs not working as intended, attacks/skills malfunctioning, AI-controlled party members not engaging in combat, voiceline glitches, and losing some of the best gear in the entire game because a mission bugged the hell out are just some of the issues off the top of my head. I know it’s an old game and bugs are to be expected but this is beyond ridiculous. I encountered fewer bugs during my TES: Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Fallout: New Vegas playthroughs combined (all vanilla btw).

EA, the game producer that is single handedly trying to rape and destroy PC gaming. I cannot say enough about the shoddy business practices of  this company or their pathetically bad customer service or the ways in which they force good gaming companies with exceptional games to release so far in advance that the public turns their backs on the products that would otherwise have left us playing for months on end. My greatest and darkest hope is that all of EA's senior staff and those who back them as if they have done something beneficial to PC gaming, should all die in a slow fire that consumes their infrastructure and reduces them to a non-entity in gaming while leaving all the good, solidly designed titles they tried to destroy, intact.

That said, on to my review of the epic, Dragon Age: Origins.


Where does one start when reviewing a game like Dragon Age: Origins?  Does one talk about the deeply involved storyline? The well thought characters; companions, background NPCs, and evil villains? Perhaps one would start by reviewing the fact that the only unvoiced character in the entire game is yours, all others have some level dialogue which is voiced whether they be the nameless commoner walking through the halls of Orzamar or the deeply intricate dialogues of each and every companion who joins you. Perhaps it is the simple yet involved process of character design and the combat.

I guess for me it’s the soundtrack. First and foremost what I think of when I think of Dragon Age is the amazing soundtrack. It draws me in each and every time I play this game; of which I am now halfway through my 10th (or maybe it’s higher than that) run through. Like many of you I owned this game when it first released and played it to death. It was only scant months ago that I bought it again on Steam. Frankly my reasons for purchasing it on Steam are pretty superficial; I didn’t want to have to dig out the CDs for a fresh install.

Regardless this game draws me in each time I play it. Even though some of the play throughs were with new characters that ended being rehashes of old characters, the time away from those old characters made it entertaining to play through again with a similar build. The music is simply amazing, but it is, in my humble opinion, equaled by the depth of the story and the villains you face. Dialogues that draw you in and make you admire some of those you interact with and despise others. All the while a story unfolds that keeps you at the center of action without actually calling you “The One”. It has an incredible epic feel to it, and yet, you remain somehow less grand than what some novels would play off of in creating a hero of your stature.

The first time I fought a dragon I was in awe of the experience. I cannot begin to explain how many times I paused to take screenshots. And yet, nearly a dozen or so play throughs later it still feels like a grand event.
For those of you who have not played this game I would say this; If you played through such games as the Baldurs Gate series or the first Diablo at its release and fell head or heels in love with them, or if you played every last ounce of the Mass Effect series and your only complaint was the ending of the third game because you had become so engrossed in the story and the lore of it…

then you simply must play Dragon Age: Origins.

Still worth the money tho

Aside from lots of crashes and bugs(which can be fixed with mods)

This game is solid good and a well made RPG. So many content, so many charming characters, world-building and great combat. While the MMO-ish combat might turn you off, cuz it did to me but I find that DAO's combat is pretty deep. The game itself encourages you to try out stuff, like combining Grease spell with Fire to make shit explode or Freeze enemy + critical hit/Stonefist to instant kill an enemy.

DAO really made choices matter and the story is so good. After playing DA2 which I think is a major step back from DAO, while the combat is much more fast and fluid, it feels as if the depths that the original had are gone. DAO can be a very slow game. Super slow. It would benefit a lot from a remaster with snappier HUD/UI but still keeping the aesthetics of Dragon Age unlike DA2 or DAI.

Pros:
+ RPG mechanics are well done and incredibly in-depth
+ Game can be modded fairly easy with Nexus Mod Manager (Vortex)
+ No need EA Launcher to play
+ Story is great
+ Awakening DLC is badass
+ Combat while can be sluggish, it makes up with the ""if > then"" tactics command
+ Soundtrack are good tho anything regarding the mages/the fade can be quite annoying. Vigil's Keep combat music is busted good
+ You can replay this game like 6 times for the character origin story alone or 13 times with variants epilogue regarding your choices
+ Companions are charming, likeable and very well-made. My favourite companion being Sten for his stoic demeanor. The others are also very great and believable characters.
+ Being a mage in this game is pretty fun. In my playthrough, my character is a mage and thus being the engine of the team to start doing stuff so my companions can shatter enemies in one critical blow. I like being an engine.
+ Rich in aesthetics from sound design, User Interface and artstyle

Cons:
- Game can be buggy and unoptimized due to being old and outdated.
- Crashes randomly at times
- Theres a city(Denerim) that you cant Load your save file if you saved there due to it crashes should you try. Only workaround is to save outside of the city as far as I know. I could be wrong since I did little research on this matter.
- Game is ugly but better looking than DA2 due to artstyle slightly less than DA2
- Sluggish combat

Conclusion:
4/5 Great game, totally on par with my Skyrim Experience. Solid experience that every RPG or medieval fans should try at least once in their time. Classic game that is well loved and praised. Made with crazy attention to detail and care. 

Bioware should really consider remaster this game to be much more accessible in the new generation in terms of performance and better experience.",1672387636,1673094658,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's sad to see how low Bioware has sunk as a company. They used to make these kinds of fantastic products. Games made with love and passion. Well-thought-out Characters, Worlds and storylines.

The foundation of the once wonderful Bioware is gone, the people who made the company one of the most popular game developers are all long gone, and you can tell by how soulless their games are these days. (Andromeda & Anthem)

Considering that they have been whitewashing the lore of Dragon Age Origins for a number of years with regard to, for example, already existing character backgrounds, interspiecies politics & the slavery background of the Antivian Crows and making it all more politically correct, it does show that the current young generation of Bioware employees has no respect for the product they are working on.

[i]One of my favorite Role Playing Game of all time![/i]

The game is close to perfection. Great setting, outstanding lore and backstory, good and funny characters, awesome soundtrack and the list goes on...

I had already played this game back in 2009, at the game release and I dared to get the Platinum Trophy on the PlayStation 3... and got about 250 hours into that game there. Yes, that game is THAT GOOD! On the PS3 version, the combat was somewhat generic, especially with a melee character. Now on PC, the game handles way better, has improved visuals compared to the console version.


[h1]POSITIVES:[/h1]
[b]+Epic story.
+Thrilling combat. (You can approach combat in any way you seek: Fast-paced, without pausing too much or going as tactically and strategically as possible... that latter option is mandatory for harder playthroughs though!).
+Interaction with the companions.
+Plenty of content (the vanilla game offers you many hours of playtime but with the Ultimate Edition, it adds a good 30 hours).
+HIGHLY replayable (with many different type of characters and races, you get to have ELEVEN different Origin story).
+Amazing soundtrack, voice acting.
+Decisions matters and carry over the next Dragon Age games. You can still go on Dragon Age Keep, a beta system that enables you to craft DA:O and DA2 storylines and import into Dragon Age: Inquisition.[/b]


[h1]NEGATIVES:[/h1]
[b]-Dated visuals. At this game's release, the visuals were already average and now in 2014, it didn't aged well.
-A few minor glitches that either requires a quick-reload or game restart.
-Poor melee combat implementation.[/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]After logging close to 300 hours of playtime (PS3 + PC), I can honestly say that I really loved this game. I rarely replay games but DA:O was a good exception. Not only I wanted to replay this fantastic game but I also wanted to craft my storyline and import it towards Dragon Age 2. 

So, to put it bluntly... Love RPG? What are you waiting? GET IT if you still haven't played it yet! Lots of replay value and many secrets to be unearthed and also, different possible endings![/b]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT:[/h1]


[h1]A Tale of Orzammar: [/h1]
Unvoiced storyline which serves as a prologue to the Dwarf Noble Origin. It was released as a bonus with the December 2009 edition of PC Gamer. It is a very short DLC (30-45 mins long) and doesn't add much and easily skippable.


[h1]Awakening (Expansion): [/h1]
Outstanding additionnal content. It either continues where the game ended with Origins and that you are still alive OR, it takes another Warden from the region of Orlais. New spells, skills, items, companions... You have a good 30 hours of content here on this very good expansion.


[h1]Leliana's Song:[/h1]
Prequel DLC about the origins of the Leliana companion character. It is a standalone adventure in which you play as Leliana during the mission. Adds about 2 hours of playtime.


[h1]Return to Ostagar:[/h1]
Short DLC that enables you to return at the starting point of DA:O. Also, if you had forgotten to recruit Dog, this DLC gives you a second chance to get it! You can also get great items and armour there! Highly recommended to play this DLC since you get to have good stuff soon in the game! This DLC adds about 1 to 2 hours of playtime.


[h1]The Darkspawn Chronicles:[/h1]
Short standalone ""alternate history"" scenario that you play as a Darkspawn and ""what-if"" your character has died in the Joining ceremony. Average-ish DLC but does give you some insight in the Darkspawn point of view. About 1 to 2 hours of playtime.


[h1]The Golems of Amgarrak:[/h1]
Special expedition to the Deep Roads as the Warden-Commander. This DLC requires your character to have Level 20 or start a new lvl 20 character. DLC adds about an hour or two of playtime.


[h1]The Stone Prisonner:[/h1]
Get to recruit Shale, the almighty Golem companion! Highly recommended DLC! This DLC is fairly long and adds about 3 hours of playtime.


[h1]Warden's Keep:[/h1]
This DLC grants players access to the fortress of Soldier's Peak. It also unlocks quests, new talents/spells and various items. Best pro of this DLC is the Party Storage Chest so you can store additional inventory. This DLC adds about 2 hours of gameplay.


[h1]Witch Hunt:[/h1]
Last DLC of DA:O. So what happened with Morrigan? You get an insight into what has transpired and maybe some closure between your warden and this Witch of the Wilds. This DLC adds about 1 to 3 hours of gameplay.

Long ago I tried playing it on the Xbox 360, but the battle mechanics were so clunky that it slowed me down and eventually petered out my interest. This was clearly how the game was meant to be played. Everything feels seamless, from the inventory to the battle mechanics.

Overall, the story and the lore is phenomenal, and the world feels alive. I find myself going to every corner of the map, just to be sure I've not missed anything. The Codex are fun to collect and I take the time to read them all. Coming back to this game after so long, I was a little worried that I'd have a hard time adapting to the graphics, but it still holds up very well. Especially once I realized the ambiance and color schemes reminded me a lot of Twilight Princess ... for some reason that really brought me onboard. 

The tale is gritty, dark and full of characters to both love and hate. Also was really impressed at the LGBTQ+ romance options and how genuine they were, especially for the time the game was created. They feel genuine and whole, and not an after thought or a gimmick. DA:O certainly has its flaws, but it is still a gem regardless. 

My only huge complaint is how buggy Denerim is, and how often it crashes the game. Learned pretty quick to save before entering any of the houses, just in case it made the entire game die. 

All in all, this game has great replayability, and your choices feel like they hold weight, which is intrinsic to RPGs as a whole. I have not once felt like my character's decisions didn't matter, or that if I had picked another option that the game would railroad the story to get the same result it wanted. You Can fuck up, you Can make bad choices. And what's better, is that the game lets you.

The console version [i]is[/i] the superior version, as this port has not been optimized for newer systems. It crashes quite regularly and may not work at all on Windows 11. If you're on Windows 7, you might not have any trouble at all! If Windows 10, it may take a bit of effort to get running properly, but the main workaround I use is keeping graphics low in big areas. [spoiler]Denerim, Orzammar, the Deep Roads, and Haven/the mountain it leads to all apply. Oddly I never crashed in Brecilian Forest, but as a general rule turn graphics to the lowest settings in big areas and you shouldn't experience a crash.[/spoiler] As for getting DLC working, that's a bit more of a pain in the neck but can be accomplished by running a few executables in game files. There's a handy guide right here on Steam you can easily find to help with that!

Now with all that said, I acknowledge my playtime says 122 hours at the time of this post, but I've clocked thousands of hours back on Xbox 360 and Xbox One. I love this game to bits and it is, in my humble opinion, the single best RPG I've ever played. The storyline is immaculate, the writing is fantastic, enemy designs are impressive & intimidating, dialogue varies from thought-provoking to outright hilarious, and the [b]LORE.[/b] God, there's SO MUCH lore to be found throughout this game, the codex is MASSIVE and I could spend hours just reading the various entries, exploring information about this amazing world BioWare constructed. It's a shame later sequels in the series couldn't even come close to standing up to this masterpiece. Every character has their own little quirks too, from [spoiler]Sten's surprising love of sweets to Shale's utter loathing of birds[/spoiler], and it makes their banter all the more interesting. There are so many variations of every little interaction that it's incredible - the time and effort that went into this is beyond amazing. Although Awakening doesn't quite stand up to the Origins main story, it's also really really good! I especially love [spoiler]Herren and Wade[/spoiler] returning. 

I really, truly love this game. It was one of the first games I played on Xbox 360 and I keep revisiting it just to relive this absolute roller coaster again and again. The lore has a ludicrous level of depth, scenes and dialogue are well-written, the combat mechanics are turn-based and yet still fun to work with regardless of your playstyle, the DLCs are actually worth it - it really opens up to a huge majority of players. But do keep in mind it's a wild ride, and deeply complex, with riddles and difficult enemies around every corner! New allies and enemies galore, all as interesting as the last, but I think I have a heavy bias towards Shale. Even after all these years this game hasn't lost its shine, and I still fully recommend it; I still believe it to be the best of the trilogy. [strike]Plus you can pet the dog. As much as you want. And he's a good boy who brings you cake! That's worth a recommendation.[/strike]

Yes, the graphics are rough these days, but play through it once and you're going to fall in love with the franchise. It is the start of one of my favorite series, and sets you on a wonderful journey through Thedas.

Understand that this is an old game with some difficult topics in the starting sections. The combat system isn't perfect, something that Bioware improves on in DA2 and DAI. However the plot line and story is what sells the game every time. I have played through every story line possible and have enjoyed how each one offers a new insight on the rest of the game, and effects other characters later in the game or franchise.

Cons: (old lady voice): Connecting to EA account >:C You youngins may not like the dated graphics and combat system

The Dragon Age series is much like the Fallout series in that the earlier games were designed in a style similar to ""pen and paper"" tabletop gaming (DnD, Pathfinder, etc). However, to keep up with modern gaming trends, and with the success of Mass Effect and FPS in general, the franchise has moved toward more fast paced action/adventure. It's similar to how some gamers love old school JRPGs, and some gamers find them too slow paced (and the more awesome among you appreciate both >_o ). Although DAO combat is not turn based, it does allow players to carefully and meticulously strategize every moment of combat - and in some battles this is even necessary.

Saying that, if you're an old school kind of gamer, you'll love this game. If you're more modern, it may not suit your pace. DAO is indeed an older game. But in a similar vein, DAO was created with care and love, before the title became a mere cash grab. Compared to contemporary triple A games, the graphics show their age, but back in the day, this was considered top tier. Point being, Bioware genuinely wanted to create a great game, and many in the Dragon Age community, including myself, consider DAO to be a must-play masterpiece.

I've seen other reviews talk about issues playing on newer machines. Given the age of the game, I can some people having issues. Speaking personally, I havn't encountered any major problems. I've been able to play this on an i-7 machine built during the pandemic, as well as a brand new laptop with (shudders) Windows 11 Home. I've even managed to launch the game on Linux. There is the occasional crash, certainly, but no more than other PC games I've played. The only time I've had real issues is when I add mods. In fact, with a fast enough processor, there's a neat trick that I call ""Glyph-stacking"". Set a glyph of paralysis, quick save, then immediately quick load. With a fast processor, the glyph will still be there and your cooldown canceled (the game doesn't seem to keep track of cooldowns across saves) and you can repeat and get half a dozen glyphs down before they timeout.

It's the dumb stuff you can do with the combat system that makes me really love this game. You can set down traps before aggroing enemies to just mess with them or even kill them outright. You can cast huge AoE spells from halfway across the dungeon to wipe out an entire room before they knew what hit them. Even on Nightmare difficulty, with proper strategy, you can just go wild with the combat system and just have a field day.",1671039320,1671179865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am not spending it running through a gauntlet of .exe modifications and replaying the boring Ostagar introduction half a dozen times. 

By frequent crashes, I mean the game abruptly closes to Windows desktop before every single cutscene and when moving between major zones. This means that the vast majority of the game, including all the plot high points, will be ruined for you and you will rewatch them a dozen or so times before the game decides not to crash. You are almost spamming the F5 key to quick save when you are playing to avoid the headache of losing 15+ minutes of quest dialogue and choices.
I am told these issues are not present on EA Play. I would consider subbing to that for one month for $5 USD and running the game through that. You can always unsubscribe and if the game still crashes you can play some other EA stuff for the other 29 days.",1670694423,1671138860,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

 I was highly looking forward to delving into one of the most acclaimed BioWare RPG titles of all time, but the game crashes so frequently that my excitement got snuffed out fairly quick.

According to many online threads, the reason for the crashes are because of compatibility problems, and you have to go through an approximate 6 step process to eliminate all of the potential reasons for the crashes; one of which is to play the game on low quality settings, which I cannot bring myself to do.  However, I've played many titles that are around the same age of this game - or even older than this game - and I did not run into this many problems.

For those that are patient enough to jump through the hoops to get the game working, this is probably not a big issue and I'm sure you're in for a treat.

After a while, I got too annoyed with bugs, like enemies shooting fireball spells through walls. Party members repeatedly stopped following commands. I had to keep reselecting them to attack targets. In some cases they would just stand there while getting hit, and not do anything. This made combat get more and more tedious. Enemies seemed to be immune to their own traps, so that if they set off a trap near me, only my characters would get harmed.

Locked chests also super-frustrating, basically requiring a specific character to unlock them, or no goodies for you!

Dragon Age: Origins features a diverse cast of deep and interesting characters. Each has their own perspective on every situation, and they aren't afraid to voice their disagreement. Each character's reasoning follows logically from what the player learns about their history, and the game does a fantastic job of showing how reasonable people can disagree on even very fundamental questions. Crucially, the game also shows those people continuing to work with one another in spite of their disagreements.

The voice acting is top-tier, with the exception of a few lines from minor one-off NPCs, and the dialogue is fantastically written. Like the original Mass Effect, this feels like a game made by and for adults -- not because of its content, but because of how that content is presented.

Part 1: the game is decent, but EA leaving it abandoned with so many bugs after the franchise has earned it so much money is deplorable, so they get the negative review, even if I still recomend the game. I played over 150 hours and the game crashed around 300 times. punishing the people who give you money leads to lack of loyalty and them being less willing to give you money if they can avoid it.

Part 2: if you are the hardcore fan type like me who wants to consume everything and in the proper order, there are comics, novels, ''third-class games'' and some movies and or shows to read, play and watch inbetween the three main DA games. If you don't play cash-grab games, check them on youtube. be informed that there are two prequel novels to this game you should read before playing it.

This is one of the best games I've ever played. I would pay $200 to experience a game like this again for the first time and you can buy it on sale for $7.49!!! Even full price, there is great value to be had with this game.

If you love RPGs, tactical combat, character development and interactions with the characters and story that matter, you will love this game! There are a few games out there that pretty much every gamer should play and this is one of them.

Visually, the game holds up remarkably well for it's age. Manyatruenerd did an excellent play through I would highly recommend watching if you want to get a feel for the game before you buy it.

The Cons: (Please don't let these discourage you from playing the game, just know they are there).
The game can get a little glitchy on the highest visual setting due to a RAM issue(?), this can be cured if you go into the game files and make an edit. There are guides online, but I just bumped the graphics down when needed. Additionally, it crashes in the largest city, so you will want to save before you travel there(every time). There is also a part in one of the DLCs where a character is supposed to do something if you spare him, he will stand there after the cut scene ends, there are multiple fixes online, but running away from him immediately will do the trick.

THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE GAME: Even though there are sequels, there is no other game quite like this and it will leave you wishing for more. There is a hole in my heart knowing I will never be able to experience another game like this. Dragon Age 2 is ok and I just couldn't get into Inquisition. Nothing that has followed has been able to live up to it and that's what makes it so sad.
For those that pick this game up, be patient and you will have an amazing time with it, I only wish I could experience it for the first time again.",1669507806,1669507806,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The use of the origin also does have very good dialogue changes depending on where you are which is nice to see. Magic is also fun, even if the rest of the combat feels a bit slow at times. 

Biggest downside so far is how when you get to certain parts of the game, it really starts to struggle with loading and crashing leading to potentially blocking all progress. The only workaround is to download a mod patch to help run the game. With the DLC, while Awakening has lots of fun abilities it is a very buggy mess which, again you need to download a mod to actually play it, as one story area can lead to you permanently losing your gear and some bosses crash the game with their effects. But this is more an age flaw than a game design issue.

The storyline is packed with lore and action and there is a lot of detail in the environment. This was the first version of the game where I noticed that there were chipmunks/squirrels in the Korcari Wilds that were making some of the noises I would hear. I enjoy how the characters all have their own opinions, so your choices have the potential to please one character while upsetting another. The characters themselves are unique and enjoyable in their own ways - it is very hard to decide who to take with me on quests! I also love that this game has 6 different starting story lines depending on the race and class you select (i.e. if you are a Human, you start as a member of House Cousland if you are a warrior or rogue, or you start in the Circle of Magi if you are a mage). It is one of the things I miss in the later Dragon Age games.

The only issue I have noticed so far is that the colors are sometimes weird - for example, all the floors in the tower at Ostagar had completely black floors and walls. I'm uncertain if that is an issue with the steam version of this game or if it's my computer settings. I'll be testing my settings for the next few days to see if anything I do fixes it.

The one thing I wish this version had is built in compatibility with controllers. My original copy of Dragon Age was on the Xbox360, so it is a bit tricky figuring out how to use the keyboard options. Luckily the mouse compensates for a lot of it so I really have only needed to use the keys to move and open the map, and I have found that some things seem to be a bit easier with the mouse than with the controller, but it would be nice to have the option of keyboard or controller.

11/24/22 Edit: I would love if Bioware would remaster the graphics and fighting animations for this game. Have there be a bit more variety than standing and swinging a sword or pushing a staff forward to shoot mana. Everything else is perfect as it is. It would just be nice if the skins didn't glitch frequently when in detailed locations or to not get stuck on the last step when going up a set of stairs in the Dalish Ruins.",1641681739,1669346761,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main thing I love about DAO is the amount of freedom they give you with your protagonist (your grey warden). One of its strong points is the dialogue and wealth of choices. You can be the typical hero or an absolute dick to everyone, and pretty much anything in between. It's not just black and white where each speech option will push you into either ""good"" or ""bad"". You have SO MUCH space for roleplaying in this game and I think that's beautiful. That said, you aren't given a completely blank slate. You'll have 6 origin stories to choose from and each will let you have a separate prologue to play through. That's great because it helps you decide what direction you want your grey warden to go and it helps make you feel like your character was already a part of the world.

If character creation is important to you, then you'll enjoy this and you'll get a decent amount of replayability. 

Another strong point is how well-written the characters are, particularly your companions. It felt like you were all just a big group of friends out to save the world. I loved the banter between them. There's a lot of travelling so it's nice when your companions suddenly strike up a conversation with each other. They even react to in-game events and your relationships (if you pursue some of them). Speaking of relationships, the romance was nice. Well, Alistair's was. I still can't bring myself to romance anyone else, even with all the playthroughs I've done. idk man I'm weak. I cannot for the life of me pursue someone else when Alistair is right there. I swear to god, Alistair is probably my favorite romance option EVER. 

OK, good things aside, it's time for the [b]CONS[/b]. 

It's pretty old and can be unstable on newer machines. You'll have to do a bit of fiddling to get it to run smoothly. Download the 4GB patch to start with. In one area of the game, [spoiler]in Denerim[/spoiler], it WOULD NOT STOP CRASHING for me. There are lots of guides online to help you pinpoint the problem and resolve it. It can get annoying tho, ngl. 

The graphics are not pretty. The people are not pretty. The surroundings are brown and dull. [strike] You can just pretend it's because the world is very bleak at the moment so everything is so muted and not cheerful [/strike] If it really bothers you, just mod it. Mods help. Mods are great. Just mod the game, man

Combat is clunky and takes getting used to. There's some strategy involved because you are controlling your entire party and what spells or skills they'll use. You'll have to position the characters in a way that will benefit their specific strengths or you'll get your teeth kicked in by darkspawn. During combat, you [i]will[/i] be pausing multiple times to position your party members. If you don't want to be too hands-on, you can just set which behaviors you like in the tactics menu. It's daunting at first, but there are guides (again) for handling it. I've never encountered a game with combat like this before, but it's not bad after you get the hang of it.

1) You may experience crashing issues related to a memory leak. Either lower your graphics setting completely, or read about this fix which as worked for me on with multiple computers and specs: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451 

2) Soldiers Keep DLC one of the critical NPCs may get stuck and the event won't trigger. If this happens, you can exit the area and come back in to trigger the cutscene again. When the cutscene ends, immediately hit the escape key until the menu pops up and the NPC should path correctly. 

Outstanding bugs aside, I honestly think this game aged pretty well. The story is masterfully told and the gameplay mechanics are stellar. This is a game where your choices matter. I mean, really matter in a gameplay altering way and not just different dialogue choices. You have classic moral dilemmas that lead to different outcomes. 

There are three races, four, classes, different backgrounds depending on your choices, and each class even has unlockable specializations depending on your choices in game. There is a lot of room to build your character how you want to play them. 

My largest personal criticism for this title is you cannot re-specialize. I say personal because I don't think this is necessarily a fault of the game, just a preference. I'm not a blind player and don't often give games a second play-through, so I get gripy when I come across new information down the road that I can't capitalize on because of other choices I made in the game. If you are a completely blind player and enjoy replayability, this criticism becomes a strength because you will be looking forward to a second play through at a harder difficulty probably.

If you haven't played Dragon Age: Origins, give this game a chance is all I have to say. If you like classic RPGs, this game is next level.",1592219431,1668781819,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Bioware's classic 2000s games were better for the story and RPG options than for the actual mechanics/gameplay, but DA:0 (2009) is a worse game than KOTOR (2003) or ME (2007), or just as dated as Jade Empire (2005, nearly forgotten).

The AI of your party is abysmal, the game is NOT EASY on Easy and your attacks don't make that much damage, which CAN AND WILL be a problem when you're surrounded by 8 enemies. Having a lot of healing potions around is just as important as good weapons/armour.

I wanted to go ahead and get that disclaimer out of the way from the start. This game is a special kind of terrible PC port, and it's not just because of it's age. You don't get the kind of error messages from this game from just age, I imagine the code for this stinks to high heaven and is held together with chicken wire and duct tape. I still managed to get through this game, and honestly I still feel like it's worth it, but it's pretty much guaranteed you're going to be playing this at 10 minute increments between crashes.

ALL OF THAT SAID, this is an excellent game, with fantastic DLC. The story is great, with all the different choices that impact the story, interaction between your character(as in, backstory, class, skills, etc) and the world, and amazingly written companions. The missions and conversations with them are very fun and makes you want to spend time with each one.

The combat is... ok. I wouldn't say it's bad, in fact alot of the time I had fun. But when it came to tougher fights, I found myself having to micromanage the absolute crap out of all my characters, pausing every three seconds like the world's most boring DnD fight. I'm not just saying that, it's quite litterally like telling your DM blankly that you ""hit the guy with your sword"" and all he does is plainly reply back how much damage you did to which you immediately follow up with another straight forward command, continuing this cycle for about 30 minutes. 

However, again, this is only the case for tougher fights. And the main draw is the story and companions, which this game hits right out of the park. This is definitely recommended! Just, again, not on PC if you can help it...",1667378364,1667378364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition is the first installment in BioWare's original fantasy series. It is an RPG in the oldest form, so over time it can be said that it has become quite unpleasant to play. The very concept of the world is a combination of Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones, which creates a really great combination of an epic adventure with the dark realities of living in the medieval world.
[h1]The Plot[/h1]
Even though this game hasn't aged too well, the storyline is brilliant, and should be an example for any role-playing game. Over the course of the game, the story pushes us to different, very original locations, so you can not complain about the lack of diversity. The side quests may not be very interesting, they are mainly the typical ""go there, get me something"", but this is compensated by the main quests, which are very long and interestingly structured, there is no thread that would repeat itself twice. The world is quite alive, in cities there are many characters who, although not very mobile, give the illusion of a living world. Speaking of the main characters, they are written well, each of them has something interesting to say. This is a BioWare game after all, in their games the relationship with your companions is always the best element in my opinion. Our adventure is summed up in the epilogue, where I finally saw the scale of our decisions. We can even be a complete prick, and the game even allows us to murder all our companions if we piss them off. And the best option for this game is creating your own character, and basically the moment where you choose your social status/race. For each status/race, there is a separate prologue that lasts an hour or so, and it will be remembered later by the characters. There are 6 of these original prologues, so this is a reason to complete the game at least 6 times to see every possible option. The canonical choice here is a human noble.
[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Camera work is okay, but it is typical panning by holding down the right mouse button, which can be quite unpleasant in crisis situations (at least you can pause the game with the spacebar to give commands). The fight itself is a typical skill clicking and watching your character execute commands. This is okay for smaller skirmishes, but as time goes on and the difficulty increases, it gets quite tiring. Moving on to the dialogues, here our hero does not speak, which although gives greater selection for dialogue options, looking at the face of our hero who is staring somewhere into the abyss for most of the game is quite uncomfortable. It does not help that the interface is quite small, and although it is somewhat readable, sometimes you have to fumble around to find the thing you want. Scaling of the difficultie is completely fucked up in my opinion. In some moments it is too easy, and suddenly everything becomes incredibly difficult. The easiest difficulty level is equivalent to the high difficulty level for today's games. And I must admit that I am feel stupid to say that, but it seems that this game is too long. My main point is that there are a lot of locations, a ton of shitty side-quests, and there is a lot of additional smaller spaces to visit ( the navigation is also slow ). In unpopulated locations, we have a trend where most of the spaces are empty areas full of enemies, and basically for a few hours we run around from one field to another murdering hordes of the same enemies, which in the end does not give us anything. I really doubted if I wanted to continue playing when the game asked me to clear a huge underground location full of enemies for the third time in a row.
[h1]Bonus Content[/h1]
As a DLC, we have access to 5 story expansions. These are basically just short (but very interesting and well done) stories about little side adventures.
[h1]Technical Matters[/h1]
Apart from brilliant music, good animations and a great job done by the voice actors, the game works tragically. Random drops in FPS kill some great moments, and the game crashes to the desktop from time to time, sometimes even to the point where the game's save cannot be loaded. And if anyone wonders why this is so, it's because the game's old graphics engine can't cope with newer processors. So in order to overcome or even remove the problem, you need to lower the graphic settings as low as possible. And while it makes the game experience more stable, the game itself gets incredibly shitty in appearance after such changes.
[h1]Summary[/h1]
Incredible game that didn't survive the fight against time. In my opinion, this is a game that just needs to be remastered to be available to more players. I recommend the game, but be warned, be prepared to get frustrated often.

[i]Spoilers ahead. Big ones will be marked; read at your own risk.[/i]

Dragon Age: Origins is the first of (currently) three fantasy RPG games in the Dragon Age series. It is a mostly decision-based game where your choices change the path of the story for better or worse. You play as a Grey Warden put in a rather precarious position after a critical battle, fighting against monsters in the traditional and not-so traditional sense. Become an elf, dwarf, or human, a warrior, rogue, or mage, and see the chaos ensue.

[b]GAME PLAY SUMMARY:[/b] DA:O is a third-person game with a fairly easy combat system, an incredible conversation/dialogue set-up, crafting, puzzles, and more.

[b]COMBAT:[/b] While DA:O is a fantastic game, the combat is pretty simple. Depending on the character you play as, you may be using magic or physical weapons to fight against your enemies. You press a button (or a key if you have it set up) to use a skill, and you go through the battle. While it can be more strategic (there is the ability to put down traps, use poisons, etc.), it's overall unimpressive and not the focus of the game. If I'm being entirely honest, I usually play the game on Easy mode because the combat is so time-consuming, and is hardly the focus of the game. It's not really worth trying to play it on Nightmare mode unless you want bragging rights, in my opinion.

[b]DIALOGUE:[/b] The best part of the game, and what makes it stand out the [i]best[/i] from the other two games at this time. Not only do you have a wide variety of options to select when conversing with companions and NPCs, but depending on your character set-up (origin, class, skills, etc.), you even get different things you can say based on [i]that.[/i] Besides that, depending on the decisions you make during the game, your dialogue options will continue to change and morph. And the great thing about it that Bioware did [i]spectacularly[/i] with this game that they didn't really with the others? Your decisions [i]actually matter.[/i] If you decide to kill that individual? People react to that! If you decide to go to one location first and then another? People react to that! There's so many different paths you can take with your character and their conversations, and I could spend hours talking about it.

[b]CRAFTING:[/b] You can craft different items/potions/runes/etc. in the game. I personally am not a fan of crafting, but that is my personal preference. Usually, to craft something, you have to talk to one of the merchants in game, but things like potions/poisons/traps, depending on how you set up your character, can actually be made without help. You just need to collect the items... which, depending, can be a pain.

[b]PUZZLES:[/b] There are a few times throughout the game where puzzles pop up, and they can be rather thought-provoking and time consuming. There are riddles, puzzles where you move things, puzzles where you move characters, and more.

[b]GAME CONTROLS:[/b] It is best to play with an exterior mouse and your keyboard. The game, due to its age, doesn't have controller capability, but it can be modded in. Overall, once you've got the hang of it, it's pretty simple to play.

[b]CHARACTERS:[/b] Every single character feels rich and deep with personality. Your companions that you meet are complex and [i]all of them[/i] (I mean [i][b]all of them)[/b][/i] have more than meets the eye. Most NPCs are memorable in some way or another.

[b]DIFFICULTY:[/b] The game itself isn't that challenging. There are a few battles that can be hard, but they can usually be avoided. The difficulty really lies in getting the outcome you desire.

[b]GRAPHICS:[/b] Considering the game's age? They're actually pretty good. If you don't like them, however, the modding community for this game is insane and active, and you'll [i]definitely[/i] be able to find something you like.

[b]GAME LENGTH:[/b] The game can be pretty short... if you decide not to pick up much, go to the different locations, talk to people, do side quests, etc. However, it is best to try and do as much as you can when playing, and that can take several hours/days to do.

[b]REPLAY VALUE:[/b] Through the roof. There's so many different ways to play this game, and you can always discover something new as a different character.

[b]NAVIGATION:[/b] Can be straight-forward at times. You usually go to a specific area and then are there completing the main quest for it and the side quests you can find. The game has a map to help you navigate if you get lost, but that doesn't always stop you from doing so. [spoiler]Let's not talk about the Fade. Screw the Fade. Or the Deep Roads. They also suck.[/spoiler]

[b]SOUND:[/B] Great music! Creates a great atmosphere. The voice-acting in this game is incredible-- you may recognize some famous voices such as Tim Curry (Rocky Horror Picture Show, Clue, etc.), Claudia Black (Farscape, Uncharted, Mass Effect, etc.), and Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop, X-Men animated series/games, etc.) among many other talented voice actors. Sound effects are also pretty awesome and can leave you unnerved at times. There have been a few times where I have stopped in my tracks due to a rather loud growl under the realization that I might be about to fight a dragon.

[b]STORY:[/b] Incredibly engaging and keeps you in your seat. The story is the true heart of Dragon Age, and well written.

[b]WHY ULTIMATE EDITION?:[/b] The Ultimate Edition of DA:O has all the DLC (minus a few things that came with specific consoles, time periods, etc. from years ago) you can get, and it's worth every penny. The DLC included: Dragon Age: Awakening (post main game campaign), The Stone Prisoner (companion), Warden's Keep (location), Return to Ostagar (location), Feastday Gifts/Pranks (items), The Darkspawn Chronicles (what-if campaign), Leliana's Song (companion campaign), The Golems of Amgarrak (campaign), and Witch Hunt (post main game campaign). That's [i]a lot.[/i] While the main game itself is fantastic and is playable without all of this, the DLC brings so much more to it.

[b]THE MODDING COMMUNITY:[/b] Dragon Age: Origins (and the Dragon Age saga in general) has an incredible (and incredibly large) fanbase of modders. After Bioware stopped working on this game, modders decided to pick up the slack and create bug fixes, remasters, new features, and more. It's highly recommended you play with mods for a true Dragon Age experience (at least, get the bug fix one. The others can wait until you finish playing for the first time).

[i]In summary......[/i]

Dragon Age: Origins has won several game awards for a reason. It's still a spectacular game in 2022, and it will remain so for years to come. If you love fantasy RPGs, games where your decisions matter, fun customizations, good stories, and more, look no further.

the world of gaming would not exist as we know it without Dragon Age: Origins.

the bugs make it borderline unplayable at times, but this is a classic for a goddamn reason, and the bugs can easily be patched with mods. it borrows from the devs' history of Baldur's Gate and you can feel the influence of D&D resonate through the whole thing -- it began a movement in video games for choice-heavy narratives and close parasocial relationships forged through walking through the fire with a found family in a digital world. bioware have also been LGBT allies from the start, featuring one of the first gay romance plotlines ever in the RPG scene. 

even if you aren't all that into video games, casual mode will allow for even the least savvy of players to take their joinings and slay gods. it is not, however, a game I would recommend sharing with your parents, because old animations plus at times raunchy humor and truly horrifying beasts may make some people clutch their pearls.",1665788957,1665788957,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Another community member I saw on a thread somewhere had the idea of doing a canon ""Nightmare"" play-through, through each of the Dragon Age games.

I'm a huge fan of fantasy settings like this, and by playing through all the games, I'd hoped to get a better perspective of the world of Thedas.

Suffice to say, this game is PACKED with lore that I wouldn't have known otherwise. It makes Origins shine, but its a bit of a detriment to the other games, now that I think on it. It's hard to get into the world as a new player, especially since the game is dated now.

The story of the Grey Wardens is as captivating as ever, and the individual Origin stories of each character are addicting to see play out. This game introduced me to Bioware as a company, and replaying it has shown me that it's still a special game. Graphically the game is a bit dated now, but that’s not a huge deal to me. The game can also be easily improved with online fan patches.

My only real complaint on replaying it has been the combat. It’s relatively simple and gets very repetitive by the end of the game. That being said, the story and characters are easily the best part of DA:O. The rag tag group of characters that follow you are always amusing to listen to, they’re all very varied in how they act and respond to your actions and words. It's a very character driven story.

Ultimate Edition also comes with a bunch of extra DLC, most of which is pretty good. But the real star of the show is the expansion, Awakening, which adds a whole new campaign totalling 15-20 hours on to the end of the game. This edition is worth it for this alone, but the extra DLC is a great bonus. This game is still worth experiencing in 2022 and beyond, the game is that good for those looking for a more accessible CRPG.

The story takes place in the world of Thedas, in the province of Ferelden. In the years past, monsters known as the darkspawn would emerge from underground and mount an assault on the surface population. These assaults were triggered by a rise of a tainted dragon, an Archdemon, who would lead the attack on human, dwarf and elf population alike. Wars that ensured were called Blights, and you find yourself at the beginning of one such Blight. You are a member of the Gray Wardens, a special force designed solely for battling darkspawn.
It is immediately clear that a lot of money and effort went into this game. The graphics are amazing for a game that's over a decade old and every line of text is beautifully voice-acted. Sidequests are abundant and bits of lore jump out of every nook and cranny. The story is breathtaking and is deeply affected by the choices you make throughout your adventure. As for the characters, this is where DA:O really shines. The number of companions, their dialogue interactions, as well as their combat synergies, are all top-notch. Character development was also done nicely, with tons of abilities that offer numerous viable builds. With Ultimate Edition, the game features several smaller stand-alone campaigns, which are refreshing and nice.
So what's keeping Dragon Age: Origins from being a perfect RPG? Technical issues. On modern systems, the game is plagued by graphical glitches and constant crashing. This can be remedied by a couple of mods that you'll find easily in the Steam guides section. Camera is slightly broken when indoors, but it's not tragic like in some games. Since I'm already talking about the bad sides, I also have to mention that Awakening (the largest of the stand-alone DLC campaigns) is ridiculously easy - I was playing on nightmare but it felt like 'story mode'. Everything else in the game is fine though.

Dragon Age: Origins is rightfully considered one of the greats. A true classic that set new standards for modern RPGs.

As for this game, I loved getting to know the events that led into Inquisition (which I played first) and experiencing a different side of things in Thedas. The story is 10/10 for me, as I was hooked from my first playthrough. I can really attest to a mage playthrough (that's really my favorite to play for this series since it's such an oddity to be a ""freeroaming"" mage in Thedas), and it is certainly rudimentary in terms of the play-style (not in a bad way at all considering when the game came out, and the same can be said for the small amounts of time I played the other classes). The graphics are okay (again, its age) and the world has set paths for you to walk, so it's relatively easy to find where you need to go. There's not a single thing about the game itself that I dislike, and one of my favorite components to an RPG is the ability to have your choices effect the ending. In terms of a mechanic (I believe this counts as that, newer to gaming so I'm still learning bits and pieces) I dislike, though, is the jumps in difficulty based on the chosen setting. There's definitely a noticeable difference between each setting, and it can be a slap in the face if you're not prepared for it. I've never had a game have a ""Setting A"" feel significantly easier than a ""Setting B"" that's the one-up from there.

I'm sure there are many more things i left out and many of you are now convinced to NOT get this game. But let me assure you, my recommendation isn't a joke but an actual recommendation made with sincerity. This game is fantastic despite the flaws caused by its age and its sequels don't do it, nor the world of Thedas, true justice. Origins is dark, gritty, unique, and is something I wish i could re-experience for the first time again. It is a shame that the easiest way to play this game is on consoles given they don't have almost any of the issues you'll be presented with on PC but they don't have mods and no, mods are not quintessential to enjoy this game but they will certainly make it look better. This game is worth playing for the Origin system alone in my opinion if for no other reason then to lament on the fact almost no other RPG really does a background for your character as well as this game, if they even have a ""background""  tab for your character at all. So I urge you to get it, push through the problems and look past them. Origins was/is one of the best RPGs ever and its unfortunate decline caused by modern hardware and Bioware's lack of foresight at the time of development shouldn't degrade how good the game actually is beneath the hassle.",1638504611,1664839952,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Ive played Dragon Age Origins for the first time after i played da 2 and da inquisition and played origins after hearing a lot of praise from all sides for it. Do i think it lives up to it? Yes and no. The story and the characters are memorable and especially the dialouge between party members on your adventures wich i consider the best out of all bioware games ( looking at you morigan, alister and Halfmetertank (my dog)). I can set my own Atributes and Skills of wich there are a lot, as well as equipment for all party members. The game doesnt take you by the hand and lets you play as you wish.

And now where the cracks of an older game start to show in my opinion: The graphics are bad compared to inquisition and the combat lacks the impact of a da 2. While it is good that the game doesnt take you by the hand, there are things that could be made clearer in my opinion. For example i played a mage and only mid campaign realised that you can combine spells. Sure it was probably stated somewhere but a tooltip explaining it in my skill window wouldve been nice. There are certain areas a lot harder then others wich could be made a bit clearer and the difficulty spiked to ludicrious hights and some points (might have been cause i played on nightmare cant say for sure).

Overall i enjoyed my experience with the game and all the dlcs wich reminds me again how much content you had in a lot of games pre live service era. I especially loved the parts where i knew a hefty fight was coming and i checked equipment of my party, healed wounds, considered tactics and took stock of my consumables. Or the times where i had to consider if casting a spell that could clear a room of minions but left my mage unable to cast much on the boss was worth it. The story arcs of the characters and the influence i had over them gave me the feeling of being part of a story wich i didnt have for a long time in games. 

Would i recommend it? If you can find at least some enjoyment in the gameplay and are interested in the story then yes. If youve seen the gameplay and dont like it but would like to play for the story i wouldnt recommend it due to the gameplay being very drawn out at times.",1664669217,1664669217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead lets talk about the best thing this game has done for all the fans of the franchise no matter what game you started on.

I bought this game on steam thinking I wanted to revisit the fond memories I have playing this game . However, the game is actually almost unplayable. Once you get Morrigan in the party, you have an extremely high chance of crashing if she uses winters grasp. Occasionally your character levels up, it crashes. A cutscene has a 60% chance of crashing in my experience. Random crashes are unpredictable, and there are no updates made at all to fix this. Some folks mod the ever living crap out of this thing and it still doesn't eliminate even most of the crashes. Steam should honestly take this game off the store page, its an absolute rip off for its nearly unplayable state. I ignored the reviews listing several of these same details I have given, and I am regretting my decision to try to push through this game in spite of it. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME ON STEAM YOU WILL NOT FINISH IT, YOU'LL BE LUCKY TO MAKE IT OUT OF LOTHERING SOMETIMES, BUT YOU WILL GET STOPPED SOMEWHERE ELSE BY GAME BREAKING BUGS.

I played this about 7-8 years ago and really enjoyed it. I'm a sucker for bioware rpgs. Playing this now though and the age starts to show badly. Some of the jank in this game gets to be to much. The difficulty spikes are really random and sometimes can trap you with no time to save. The combat itself is also very slow compared to more recent crpgs. Also as most players will tell you the fade sections are suck a drag and kill the pacing. The characters are decent but I remember the cast of Dragon Age 2 way more fondly.

So why a positive review? It's quite a expansive game and has a lot of love in it. The relationships with characters and the story itself are so well written. It feels like the next step from kotor writing wise. Playing a mage can be fun (emphasis on can) and I think the dlc rollout is awesome (so many expansions) even though over half of them have to be accessed outside of the main game.

Imagine being a super old game, but still, having great voice over character dialogue, [u]meaningful conversation choices that can completely change the outcome of some situations[/u], [spoiler] possibility to have romantic interactions and relations even with the same gender if that's your thing [/spoiler], many customisation options (just the amount of facial custom at the creation of your character, puts 95% of the games with this kind of option to shame) and crafting.

[h1] Bad things [/h1]

Since it's a super old game, there are many setups that will not work so well and the game will probably have crash issues. For that I suggest lowering some of the graphics inside the game and also following some of the steps in the help section here.

I had an issue were my game would occasionally crash on random moments or during a cut-scene. The game was so good that i pressed through almost all of the main campaign just spamming Quick Save and [strike]praying to the Maker[/strike]. After reaching a point where I couldn't push through, the forums here helped me set the affinity for only one CPU and after that I also took the graphics down a notch, it never crashed again. ([i]I still kept spamming Quick Save every time cause, yeah, you cannot imagine the amount of PTSD some crashes gave me[/u]).

[h1] Result: Epic, 10/10, so go PEW PEW Dragons and [spoiler]bang the bard[/spoiler].[/h1]",1663829113,1663829541,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Others have already mentioned so much of this game, that I’m just focusing on one single aspect that makes this game stand out:
The dialogue system. 
In the Mass Effect games and in the other Dragon Age games, you always see the outcome of a specific dialogue choice by hovering over it with the mouse. You have the blue positive-paragon guy in the top right, who wants to make love with the other crewmates/companions, you have the neutral/funny one in the middle and you have the red renegade/evil/cruel guy in the bottom right and then you have neutral information on the left. Always. That’s boring and makes you care less about the context of the actual dialogue.

In DA: Origins on the other hand you have a simple list of dialogue options that never tell you what’s the paragon and what’s the renegade option just by where they are on the screen. You have to read it for yourself, interpret it and think about it. That makes you care for the whole dialogue much more, especially in the romances. When I was dating Leliana, I couldn’t just always choose the first option on the top of the list, no. It was a really hard riddle, to get to the correct dialogue options with her, until she opens up more and more and lets you get to know her more intimate side. Of course there are easier compaions like Morrigan, who can be easily persuaded by some gifts, until she is ready to sleep with you, but Leliana alone makes the romances much more challenging and entertaining. That’s more than any Mass Effect character has in his/her dialogue.",1656720984,1663685747,True,13,1,0.605159461498260498,0,True,False,False

Masterpiece.

Perfect balance between strategy and action in combat. You can either play it as if it were Skyrim, charging into enemies, using your skills and receiving help from your companions, or as if it were XCOM, pausing to analyze the battle and then giving orders to your party (of course, these choices of playstyle will be limited by the difficulty you select).

The story is deep and complex. Companions's personalities put a lot of social and moral pressure on the player. The game makes it seem like it has endless possibilities of dialogue and different endings. Even the smallest detail like giving a coin to a poor elf in the Elven Alienage offers you a little plotline that has zero relevance, but it has different reactions for you to choose. It gives you this constant feeling that the game is responding to every action of yours, no matter how insignificant it is.

Long story short, the world feels alive, its characters feels like living people and the battle feels like a battle.
If you like RPGs and/or strategy games, you'll love it.

Masterpiece.

Obra-prima.

Esse jogo envelheceu como vinho. Equilíbrio perfeito entre estratégia e ação no combate. Você pode tanto jogar como se fosse Skyrim, voando nos inimigos usando suas skills e recebendo ajuda dos companheiros, quanto como se fosse XCOM, pausando para analisar a batalha e então dando ordens específicas para cada membro do grupo (claro, essas escolhas de gameplay são limitadas pela dificuldade que você seleciona).

O enredo é profundo e complexo. As personalidades dos companheiros colocam uma enorme pressão social e moral no jogador. O jogo faz parecer como se houvesse infinitas possibilidades de diálogo e finais diferentes. Até os menores detalhes como dar uma esmola para um elfo pobre na Elven Alienage oferece uma pequena historinha que não tem nenhuma relevância, mas possui diferentes reações para você escolher. Ele dá um sentimento constante de que o jogo está respondendo a cada ação sua, não importa o quão insignificante seja.

Em suma, o mundo parece vivo, os personagens parecem pessoas reais e a batalha parece uma batalha.
Se você gosta de RPGs e/ou jogos de estratégia, você vai amar.

The races/classes aren't as plentiful as they are in DnD, but you have the basic human/elves/dwarfs thing going on, and the basic warrior/mage/whatever going on. Overall, totally worth it. If you don't like the price of it, you can wait until it goes on sale, but I'd say $30 isn't too bad if you're buying this on its own and not buying a ton of games at once (trust me, the more you buy at once, the more the money adds up and it can get extremely expensive; the struggle is real >_<). 

I'll be honest, the story-line is alright, and it's by far not my absolute favorite, but I wouldn't say the story is bad either. It does have a lot of it though. As advertised, it really is story-line rich. I think the reason why the story isn't my favorite though is because I generally just don't have a great habit of following story-lines, but I do try to. So while it's not my absolute favorite, I would say I really like it as much as I can even keep up with and pay attention to it before I get totally distracted by just killing things (ADHD/ADD gang if you know you know). But overall, I'd say it's a really great game, and if you wanna play it on another platform, they have it for xbox360 as well. I'm unsure about the other platforms they might or might not have it for, but I'm mostly a PC gamer, since I kinda live on my PC, so yknow, that's why I bought it for steam instead of continuing to play it on the 360. (Tbf, I got the game at Goodwill for 360 pretty cheap and had no idea what it was so I wanted to try it and I did and I really liked it and turned out they had it on steam so it was pretty great)


P.s.
My only sad moment is that it isn't multiplayer, but that's about it honestly. Aside from the fact that there could be a lot more classes.

The storytelling is definitely, for me one of two major strongpoints of this game.  The other point are the conversations you can have with the people around you. Not only do you learn alot about the characters, but you get to form relationships with them, that go so much further than in almost every other game. On top of that, you are getting a real sense that your decisions matter and that they change the overall outcome of it. That means that the game has alot of replayability, because there are different outcomes to many quests, not to mention many different outcomes for the main quest and quite a few different starting options. There is alot of character customisation aswell, when it comes to combat and fighting style. The combat system is very deep and requires alot of attention. It plays almost like a strategy game, rather than a modern action game, which may be why I never completely got to grips with it. 

Pros:
+ amazing storytelling
+ intricate and complex characters 
+ possibility to form any kind of relationship with your companions
+ very good writing, not only for the story, but for the conversations in general
+ alot of decisions, that at least give a very compelling illusion of choice
+ many ways to customize your character 

Cons:
- graphics obviously not up to todays standard (still pretty good for such an old game)
- battle system requires a bit too much attention for my liking 
- the game doesn't always seem very well balanced (it does overall, but here and there you have all of a sudden a very hard encounter in a dungeon, but then the last and supposedly hardest enemy in the dungeon is a cakewalk)
- not the best autosave system (found myself either dying and then replaying 2 hours or savespamming alot)

This was the first game I ever bought for myself and it has remained something comforting for years and years. 

Great dialogue, combat (if you like that baldurs gate style), and characters that stick with you for a long time. 

On a sentimental note this game got me through tough times with tough parents and Im mostly writing this review because out of all the games in my library it feels bad not giving this game its due. 

I had a lot of difficulty getting it to work on windows 10 but after much googling and mod downloads its even better than it used to be, and I get to put on ultra graphics like a real gamer. It took me a solid week of tuning to get this game working how I wanted it to- I see a lot of comments about this, and I still experience bugs sometimes, but its worth it and I def advise buying this and making this work. THIS IS NOT A GAME YOU SIMPLY PLUG AND PLAY. There's quite a bit of work you have to do to make it work right if you're doing it on desktop- on laptop it's a little easier but mods are...*chef's kiss*

Personally, this game means the world to me. It's weird writing this down 10+ years later but through every pitfall and period of stress Dragon Age Origins has always been around to help me escape for a little while.

My only complaint is that the game does tend to crash somewhat frequently, and when I try to reload my last save, it crashes again, and again, and again. I played with the graphics settings a bit and haven't had as much of an issue since then, so it's manageable.

I played this for the first time in 2018, a long time after it was released to near universal acclaim. I have none of the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia that a lot of people seem to have (which is totally fine, I just don’t have that to enhance my opinion of the game) and without that lens to look through all I can say is this game is old. It plays like a game from 2007, and it was released in 2010. It isn’t exactly bad, it is just super dated and not fun from a modern perspective. 

The combat system of commanding yourself and your chosen allies is a neat idea, but the managing of these characters and abilities was simply not fun for me. That and the random difficulty spikes seemingly out of nowhere, and the lackluster companion relationship system (give gift x 100 = love) frustrated me. I also had significant crashes, though this is likely due to the PC port. I attempted to play the Morrigan DLC but I get consistent crashes about 20 minutes in and cannot progress. 

The good about this game is the story and characters themselves. It’s a solid story, this is BioWare at the height of their glory. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is thoughtful and even heartfelt, and the main story is engaging. Unfortunately for me the good was undercut by so much mediocre (to downright unplayability) that I can’t recommend it to anyone playing for the first time.

You can play as a hero who can do no wrong and always works to saving everyone... Or you can be an absolutely psychotic bastard who relentlessly slaughters people at any opportunity and can completely refuse to save certain people, or even completely make already bad situations worse by taking advantage of the situation and going the easy/lazy and/or most profitable path, completely screwing everyone other than yourself over. The character designer also has the most meaningful character design in any game you will play, as depending on your character, you will be able to experience up to 6 game starts (origins) which establishes how you get tied into the main plot and can decide future quests, encounters, or how characters will address your character.

However there are some issues you will more than likely come across. For one; the game on steam is extremely buggy and you will frequently experience crashes (about 20-30 every playthrough) so I HIGHLY ADVISE if you buy this game that you save frequently. Sometimes after a crash you may have to restart your computer or something to get the game to not crash upon loading a save. I noticed if you tab out, you are more likely to encounter graphical glitches which inevitably seem to lead to crashes. However, these are the most I have experienced, it is quite annoying but the game is still good despite this.

Story: Classic high-fantasy adventure with a dark tinge. Several clearly significant choices, but also some choices that feel forced or too vague to mean anything. There are some unnecessarily edgy details, as well as unneeded fantasy misogyny. There is also fantasy racism, but they explore the ways that racism is enabled by religion and politics, and so it is insightful enough to not be a waste.

Companions: Truly beautiful, when they are done well. The best-written ones were Alistair, Morrigan, and Leliana. They react to both your dialogue and choices as you progress, and can even be persuaded to change their opinions (within reason). There is development, but it is more clear for some characters than others--and some characters do not truly feel like they are developing outside of their conversations with the player. Still, well-done overall.

Combat: Fun. Real-time with pause, along with the option to toggle between overhead view and third-person combat. Slightly clunky compared to more recent titles, but still feels satisfying when you see your character rip into darkspawn, ogres, and dragons with special animations for the killing blow. I feel like every character, from mages to rogues to two-handed warriors and sword-and-board knights, had a clear use.

[h1]Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Review[/h1]
Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition is an RPG developed by Bioware and Published by EA on October 2010, Dragon age: Origins provides an amazing RPG experience, the story in the dragon age is gripping with multiple choices to make during the gameplay which affects outcomes of the game throughout.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Bioware's homage to its own legacy (namely Baldur's Gate and NWN), Dragon Age is an RPG with excellent mechanics and equally deep world-building. If you enjoy the gameplay of the games like Baldur’s Gate, there's a good chance you'll get your money and time's worth in Dragon Age: Origins, This quite an extensive game after all, a single playthrough that can take up to 50-80 hours or more depending upon your play style. The combat is tactical and often brutal, with even small mistakes spelling out your party's end. Some micromanagement is required, but there's a surprisingly robust tactics sheet that you can adjust to your liking for each character in your party. Speaking of characters, Bioware really hit it out of the park here. The cast is very memorable and includes a sultry but mean-spirited sorceress, and the mandatory alcoholic dwarf, among others. Adding some spice to the mix is of course your prerogative, as you can create your character with their own unique background that actually determines the starting location of the game-a feature seldom found elsewhere. Dragon Age: Origins is a dark fantasy, and it likes to remind you of that often, and many times in less than subtle ways

[h1]The World[/h1]
The world building itself is quite excellent. Dragon Age: Origins-Ultimate edition includes all the DLC’s that were released later through. The combat is a live action with a pause system to queue up abilities if you choose to (if you play on a higher difficulty you will be pausing a lot). Leveling up will feel familiar to anyone who's played an RPG before, pick stats to raise and then pick talents at each level. Overall the game play is challenging but very easy to get into especially for an RPG. Graphics and sound both hold up great. There's no need to mod the game it's great as is, however there are graphic and some small gameplay mods if you're interested. This isn't one of those old games that you boot up and instantly notice how dated it looks, dragon age visually and mechanically holds up.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you haven't played this game you are missing out big time, it’s easy to get into with no overwhelming mechanics and one of the best stories in a game in my opinion. Bang for your buck is incredible, dragon age will keep you entertained for quite long time. Dragon Age: Origins-Ultimate edition is an amazing game that provides a lot of fun gameplay elements, you could easily sink a couple hundred hours in this game.

Before you get angry about me saying this, I would like you to know, that unlike most I have not played any video games through my childhood, and I have only started playing video games as an adult. I do believe that it was a fantastic concept, and a good game when it has come out, but much like the first Witcher game, it is due for a remake. 
The story itself is quite good, and I can see the inspiration this game have given to Mass Effect 2, for which I will keep this game in high regards no matter what. This game is somewhat of an amalgamation of Mass effect 2 and 3 with high fantasy elements, since the main story is about you gathering allies against the Blight. The Blight has not established itself as much of a threat in this game as the Reapers were in Mass Effect. Which game is better? I could not rightfully say, granted I like Sci-fi a bit more, therefore I am a bit more lenient towards Mass effect, though Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games, so I am not against this genre either.
My point is that, whilst the story, and music is good, and the graphics are alright, the game suffers from what most games from this era suffer, which is: being an outdated game , with an amazing story and soundtrack, but an outdated gameplay, much like the Witcher 1. In certain cases (e.g.: Resident Evil 4) this clunkiness gives to the enjoyability of the game (additional horror elements from you being a little less responsive than you would prefer), but in most cases it holds back the game itself.
I do not by any means mean to say that Dragon Age Origins is a bad game (I liked Mass effect more, but that is my preference), however it certainly could use some improvements. 
First and foremost, I disliked the level gating system. basically the game lets you run blind into the different story missions. without knowing whether you are prepared, or not, to go through. The main questline is meant to be completed by a certain route which is not made clear at the beginning, therefore I have ended up doing the Redcliffe and Dailish story missions sooner than for example the circle of Magi questline, which was of course the wrong order, and therefore the latter was really easy, whilst the former missions were much harder. I would recommend you look up a guide on the internet about the suggested route through which you are meant to complete the main missions.
Much like mass effect I would suggest going with any sort of character archetype but simple human noble, since much like in case of the soldier class in Mass Effect, you will miss out on the cooler abilities, and some essential ones as well (heal, revive, and crowd control spells)
The Denerim parts of the story were annoying, since the game would constantly CTD on higher graphics settings, even though I have a powerful gaming rig. The solution for this issue is to set your graphics to low.
The game itself is I believe worth it, since it is not that expensive, and it is quite good, but if you do not get used to the combat system, fighting enemies - especially hordes of enemies - will become somewhat tedious.

The tons of voiced reactions and banter is astonishing notably.  For example, once you change a situation in an area, the citizens all have adapted voiced reactions.  Each companion has many dialogues as you improve the relationship/trust.  They put a lot of love/work into this game. 

[b]If you like CRPG/RPG, I see no reason why you would not enjoy it.[/b] 

Combat : since I played a mage, I had fun, as you have many options and flexibility.  The system is flexible and you can turn your mage in a melee warrior if you wish. 

[h3]Time and content :[/h3] 
How long the main campaign takes varies of course. If you read all the lore and search for everything, and do all companion quests, it can take over 100 hours.  If you do not read everything or if you hurry, you can finish the main campaign much faster (polls show about 50 hours). 

BUT there are expansions (notably [i]Awakening[/i], and more), and also mini-stories added that are meant to be played after the main game. 

[h3]Difficulty:[/h3]
I played on Hard difficulty, which was perfect for me, as I like using tactics, micro-managing actions in combat, etc.  It was sometimes tough !  There is a harder difficulty setting called Nightmare, but I feel Hard is perfect. 

[h3]Visuals improvements :[/h3]
Ps : I played with many mods that improve textures and graphics (see Nexus mods site).  It is super easy to use mods in this game (you just drop your texture mods in the override folder*).  

- I recommend the mod [i]DAO Better Lighting[/i], as it makes all colors more realistic, less bright (that mod has a specific installation method). 

Nexus mods : also install [i]Qwinn's Ultimate DAO Fixpack[/i] which fixes tons of bugs, big and small.

One thing I can say is that is this is one of the hardest RPGs I've ever finished.
This game will punish you for not playing things smart and avoiding most of the side content in the longrun as you will want to do this content so you'll be appropriately leveled and well equipped for the endgame, and choose wisely who you ally with in your party, aswell choose well who you bring with you depending on the Quests some work better with particular characters abilities and talents and best to work them with you.
Unlike the console port Normal Mode on PC Has magic/AOE Friendly fire and you are intended on using the Zoomed out Isometric Camera and to Pause frequently along with using your tactics menu to organize your party to deal situations apropriately. If you so choose to play easy you won't be able to ignore the Tactics/Pausing as you will still have to do it to some degree, along with friendly fire being disabled.

Among other things the game graphically is Passable its not ugly or awful.
Combat is alright could have been better in some ways, can feel extremely jank when you're a melee build imo.

Like some old games I had to install some mods and fiddle with settings in order to get it to boot and run without constantly crashing, which isn’t a huge problem, but having to run the game on low makes an old, outdated game, look even older and more outdated.

The first thing I noticed is how awkward the controls are. Its an odd mix between top down and third person that really just does not work. The combat is also really bad and has one of the worst difficulty curves I’ve ever seen. The first several hours were extremely difficult, even on the easiest setting, and then all of a sudden the game became a breeze.

I really did try and give this game a chance, but I’ve gotten to the point where I really do not care to continue. Maybe at some point I’ll feel the urge to return and finish it, but as it stands, I do not.

TL ; DR - Play how you want to, choose any specializations you want for your character on your first playthrough(s) NOTE NOTE NOTE - GLITCH FOR LOSING ITEMS EXPLAINED FOR AWAKENING DLC AT BOTTOM OF POST. PLEASE READ THAT EXPLANATION OF THE GLITCH BEFORE PURCHASING - note - if you get the glitch in the dlc, it does NOT affect your main story before doing awakening dlc, only the awakening dlc itself.
NOTE NOTE NOTE - IF YOU WANT TO ABSOLUTELY BREAK YOUR GAME IN A GOOD WAY (BECOMING OVERPOWERED AF EARLY ON) Go watch ""The spiffing Brit's youtube video titled ""Dragon Age Origins is a perfectly balanced game"" He shows you all of the money glitches, xp glitches, and item glitches to obtain multiple of items you would normally only be able to receive 1 of. This will 'break' your game in a way that you will NOT WANT TO PLAY NORMALLY. I HIGHLY SUGGEST PLAYING THROUGH THE GAME NORMALLY BEFORE DOING THIS AS YOU WILL NOT WANT TO PLAY NORMALLY AGAIN. HE DOES SPECIFICALLY SAY THIS IN THE VIDEO TOO, AND I 100% AGREE. Play normally first, then go game breaking if you so choose.
NOTE NOTE NOTE - I do not play with mods on this game, just the base version as the mods tend to crash my game as I'm on AMD not Intel for CPU. That's just my experience with mods for this game unfortunately. BUt really, if you want a mod, there's one you need which stops the game from crashing randomly. This game does have memory leaks once in a while, so PLEASE SAVE PERIODICALLY. There are auto saves but sometimes they won't put you right where you need to be if your game crashed.
This game is very near and dear to my heart, having played well over 1000 hours on console when it it was originally released.
If you like slashing through mobs/lobbing fireballs at them/sneaking around like a rouge and getting massive damage backstabbing, then this game may very well be for you.
First things first, there is no controller support for this game, unless you use 3rd party software. However, you can either hold down your mouse button to move, or you can use WASD movement. I switch between the 2 depending on what I'm doing, although I primarily use my mouse for movement.
Warrior classes - easily some of the most fun I've had on this game just running around swinging my sword, bashing enemies with my shield. It's simple, fun and effective. One thing to keep in mind, if you do a warrior build, I HIGHLY recommend doing Templar and Champion specialties for the build. Great magic resistance by being a templar, and you can disarm mages and interrupt their spells very easily. Warriors are sadly limited to in being forced to run up to enemies though, and sometimes they'll be dead by the time you get to them.
Mage - Mage is just super fun and overall very very strong with AOE spells, namely fire spells as most enemies suffer from teh burn damage. You can be a BLOOD MAGE and that's considered very bad in the Dragon Age world. But hey, they're extremely strong, using their health as a mana pool. Does require some micro managing to an extent.
Arcane Warrior is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME BTW. Arcane Warrior is a mage specialization (like blood magic) but if you build the character right, you can solo everything and basically never ever risk dying. It's super useful if you want to play on nightmare difficulty (which is a fk you unbelievably hard difficulty lol, but very rewarding when you finally get past something giving you issues for... 3 hours) Overall, Arcane Warrior lets you be a mage, but wield melee weapons and use your magic stat as strength to wield said melee weapons. You can also wear melee armour which is what helps this build be so strong.
Rouge - Easily the most damage in the game once you make the build. Choose Bard and Assassination specializations or Bard and Duelist specializations (IIRC Duelist is more damage overall, but Assassin has good utility) But either way, you're gonna have a lot of fun. I do not recommend the ranger specialization unless you're specifically going for a ranged build using a bow/crossbow (but really really not worth it as you'll get more damage with the other 2 specializations even choosing a ranged set up with bow/crossbow)

Overall, while my favorite play style is Arcane Warrior for Nightmare difficulty, I prefer the rouge build as mentioned above. It has the absolute highest damage potential, and you can use an ability called ""Shadow"" which makes you completely invisible to enemies until you attack them. Will work on bosses as long as your other party members are alive, generally speaking. (Very useful for a boss fight early on in the beginning)

As I'm writing this review I'm actually re downloading the game onto my computer to play again. (had to replace my SSD couple months ago) 
Think I'm going to do a Dual Wield rouge with a specific weapon from defeating a boss from a DLC 'campaign' It's called the Reapers Cudgel and it has a chance to knock back enemies when you attack.

LAST THING - If you decide to buy this game and you complete the main game, there is an ""awakening' dlc which is fairly fun imho, and it lets you progress your character a bit farther. THERE IS A GLITCH IN THIS DLC THAT WAS NEVER PATCHED SO PLEASE READ THIS!!!!!!!! - Once you set off for a specific mission, please put all your stuff in storage before entering the cave going after the main bad guy in Awakening DLC. the glitch that happens makes you lsoe your armour and weapons and there is no way to get it back! It has been thought that certain items from the other DLCs )like reapers cudgel, helm of honleath, a dagger from the village on honleath will cause this glitch as the items are not supposed to be present in Awakening. This glitch MAY MAY MAY happen REGARDLESS of having those items or not. SO PLEASE AGAIN STORE ALL YOUR STUFF IN STORAGE BEFORE GOING INTO HE TUNNELS FOR THIS SPECIFIC MISSION. As it is, you will be really strong when you get to this point anyways, mainly 1-2 shotting the enemies you come across in the tunnels. that's as specific as I can get without spoiling the mission itself. Sadly I forget the name of the mission but you'll know when you get to it (the dungeon is a silver mine i think? in some woods in the dlc outside of your base for Awakening DLC. You'll have come across the bad guy already once so you'll know him when you see him before you chase him down into the mines. generally, the mission depending on how fast you are will be about 6-10 hours into the DLC",1658711313,1658711313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For a game from 2009, Dragon Age: Origins still holds up rather well. Visually, it looks dated because... well, its a 13-year-old game. That's not to say it looks awful - I like the retroness to it. The story's great and immersive. The game play is intuitive and rewarding for those who explore the different builds and classes. The voice acting is awesome and fits the characters. The music fitting and helps build the atmosphere well. And I love how my player character's decisions ACTUALLY matter plotwise to a surprising amount of extent.  Perhaps I should stop being a douche to everyone and see what being super nice gets me lol.

One big problem I'd found with playing is that the game will crash when played for an extended amount of time. On my rig, the game crashes during loading scenes when going to different maps. I notice before it crashes, there's a gradual increase in loading times. At first, maps transitions happen within 3 seconds. But after a while, it'll go up to about 10, then about 20ish, then even up to about 30. Once I hit those long loading times, my game will inevitably crash. I'm guessing there's some optimization issues going on.

Anyway, I just learned to save often just in case. It doesn't impact my experience too much since it hasn't crashed mid-fight or mid conversation. I still say this game is totally loads of fun and completely worth the purchase!",1658534848,1658534848,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Turns out, all I needed was a couple mods to appreciate the game in its entirety. While it does still show its age, the story of the game is engaging, the dialogue options clever and vast, and the characters memorable. Having so many background options for your character, with different prologues for each, also provides some interesting variety. The options for combat and specializations are also some of the most interesting in the series, I'd say. Being a warrior is actually fun, which I can't say so much about later entries.

I played mostly vanilla, with only two mods enabled-- one for better hairstyles, and one that speeds up movement and combat by 20%. That was all I needed to have a far more enjoyable experience than the last few times I tried to get into this game.

I played Dragon Age: Origins a long time ago on my Xbox, but I was never captured by the game because of my young age and inexperience with similar games. Dragon Age is a very special and unique game after all, a combination of old school RPG mechanics with a bit of a ""modern"" twist, rather than what I was used to (Bethesda RPG's like Oblivion).

But after coming back after almost a decade (this time on the PC), I fell in love with the storytelling and brilliant multi-choice dialog. Actually making me feel like I have a voice in the world. The combat however was still a bit hard to get used to. Actually a bit more than a bit, after repeatedly dying to an undead Revenant in the Redcliffe Castle Courtyard, I'd had enough. I was about to rage-quit, and I did... for a day, but I realized that I really wanted to see where the story was going and what would become of the companions I had meet, so I opted for a solution that I seldom use. 'Lowering  the difficulty to easy!' Well, you might think this is a lazy or even cowardly choice, but I beg to differ.

In most other games I play, I tend to max out the difficulty. For instance, modding the Elder scrolls and Fallout to the point of dying to a single sword stroke or stray bullet, because I know those games by heart. But this time I felt like the difficulty was hindering the meaning of playing the game. After all, shouldn't games be fun to play? I realized that I wanted to play the game for its story and adventure, and not endless strategizing and reloading. So that's what I did, and it was amazing!

So my advice to you if you want to play any game really, is that it isn't always about how hard the game was, it is sometimes about the adventure and the amazing story that the game wants to tell you. And that is what Dragon Age: Origins was for me, a great Adventure!

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
 When Bioware was at its peak they made this gem called Dragon Age: Origins which fans of rpg's loved. 13 years later I decided to replay it, again, and see if it holds up. Suffice to say, it has aged like a fine wine. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+Fantastic atmosphere.
+Great characters.
+Tough, non-casual bs combat, that requires thinking, especially on Nightmare. 

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Main story is pretty generic, you're special, kill a dragon, the end. 
-Orzammar and the Deep Roads. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
It's rare to see an rpg where the story and starting location might change based on your class/race and it was even rarer back then. Depending on your choice you start somewhere based on your race but eventually, all choices lead to the same outcome. You become a Grey Warden and you are tasked with dealing with the Blight which is an invasion of darkspawn. Think of darkspawn the orc version of Lord of the Rings. It's practically the same overall, except instead of taking the ring to Mordor, you have to kill a dragon. 

Obviously, it's a bit more complicated, there are tons of lores and background stories for all the characters and whatnot but there's never time to fully develop them and you're stuck reading tons of texts if you want to bother. I was never truly impressed with the main story, not even when it launched, dragons, orcs--ugh I mean darkspawn, magic, and swords, all generic fantasy tropes. What I did find impressive, were the companions. Each has their own background and personality and almost all of them are great to listen/talk to, especially Alistair and Morrigan and their constant shenanigans. 

Not much else can be said, some story parts are really nice, especially the Circle of Magi/Redcliffe story arcs and some are just...tedious/annoying and wastes your time half the game such as the dwarf storylines which I always hated. 
  
Story rating: 7.5/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Dragon Age Origins is a third-person or top-down classic rpg, where dialogue choices matter in small ways and many bigger ways, as well as having a tactical pause type of combat where you can give your character and companions orders on who to attack, when to attack or use spells among many other things. You can also naturally set up predefined tactics for each member, including your own character so that they do specific combat tasks while they are AI-controlled, for example attacking only mage-class enemies, something you do not see any longer in recent games. 

Just like any other rpg, you pick a race that has predefined bonuses to certain stats, pick a class, whether it's a warrior, rogue, or mage, and level up your character. The three classes are not as simplistic as you imagine, each class has a ton of spells/skills as well as an advanced sub-class. For example, rogues can go full ranged and take on archer skills as well as learn bard spells for aoe buffs and the same can be applied to all the rest. 

There's also a bit of crafting but it's extremely limited so not really worth discussing it as you'll rarely use it. Sadly there are not that many unique armors and weapons to equip as you might expect, especially from a visual point of view. I think mages have like two types of robes and that is it, you'll be looking goofy the entire game just with better stats, same for the rogues, with warriors having more variety than the rest. 

Not much else can be said about the gameplay, pick dialogue choices and watch the story unfold, and kill everyone with tactical spells and skills. It works well even after so many years and probably will forever. 

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
The best part of Dragon Age Origins as well as any Bioware game is that they hire talented voice actors. The characters and their voices are incredibly well acted and their banter with each other feels natural and very funny at times. Some do a better impression than others but overall there's nothing negative to say about the voice acting. 

The soundtrack is also fantastic though the combat music will get pretty repetitive at some point and as for all the sound effects such as the atmospheric ones and whatnot, they're all great, better in some places than the rest but overall good stuff.

Audio rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
I honestly thought after so many years the game would look underwhelming but I was very wrong. Atmosphere-wise and the way the lighting was constructed still feels very modern. Some places like the Circle of Magi look incredible. The character models are indeed a bit ugly as well as the wardrobe but the game still holds up overall quite well, far superior to the second game. 

Level design is also top-notch, as you'll visit several unique places with lots of rooms and places to explore with the only negative being Orzammar and the Deep Roads, fuck those places. 

The game naturally runs perfectly fine tho you might need the fixed exe version of the game that allows the use of more than 2GB of RAM else the game will crash constantly. Besides that, if you play for too long the game starts stuttering as it is unable to handle modern specs. A restart is quick and solves the issue.

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 8/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you're new to the series, well, you're in for quite the adventure and it's probably the closest thing you'll ever get to an actual great Lord of the Rings singleplayer game but much MUCH more. I won't comment on what comes after, as I'll do a seperate review of the others but Origins is highly recommended.

This game is incredibly broken on steam, and has been so for a very long time.

The Origin version seems much more stable but if you're on the fence about buying it from there, don't. There are probably *other* ways of obtaining the game that will be just as stable & you'll get the exact same amount of customer support from EA ;).

And there's one big thing I have to say: Origins is BY FAR the best out of them. It's actually so good, that it has become one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It does come with a problem, that I actually can't enjoy the other Dragon Age games. This game set the perfect standard and they haven't come close achieving the same feeling.

I don't know where to begin, but it's amazing from the moment you boot up the game. Depending on your race and class, you have different backgrounds to choose from, and each background plays totally different and even gives you different choices for the full game. And by meaningful choice, I mean one of the best I've ever seen in a RPG. Not only can it completely change the game and your experience, but also for the sequels. And the dialogue options are not the simple ones, but you always have many different to choose from. And many lead to a different outcomes. You can mostly always solve the matter how you want it to.

Then comes the combat, while I never played a tactical real time with pause combat yet, I learned quickly on easy mode. After learning, the game became doable on normal and by the end of my experience, normal felt like easy. It's really in depth and there's a high skill level, but I mostly played my own character and set my party members to different tactics. The skills feel and look amazing, and you can really customize how you want to play, with different subclasses as well.

And talking about the party members, the available companions are amazing. Each really feels like their own personality and can like/dislike what you do. But not only that, they also give their own opinions about things or even talk to the NPCs themselves. The characters really grew on me and they really felt fleshed out. There are also romance options in the game, which I always like in RPGs.

There's simply too much to say about this game. And even though I completed it this year, it's still perfectly doable. The graphics didn't really bother me, nor did it really feel outdated. And the game has an amazing modding community if it troubles you, so you got many great mods to fix that. But I wanted to play the vanilla experience first, and I'm still blown away by how in-depth and how amazing this game is. When looking at party based RPGs, this is the standard. It's honestly really, really good. I hope Dragon Age 4 can draw more inspiration from this game just like Baldur's Gate 3 does, because DA2 and Inquisition don't come close to this one.

Many choices you are able to make in the main quests affect character's fates/opinions/plot. Completing the main campaign including every side quest is around 70 hours, and its expansion Awakening takes around 15 hours. 
You can have a total of 3 companions with you in the open world so you may fight alongside or control a member of every class (warrior, rogue, mage).

Origins and Awakening gives the player free choice in what order they want to complete the main quests until the stories climax. The story is very well written and will make you wonder if the choices you have made so far will contribute or threaten your cause. The companions are a large part of what makes Origins great. You will not be alone in your journey because you are able to recruit fleshed out NPCs to your party or not, if you prefer not to have them join you. Some of these companions are able to play a pivotal role in the story if you let them. 

Importantly, you can import your DA:O save into Dragon Age II to have the choices your Origin player made, reflect in the sequel. So your choices in this game are able stay canon even after you move onto the sequels. Note: Dragon Age Inquisition (DA3) abandons save importing from previous games, and instead uses Bioware's website, Dragon Age Keep to reflect player choices and key moments prior to Inquisition.

The game was made a long time ago so the combat system will seem janky to many. The game also still has many bugs present that can be solved with mods.",1656990843,1656990843,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game has been sitting in my library for a few months now, and  i just now decided to pick it up. 
The story is FANTASTIC. This game might easily be my favourite game.
But I will not be playing it on steam. 

It's Broken. Broken broken. There are certain places you cannot go without turning down the graphics settings to the bare bones or else the entire game crashes. Want to go through Lothering? Put everything on very low. God forbid you want to talk to someone in the Lothering Chantry? very low settings and pray .  (and i have a very good computer.)  At one point, the textures bugged out and i had to completely restart. Cut scenes blacked out and had no audio - another restart. 
I had to play this game, essentially, by walking two steps, saving, and doing it again, in anticipation of a crash that may have wound me up who knows were.  Only complaint i have about the base game is the auto-saves feel pretty few and far between, which was inconvenient with a game that was threatening to explode just because i wanted to talk to a companion. 
Not to mention, there was no CD key, and, following every google article i could, i still could not figure out how to receive my DLC. It does NOT come preinstalled. GOG's does. Also, i got GOG's ultimate version for 5.00 at time of writing this review. Only when i downloaded GOG's version did i get the Ultimate Game that i paid for.  The game runs much smoother, and my computer doesnt scream everytime i play it. 
I very much wish that i could get a refund on this completely trash version of this game, but alas, it was my mistake for assuming a game would work when i finally wanted to play it, and then stupidly continuing to try to muscle through frustration. 
The game is not the problem. I played this game for 30 minutes and got hooked. The problem, though, is the Steam version is so horrendous that you have to fear a crash just by breathing wrong, which does bring down the likability of the game if it frustrates you enough. There were plenty of times a crash made me want to give up the game entirely - but the story is far too good to make me give up. 

Playing the game? Absolutely recommend, Buy it.
Playing the game on steam? God, please save yourself the heartache. 


[Edit July 4th 2022]
I don't know what to tell you guys, but those of you who commented on my review saying that you had to download patches or change something on your end means something is wrong with the game. Also, how can i 'do it wrong'? By the way, these complaint i have on the game, i have googled, and these same complaints that i have have been documented by others on the steam version of this game years back. I have a computer that is very good, albeit a couple years old. However, this game is from 2011, and should have had effective patches and fixes to accomodate newer computers. 'Gamers' are so quick to assume user error. Google what issues ive had. youll see the same results and complaints come up over the 11 years this game has been released.

I know to a lot of people that likely doesn't mean much, there have been incredible entries into the cRPG genre from smaller studios long since DA:O, however the insane amounts of time, effort, passion and money poured into this game makes it something truly special that no game has come close to since. While Mass Effect and KOTOR are the games that people remember most fondly from a better-days BioWare, DA:O is a game that remains unrivalled in the sheer amount of soul it exhibits. Although the series overall doesn't stand as strongly amongst its contemporaries, the first game remains one of the greatest RPGs ever made.

The game is far from perfect; on modern systems it's quite buggy and requires some workarounds to avoid issues such as memory leaks. Combat balance is simply bonkers and requires some modding to fix, and ultimately quite a lot of interesting content ended up on the cutting room floor (which again can be restored by mods.)

Despite all that, Dragon Age: Origins remains an exceptional play; one of those special games where you feel your heart flutter as you grow to understand and adore the world and the people who inhabit it, most important of all are your companions. Spending hours getting to know the core party in this game at your camp, back-dropped by the exceptional score composed by Inon Zur, is an incredible and memorable experience. The characters are unforgettable, their convictions and beliefs will remain cemented in your mind, and subsequent replays over the years will feel like revisiting old friends. I last played this game upon release in 2009, and despite how much in general I have forgotten over 13 years, I remember all the names and faces like the back of my hand. I adore the companions in this game.

You enter the world of Thedas after thousands of years of history and conflict, and you can feel it all within hours of playing the game. Political and racial tensions still exist, the world is littered with ancient lore and history; a lot of which has been obfuscated and filtered through the lens of The Chantry. Written lore is penned mostly by scholars of The Chantry and therefore has a significant religious tilt, however there are still fringe-groups and factions putting pen to paper to try and tell the truth of the world before a major religion rewrote it all. If you ever admired the older Elder Scrolls titles for their up-for-interpretation style lore, then the world of Thedas will be just as compelling for you.

The overall story of this game is pretty standard and wears its Tolkien influences on its sleeve; despite all that the world continues to feel original and inspiring, almost as though the main plot is simply a vessel; an excuse for the player to really go out and see Ferelden and meet all the major players who live and fight there.

Combat is quite possibly the weakest part of DA:O, but I still love it. Tactical RPGs aren't particularly my strong suit, and as mentioned before the balance in this game isn't really all that great. However, the combat remains pretty cinematic and enjoyable for some, and if its something that you cannot get to grips with or outright hate, you can always crank the difficulty down to Easy or even install mods that skip all combat in the game. 

DA:O is the first game of what is currently a trilogy, soon to be a tetralogy. I mention this because the current trilogy of games are setting up for what will likely be a huge payoff in Dragon Age: Dreadwolf. There are mysteries and questions raised in this title that have yet to be answered, and for as many faults modern day BioWare have, it still seems like their heart remains with this franchise. It will be incredible to see this series pay off after over 13 years of waiting. If you're looking for a new world to dive into, now would be the perfect time for Dragon Age.

For those who want more from the series, I recommend 'Dragon Age: The World of Thedas Vol 1. & 2.' A pair of fantastic high-quality hardback lore books that make for an incredible contextualisation of the world and lore of Dragon Age.",1656715118,1656715504,True,1,0,0.514428377151489258,0,True,False,False

The story of this game seems interesting enough: recruit different factions to defeat the Evil Overlord. The characters all have distinct personalities, and the brief interactions during travel really brings life to them all. I often find myself wondering how one of my companions will react to one of my dialogue choices. I am not a personal fan of the RTS-style of combat (I have some personal struggles with targeting in this game; I find myself pausing combat just so I can make sure I am targeting an actual enemy and not standing there like a fool), but the story mode difficulty remedies most of the problems I had with it. There does seem to be an unspoken path to go forward (really only determined by going into an area and seeing if you don't get immediately bodied by the enemies there). I do wish I had the ability to make the text/UI larger, however. In spite of its (relatively small flaws) mechanically, I am sure that I would enjoy this game...

If I was able to complete it without crashing, that is. There have been times when I would be walking around, attempt to take a screenshot of something interesting, and then the game would crash with some error box. There was another time where I ran into a bunch of spellcasters in an area with a lot of particle effects and the game crashed again when they all launched their spells. Another occurred while switching between buildings in one of the towns. In another (larger) town all of the textures were missing from the inside of the buildings: there was nothing but black void. The frequent crashes without a real auto save really kills any enjoyment that I may have had from this game. The worst of it came when I had just defeated a difficult boss by the skin of my teeth, watched a 5 minute cutscene, only for the game to crash at the end of the cutscene, making me re-do that same boss fight. 

There also appear to be some hoops to jump through if you want to activate your bought DLC for this game, since the legitimate way to do so has been deprecated on Steam (the options are literally gone from the Steam interface). 

If you are going to play this game, I would suggest finding it through another vendor (since it is an EA title, you might have more luck through Origin, but I haven't tried).",1655848222,1655848222,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

However, on my current machine, which is a 3070 i9 build, I couldn't get this game to function for 10 minutes without crashing, let alone run. 

I spent nearly 10 hours researching for troubleshooting options, exhausted every avenue I could find, and consistently suffered from crashes, and the inability to just flat-out load my saved games. If I were to close the game, I would have to start a new character, from square one, and never turn off the game if I wanted to play it. 

At first I thought this was a hyper-specific issue, but looking at thread after thread online, this seems to be a problem that is becoming more and more problematic and more and prolific, and what's worse, we'll never get a proper fix to get this game running. 

So, seeing as how this is the likely outcome it seems for most modern systems, it's with a heavy heart I say buyer beware; you may not be able to get this game to run for more than a minute or less without crashing, nor load your games if you want to continue playing after breaks.

The best thing about Dragon Age Origins is the immersive epic story about cliche-classic uniting people to fight one true evil that terrors the land. Your choices matter and it will have some consequences in the game and even in later game installments (Dragon Age II and Dragon Age Inquisition). Although your choice matter it also has a Linear elements into the story making your (Main Character's) purpose on this game true from the start to the end.

The Characters are great, they somehow will bring a cliche/archetypical sense but i'd say they're well thought and written. Some of their dialogues might feel odd at first but as you play the game they'll get better. The world-building is very interesting with the history, the cultures for each races, the discrimination to those who wield magic out of fear and clash with some who seek to put them into control is brilliant.

What I dislike about the game in my case is how it crashes randomly so I had to keep like hundreds of save/quick-save playing the game. But hopefully that's just me and its nothing i can't bear anyway.

Overall i cant say anything about the gameplay as I only play casually. But if you want to kinda look for inspiration for world building and seek an immersive epic story of good vs evil then this game might be for you.

But I can't say the same about Dragon Age Origins: Awakening. It gets kinda boring compared to what I get in Origins on the story side but the battle is enhanced as you gain more level and get more abilities to try as well as the feature to respec, so... you get to reset your builds and stuff.",1655517844,1655518483,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So do not buy the steam version of this game unless you are willing to hunt around and work out all the crashes and bugs that are in the Steam version.

I'm sure EA doesn't care about the Steam version as they don't make as much money from you buying the game here and would rather you buy it on their game platform instead. And that is very shady overall.

This is the first time I have played this game, having only played DA inquisition (which I also liked a lot). A fascinating dark fantasy setting, awesome and in depth lore, choices that matter and that you can feel the impact of. The way quests and the story plays out can vary so much depending on your choices. I also love how choices are not black and white good or evil, but rather really hard choices that are morally grey. Never an easy way out of something. This made the choices all the more interesting, something like Witcher 3 in terms of morality of choices, for comparison.

Incredible cast of characters. Probably some of my favourite characters in almost any game. Dialog is top notch and always engaging. Always interesting since you can say so many different things depending on what kind of character you are. Complete with the classic Bioware romances, companion quests etc. All so well done in this game. Overall story was the pretty classic fantasy type, but done very well. If you like things like Lord of The Rings, Witcher, Wheel of Time etc. you will love this, or if you like Bioware games like KOTOR or Mass Effect this will likely appeal to you as well (provided you enjoy fantasy).

6 different origin stories alongside character customisation, along with control over where your attributes go, what skills you have etc. Lots of ways the build your character. I ended up with a mage who wore heavy armour and channeled spellpower into phyical strength for sword use. So many ways to build your character.

Combat is quite slow and more tactical, with the pause and strategies style, kind of like Baldurs Gate. It's really rewarding and fun, and decently challenging throughout. Some clunkiness here and there given its age, and some annoying difficulty spikes, but nothing major. Overall fun throughout.

Also, the ultimate edition is well worth it. I have not got to all the DLCs but they add some great side stories, nice gear to obtain. It evem has the Dragon Age Awakening with it which you can import your main game choices to, which is awesome. This is like an expansion which adds another 15 hours at least. Great value.

The base game is really good. They offered different backgrounds for each race which i really liked even tho i played 3 times dalish elf, one time but never finished noble dwarf and human noble which was my very first playthrough.

The RPG elements are plenty, good stat and skills system, plenty of upgrades for weapons for the whole party.

The companions are so well made, it's pretty clear they put a lot and i mean a lot of attention in the first 3 that you meet because 80% of the time people will fall in love with them and never change them out. That was the case for me every playthrough, 90% of the time had Alistair, Leliana and Morrigan which i ended up romancing every single time. I hated the dog, it was really loud every time i talked with companions in the camp, the rest were ok.

Many times have I enjoyed this game, with different characters of different origin.
The origin of choice really has a influence on how the world of Thedas looks at you, and your choices define who you are.
Along the journey we are accompanied by lots of different characters, each with their own motives and standing in the world. The choices you make, gain favor with some, lose favor with others, its really interesting to replay and use different characters along the way.

You can easily sink 60+ Hours into one playtrough, but if you wish to do all the quests there are, you can add a lot more hours to the clock. After that you also have the expansion Awakening. The expansion feels a little bit less impactful (if you chose a certain ending) but is not at all a bad game expansion.

Multiple origins for class and race, multiple endings, lots of different class loadouts, all the classic RPG tropes you could ask for. I picked it back up because I wanted to give the whole series another playthrough, and I'm glad I did. 

But this game crashes /a lot/. Probably about every two hours it will just crap out, just in time for you to have forgotten to keep up with obsessively saving - sometimes it crashes in the middle of a fight, sometimes after a cutscene, sometimes just because it wants to. Other times the frames take a HUGE hit, especially when there's a battle with multiple mages going on... and when my main team includes Morrigan and Wynn, there's always multiple mages. This issue gets worse the longer you play. My next complaint is largely pointless because anyone who buys this now is going to buy the Ultimate Edition, but just for the record, all the ""DLC"" (excluding Awakenings) is trash.

While it is the best combat system of any BioWare game I have previously played, it is still heavily lacking, and often feels boring, and like a chore to do before you can continue the story, instead of an enjoyable experience that adds upon the story. The companions are good, but generally not great, with some exceptions both ways. The graphics are very outdated, but that is to be expected with the game, and if it is a big problem, there are tons of mods to improve upon this, and while mods fixing a game doesn't excuse it, it is a game from 2010, so for that the graphics are acceptable in my opinion.

Speaking of mods fixing a game, Denerim is absolute hell, and without mods would be enough for me to drop the game entirely. If I hadn't known of this issue, and how to solve it beforehand I would not have finished the game. Without the 4GB patch the game crashes constantly in Denerim, with progress at some point being near impossible to achieve. Other than this, gamebreaking glitches were minimal, and rarely occured, except for the occasional crash, which didn't happen too often, but more often than in any other game I have ever finished.

To go back to the good, I enjoyed how choices actually do matter, unlike in the title of theirs I have played most, SWTOR, where choices rarely actually matter. [spoiler]Couple of examples of this is how you can end up with multiple different in different combinations, like you with either Alistair or Anora, Alistair with Anora, or either of them alone, or in how you not exploring properly can lead to missing companions completely, like just not meeting Leliana so she just dies by darkspawn offscreen (most likely, haven't played later games, but I believe she can return, so I am unsure)[/spoiler].

Now when it comes to expansions the game is pretty lackluster, going for quantity instead of quality, so while there are a lot of DLC, there is only one expansion among them, and while I do find it enjoyable, it just doesn't meet the same standard as the main game in my opinion, with the main game having a good story crafted out of a not so interesting concept, and Awakening being a mediocre story, crafted out of a quite interesting concept.

In conclusion the game is worth the money in my opinion, but to enjoy it fully you should install the 4GB patch to play the full game: [url=https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371][/url]. The DLC's by them self are not worth the money, but for excample if you buy the ultimate edition and get all in a bundle, I would say it is worth it, and while none are great,k all ten of them add up, and do add something positive to the game, and generally does improve upon it.",1654783762,1654783883,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now a much detailed review.

To begin with you get to choose between 6 different origin stories with different motivations for each class/race to progress. Also, each of the stories are worth experiencing as they provide more information on the lore of the world. 

PROS:

About the World: It is complete with precise background information given and everything explained surprisingly well for a origin story. 

About the Antagonist: Without spoiling anything this was my most favourite character of all the people you'll meet in the world. The motivations are clearly explained and you get to see what a great villan he is.

About the Companions: There are a lot of people you will come across whom you can include in your party, who will follow you througout your journey. The characters are well written and witty ,even though at times it might be annoying. You can also romance some of them, other great thing is that you might encounter different members based on you origin story which was interesting.

About the Exploration: There is tons of replaybility with this game, i fell like i could have easily played it for 60hrs for the first(but didnt as i wanted to know about the story and how it ends). It rewards you with unique items for exploring and just roaming about the world. One thing i didnt expect was the world to be massive, no granted as compared to RDR2 or The Witcher 3, this world is nothing note worthy, but for such an old game it is huge and most places you go you can enter almost all buildings.

About the Choices: There are a ton of choices for you to make, some with minor and non consequential effect to the story, and some with huge impact from how you play going forward to which of the party memebers will either leave you, or they may backstab you. It really wants you to fell like you live in this world and you choices rightly affect you.(I played this game non-stop for about a week and all i could think was about the effects of my choices)

CONS:

About the GamePlay: You either love it or you hate it, there is no two ways about it. (I personally didnt like it very much but bared with it for the sake of story and to experience such a masterpiece) I also didnit like that we have a mute protagonist even though there are lines for the character when you assign actions to him.

About the Crash: OH MY GOD!!! This game crashed atleast 40 times. A simple solution is to play on lower graphics setting but it also doesnt help that the game is too old and lower settings dont look that great. you wont be able to get 60 fps(without any modding).

To Conclude:
Its a Masterpiece, i feel BIOWARE's best game(other than mass effect trilogy) i feel as though you should definitely experience it. 
I havent played any other Dragon Age but this left me wanting for more, also I'd recommend you get the ultimate edition as it has all the DLCs and they are damn good. Overall its a 10 in my eyes, it is flawed but still great.

I'm going to split it up into pros and cons, pros first, then cons. This is not a fully comprehensive list, as with my multiple runs through the game, on almost every console/port, I'm still discovering things in the game.

Pros:
1. The dialogue is some of the strongest and most compelling of any RPG I have played. I love Allistar's Golden Retriever and snarky personality, Morrigan's sad yet compelling way of covincing the player. Lelliana's innocent tone and speech. I could go on and on about the Dialogue and how it makes me trust, and sometimes love my comrades.
2. The character building. The character building is Bioware at it's strongest, not only do characters have their arcs, their arcs are formed by the player's actions. Allistar becomes okay with sacrificing himself if you decide to talk it into him after meeting someone important to him, Morrigan becomes more emotional if you romance her, Lelliana loses her hope of people and becomes more deadly if you choose to kill her old girlfriend, Wynne comes to terms with being possesed, Ogrhen... Is Ogrhen, Shale comes to terms with their past, Sten remains rigid in his views but allows the warden to question him about them, The secret companion shows his reasoning for what he did what he did. 
3. The setting is unique. Instead of elves being all pretentious, they were enslaved. Dwarves have great political strife and rigid house laws. Mages are imprisioned and are the only people who can be possesed by demons. The chantry are the people who imprison the mages, making them into a weak people, while being an insanely rightous and pretentious organization. Thedas is a world full of conflict, that is united by the warden to fight the darkspawn.
4. The darkspawn are just cool man.
5. The DLC gives you insight to characters and new mechanics (Especially awakening)

While there are many more pros, lets get to the cons.

1. The graphics are archaic, The game came out around the middle of the 360's lifecycle, it shouldn't look so terrible but it does.
2. The combat is also archaic, while I like the more RTS style combat, the systems on how combat is calculated can be completely broken (My first play through on PC I was doing over 100 damage a hit after level 7) and things like flasks and bombs are virtually useless (Even more so on nightmare difficulty)
3. While this fits into combat, the healing system is also broken, You can make the highest level health polutice after ~level 10, with it not being super expensive later on to buy the ingredients in bulk. You can get hundreds of them with this strategy and it trivialises the game, and its basically nessicary on nightmare dificulty.
4. The dog compainion is boring and very weak compared to the rest of the compainions.


Overall, I adore the game, whenever I come back to play it every once in a while I just smile when I see my favorite companions.

Highly recommended, this game is my favorite RPG of all time and I cannot wait until they remaster it. DAII and DAIII both pale in comparison to the masterpiece that is DAO, but it's hard to create something that is better when nearly everything is flawless in DAO for a medieval fantasy RPG title.

The game has shown it's age a little, but the story is solid, the characters are memorable, and the choices feel like they truly do have an impact.

I came back to try out a full series playthough and I just can't. I tried to give it a fair handshake but years of experience since this came out has just ruined it. The lack of AI intelligence and the use of cheap tactics to pad content. I know better now how they do this shady shit and it doesn't sit well with me.

The 'difficulty' of the game isn't a smarter AI, it is simply more crowd control abilities and more mobs. I rarely ever died from it but it did pad out fights to take sometimes 10 or 15x longer than it should have been. That is just disgusting and anti-player. I just can't slog through this mess any more. Every single mob in the game has multiple abilities to hold, stun, daze, bind, blind, etc. It's almost always their first ability. It is just not an enjoyable experience. It is not strategic or complex. It is an effort to pad game content.

If your player goes down the crowd control path of pretty much any class with the right spec, you will win regardless of difficulty. I swear whoever scripted the combat in this game had a real hard-on for crowd control. It was that way in Baldur's Gate only not so.. fucking annoying. Sure, you can build resists and some mobs have resists. But, to get yourself there on the hardest settings and the highest mobs you'd basically have to dedicate your entire build to resisting.. and that's stupid.

I don't know. Coming back to this game left a sour taste in my mouth. I got 2/3rds done before I finally just Alt-F4'd and uninstalled. Barely ever died (Maybe 6 times in entirety on Nightmare).. just got tired of sitting around waiting for stun timers to wear off every single fight multiple times while the mobs just stood there goofy looking not able to get past my regen. They legitimately last longer than the entire rest of the fight. It's disgusting.

P.S. If you really still want to try it, go and at least get the EXE update from the mod guide. This shitty steam version will just crash repeatedly. Anyone that says it doesn't is an idiot.",1652665384,1652665690,False,1,0,0.477941185235977173,0,True,False,False

The companions that tag along with you have good banter/conversations with each other in between roaming around giving it a more natural feel to the world and like you're not the only person in the group capable of starting a conversation.

Most missions progress the story or lore. Story is great along with all the characters. Writing is top notch as usual for most Bioware titles. 

The gameplay is decent once you learn it and what to level up. I would seriously recommend playing on a lower difficulty if it's your first time because there will be a ton of difficulty spikes and if you don't level up the right skills and get the right abilities you will have a hard time on harder difficulties. Everything is really customizable you can really tailor your character and your squadmates even down to the ai of your squad in combat to further the tactics. You have control over every character and their abilities so even if you don't like the class you chose for your main character you can experience them all the mage is by far my fav. You can even get sub classes later in the game to give your characters exclusive abilities to further customize them. This game is a tactical rpg so it's honestly not for everyone in my opinion the combat does feel very slow and strategic and you will definitely get tired of it after the 100 plus hours this game goes on for but I think that can be said for any game of this length. Thankfully the story is great and there is a ton of choices to make so it keeps you wanting to play. This is one of the best rpg's I have played and this is my first time playing this. 

Why am I giving this a thumbs down if it's so great? Because this game is broken and should not be sold on steam or anywhere in this state. Game crashes alot in the bigger more open areas so you have to turn down graphics to keep it from crashing. The worst part is every time I start the game the mouse cursor is not there so the only way to fix it that I could find is to restart the pc. This gets extremely annoying. The dlc is mostly shit since I'm stating the negatives. Most of it feels like cut content that EA decided to sell back in the day. The awakening is the best of the dlc's and I couldn't even finish it because there is a game breaking bug this is the first time that has ever happened to me in any game. The witch hunt dlc (Barley, feels like a epilogue/cut mission)  and awakening are the only ones worth playing unfortunately they don't have the same level of quality as base game other then awakening which is broken completely with lots of bugs.  The game should not be sold in this state fix your shit EA or don't sell it.",1652011803,1652011803,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

+ Well written dialogue, fantastic world building. The lore is consistent in it's own rules and feels very logical in a way, as in, given the rules they present, things progressively develop according to those rules, as opposed to something like world of warcraft, where new rules pop up to make the plot artificially more interesting.
+ Meaningful tactical combat for the first half of the game. Afterwards your characters are too powerful even in the highest difficulty and the enemies just don't have enough tools to deal with you for the most part.
+ Rich world. Each kingdom feels unique and fresh both in narrative and gameplay. Boss fights have wildly different mechanics instead of just fighting a monster with different numerical values.
+ Great, immersive art direction in the maps and characters. Their weapons and armor are lackluster however, and only warriors have some sets that look good.
+ Decisions that have consequences. Your main character and the world they live in at the end of the game will feel completely different from mine, as opposed to something like Mass effect, where every shepard is pretty much the same person.
+ Fantastic voice acting for the most part.
- Class design. A level 7 character feels exactly like a level 20 character, the kind of tools you have available don't change much after the initial build setup, which makes the gameplay stale pretty quickly.
- Itemization. The items themselves are extremely uninteresting, they have a tier system and very rarely you have some bonus that justifies using one set over the other by any metric other than it's tier. 
- Difficulty. It's great until around level 8, after that the combat starts feeling like a hassle because you're just way too powerful compared to the mobs (considering the highest difficulty). Before that point however the difficulty is fantastic, it rewards you for using traps, bombs and resistance potions, it's very engaging and i wish it could have stayed like that for longer.
- I'm not sure how to express this but it seems like the game lacked either time or budget, there are very few in-game models for weapons and armor, specially if you're not a warrior. A lot of animations repeat themselves far too frequently as well, making it more of an annoyance.",1651444224,1651444361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story rich and classic Bioware formula where choices matter and greatly alters the outcome of quests. Pacing and gameplay mechanics might drive away a lot of players but heavily immersing oneself to the story makes this game a worthwhile experience. Much of the worlds lore can be told through dialogue with NPCs and companions making it easy and interesting to learn about while also providing codex entries to read for those wanting to go more in depth. If listening to characters talk and slow gameplay is boring to you i would say to pass on this one because you can choose to end conversations and cutscenes early if youre just trying to get through the game but the gameplay is probably not going to be entertaining enough on its own. Game offers difficulty settings so you can make it as easy or challenging as you like. Many interactions can vary based on the players character such as if they choose to be a human or another race and even the class they choose making the game have lots of replay value,1650262902,1650262902,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

addicting: 11/10
graphic: 8/10
music: 9/10

This is one of my favourite games ever. 
I have the box edition bought when it came out, but I could not help myself to buy it on steam on sale and complete it for the third time now. 
It has wonderful characters, love stories, beautiful armours and swords you can put effects on them like fire, ice and thunders. YOU CAN HAVE TWO SWORDS IN YOUR HANDS YEAH! The fighting system is well made, you can pause and prepare tactics or just attack ha-yaaaaaaaa! It has a great system of commands you can set your companions to act on their own like drinking a potion when life is under 25% or casting a spell, for an archer to switch to the sword when attacked directly. And let's not forget, it has DRAGONS DUH! 
But what made this game so great is the plot. The entire world and the stories told are so well made it's just addicting. You will sink in and play for 12h a day just to do it all, complete it all, find it all. There are stories within stories.
The only mini-bad thing I can say about this game is it that is just a bit old so, you just have to use your imagination a bit more when they say for example that Morrigan is sooo beautiful etc. xDI mean I love her and she is and I will always pick her... but her eyes are too just too far from each other XD So, that and  and that the main character is not reading what we are picking him/her to say ;p But still, he is my pretty fiery red hair boiiiiii, saviour of the Ferelden! Legendary commander!

Anyways, I got to this game well after release and still had a blast. It was my first Bioware game, so I was unaware just how much story was going to come at me, but it can definitely be classified as an epic. Between the overarching plot and then all of the available companions and their quests, I wouldn't be surprised if you could fill up several novels' worth of material. (And maybe they have some, obviously I've never looked for any or anything lol)

I can't say it's this crazy original story by any means; you become a part of the Grey Wardens, an elite demon-killing faction, and are charged with killing the Archdemon or some such so they don't destroy the world!!! That is, of course, heavily paraphrased but is essentially the goal. What makes it special is the detail that goes into all of these ""stereotypical"" characters and settings. For instance, depending on the race and class combination you choose at the beginning of the game, there are six different opening sequences that you may experience, each vastly different. Once the beginning is over, the six introductions will merge and the story will become cohesive for each character from there, but it was a really cool mechanic, I thought. Plus, NPCs would react to what combination you chose, and treat you based off of that, which was a cool tidbit that helped immersion.

The gameplay was really interesting, I thought. It could be this intricate system where you're controlling each character and using their skills to maximum potential and seeing everything from a top-down view to strategically plan each move, OR you could take the Fefnir route, playing from a classic third-person perspective and allowing your companions to be guided by the AI, which seemed to do the trick most of the time. I did dabble with this ""RTS-lite"" control scheme, but I rarely play on the hardest difficulty in games, so it just felt unnecessary. I could see how that would be massively impactful if you chose to fight some of the harder encounters on the hardest difficulty though, and applaud them for having that sort of option.

This game is truly a staple in the genre of medieval fantasy RPGs, and I think fans of the genre could easily lose themselves in all this has to offer.",1649965880,1649965880,True,6,3,0.601449251174926758,0,True,False,False

Dragon Age Origins places you into the world of Thedas as a Grey Warden recruit charged with stopping the Blight from devouring the country of Ferelden and eventually the world. The game features a rich story of memorable characters, excellent writing, emotion, depth, and a sense of kinship with your companions that is rarely found in other games. The combat features essentially a semi turn-based auto attack system that can feel a bit clunky and dated but nevertheless works for this game. You get to create your own character as a male or female and can choose from 3 different races to play (human, elves, and dwarves). In true RPG fashion, there is a large amount of armor sets and weapons to choose from, including a crafting system that is fairly easy to understand. The PC interface is very intuitive, and allows you to map different skills/spells/potions to your number keys for ease of use. The character leveling system allows you to upgrade your stats and skills as you see fit with each level, and you level up fairly quickly in this game.

Every part of the game is immersive and the lore is quiet great. The lore and the world are top notch. The interactions with my companions and NPCs are just above else.

Unlike in Mass Effect where Paragon and Renegade can both at least seem efficient, there are dialogue options in Origins that are just needlessly hostile and cruel, I do wish as with many RPGs that the 'evil' dialogue was callous or self-centred instead of abusive.

What's bad? Character design is laughable. You almost always dress like a bandit or an action figure hero, with the default pose that you run around with being that of a clammy dude laying on an autopsy table. The crapsack permamedieval is boring as hell. It's like if someone had Faerun explained to them in 10 minutes, but darker and more French. The peoples are never believable, with the typical ""what if white people were the real victims of slavery"" (elves) thing that fantasy oddly falls into a lot (like... a lot), but also combined with the less common ""indigenous culture is cool, but what if it was more white"" thing that fantasy also oddly has a thing for. Mechanically, inventory management sucks, equipment isn't meaningful, and dialogue options are somewhat limited pretty often. Skill trees are somehow way too informative and way too under-defined, not letting you understand for instance that Archery is the most powerful combat style in the game -- but that 90% of the Archery tree gimps it instead of empowering it.

So, negative ramble aside? Somehow the game is awesome. It takes the wonder of Neverwinter NIghts, the intricacy of D&D, and the feeling of surprise and purpose and humor of KotOR and ramps it to 11. Bioware really knocked all of that out of the park. Even boring scenarios, like visiting a castle village that -- surpise! -- turns out undead waves are pouring out of the castle and assaulting the locals, are really fun. The voice acting is great for the year, though it's no Mass Effect (Keith David should have been Loghain) and the soundtrack is maybe one of the best matches for a video game story ever.

Also, you can easily (compared to other games of the time) mod it to hell to fix a lot of my complaints, so. DO that.",1649181621,1649181621,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

A game with uninspiring graphics hides one of the most beautiful and complex stories I've ever played.
Play as anyone you desire and defend your country against a rising evil, but not before you change the politics wherein you reside. 

I love games that have actual consequences for our actions. DAO allows for game-altering side-effects throughout the rest of the game, and into the rest of the series. 
The companions we meet along the way are unique and comical through their individualism and reactions to the environment you set in place.

I'm also basic and love the ability to act as a sarcastic ***hole the entire story. 

I honestly don't know what else to say. I used to play DAO many years ago, but picked it up again for the first time in almost a decade. It still holds up extremely well, and it's a breath of fresh air compared to any RPG or AAA game released nowadays. I totally recommend to any of my friends that are interested.

Basically DA: Origins has a potential for more challenging gameplay, a wee bit less handholding, and depth to it. If you're looking for something that ignites a bit of that Baldur's Gate feeling from childhood, this'll do it. I am NOT a hardcore gamer, a woman who cries and pauses a lot lol, but I can play most games on Hard mode without too must frustration. DA Origins' Hard mode is quite hard for me, so much so I never bothered to try the Nightmare and in some fights I've lowered it down to Easy because I just got so overwhelmed. Tactics are crucial, both your own assessing the situation and how you assign your players, and Origins does a great job of giving you the reins.

I DO see merit in the sequels - I find the stories of Origins interesting but the character interactions wooden, predictable and it was underlined within minutes of starting DA 2, and Inquisition.. well, it's soulless yeah, but the emotional investment of DA 2 to me makes it worth playing, and the customisation/roaming are fun.

I absolutely love this game so I'll get straight to the point.

- The game-play experience is [b]not nearly as fluid[/b] as the console one. Instead of a fluid action rotation during combat, it's like it's trying to be a crpg with a locked camera distance... ( Feels fairly off when you know how well it ran on console.)
- There's [b]no controller support[/b]. So I'd suggest remapping the camera rotation keybindings & move the party by right clicking which makes things less janky.
- Some features are missing like hiding you helmet & the action wheel for instance.
- You'll experience crashes & bugs which I never experienced in the original game.

However, Origin did as Origin does and was not able to verify that I had purchased this gem of a game even though I had logged well over 100 hours of it on my old computer. So, I bought everything for a second time on Steam, and at a cheaper price, too!

And honestly? So very worth it. I would buy this game and its sequels a hundred times over. DAO is a bit of a slower, darker story than 2 or Inquisition, but it's still so important to the overall story and so, so good. DAO is unique, in that no matter which origin you choose for your character, all of the others still exist within the world. If you choose to be the Amell mage and make it out of the tower, the elves, the dwarves and Cousland are all still there in their parts of the world. They don't survive of course, because Duncan is saving you, but they're still [b]there[/b] and that to me, is so very impressive from a storytelling standpoint.

I feel like there's more concrete things I can say to convince you, but honestly?

It lingers in the back of your mind and nestles into your memory, reminding you every once in a while about the scenarios you played through and the characters you met. And just...

I can never say enough good things about these games. I love them so much and can honestly say that they are my favorite games of all time.

3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Dragon Age Origins is what I believe to be the pinnacle of Bioware games. It is the very definition of what a Western RPG should strive to be. The characters are incredibly likable and engaging, the writing is top notch, the story is interesting, and the roleplaying opportunities are unmatched. 

I'll fully admit that the gameplay in this game did not age very well. The series has since switched to a full action RPG format, and I'm okay with that. What this game brings to the table, however, is a truly player-centric adventure. It feels like I'm playing D&D with a really good DM. It feels like I'm driving the fate of this world, like my choices matter.

THAT is what makes this game so good. The lovable characters, the storytelling, the romance, it all comes down to YOU. THE PLAYER. 

I chose this as my favorite game of all time. Not because I have the most hours in it, not because I find it particularly replayable (though it is), but because this game sticks with you and provides an experience that other RPG's can only dream of. I still quote this game all the time, and I'm sure every other DA:O fan will tell you the same thing.

This game should be held up as an example of how to write a choice-based RPG. And YOU should play it if you are looking for that experience. 


<Old Review>
It's 2015 now, 5 years after the release of this game... (Well the steam release at least, i'm not going to bother looking up the official release date) And I still play this game... a lot. Despite Dragon Age: Origins spawning 2 sequels, I always find myself coming back to this one. The textures are bad, run speed is slow, combat takes a while to get engaging but this game is irrefutably the best game in the franchise. Gameplay wise it's extremely polish, allowing for multiple builds and adding new depths of difficulty. Every build has advantages and disadvantages, forcing players to think about where their next skill point should be placed. Dialogue is skippable and the choices are clear and concise, making it easy to judge what an NPC's reaction will be to your choice! However this RPG doesn't use a patronizing dialogue wheel that shows you pictures and says, ""This is the NICE option, This is the FUNNY option, This is the MEAN option, This is the option to kill yourself"", No, this game knows you're too smart for that and says, ""Here's the choices as to what your character will say, NOW ROLEPLAY"", Which is an EXTREMELY welcome change from the all too common ""Choose your prick"" gameplay style. - *cough* Dragon age 2 *cough* -  Story wise it's engaging , constantly forcing the warden to make critical choices that will ultimately affect the ending. Graphics wise it's not the BEST, it could be way better, but graphics never really mattered to me in the long run, and the UI looks really good. The characters and their animation can get comically bad sometimes, but it never gets ugly- *cough cough* Dragon Age 2 *Unconvincing cough* - and the character creator is a lot of fun.  All in all, Dragon age: Origins is a great game, well worth your time and money.",1436449720,1647378806,True,2,0,0.517753899097442627,0,True,False,False

Now the gameplay in combat and such may not stand the test of time as much as the worldbuilding and story, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's possibility to play man character focused, as a party or even though a top down, strategic overlay makes it so that any player has the freedom to explore their own style.

This is not considerably my introduction to this series. What to say, many things actually, putting a consistent 60 hours into a game from 2009, but how can I not. Well lemme explain

[h1]Story[/h1]

Easily one of the best stories ever told. To begin, you are told from the get go what the current situation is, there is an invasion from a blight known as the darkspawn. Immediately they are show to be ruthless and scary. Only the Grey Wardens are the ones destined to defeat a dragon known as the Archdemon, known to control the darkspawn invasion. You can choose up to 6 different origin paths, no set linear path you have to follow like most modern RPGs, the origin story you pick is vital to whats happening in that story as well as later or immediately if you decide to go back to the origin place.  You have a choice between Human Noble, City elf, Dalish elf, Circle Mage, Dwarf Commoner and Dwarf Noble with over 11 combinations class builds. despite what path you choose, you will experience a story from where you decide to start and then later be met with a internal conflict which will lead you to joining the grey wardens. You join up with Duncan, meet Alistar (another grey warden you meet) survive the trials and are met with a battle where you see a turn of events which lead to twists, choices and consequence. As you venture to unite the factions into fighting the Blight, you as the player have to make certain choices which will either benefit everyone, them or yourself. Do you wanna be evil? Origins lets you do that? Goody two shoes? go for it. Neutral? of course but not every companion will like what you do for either path you decide to take. There is too much to talk about in terms of story and you just need to experience it for yourself to understand whats up. However what makes the story so perfect is the characters, specifically the companions.

[h1]Companions[/h1]

When you think about companions, some may think nowadays, they are just an NPC who follows you, do what you are told, carry your gear and sometimes some commands. In Dragon Age Origins, companions are much more than that. They tie in with the gameplay mechanics, each one has a specific class with some being completely unique to them (ie preset specialisations, your mabari and shale). They are also extremely fundamental to the story itself, they will speak there mind on certain topics and actually interact with the NPCs rather than have a throwaway line which just has them say an opinion and the NPC doesn't acknowledge them, NOPE your actions matter here. 

If you reach certain approval paths, they will speak there mind about you and how you treated them. If you say the wrong thing, you can lower the approval or if you say the right thing you can increase the affinity a bit more. By making them hate you, they will change there response and expression, a small attention to detail, they will act more disgruntled about you and possibly might betray you or flat out leave. In addition you can tell them to piss off if you want too and once again depending on the approval, they will be like ""oh good riddance, don't tell me twice"" or ""oh why do you want me to leave, ah I understand, good luck then"". Some may even also die by your own actions if not picked carefully. By also increasing approval, they can get a bonus to there attributes up to 6+ further improving them in combat.

Romance is also an option in game, only for 4 companions, Zervan and Leliana are same sex romance options while Alistar is female only and Morrigan is male only. Love triangles are also an angle and will lead to some pretty dialogue but in the end where you need to make a decision to choose who you want to be with if you approach one of the ones you romanced. It's entirely possible however to finish the base game with a love triangle, which I've done myself with Morrigan and Leliana (sorry Zervan, we still bros though). Romance doesnt have as many benefits, besides a small sex scene, but sometimes the romanced one wont disapprove as much even if the choice doesn't align with there morals. With a great story and brilliant companions, how about the world and questlines

[h1]World Design & Quests[/h1]
The world of Ferelden is quite vast, from swampy marshes in the kotari wilds, to the bustling city of Denerim, The Underground city of Orzammar (being one of 2 remaining Dwarven kingdoms), The Dangerous Deep Roads, The lush but dense forests of Brecilian, tall but menacing Magi Circle tower and mysterious Redcliffe Castle. Nothing feels samey and generic, nothing is just one biome palette, its all different and expansive and suits the factions that inhabit it well. Elves are either enclosed in denerim in the slums of the Alienange or more open and territorial in the Brecilian Forests. Dwarfs are all tied up in nobility, politics and plotting and prefer to reside underground, despite the area being the breeding ground for the darkspawn in the deeproads. Finally humans reside either as mages in the magi tower or in the city of denerim. Not all are staged in these locations and many like to roam around or be set in locations you wouldn't except, making the game more diverse and have a unique flavour.

I've mentioned before how choice is important and how it can lead to consequences, as well as affecting the future of your playthrough and how it ends. Ostagar is a perfect starting point where it teaches the player about multiple quest lines that are side quests from being fetch quests to power you up or to other progression paths to look into. You are also introduced to your first possible companion you could recruit sten who is locked up and after you uncover what he has done, you can choose to either free him and let him go, be killed by darkspawn or allow him to join you. after Ostagar, you can go to 4 different locations each with there own set of quests, be it side quests or main. Some quests have you going to small ""arenas"" which are locations which you fight a group of enemies in an open field or enclosed area and you do something specific to that quest. 

One of my personal favourite quests was ""The Arl of Redcliffe"" quest, where his son connor is possessed by a demon and there are so many ways to approach this quest. You can flat out kill Connor if you want and that affects certain companions, you can have a blood ritual done by Jowan which will sacrifice the wife Isolde or you can request help from the mage circle at the tower if you have done the quest and not be in favour of the templars who want to flat out kill them (which takes longer but leads to a much more peaceful resolution). If you choose to enter the fade with a companion, you flat out have to fight the desire demon. If your character ends up being a mage, you can choose the following options granted the demon is allowed to return to connor later: blood magic, a kiss from the demon, have the approval of companions increase or grab a tome book which can increase a talent or spell once. In addition if you have high persuasion, you can intimidate the demon to leave connors body which means she will leave for good or even asks for more and still grant you one of the rewards. Such a well done quest and your companions will talk to you about the outcome after. mosts quests are like this and not many games have such outcomes. What leads to good quest however must be shown in gameplay.

- great characters (Alistair, Shale and Zevran especially)
- consistent story telling, you always know what happens pretty much
- unique combat which requires you to strategies
- meaningful choices all around

The bad:
- limited enemy design
- magic is pretty broken and unbalanced (you notice that when fighting high ranked enemy mages)
- high dragons as a melee spec (good luck fighting those when not running a shield with the appropriate trait to NOT get knocked 24/7), in general fighting in melee isnt really fun
- some side quests are just collect a random quantity of item X

The really shitty:
- This game crashes a lot. And by a lot I mean at LEAST every two hours. I tried common fixes the community provided and even made it run with 4 GB Ram. I started quicksaving (you should too, if you value your sanity that is) a lot. And while my soul was draining with every crash in the most tedios situations, the nail in the coffin was at the end. 
So i beat the end boss, which was an enemy which I mentioned above (so ye, shit fight) and in the epilogue, most likely close to the end, my game CRASHED AGAIN. So I would have to fight the stupid boss again to continue with the last dlc and awakening but... no thanks.

For me, this game was unplayable until I downloaded the 4gb patcher from a link in one of the steam forums.    
     It takes literally like 1-5 minutes to do and there are numerous tutorials out there on how to do it. Basically you download a patched version of the .exe and replace the file found in the game folder. No crashes whatsoever after that mod (as opposed to crashing every 20 minutes).
    I also use vortex mod manager to handle my 5-6 mods that I've got installed. Give this game a shot.. it's on sale about once or twice a month for $4.99.

Aside from that i saw a lot of reviews in steam saying the game crashes a lot. And it is indeed true that it crashes if you have high graphics in certain areas.

Get a mage with the haste skill ASAP, makes a really nice QOL improvement when you are exploring.

When you are doing the awakening DLC, there is a bug where you lose all your items in a certain quest so make new saves in each new area. (if you want to know which quest.......... its the one when you go into the silverite mines)",1646011055,1646011055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Origins 8.5/10
Inquisition 3/10 Avoid at all costs


Not without its share of flaws ranging from texture glitches, drab environmental colour pallete, weird hero pathing, boring item attributes and unclear skill effect/potency. Dragon Age: Origins is a game that is certainly beginning to show its age.

However, this game is miles above Dragon Age: Inquisition. I only wish somebody had told me to avoid Inquisition years ago and instead had me start with Origins.. It took me 50 hours to understand that Inquisition's world is anything but imaginative. It's a world with merely a pretty shell but with little to no substance at its core. It's a world with a series of forgettable if not downright cringey character interactions, dull NPCs, insipid side quests (many of which amount to nothing but Ubisoft-style fetch quests), and a by-the-numbers main story that may as well have not been there. It was a regression in this series that painted a very poor representation of what I might expect in its predecessors.

Dragon Age: Origins on the other hand, despite its age, has a potent main story and imaginative side quests, interesting and grounded character interactions, tactical gameplay options and more. As dated as the graphics are and the combat clunky, it really won't matter because DA:O's strengths will always lie in characters, story and choices. As any RPG should.  It's not without flaws certainly, but I can genuinely recommend this game with my 50 hours in it at the moment.

This game may have the same name as Inquisition, but there was clearly a distinct difference with the quality of writing between the two. The same way that Fallout 1/2 and New Vegas had a distinctly different feel to Fallout 3 and especially 4, so does Origins to Inquisition. The same way that the early Mass Effect games felt distinctly superior to Andromeda despite some dated elements, so too does Origins surpass its most current iteration of the Dragon Age formula.

This was back when the EA name was not a complete and utter embarrassment. Now, no surprise. If EA is involved, it's most likely a dog**** game.  I wish I didn't have to mention Inquisition so much and compare the two, but it's difficult not to considering how overrated the game was and continues to be. If I could spare someone the time, energy and their hard-earned dollars by having them avoid touching Inquisition with a 50 foot pole, then I will consider this review a great success. Note also, the Ultimate Edition has a tonne of additional DLC content amounting to well over 100 hours for one playthrough if you do everything there is to do.",1644905833,1645681105,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A last caveat: its sequels have nothing in common with DAO as far as the gameplay is concerned (and the third title is especially awful, a sort of early '90s arcade with an unordinary amount of crafting involved).

The bad
-sidequests are mostly very sketchy
-the origins have a marginal (at best) impact on the plot and interations with NPCs
-marked lack of balance between classes and talents (to name but one, the arcane warrior  is basically impossible to kill and deals ridiculous amount of damages, especially if coupled with blood mage, almost defeating the concept of tactical fights)
-character development is quite shallow (more or less at the same depth of the first Diablo...)
-Awakening is mediocre at best, both in terms of contents/gameplay and plot
-DLCs are borderline to cheating, filled as they are with uber-powerful items

The good
-plot is sound and the main quest is written with care
-fade sessions are among the best moments I have played in any cRPG
-graphics are nice, and animations are excellent: characters wearing heavy armors and swinging big sticks do not jump around like prince of persia
-the core concepts seemed solid  and could have gave rise to a great game if properly refined
-the recruitable companions are well written and some are among the best in BioWare's history

The game is a little weird with its combat. All the difficulty only comes from things being obtuse. A lot of the harder fights are only hard cause they rain like a billion mages and archers on you at once so u have to essentially take the fight step by step with that pause function (but maybe I'm just a bad strategist).

Great story so far, but this game crashes all the time an it has a few game breaking bugs. Its super clunky an didn't age well. I don't recommend someone buying this full price. You crash in battles, you crash in text, you crash in load. I got a few game breaking bugs that I was able to fix via some work a rounds on there wiki. One big bug is the game will not load a save when you crash in Denerim, which is almost every other load screen. I would have to load a older save to get the game to work, then load current save if I want to continue playing. Its a real pain. This game crashes at least 2 times every time I play it. So save a lot if you do plan on getting this one. 
 
EDIT: 

I gave it a thumbs down due to all the bugs, crashes, bad team AI and such, but I changed it after completing a story an playing the DLC. The DLC is pretty great, an they changed the players team AI an its much nicer. I know there are MODS to fix this stuff, but I am rating the game, not the game modded. I still wouldn't recommend paying full price, but the ultimate edition is one you'd want to get.

3rd EDIT~! 

Ok I switched this back to THUMBS DOWN, not recommended. I played through the base game an all its DLCs. The awakening DLC is good but a lot of bugs an game crashes. At one point I was crashing every 10 mins an multi crashing over an over in battles an such. Game is just a mess. The other DLCS are quick stories you can blast through in like an hour or so and there is an end boss for one of the DLCS that is unbalanced an broken, hard for me to beat its first part than its second part it bugged out an just stood there. OK~ 

All in all, its a great story, cool characters, magic, swords, rpg lvl up game...but with the massive amounts of bugs, glitches, an the game crashing all the damn time it became a chore to beat. At two different times in my playthrough the game bugged out an I would lose equipped gear. Like helmets and weapons I quested to get.

It seems like every time I play through this game there is something slightly different, or my approach is different leading to a vastly different gameplay experience.  Battles get kinda action packed and chaotic at times but then you can zoom all the way out for a ""Commander View"" and really take control tactically of a potentially overwhelming situation.

The game rewards a lot of tactical thinking and will punish you if you don't have a balanced team in your 4 person party... which sadly means some characters almost never see the light of day because either your Main Character fills that role or ultimately their synchronicity isn't as great as other characters.  But the dialog and relationship aspects of the game can really affect who you roll out at the time.

Some characters will literally keep getting pissed with you if you do side quests or help unimportant people of little consequence or if you are doing morally gray things.  One character that will always be on board is your Dog, who is an alright Tank but is quickly outclassed by literally everyone.

Ultimate edition includes the DLC which will give your play through a massive boost, though if you wanted to do Vanilla it's not impossibly hard or anything - just feels lacking after playing with the DLC... and besides, who doesn't want a Golem woman constantly berating everything you do?

NOW I will give this disclaimer, whether you never played this before or if you're seeking to get lost again after some years like a day trip with a semi-toxic ex... there are bugs.  Browse the discussion forums but on modern systems the textures don't always play nice.  There are fixes for this though I can't link directly, but everything I found that fixed the game to it's working potential was found on the steam community hub.

After playing some of it again, I'd say the story is better than I remembered, but the actual gameplay is even worse than I remembered.

It requires extensive micromanaging and yet at the same time it will basically run on its own without you even touching the game. It's like the worst parts of Final Fantasy XII's combat system but even that game I remember being more engaging. It's enjoyable enough as a basic fantasy story, even if it is generic and largely unmemorable. But the gameplay is just a slog.

Despite its age and flaws, [i]Dragon Age: Origins[/i] is probably my favorite game in the series. The story - while somewhat-lacking in originality - is well-written, well-paced, and well-presented on the whole, with some interesting twists and subplots. There are tear-jerking and intimate moments, horrific discoveries, and scenarios that introduce some difficult moral and ethical dilemmas depending on your investment in the characters.

Speaking of the characters: despite [i]also[/i] lacking originality (standoffish witch, dashing rogue, stoic fighter, drunken dwarf, self-righteous paladin...and bisexuals who feel more token than genuine), are somehow more likable and relatable than many of the others introduced in later installments.

The gameplay is aged, but it's aged just fine. There are a few small bugs here and there with the camera, aiming, and hitting, but it seldom (if ever) spells doom for your party. Combat is definitely slower than the later games, but it's never boring. Difficulty levels ramp up appropriately and present a fun challenge, especially if you're hunting achievements.

It's a great place to start the series, too - not just because it's the [i]literal beginning[/i], but because playing through helps to build a more solid foundation on which to experience the rest. While [i]Dragon Age II[/i] and [i]Inquisition[/i] allow you to choose the outcomes of events in [i]Origins[/i], many of the smaller subplots will be unresolved, and characters/settings/events that are referenced or revisited will be otherwise unfamiliar.

    [*][b][u]In-Game Purchases[/u][/b]: None anymore. In fact, pretty much everything that was once purchasable/exclusive can safely and legitimately be downloaded for free from the [url=https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Downloadable_content]Dragon Age Wiki[/url].
    [*][b][u]Learning Curve[/u][/b]: Pretty easy. Need to do a fair amount of exploring the usefulness of most spells/abilities, but it's easy to do. The PC version also allows you to keep more abilities at the ready than on console.
    [*][b][u]Replayability[/u][/b]: Medium-high. You can play through the origin stories in about an hour or so each, and with some strategic saves, see most of the possible outcomes to key events and even explore all of the possible (largely-inconsequential) romances.
    [*][b][u]Recommended Purchase Price[/u][/b]: $15 (it goes on sale often for far less)

Five times in a row I try to load a game and it just crashes.

I was happily questing, leaving Denerim to continue looking for an item I need for the plot. As soon as I went to leave the city, the game crashed. I reboot and now none of my saves will load; it just outright causes the game to crash. I guess 26 hours down the drain. Now I know why the game was on sale for $7.

Edit: I figured out that changing my texture setting from high to medium allowed me to successfully load/play my game. But I have read a lot of folks have issues they can't even resolve.

You manually enter your choices in the Dragon's Keep and they will carry over into the next two games. The games are also intertwined with people and places. 

If you are a newcomer, health potions are the key to this game. Set your tactics for your companions to quaff them at 50% and keep a large stock of them, and you'll have a much easier time of it. There are many walkthroughs and information sheets on the game, so you won't get lost at any time.

Dragon Age: Origins is undoubtedly an all-time classic, worth every penny, even after so many years. It´s a game I had already sunk in a lot of hours the first time I played it; and I still found it quite enjoyable this second time.

The story is simply epic, and you can spend countless hours trying to get all the different endings. The gameplay is quite versatile as you can simply lower de difficulty and further the plot as quickly as you can, or play it in nightmare mode, where you’ll spend a lot of time in the pause screen, micromanaging every action for a full tactic approach. The characters are well developed, and your interactions with them are another key element in how everything turns out in the end. 

The graphics are not something to write home about, but they haven´t aged too badly and can easily be improved by different mods. As for the soundtrack, the word is…mesmerizing, a worthy addition to any epic playlist.

However, I seriously considered not recommending it at all, at least in this platform, due to the many, many bugs you can encounter while playing it. Some of them are tolerable, even negligible, but there are a couple ones that are so big and annoying that I can´t believe they weren’t fixed in the beta. 
The worst things that may happen to you are:
-Constant crashes and damaged safe files; which I managed to fix thanks to this, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=233222451.
-DLC content not showing up; which can in turn be fixed following this steps https://steamcommunity.com/app/47810/discussions/0/523898291489266758/ 

In regards to the other ones, I recommend reading a few forums or downloading some other mods (which it´s already highly advisable for a richer experience).

TLDR
In conclusion, Dragon Age: Origins is an expertly done fantasy game, with the potential for hundreds of hours worth of gameplay. The full experience can be dampened due to it´s many errors, but most of them can be easily bypassed with a few mods.",1637259419,1642445373,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Although skills for warriors and rogue are boring as f*ck, the 40-50 mage skills are incredibly diverse, all having a different purpose and being useful in their own way (even on higher difficulties). Builds can get really deep, from Heavy Armor wielding spellcasters to bloodmages that hurt their own teammates to unleash incredibly powerful spells. 

I have to say that the game drags a bit in the last third, and some sections are really annoying to play. Combat gets repetitive as well because you reach the pinnacle of your build strenght about half way in, seeing yourself min maxing in the last half.

Some, like Return to Ostagar, are critical, while others (I'm looking at you, Feastday Gifts and Pranks!) have....questionable utility. Did you kill everyone it was possible to kill in Redcliffe and now Alistair is mad at you? Stuff him full of cakes and he'll be back to throwing roses at your feet like it never happened!

Witch Hunt is best played by a HOF who romanced Morrigan. Plain and simple. You can play it otherwise, but why would you miss out on following our snarky enchantress through the Eluvian? Because the party members from this DLC are fun people, that's why.

Return to Ostagar is awesome as soon as you have Alistair's strength stat high enough to wear Cailan's armor.

If you like to play as a rogue (and you absolutely will, it's annoying to miss out on all those locked chests on missions without your party members), consider playing Leliana's Song first. If you find all of the pieces of the leather armor, you unlock the Battledress of the Provocateur as a piece of rogue armor in all future playthroughs. It's the only reason I ever bother putting many strength points into my rogues. (20 to be precise).

I didn't even finish Golems of Amgaraak, not gonna lie. It couldn't keep my interest. I've heard stories about the end boss though, so I might have to give it another go.

Didn't bother much with Darkspawn Chronicles. Not my thing.

The Stone Prisoner is another critical DLC. If you go to the Deep Roads without Shale in your party, well to each their own I guess. It just adds a little flavor.

Has a story that contains... just about everything honestly. Politics, Drama, Romance, Betrayal, Conflict... it's all there.

It's also great that literally all dialogue is fully voiced and has optional subtitles. You can press escape to skip dialogue if it gets too slow and boring.

Has some exploits (no hacks or cheats required) like infinite money and items (and by extension infinite skill points and therefore infinite power) which makes the game feel more like a sandbox and makes the whole thing more casual, if that's how you like to play.

Mods via nexusmods are really good and enhance gameplay for the better, one going so far as to add a monk class to the game with its own skills and everything. Respecialisation, extra dog slot, camp storage and bigger inventory space are must-have mods, especially for casual players. A UI mod to increase text size is also a good pick for just about anyone (unless you are intentionally developing myopia).

You can tweak the game to be as easy or difficult as you like, with players able to choose to abuse exploits or play normally.

60 hours in and still haven't finished the game and started awakening yet. Well worth it.

The smart thing to do would be to wait for a sale, but even at full price I'd say the experience is worth much more than the 3 or so tickets to the movies you would be able to afford with that money.

Don't get me wrong, the story is amazing, easily on par with something like the witcher 3, adding the companions, interactions between them and all that, for some it might even be better. If you want that, id definitely recommend it, however there are some big flaws here that you should consider before jumping into this.

First - boy oh boy does the combat not feel good. The first ~3 hours of game were okay, because you were mostly alone, but once you got the companions... Next ~20 hours or so were hell (even on easy difficulty).
I'd bet that it was okay at the time, but it is quite complex and also - quite broken. The main reason being the tactics system - you can more or less set the AI of your companions to tell them what to do, which i would consider great if not for one big flaw - the amount of actions you can designate are really low, especially at the start. Even when you have only a few skills at your disposal, you still need to tell them to use healing/mana potions, then set the sustained skills and all that. It becomes better in the mid game, but then worse again in late game, because then you have so many skills that even double the capacity would not be enough.
So what can you do about that? Nothing, you just micromanage it yourself, which is tedious as hell and makes combat take a really long time. I had to cheat a little to make more bearable, like cheating money and buying better equipment and getting a mod which sets the dog to be a permanent 5th companion (normally there are 4, + minions form necromancy or some other place), although with limited functionality.

Another big thing was the bugs. Even with community made fixes added as mods, there were still quite a lot of them here, ranging from simple textures breaking/not displaying correctly, to random animations breakage, some people missing, resulting in talking with air, getting stuck on terrain, especially stairs, various items not dropping when they should... and so on, and so forth with various other things. I still managed to finish the game, but it required quite some saving and reloading for all kinds of reasons.
And the worst of all - game crashes. It might be okay for some, but for me, even after hours of tinkering with configs, mods, and all other stuff, i could not make it stop crashing.
Over the whole game the game crashed around few HUNDRED times. At basically every bigger encounter, travelling from one place to the next, some cutscenes starting/ending, loading different levels (especially in big towns), alt+tabing to check the wiki... Yeah, basically everywhere, at any time, even just leaving it alone to go to a bathroom and coming back to it crashed.
I get that this is a 12+ year old game, but come on... I'd bet it will only get worse with age, with new windows versions (on win10 here) and all that, unless this gets a remaster that fixes it.

Lastly, the mods. If you don't want to tinker with them, you probably wont even be able to play this game. At least for me, it would not even launch without the community fixes, and some of the mods are almost necessary to have (like no helmets mod - do you really want to spend the whole game not seeing most of the followers faces?).

Honestly, i'd really rather have this made into a tv show or something, and see it that way rather than do this again. But if you're committed to give this game a go, or you have played it in the past, go for it.

I want to heavily mention, it's not like this game is absolutely terrible or anything, and I'd actually give it something of a 7/10 in almost all aspects, the story is breathtakingly amazing, the graphics are a bit outdated but timeless, the combat has some interesting ideas behind it.

The issue I have with it though is the fact that the ""Tactics"" menu is probably one of the worst explained things in any game I've ever seen. In theory, the game gives you the illusion that you can ""just set this to default and you'll be alright"". The issue with that is that you won't be, not even remotely. So after you've died multiple times due to the fact that your companions start running around like headless chicken, you start to actually pay attention to this system that, so far, you've only looked at as some sort of ""micromanagement optimization thingie"", which then gets you into the heart of the problem:

This game has a steeper learning curve then games like Guild wars 1 or even Dark souls. Not because the gameplay itself would be hard, but because you'll have to invest many, many hours into minmaxing and theorycrafting these ""tactics"", at the end of which you'll probably be able to write AIs for Indie games even though you've never wrote a single line of code.

That, by itself, wouldn't be too big of an issue. The concept is pretty cool, to be honest. It allows you to set up your party the way you want, the way that fits a specific playstyle, which all in all allows a lot of unique flair (a vibe that is being brought in with the story as well, as the story feels vast and incredibly branching). The issue comes from the game being advertised by everyone and their grandmother as ""casual game that anyone could play"". No. It is not. I don't know what kinds of ""casual laptop grandmother gamers"" some of these reviewers have, but I press a massive doubt button on this.

The even better part of this slightly obfuscated and confusing system is that there's no proper explanation for it. You'll have a quick tutorial popping up, telling you very briefly that all of this exists, and that's it. If you ask around in the community, people will just tell you to ""get good"", or sometimes they'll downvote you or tell you that ""this is probably just not your genre and you should just refund"".

It's as if the community guards the secrets behind figuring out this absolute clusterfuck of a system, with no proper help being brought.

All of that would be *fine*, if that was the only nuisance you had to deal with. But, of course, it isn't. There's constant stutters, some graphical glitches, a few audio glitches, and ever so often the game crashed my whole PC when I alt-tabbed out of it.

Would I recommend the game? Unless you literally have 2 weeks of your life to burn just to learn the basic mechanics that make this game enjoyable, no, I would absolutely not recommend it. Not even during a 90% sale. And even if, at that point you should just get into Dark Souls, it's much simpler and easier to pick up.

As the story is absolutely 10/10 amazing, I'd still recommend you to get Dragon Age 2 or Dragon Age Inquisition instead, where the devs removed all of the clunkyness from this confusing system.

""But why are there so many good reviews on this?"", well, dear reader, because some people have had 2 weeks to burn and they did their spreadsheets and PHD-level calculations to figure this system out. And yes, granted, once you reach that level, it's absolutely the most amazing experience in the world. But the path to get there is absolutely atrocious and I would not even remotely recommend going down that rabbit hole. I wouldn't say it's worth it for your average person.

Myself? I probably will go deep into this, mostly because I'm literally unemployed, unemployable and receive unconditional social welfare.",1641538654,1641568977,False,2,1,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

The characters and their stories were great to behold; the romance and banter that come with them, lovably superb. The politics were rich with strife on all sides to the very end, and the cast woven in with them were just as complex. It fostered immersion and ethical dilemmas that can or will follow you all the way through to DA: Inquisition, depending how you handled them -- and I find that pretty damn cool.

Such praise is not without its grievances, but for an over-a-decade-old game it is what it is. Although its combat system was not always my favorite, I can't deny the oft-spoken opinion that it is, in part, what made it a well-beloved foray into the RPG genre. [i]But[/i], if and when I play it again, I feel confident that opinion may change after the lessons I [strike]hopefully[/strike] learned from stumbling into every instant death and blunder you can imagine along the way. :o)

I did have to mod the game to hell and back again to get it to look and run as I liked it, however, with one game-stopping glitch in particular requiring a third-party patch to make it playable again. That aside, I think the writing more than makes up for its technical blemishes... just come prepared. Multiple save slots and a few quality-of-life mods were well-worth the investment, in my experience.

[b]DLC Reviews ::[/b] Although I didn't complete all DLCs at the time of this writing, here are some brief remarks on the only two I cared to try before moving on to Dragon Age 2. These do not include the DLCs that can be completed within the first run of the original campaign (The Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep, Return to Ostagar), compiled with my overall rating offered above.

First in line is [b]Awakening[/b]. It was, perhaps, the best in terms of post-game DLC I could have ever hoped for. The characters were fantastic. The story was great and well-paced. It improved on a lot of the problems I had with the base game, and carried over my progress in a way that made my Warden feel integral to the story at large. 

It's practically a sequel, and an important building block toward the next installment of the franchise that shouldn't be missed. [b]9/10[/b]


[b]Mage Hunt[/b], on the other hand, was a bit disappointing in comparison, but offers relevant closure for one of the best characters in the game so I can't complain [i]too[/i] much. It wasn't nearly as fun, though... kind of frustrating actually. It is a tale where the only character in your party worth caring about is your dog, because the other two have the combined charisma of a cardboard box left out in the rain. Clocking in around 2 hours long, It was short, at least, but could have been a [i]lot[/i] shorter. [b]5/10[/b]",1641555450,1641558326,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

I completed one play through as a Sword and Shield Warrior on a 2015 Laptop (with an i5 & a GTX 960 card) running Windows 8.1. The game did not crash even once. 

I bought a new Laptop late 2020 (RTX 3060, i7) running Windows 10. The game crashes quite a lot. Especially when you take screenshots or when a cinematic scene is about to begin. I strongly recommend quick saving after every fight so you can quick load after a crash. 

What to do when it crashes frequently:
- Scale down the video settings to moderate detail. Turn off Vertical Sync. This allowed me to complete the game. 

I enjoyed my play through as a mage infinitely more than I did when I played a sword and Shield or when I played a DW rogue. 

My Party composition was:
- My Main Character (as a Mage) - Fire and Ice Lines (I wanted to try the Storm of the century), Mana Clash line (strongly recommend, I missed this on my prior play throughs, it makes a huge difference), Hex line, Force Field/Crushing Prison, Spirit Healer Line.
- Morrigan with CoC, Lightening Line, Hex line, Force Field & Crushing Prison. I built her as a spirit healer since the first 2 spells in that line are some of the best ones in the game. 
- Alistair was my tank. All skills in Sword and Shield. All skills in the Champion Line. 
- Leliana was my rogue and Love interest. I romanced Morrigan on my first play through. Romancing Leliana was far more satisfying. She comes with an Archer build but if you invest 2 points in Dual Wield to offset penalties to your offhand and then invest in the Momentum line and get her to be an assassin with mark of death, She becomes a DPS beast who literally takes no damage with high Dex. 

I played the Entire game on Hard so I can finish the play through with some challenge and not take too long. I completed the game at 55 hours on my most recent play through. I highly recommend playing as a Mage. You do not have to be an Arcane Warrior/Blood Mage to enjoy playing as a Mage. Storm of the century is over rated. You will not need it to win as a mage. My Mage was a good guy who just made A LOT of Potions. Unlimited Flasks/Agents from Bohdahn, Unlimited Lyrium from the Mage Tower and Unlimited Elf roots from Varathorn in The Brecilian Outskirts = Unlimited Potions. 

I would recommend playing Dragon Age Origins ahead of Dragon Age Inquisition though DAI has better graphics, the game is not as fun. Not even close. In fact, I quit playing Dragon Age Inquisition at the 50% mark on 2 different characters because there is too much grind and the story is not as gripping as Dragon Age Origins. 

After 200+ hours playing this game, I can say that I will miss the companions in Dragon Age Origins, They are some of the best written characters of all time (anime, movie or gaming) and the Story is one of the greatest tales ever told (on par with LOTR, Warcraft).

On another note on the game itself, the graphics are dated though not too off-putting, and there are some mods that update aspects of it such as character models.

The best part of this game by far is it's story though. It is set in the dark fantasy region of ferelden, where you're fighting an unstoppable horde. It has an immersive story and environment, and in my humble opinion, its story is the best of all the dragon age games. While the other games focus more on updating the battle system, they lack some depth to story so if that is important in a game to you, Origins is the best choice. It has meaningful choices throughout the game with multiple endings and romances (as well as being lgbt+ friendly with canonical gay / bisexual romance options for some characters). 

In terms of battle, the AI can be both very intuitive with the use of tactics, but also choppy with controls and character movement. It is as it says it is; a tactical roleplaying game, though it can be played as live action (which i prefer) on lower difficulties. You are able to pause the game to plan out each of your moves as well as being able to play as each of your companions. Technically, you could go through most of the game just by playing your party members and letting your player character use tactics to control itself.

For anyone who's played the game on a console, you will find the way the inventory works to be a little cumbersome.. you will be dragging and dropping everything, whether something is a gift needs to be hovered over to find out, equipped weaponry disappears from the list of inventory, armour bonuses won't even show if hovered over; the item needs to be inspected to see if wearing as a set of the same types of armour gives a certain bonus, all minor things that add up. 

The way combat works is, to the way it works on console, is very bizarre. You interact with objects with the left-click but attack with right-click, and left clicking on enemies does nothing (and this can't be changed in controls, only swapping the whole functionality of the left and right mouse buttons). You can't logically click on an attack and then select your enemy, you have to pre-select your enemy and then click your attack. It's counter-intuitive and took several hours to get over. You will also be taking advantage of the pause function in sometimes even simplest battles, particularly early on in the game. 

MY MOST EGREGIOUS TOOTH TO PICK WITH THE PC PORT OF THE GAME is that codex items don't highlight with the shiny glow that interactable items like chests and dead enemies have. They don't highlight at all. And when that codex might be a single random book on a cluttered floor amongst hundreds of other books that all look the same you will miss them. I've only gotten the ones I did because I knew to look for them, and I still missed several. And as a matter of fact the highlights of the corpses and chests is barely visible, I find myself manually hovering and checking every dead enemy for dead items after every battle rather than doing a quick glimpse and carrying on.

All in all, this is a great game with a wonderful story and likeable characters and there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the port, it's certainly more stable and far less glitchy than the PS3 port. I will never give this game a poor review, but I do think there are some changes that could be made to the PC version that would make it easier to play. I write this simply to let console players know you'll be in for a re-education on the controls. Perhaps I'm only playing a vanilla version and these are changed with a patch I haven't checked for but it is what it is.

I'd heard this one was one of their finest hours for years, but I hadn't quite gotten into it myself. I can say now that I do get why people loved this one back in the day. I remember trying years ago and kinda bouncing off, but I've played a few other classic RPGs since then, and I'm far more accustomed to RTwP (Real Time with Pause) combat. Gameplay-wise, this isn't far from other RTwP games like Baldur's Gate, and generally I had fun getting through the various encounters. Mages can be pretty frustrating at times though, especially in the late game. It's never fun when a party member is immobilised or blocked from healing. But ultimately it's very satisfying to use your wits to figure out each encounter.

Where Dragon Age really shines to me is the characters and the world, opting for its own fantasy world with its own familiar but different quirks. I really grew attached to the characters, and had to think very carefully about my decisions, balancing what I thought was right and how it might affect my relationship with my companions. I spent a lot of time getting invested in the world, talking to people, immersing myself in the role of the Grey Warden.

Overall this is a very solid RPG I would recommend, but be aware that there are some bugs here and there. Some causing softlocks, and some outright crashing the game. One thing I would recommend for the latter is lowering the graphical settings to medium. Yes, for some reason that helps. I can run many of the latest AAA titles, but Dragon Age from 2009? That's too much. (There's probably a reasonable explanation for this, but I don't know it.)",1641425205,1641425205,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

All three times I was really enjoying the experience while I was having it, but a corrupted save nixed my first play through attempt and too much of the same (i.e. repeating things I'd done before) made me lose interest the second time. However, after picking up Inquisition on a sale and breezing through it all pretty quick, I thought I'd finally finish Dragon Age: Origins.

Firstly, and in my opinion most importantly, this game's story is phenomenal. The characters, especially your companions, are all very well fleshed-out. The world of Ferelden is introduced gradually, growing in scope with the game's progression and cluing the player into it's history with time. This gradual unveiling of the wider world makes its very complex history and lore easily digestible. Most crucially, though, the main plot it engaging and unique. Your quest feels important and the effects of your actions are palpable. If there is one thing I can unilaterally praise about this game, it's the story, and I would go so far as to say the story is good enough that it garners my recommendation all on its own.

However, in spite of my gushing, this game is not without fault. The combat system is fine, but I feel that it is much smoother in Inquisition than it is here. The map's vastness does help add to the sense of massive scope this game has, but it also leads to an almost irritating amount of wandering back and forth. My most potent gripe, however, is with the quests themselves. In my opinion, they're too long. For example: (early-game spoilers ahead) [spoiler]This is the sequence of events required to gain the assistance of Arl Eamon, an ally suggested by Alistair: 1: Travel to Redcliffe, which is under some sort of magical siege. 2: Assist the town in the fight or leave it to be demolished. 3: Sneak into the palace to figure out what's going on in there. 4: Fight your way to the grand hall, where you find the Arl's son in the thrall of a demon. 5: Perform a ritual to banish the demon, or kill the child. 6: Discover Arl Eamon is in a magical coma. 7: Learn about the restorative Ashes of Andraste, and go in search of an archeologist who's searching for them. 8: Fall into a trap meant to keep you away from him, then learn he's likely in some remote village. 9: Travel to the remote village, which is under the control of a cult. 10: Eventually fight your way to the archeologist, who is the cultists' captive. 11: Go with him to an ancient ruin, where you will supposedly find the ashes. 12: Fight through waves and waves of cultists, which takes eons since the combat system is slow. 13: Eventually reach a different tomb past the initial ruin, and battle/puzzle your way through a series of trials. 14: Finally find the ashes, and take some. 15: Return to Redcliffe and revive Arl Eamon. That's all one quest, albeit a multi-staged one.[/spoiler]

Even if you didn't read all that, it's length alone should tell you just how long the quests in this game can be. All of that under the spoiler tag is a single quest. Basically every main quest is like this. The one I listed isn't even the most egregious, in my opinion. I just selected a longish one to showcase my point. Either way, the almost never-ending nature of a number of this game's quests is likely one of the reasons it's taken me 3 tries to actually finish this game.

I will stop griping now, though, because even though the quests can drag, they are all still very well-written pieces of entertainment, and ultimately their length is a negligible issue. Overall, this game is well worth the price, and is a must-have for any fantasy lovers out there. I highly recommend this game, the only caveat being that you ought to know what kind of a time commitment this truly is beforehand (not in the sense of overall game length, but in the sense of individual mission length. Don't expect to finish whole quests in one sitting.)",1641335680,1641335680,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Saves also occasionally crash on load, forcing you to load older saves losing some more progress. Particularly painful since this game has a dubious autosave and crashes happen at random.

Banter between companions is 10/10 and the amount of choices you get to make in the game is insane. This is honestly such a fun game with tons of replay potential. Also, you get a dog!

Edit: Regarding the incredibly frequent game crashes, I found a tip that I tried and it worked wonderfully for me. Before you open Steam to run the game, open EA Origin platform and leave it running/open while you play through Steam. That has minimized potential crashing for me. 

Another thing that I discovered on my own is if you take screenshots (F12 for me) and it doesn't capture any image, your game is going to crash soon. So I've started taking screenshots every once in a while during play and when it fails to register that I've pushed F12, I save, close the game completely, then start back up again (leaving Origin open).

Utilizing those two tips has kept me from any crashes at all through the end of DAO and all of my DLC playtime so far. I hope this helps!",1639812886,1641183914,True,64,4,0.859139561653137207,4,True,False,False

67 hours in: what i said still holds true.

This game was and still is up there with some of the best games of all time. The writing, the graphics, the sound, and the setting are all top notch, even today. 

The world is set in a very Tolkien-inspired, swords and sorcery, type of world. That being said the world is not a soulless copy of that type of setting. It does enough to set itself apart in all of the most interesting ways. This is where Bioware in its heyday really shined. By this point, that team had tons of experience with world building going back to Baldur's Gate and mastering their style with Star Wars: KOTOR. Other games have tried the whole travelling/combat companions thing but Bioware at this time always had something special. The companions in Dragon Age are every bit as interesting and endearing as the legendary ones in the Mass Effect series. This is how Bioware excelled so much at world building. By having such well written and deeply interesting companions, the player cares about them and learns about the world through their friends within the game. The exposition matters when it comes from a character the player really cares for. 

The graphics and art within Dragon Age: Origins is some of the best in all of gaming in my opinion. I could go on and on about some of the things that set this game apart. One thing the game really did well with for a game from 2009 was god rays. Now it is no big deal for games to have real-time volumetric lighting but back then, this was not possible. This game makes very good use of baked in volumetric light shafts in key places that make those locations really pop visually. The other detail that is unique and that I wish more games now would implement is how the characters get covered in blood after each battle. That visual seeing some of the carnage that your party unleashed on the enemy gives the combat a much more visceral and weighty impact than in other games. 

Everyone should play this game as well as pretty much everything else that Bioware offered at that time. These are how western-style RPGs should be made. These games get nearly everything right where so many RPGs fail at either the combat or somewhere within the character management systems and make the game bland and too much like a chore to have any appeal. These games are everything an RPG should be and everyone needs to experience how glorious that feels even today.",1640505028,1640505028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your party is (mostly) really great to talk to, and or argue with about points with the world of the game. Characters like Morrigan and Alistar are fun and engaging and connect to the story in fun ways, while characters like Sten and Leliana are not super connected to the story but make alot of the world believable and fleshed out. Combat on PC works as intended where its mostly action with a mix of pausing every few seconds to plan your parties next move. Combat can be a breeze in most situations if you have just a solid team but can get very hard if the difficulty gets high or in certain boss fights. The DLC that's added on is mixed where some DLC like the Golem of Amgarrak sucks, no good characters, combat was hard but not rewarding, and dosen't add the world at all except if your really like dwarfs. DLC like Return to Ostigar is good because it wraps of the feelings of Alistar about his teacher, you get fun fights with all the darkspawn, and going back to an old location is nice. DLC like Awakening is fantastic new fun characters (Mostly), new skills and weapons, and very engaging story in multiple parts. Very few negatives I can actually think of is that while your choices matter some choices are really just good guy choice vs bad guy choice. Also some of your party feels tacked on like Zeveran whose assassin background isn't super compelling but passable and while other party members feel as if one story thread connects to them (Like your Bard and the sacred Ashes) so they can feel justified for being there, he just feels like DLC that doesn't add anything besides funny lines here and there.

I'm not a big Bioware fan but this is my favourite of their games, and easily my favourite in the Dragon Age series. The best aspect of this game is simply the raw amount of branching paths and consequences this game has in store. Nearly every part of your character will play a role in how people treat you and how the story plays out. Your attitude towards NPCs effects the game in a very real way, and there's a lot of branching paths the main story goes in, especially in the later half of the game with one of your companions. I'm not exaggerating when I say that most quests in this game usually have 3 or 4 endings, each of which are unique and not just swapping whether ""X character survives X"" or what reward you get.
Each class is unique, but as to be expected from an RPG released in 2009 the combat isn't the best nor smoothest. The game has an issue with clown-car combat; what I mean is that enemies have a tendency to spawn in great numbers, almost always outnumbering your party and you need to plan very carefully and efficiently if you want to survive. This is fine, but I get that some players probably won't enjoy having to babysit every companion and pausing the game every second to check. The casual difficulty alleviates this issue but the problem with numbers remains, meaning you'll just be mowing through enemies without being really threatened (which is what you ask for when playing on easy mode, I suppose)
Despite that the game is a really fun and pretty well-written RPG. If you like making your own character and making important decisions within a story, this is a game you'll enjoy a lot.

Some of my favourite quotes from the game:
""You know how elves are. Every now and then they start to think they're people, and you have to put them  back in their place.""
""Elves are a small, lithe, pointy-eared people which excel at poverty.""

This is a fantastic game and I have enjoyed many hours of it on PlayStation. I recently purchased the game on Steam wanting to replay this fabulous game but it constantly crashes. Playing the main character specific backstory at the opening of the game works fine but then it crashes when you get to the main area of the game every time. I even replayed the opening quest (which takes roughly 3 to 4 hours depending) to see if maybe I somehow corrupted my save or something. I tried multiple guides to try and fix the issues but it still doesn't work because the fixes are from 2014 and the support site for the actual game has now been shut down (as of the time of writing this review in 2021). Steam WILL NOT refund my money for this game because I have played for over 2 hours even though it clearly doesn't work.

The story, the characters, and the choices you make are some of the most memorable and well thought in the genre without a doubt, and it will not be easy to topple them. You will either love or hate the characters, but won't be indifferent. And it's refreshing to see how the party interacts and have relations and opinions in between themselves; the world is not only made around player-NPC interactions. 

The gameplay offers great depth and many different skill combinations, your creativity is your limit; it will not be repetitive, though the system can be exploited for easy wins if you want to. The party-character combinations also give plenty of replayability, besides the unique dialogues during quests. The enemies have each their own strenghts and weaknesses, making you have to think through when engaging. Geography will also play a big role, and fortunately developers thought carefully about that - you will not see the same hills or caves in the same way everywhere.

It has characters to love, a grand story, and one of the most convincing arguments for the merit of games as a form of art. It's kind of remarkable how well this game holds up by modern standards, especially when you compare it to the sort of guard rails that most modern games have. 

I'm not going to bother delving further about what makes DA a great game since this replay comes well over a decade since it's launch, but I will mention some things for the 2021+ user of note. 

1.)  Strongly consider modding your game. The game does look like something from the 2000's and there are some great mods out there to help with the graphics. 

2.) Quick save often. I'll admit the game crashed to desktop a LOT on me, usually right before combat. Other technical issues also included the various textures (be they NPC skins, or wall coverings) would frequently break down or shift after extended play. Nothing a PC restart didn't fix, but if you're hoping to pick this up for a technically flawless experience; you're going to be disappointed. 

3.) One thing I'll mention to DA's credit/ detriment, is that this game really feels like it was made in a really special time of gaming. Back when quest icons were hidden, or the order of NPC's you spoke to would make a HUGE difference in the outcome of an event, or that you're asked to make a choice without anything spelling out the consequences until much later. DA comes from a fairly cavalier time in gaming which made me realise how much I'd come to depend on modern conveniences (like quest markers, or dialogue that didn't burn/ bless you for little choices). It can be a little jarring coming back to something like this in 2021, but again: DA really is a gem and you owe it to yourself to play it, whether for the first time, or for another trip around the block.",1638082482,1638082482,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It doesn't have that crappy, by rote open world feel so many newer releases are plagued by, and its simplified but tactically orientated style of play, with great to middling dialogue, mostly excellent characters, etc. all stand it in good stead. It is sadly slightly reduced by its romance subplots, which take place through a strange but industry standard system of gifts in exchange for awkward 'romance' scenes. These play out much like mushing a Barbie and Ken doll together making kissing noises (or a Barbie and Barbie, Ken and Ken doll). They are uncanny valley, is what I'm trying to say, and showcase an oddly transactional understanding of human relationships. I love the origins feature of DA:O.

Now as a prelude, I'll cover the gameplay, graphics and mechanics. Personally in RPGs this matters so little to me. I still play Fallout 2 and enjoy the hell out of KOTOR and Mass Effect. But...lets be real here. They suck. The graphics are...okay-ish? The gameplay has the pacing of tetris and the mechanics are just...old. None of it is fast paced nor are there any really cool abilities looks-wise. None of this is important to me, in fact, its clunkiness brings out a personal enjoyment. But yeah...its definitely really aged. It would also be remiss of me not to mention the fact that the game is ancient, and therefore crashes on newer PCs. About once an hour for me personally. Now I was able to fix it by way of a guide a while back, but going into it expect performance to be less than stellar. Now onto the meat. 

1.) First I like to cover the world itself. The RPG is set in your typical, run of the mill fantasy world. You have dragons(duh), swords, magic, elves, dwarves and pretty much everything you expect. Now for alot of people, this is right up their ally. Not mine. Not a fantasy fan. And for the first 10 minutes or so I was a bit unsure...however that quickly vanished as the brilliance behind the worldbuilding began to show. The world you see at first glance is more of a skin and its surface level in depth. Its quite unique in its own right. You have elves...sure, but instead of being mystical or exotic, they are slaves and second-rate citizens trying to past their hatred for humans. You have dwarves, but whereas most fantasy worlds give them some overall generic features then treat them as humans with a skill(i.e blacksmithing), DAO really embraces them. They arent just miners, their entire civilization exists under the ground. They aren't just good blacksmiths, they are geniuses of the trade. And much to my surprise, the world runs off of logic. Not on vague magical substances used as gorilla glue for leaps in logic or historical events that are never shown utilized to explain the current incoherent state of things, but rather the world makes sense. You'll find the rules are explained to you by the end of the prologue, and the world isn't afraid to abide by those rules, in fact, it thrives on them. And for these reasons I found myself in love with it. Starstruck. 
2.) Second is the story. The story is...much like the world, deceptively deep. Initially its pretty simple, you have a massive horde of very bad things coming from the south and you need to stop it. Typical fantasy. However said bad things are really just a force of nature. No less or more evil than a gust of wind or a river flooding. And the true antagonist is someone who lets fear guide him. I really dont want to spoil much more of the story, so I'm cutting it off there. I will however note one thing that DAO does right, and thats the protagonist. There's a fine line in RPGs between a developed protagonist(i.e. Geralt from the Witcher) who has their own history and personality, and an undeveloped one(e.g. Dragonborn from Skyrim) who is essentially a blank slate. BioWare has managed to do both of them, and do them exceptionally well. Your character is *YOURS*, your decisions and your motivations are yours, however your character is also developed, having six distinct backstories. And when I say six backstories, I don't mean a sheet of paper you read thats interesting, I mean a full one hour story segment that helps define your character and the setup of your story.
3.) Finally I want to touch on the characters. Oh BioWare really outdid themselves here. If you played Mass Effect or any of the TOR games you'll be quite content. Your party consists of a wide range of characters, who engage in banter with not just you but also each other, and you'll find that said banter is quite entertaining. And the characters are so well done. Your primary core group consists of an evil selfish witch, a goody-two shoes templar and a broken, delusional but also endearing bard. And very quickly you'll begin to stack the companions, having plenty of options to pick and choose who you want to take and where. Out of the eight or so companions, I found most to be well written and fairly deep barring one, the elven assassin who's only defining trait is that he's a man-slut. I'm not sure what BioWare was going with that character but killing him was certainly not the worst thing to happen in the game. Which brings me neatly along to my next point...you can kill your companions. Throughout the story or events you'll run into various points depending on your choices which will allow you to kill a companion, which is...awesome. The freedom to have those options, rather than just having an *essential* tag slapped on them(looking at you Bethesda) is fantastic. Though it could be argued its not as free as some rpgs which is absolutely true. Both Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Fallout 2 allowed me to kill my companions whenever I so desired(I only bring those up because ive played them). It seems like a weird thing to go off on a tangent on, but its actually quite a good exemplar of how the rpg treats player freedom. If a game allows you to murder primary characters off of a whim, the game takes your freedom very very seriously.

Last thing I want to touch on is the DLC. Its...okay? Awakening was good. Thats the best word for it, it was solid. The rest sorta fell short. Either reusing the same maps or just adding just another dungeon. 

With that I finish my review. Dragon Age: Origins is one of the best rpgs I have ever played. Its a game that has fantastic world building, characters and a deep story while also prioritizing player choice.",1637986301,1637986301,True,39,0,0.78183591365814209,0,True,False,False

I have only completed one full playthough, which took me 200+ hours. This, of course, is taking into account the fact that I tend to be a completionist and try to explore every bit of the game. However, even for those who may not care as much about completion, Dragon Age: Origins is sure to provide a lengthy adventure to get immersed into.

On top of this, the game offers a respectable amount of character customization. In creating a character, one can choose between several races and classes-- each of which affect how the story may turn out. In addition to being able to customize  the character you use, this is also a game where choices matter. A choice you make early in the game could end up having repercussions throughout. If you are the type of person who wants to feel the effects of your choices in games, this may be for you.

This, of course, is a review for the Ultimate Edition of the game, so I will also discuss the value of the additional DLC offered by the Ultimate Edition. The Ultimate Edition offers all of the DLC available for Dragon Age: Origins, which can offer several additional hours of gameplay on top of the base game. For me, the DLC took about 50 hours to complete. Of course, the DLC is also affected by one's character path and choices, so the DLC has some replayability value as well.

Overall, Dragon Age: Origins is a phenomenal game that any RPG fan should enjoy. Its developer, Bioware, has a history of developing high-quality RPGs, and this is certainly no exception. While the game may be a bit outdated in terms of graphics, it is still an enjoyable experience that one can play repeatedly without getting bored.",1480042977,1637812297,True,1,0,0.505988001823425293,0,True,False,False

When I first played it on Xbox 360 I described it as a 'Lord of the Rings' sized adventure, and while it definitely feels smaller in scope than that in modern day, I'd say the game itself holds up pretty well regardless. You really can't go wrong with this game, it has everything you could want in a fantasy RPG.

The only problem with the PC version is it has a few unfortunate bugs that cropped up in my playthrough, so be wary of that; for me the game crashed in at least three specific areas. They are not gamebreaking because they do have workarounds and they are not predictable for every player, so don't worry.

[h1] YANOGA REVIEW [/h1]


[b][u] GRAPHICS -  ★ ★ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
''Dragon Age'' was one of the first big Open-World RPG's and you while the Design still looks damn cool the overall graphical technic is quite outdated. On top there are SO MANY bugs in the PC-Version of this game that nothing really looks like it should be.

[b][u] MUSIC - ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ [/u][/b]
One of the greatest Fantasy-Soundtracks I've ever heard.

[b][u] STORY -  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★ [/u][/b]
A true ''Dark-Fantasy'' Story with lot of choices and different endings. Every Character feels alive and I remembered many scenes from my first play back in my teenage years. One of the greatest storys in RPG-games!

[b][u] GAMEPLAY -  ★ ★ ★ ★ ☆  [/u][/b]
The gameplay with his ''taktic-gameplay'' can feel slow sometimes but overall gives you good possibilitys to fight the way you like. The gameplay-loop of fighting and looting really hooked me.

[b][u] WORTH BUYING - ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ [/u][/b]
And know the biggest problem...
The PC-Version is fucking unplayable! 
So many bugs which are mostly crashing your whole game Is nothing I would recommend. Yes you could download Mods but I would suggest that developer put work in the shit they release. 
Dragon Age Origins as a game would definitly get a score of 90 or higher but with all that bugs and frustrating shit I never ever would play this on PC again.

 [b][u]    LENGTH [/u][/b]          : Played 8 Hours, You could play like 200-300 easily

[b][u]    BUGS    [/u][/b]      : To many & Gamebreaking
  
 [b][u]     PRICE [/u][/b]       : Paid 5€
  
 [b][u]     DIFFICULTY [/u][/b] : Medium

[h1] FINAL: 

40  / 100 [/h1]

Careful exposition of a vast but not overwhelming world yields an exciting and engaging story that is offset well by a sense of humour and reality provided by the characters. Choices have real consequences but the results match well with the thought processes behind any such decisions.

Combat can be a bit clunky with a DnD esque system that can sometimes rely on micromanagement of each individual character moment by moment but by enlarge provides an appropriate challenge and feel given the setting. The game is also on the longer side but if you enjoy it this should be something to relish.

The game is amazing, letting you take so many paths in the game

However, A BIG Warning when playing this game

There are countless bugs in this game..., I've crashed about a billion times, Once you get to Denerim there's a chance you'll constantly crash and won't be able to load up your save, making your current save useless unless download a patch for it. 

These crashes have really been annoying, i've never known a game to crash, but past the constant crashing the game is amazing

Just make sure you save regularly, or you might end up going quite far back and having to do alot of the quests again, because of the crash

Just like another reviewer who helped me
Heres a fix for the crashing =

easily in my top 5 games of all time.

Before playing, you must know that it is an old game that crashes due to new hardware. look up how to prevent crashes when visiting denerim. Nonetheless it's SSS+ tier.

I recommend playing DA:O UE in chronological order.

[b] And it isn't. [/b] 

There are so many things that I missed when I initially played it as a 10 year old scamp, and the PC edition's balancing is different from it's console counterparts. Combat on consoles was more action based, whereas the PC version leans more on tactical squad management. 

You can pause the game and issue commands to your companions using a large and varied amount of abilities that you get from a pretty in depth leveling system that includes 3 classes and a total of 18 specializations (6 per class). 

You decide in the beginning of the game your race (Human, Elf, Dwarf) and your origin of which there is 5 (with an optional extra origin exclusive to the expansion) that will determine where your character started from (City Elf to name one). This will affect the first 40ish minutes of gameplay with a specific story to your origin and be referenced throughout the game. 

The lore & story in this game are really great, and the amount of it is huge considering time of release, with almost 68,000 lines of dialogue (For reference, that's 8,000 more lines than Todd's favorite cash cow, Skyrim). 

Both the story being mostly nonlinear, and the decisions you make throughout the game that affect the plot adds a TON of replay value. 

The companions in DAO are all compelling with their own motivations to join your adventure with different combinations of them having unique banter between each-other as well as loyalty quests similar to Mass Effect's companion system. 

Romances are a thing in this game if you're into that (Hetero and Bi). 

With the steam version you get all of the DLC that includes several gameplay segments that adds to the story (including a companion). One of the DLCs (Awakening) is considered to be an expansion because of it's length (15-20hrs). 

Unfortunately, the main negative I can think of is bugs that were never patched so if you want to have a crash free experience I'll link a tutorial that I used at the end of this review if you want to learn [i] (just watch until the fixes section, everything else is optional).


 [/i] [b] Overall, this game is fantastic and I'm sad that it's kind of forgotten with other games of the era like Skyrim and Mass Effect completely overshadowing this underappreciated gem.

But so far, I'm impressed. And I'm willing to look past a lesser experience (according to others) in the sequels if it means I'll grow attached to the characters like I did here. This story comes the closest to the classic chivalry trope I've played so far. Of course, you could just be a heartless bastard as well. And when it comes to choices, your origin affects the story so heavily I see myself replaying later on to see everything that changes. Cinematic cutscenes, plenty of decision-making dialogue, and all wrapped up in a neat 80 hours (at least on an initial playthrough). And I highly recommend getting the complete, ""ultimate"" edition if you want a follow-up to what happens after the main game.

     But I still don't see it as the best of its genre. For how much the story draws you in, it's over before you realize, and on top of it there is filler content in the way of RPG's greatest sin, fetch quests. Look, for the newcomers: you're liable to find yourself lost trying to find X item and Y number of them, so remember to press TAB to highlight all the items you can interact with. You can also enable in the settings a shiny glow over containers that haven't been looted, but this won't tell you where that hidden lever or buried treasure is.

If you're interested in the combat, the story, or just a general involved experience, you won't be disappointed.

What it lacks in combat mechanics, it makes up for immeasurably in story. Prior to Dragon Age, I'd never encountered a gaming series that was so incredibly rich in lore. The character origins give you a good understanding of life for the common races of Ferelden, and the party members who join you in your pursuit to save Thedas, will give you interesting insight into the differing cultures and politics within the world itself which is further explored within the other games of the series. 

Though don't be fooled by the fantastical setting, there may be dwarves, elves, magic and dragons, but both Dragon Age: Origins and the games that follow do not shy away from the darker elements that plague the world and societies in it. Your race, class and background may be accepted by party members, but there is always someone who won't think twice about criticising a ""knife-ear"", ""duster"" or ""shemlen"" Warden regardless of the accomplishments you have to your name. (And that's just the tip of the iceberg compared to some elements of the societies within the world)

You can see the decline into what it is now if you play the DLC where you meet Anders. Your character is forced into not acting (your choices only look like they matter for flavour and shock factor, and only when the game wants your choices to matter, as in ""you WILL not look for this character and make them angry and----, so that they will be there later on to steal from you"", which is not bad in other games, but here is irritatingly obvious, particularly because you can see it in the dialogue, as the usual, more extended, options are not present), in the DLC they make your character also makes faces regardless of what option you choose, and you are overall, regardless of what you say, pushed towards 

SPOILER  UHHH! Morrigan bad, I am angry at you! SPOILER

and it is overall, like Dragon Age 2 and Inquisition, just your typical thing with shock only when they want it, the rest with ""american comic"" things (too much humour, your character is dumb regardless of your past or choices and logic), grind to get to the ""hopefully better"" later part and dangling things everywhere to play on fan-favourites and past events.
You can see this in Leliana's DLC as well. [SPOILER  If you killed her or she was not met and died when the Blight spread to the town, she is still alive in Inquisition, regardless of what you did SPOILER] and one can see that is because someone that made the game just likes their character too much to care what the player's story did (DM fatal flaw).

I honestly think that this game has a lot to offer in terms of lore significances and gives us their unique takes on fantasy story in accordance with The Lord Of The Rings world. I recommend this game on the behalf of traditional single player rpg that doesn't heavily involved in microtransaction besides story dlcs (still this is unbearable). The good things that i can say are the story is great, the gameplay mechanic is consider handy in a more modern western rpg at the time and still alright, the varity of spells-talents-skill are enormous, the characters are interesting enough for you to care, a long game that doesn't bore you to death and in fact makes you want more, a very humane and realistic description of what this world actually is in some way, etc.   The bad things are the bugs, the bloody bugs. Bugs, glitch, and hard crash are a quite frequent occurences and the only way for you to not go insane is searching for fixes and mods which the community graciously provides. I dare say that old games like this pretty buggy and the devs just don't care anymore about it after the last dlc came and left the community to fix it with mods and proper fixes for them with no extra cost is both sinister yet logical and thank the maker they don't or should i say haven't discontinue the mods use in the community. The last but not least you should try it at least once if you new to rpgs and it is easily understood story and gameplay wise just make sure to dowload the fixes and important rudimentary mods for the game to work properly. Alas, if EA is watching please remaster the series and make a trilogy definitive edition of DA series I know it won't make billion of dollars like FIFA or any loot boxes/ suprise mechanics in your current games but i can make sure it will make your fanbase happy and help to restore Bioware name in the midst of many controversy it had commited these past years (Both EA and Bioware are equally in the fault).",1633635133,1633635133,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- If you want to use mods, you'll have issues. If you use a mod manager, the game either activates the DLC or it activates the mods (and decides you no longer own the DLC). I installed my mods manually and then the game recognised both the DLC and the mods.

On to the review:

Dragon Age: Origins is a near perfect game - I was playing Skyrim at the time, but found it rather cold and was looking for something more and found it in Origins, which immediately became my favourite game of all time. Dragon Age Inquisition is a very close contender but I have a profound emotional attachment to Origins which gives it the number one spot. For anyone wondering, I previously owned this on CD but the disk got damaged, so have now bought it on Steam - actual time spent +100 hours.

Here's what it does right:

- One of the most impressive things about this game is the 'spontaneous' conversations among party members. You'll be walking along and your party will chat to each other - there are hundreds of conversations and even if you save before a trigger point, it's highly unlikely you'll get the same conversation again. It is highly unpredictable as it plays out between certain characters so the conversations you hear depends on who's currently in your party. These can be revealing, funny or just interesting, but are a major high point.

- Connected to that is 'spontaneous' cutscenes - these appear when your relationship with a party member has become high enough. These moments can either be friendship or romantic in nature.

- Branching love stories.  Like any relationship, love needs to build to a point where declarations are made and if you choose, the relationship can be consummated. You can easily sabotage a relationship, e.g. cheating, but can also create a deep bond. This can have some highly memorable and often spontaneous relationship cutscenes.

- The outstanding voice actors - the characters are so well cast that they feel like real people and you develop likes and dislikes to people like in real life. High points are Alistair, Morrigan, Zevran, Loghain just to mention a few.

- Breathtaking music - the haunting Leliana's Song is positively exquisite, for example.

- A vibrant and complicated world with religions, politics and cultures which have been fleshed out to a truly astonishing degree - there's so much history here that you could spend hours reading the codex alone.

- The characters are the same - complicated, living people each with their own backstory and motivations, and sometimes secrets, and you become very attached to them. You can build or break down relationships with your party members - sometimes through direct interaction and sometimes through your actions and decisions. This can drive away a party member or create a friendship/love for life.

- A elaborate conversation system which means you can spend long periods of time just talking to your many party members. You'll often be startled at where you end up, depending on your choices and finding out surprising new information.

- Your decisions matter - sometimes the consequences are small but others change the ending of the game. There are multiple instances of this, sometimes even changing who your allies are in the final battle. This means great replay value.

- 4 party members and you can easily switch between them and play different characters, or help out a character in a fight.

- Straight forward inventory system, no searching for things or struggling to equip something.

- The fight system is easy to use and the skills are easy to understand and can make or break you if you make bad choices. E.g. the coercion skill allows you to convince people you are right and it can work on very unexpected people... if it's high enough. Tactics allow you to program automatic responses - e.g. healing, drinking mana, responses to specific enemy types etc.

- You can easily loot corpses from a distance with your character auto-running towards it. This is removed in Inquisition, for example, a rare mistake on their part. This is extremely convenient.

- The game is exceptionally stable, allowing you to use literally dozens of mods simultaneously, without the game crashing or causing characters to act strangely. The only issues I've ever had is either a mod not working (conflicting with another mod - those often have 'compatibility' files to solve this) and occasionally a weird graphic like invisible skin. The mod system is incredibly easy - either just paste the file into a separate folder under the program files, or use a modder program to install. Removing a mod is as simple as deleting the file in the folder or uninstalling it via the modder program. This allows highly creative players to add fantastic extra content - sometimes just outfits or hair, but sometimes entire sections that weren't in the game before. Perfect examples being: additional recruitable party members, wedding and funeral scenes (which shockingly weren't in the actual game, for shame developers!) and great character scenes, which just adds to the already complex characters.

There are two things I didn't enjoy:

a)  A tedious and frustrating Fade section in the middle which is about 3 hours of wandering around trying to figure out what to do. Solution: there's a mod on Nexusmods which skips the entire section. Seriously, play it through once then download the mod so you never have to play it again.

b) The Awakening expansion. It changes things about gameplay that were perfect to begin with, and the story is tedious, depressing with all but one familiar character gone. It's like a completely different game, like a soulless husk of Origins. I played it through once and never again.

Bottom line: this game has a complex, branching narrative with fantastic realistic relationships, world and characters. Your decisions matter and can have serious consequences. The continuity is amazing as you can import your character into Dragon Age II and your unique world will continue. I have played this game through on multiple characters and come back to it about once a year to play it again. It stays with you, both the world and the characters. It is the game I got the most value out of and have never tired of it. Choice and consequence games are the norm now, but this game showed what you could do with it.

However in this spiritual successor its an original richly detailed world instead of piggy-backing on Dungeons and Dragons properties. This makes it far more accessible to newer RPG players with the world heavily fleshed out between detailed characters, quests, and written entries which you collect throughout the game.

The combat interface is both a direct descendant of Interplay's classic titles and a vast improvement over the old isometric view. It still requires you to somewhat babysit your chosen party of companions but the AI is greatly expanded and after a while you can speed through most minor battles. Your chosen character and your choices in their development will greatly affect your choice of strategy and tactics and while development choices are moderately limited I found their offered a nice balance between individuality and linear gameplay.

The nature of Thedas makes it more akin to Game of Thrones or even The Witcher as most characters you meet are shades of morality which gives you quite a bit of affordability in roleplaying the main character. You'll encounter racist humans, misunderstood monsters, and plans-within-plans of political intrigue. You'll often be faced with deciding where your priorities lie giving alot to those players who enjoy ""living in the skin"" of their characters.

While the game can sometimes be frustrating even on normal difficulty it offers a lot to a pretty wide range of RPG players and maintains accessibility for newer players while allowing for challenge for older ones. The DLCs are also nice smaller chunks of expansions that don't require long commitments of time and are easily finished in an hour or two of playtime. I found Leiliana's Song to be the most compelling especially as I was rather focused on her as my love interest. The romance options are limited in the game but each romance is very compelling and it's easy to get emotionally invested in all of the companions.

All-in-all the game, like many of the rest of the great stories, has aged rather well and is a must buy for anybody who enjoys enriching stories, memorable characters, and appreciate an excellent RPG world.",1633467543,1633467543,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hear the games get worse as they go on but I cannot personal confirm that, the story may not be the most unique thing ( Orc like monsters with a twist invade the realm, and you must defend , etc ) But unlike other RPG's this is classic Bioware RPG greatness. You get ACTUAL choices in this game that actually make a difference in your game and characters interactions and even future opportunities. And unlike other more sub-par RPG's that give you a mere 2-3 dialogue or choice options for actions, this game gives you 5-7 usually. Sometimes so many you have to scroll!. So no matter what character you are and how you want to play you can nearly be assured there will be options for you to choose that seem right for your personal guy/girl!. And also when it comes to choice and standing out from other party based RPG's you can really choose who you want to be with you. If you dislike someone you encounter not only can you just remove them from your party, but you can negatively interact with their character and literally make them hate you. The coin also goes the other way and some party members can be made to like you and give benefits, and of course since it's Bioware there is romance options too. The gameplay is not full Divinity style turn based, but it does have a live/stop and go pause hybrid type that I find I easily adapted to.

[i][b]EDIT:[/b] I managed to make it playable by downloading 1.05 version exe and applying LAA.exe fix to it. Both came from questionable sources and made me uncomfortable. I'm only giving a thumb up because Dragon Age itself is an amazing game. Below is my original review, describing the glitches before the LAA.exe fix I had. The fix fixed everything.[/i]

Steam's screenshot button works only half the time. I still press it out of habit and sometimes that crashes the game. Sometimes it crashes just because. Sometimes fog is rendered glitchily. Sometimes armor on a character keeps changing. Sometimes loading a save will crash and you need an earlier save. Sometimes the world map is rendered empty and you can't click on anything. Once, that forced me to revert to an early save, because you have to click on world map to get out of your camp.

I'm now at a point where I've tried the fixes suggested in Community Hub and tried a bunch of nVidia control panel adjustment, but the game just crashes in Denerim and a Denerim save no longer loads. I have to load an earlier save in the camp, travel to Denerim again, but after a minute it crashes again.

Win10, GTX970, 1440p. In Game's ""Display"" settings, I see video memory is listed as a negative number, suggesting it's too big for the address size used by the game.

In so many ways, Dragon Age: Origins feels incredibly inspired, a product born from passion with some fascinating design choices that almost all end up winners. It's not just a great game for its time, it compares surprisingly well with modern games as well and in some aspects outshining them. I doubt that there will ever be a game quite like this one ever again, which is reason enough to play it.

With that said, this is not a perfect game. It's unique and brilliant, but it's also flawed. Technically it's so-so, for starters. I had one crash forcing me down to Medium graphic settings and a couple of bugs that cost me a few hours of progress, which means that I was probably lucky compared to some out there. The game has a lot of flashy ability effects (especially aura abilities), something that makes the game struggle in terms of framerate. That was what caused my one crash, as I loaded into a room that had two enemies activate their aura effects at once, something the game couldn't handle. [b]Frequent saving with a new save file for each area is recommended. Quicksaving only is a bad idea.[/b] Also test the game out immediately after buying, given Steams refund policy and the problems many others seem to have had getting it to run.

Moreover, it’s worth noting that, as the game was released in the late 00's, the game was affected by the brown/grey colour curse. All the colours are muddied and washed out, something that you might argue fits the world’s overall bleakness but becomes pretty tiring over time. There are a lot of plains, forests, ruins and caves, and that’s pretty much it. The variety does improve in the DLC, mainly Awakening, but it only highlights how drab the environments are in the main game.

As for combat, it might be an aquired taste, but I really like it. You have a [b]lot[/b] of control over how combat will play out; setting behaviour in the detailed Combat Tactics menu works incredibly well, the pace is never an issue as you can go however fast or slow you want with the Pause function, and every ability has a clear function and animation so that you always know what’s going on. The variety of abilities is staggering, especially for mages, and pretty much all of them feel powerful and flashy. The impression I have from RPGs in general is that they’re either very complicated and intricate, making them difficult to understand, or more focused on presentation leading to them lacking depth. Dragon Age: Origins strikes a balance between the two and I think it does it better than any other game I’ve personally seen. It’s worthy of praise, but naturally it’s also a matter of taste. For me, it fit perfectly.

However, combat isn’t just about the systems or your own inputs, it’s also about enemies. This is also where the game stumbles a bit. It’s the volume that is the problem – there are way too many enemy encounters in this game. Some sections of the game literally have three enemy encounters in the same corridor. There are enemies in every room, around every corner, sometimes spawning out of thin air. If that wasn’t bad enough, there is some real difficulty in many encounters, which forces you into certain character choices and means that every encounter has you scanning the horizon for mages, who can make your life miserable really fast. It’s all clearly overtuned, and I would actually recommend to turn the difficulty down for standard enemies and turn it back up for bosses, simply to make the laborious sections a little bit faster.

That’s a lot of negativity thus far, but this is the end of it, because where Dragon Age: Origins truly shines is in the story and the characters. They are bars that other games should aim for. The quests have complex, deep narratives with a moral ambiguiety that makes for some hard choices, where choosing a side is not uncomplicated and where the right thing to do isn’t always clear. Dialogue options are varied and refined, giving you a lot of control and agency in how things play out. And the characters! Every character in this world reacts and has an opinion on what is happening in the world and the choices you make. Your origin affects how they see you, what options you have in certain situations, the comments they make. It’s all weaved so delicately that I’m amazed that this game came out over ten years ago.

And among all the characters in the game, the people in your party take the price. There isn’t a dud among them, every single character in your party is interesting or entertaining or most often both. Some are obvious from the start, like Morrigan and Alistair with their witty banter, while some are more subtle, like the grim Sten whose armor slowly cracks under the playful poking of the cheerful Leliana. Every single character shows their strength in time if given the opportunity. They will give their opinion in conversations and judge you on your choices, and if they don’t like what you do they might leave or worse. There is [b]so[/b] much care put in here, in every detail, in the amount of conversations and banter they have with each other and yourself, and the voice acting is absolutely golden to boot. I love the party members in this game and I’ll remember every single one in the main game and probably most in Awakening as well.

This review is too long, and I’ve probably criticised the game more than it deserves. It’s important to emphasise just how much the good parts of this game outshines the bad. Dragon Age: Origins is without question one of the best RPGs I’ve played or even heard of, and definitely a high point of the era it was produced in.

- Really good and easy to use modding capabilities

Cons:
- The glitches, there's a lot of them, one of them nearly game breaking, had to use console commands to get around it

You really have two ways of handling combat, the first is the typical action/hack and slash gameplay which is very common on console and the second is RTS-style micro-managing that is available on console BUT PC has the top-down camera and additional button layouts that make it way more tolerable.

if you do want to go through all the trouble anyways heres a couple of solutions that were not as easy to find.
First youl need

1. If the launcher crashes when it trys to configure your game for the first time you need to create a file in ""Documents\BioWare\Dragon Age"" called systeminformation.xml
2. If your launcher still crashes when pressing play. there are a couple of solutions one is to edit the params on program launch. This solution did not work for me but its available online. What worked for me is using the Vortex mod launcher. You'll need this mod (Frosty's Updated Dao.exe for steam) ( https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonage/mods/5368 ) first. Then when on the Dashboard there instead of pressing the play press the 3 small dots and go to edit if your SteamAPPId is not 47810 change it to that then save and try and launch the game from there it may take a couple of tries or a restart for it to start working but once it does it works every time.
3. If you try to load your save in Denerim and it crashes, then try loading a different save in a different location first then load the one in Denerim
4. Besides that if your having graphical issues and more crashes there is a post in the community that is supposed to help.",1628949504,1630612944,False,2,1,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

The one negative: It is rather overwhelming to start off, there is a LOT of lore and mechanics to go through but once you have the hang of it, it makes sense. Levelling up comes at about the right pace not to bore you but not to constantly overwhelm you with more options and mechanics. Granted, the gear and options really are too complicated a bit much but if you can't decide between two things just pick randomly, nothing is powerful enough to completely ruin your game if you pick something else.

Positives: 
There are brilliant quests coming out of everywhere, some which affect others. Even the fetch quests are engaging and full of lore, intrigue or consequence . Just the core game can take 100 hours or more if you try to do every side quest (took me 115 hours) and really listen to everything. Then this versions comes with long and detailed DLCs!

ALL the dialogue is spoken and the voice acting is decent. There are a dizzying number of vocal options which have small but noticeable effects on game play and the epilogue. Depending on your race and even some other events the dialogue can change. You DO have to listen to everything that is said (or read the subtitles) to understand what is going on but it is a ROLE PLAYING GAME.

There is a LOT of lore, though you don't really need to read it all to play the game, just to be immersed in the world. It is really playing out a story which you can really help to wright. I would HIGHLY recommend just role playing a character rather than trying for the 'best' outcome but if you do want to do that, there are pretty good guides online.

There are lots of great rewards no matter your class or playstyle, and all the classes and sub-class playstyles are worth playing. Rogues have a few things which ONLY they can do but even if you don't pick a rogue, you get rogue companions so pretty much nothing is denied in the game. Happily, nothing vital or unique is hidden in locked chests, so even if you don't keep a rogue in your party you don't lose anything except some profit. You can really build the character you want organically to fit how you actually are playing, not a maybe incorrect guess on how you might want to play

The graphics aren't perfect but they are nice enough and there is lots of detail.

That was a time back when everything was Dual / Quad core processors and 32 bit systems with 2-4-8 GB RAM. So, trying to run games like this on a modern 64 bit, 4+ core/thread, 4-8-16-32 GB RAM system requires a few settings changes.

We need to mimic the hardware / software setup available when it was released:-
* Set the application ""exe"" file's affinity in Windows Task Manager (Ctl+Alt+Del > Task Manager > Details TAB > right click DAOrigins.exe > set affinity) by ticking only the core (thread) numbers needed and use no more than 4 (personally I use the odd numbered cores/threads - i.e. 1, 3, 5 & 7);
* Set ""daorigins.exe"" to run in Windows Compatibility mode by going to the (...\steam\steamapps\common\Dragon Age Ultimate Edition) installation directory >  right click ""daorigins.exe"" > Properties > Compatibility TAB and set the Compatibility Mode to ""Win 7"";
* Force it to run in DX9 mode by adding the ""-dx9"" switch to the run time parameters (right click on the game's name in Steam > Properties > Launch Options);
* Lower the graphics settings to ""high"" or lower.

These settings work well for my setup and have reduced game issues without needing to use a 4 GB RAM patch. Hope this information helps anyone else struggling with running older games.",1630071291,1630071291,True,5,0,0.574587643146514893,0,True,False,False

For the past decade, Bioware has been heralded as the undisputed king of roleplaying games, largely because of a single game: Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Those who have experienced the tale need no explanation, but for those whose gaming histories are lacking, I shall say simply that Shadows of Amn is quite definitively the quintessential title of the entire roleplaying genre. The success of Shadows of Amn fueled Bioware to develop the massively successful Star Wars: Knights Old Republic, Neverwinter Nights and its many expansions, Jade Empire, and more recently Mass Effect. Sadly, none of Bioware's subsequent titles managed to fully recapture the raw quality of gaming present in Shadows of Amn. So it was that when Bioware began to bill their latest RPG, Dragon Age: Origins as the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate, we stood up, and we took notice.

Dragon Age: Origins appears to offer us exactly what we wanted—a return to the depth of gameplay we found in Shadows of Amn. Bioware promised us deep gameplay, a strong and compelling narrative, unique characters, absurd quantities of side-quests and banter and content of all kinds. The question we are now faced with is this: did Bioware deliver on its promises?

As is often the case with such things, our answer is both yes and no. Dragon Age: Origins offers a stronger gameplay mechanic, more content, and better writing than nearly any other ""Western"" roleplaying game in the past decade. To be perfectly honest, the only other game that even begins to approach the depth and character of Bioware's latest title is CD Projekt Red's phenomenal RPG, The Witcher. In some places, Dragon Age: Origins manages to succeed the standard set by Baldur's Gate, yet in others it falls short. Nevertheless, gamers looking for a strong, immersive RPG experience need look no further than Dragon Age: Origins, which is rapidly taking its place as one of the best fantasy titles produced after Bioware killed off the Infinity Engine nearly one decade ago.

Dragon Age: Origins is by no means a perfect game, or another ""quintessential"" example of the genre. It has its faults and its faults are many, but it also has its own, unique charm. And make no mistake: Dragon Age is most-certainly one of the very best games we have seen in a very, very long time.

Picked up DAO after recently completing MELE and wanting to check out Biowares other titles. I had no prior knowledge on anything about DAO and bought it without watching any gameplay etc. Expecting another action RPG and I was very wrong. 

The story is gripping and keeps you engaged throughout the main game and DLC which is ALOT of content. I liked the combat style as well as the tactic system to micromanage all your Allies. The ability to be able to independently control each ally made for some interesting gameplay and rewarding with harder encounters. The loot system isn't much different to most games with having different item slots and higher tier levels of gear etc. The 3 different playable classes each with a few choices of specs creates for plenty of different ways to play the game and keep multiple playthroughs interesting. I didn't mess around much with trap making, poison, enchanting etc but from what I had done seemed like a good system. I found DAO to be extremely challenging to get the hang of early game and also certain encounters throughout (fk the Harvester) 

Now for the not so good parts.

Staircases are by far the hardest boss in the game, of my 70hrs in game I probably spent 5-6hrs trying to traverse staircases always becoming bugged out on the top step, not game breaking but definitely became a hindrance. The fade level is one of the most boring and annoying levels I have experienced in a game, there is a mod to avoid this mission entirely which would prove useful if intending to play through the game more then once. The random encounters when travelling between locations became dragging and boring. This game does crash ALOT, I was able to cut crashes by following some of the guides that can be found on steam but you will still experience crashes at the most random points. Due to the lack of auto saves crashes can cause you to lose upto an hours worth of work. Would recommend spamming F5 (autosave) on the regular for this reason.

I used a few QOL mods to create for a better playing experience, these mods were FtG UI aand FtG Quickbar. These mods made playing on 1440p and 4k more playable due to the game being an older title.",1629615764,1629615764,True,1,0,0.505494534969329834,0,True,False,False

It was a little tricky for me to get a hang of the combat at first, since I hadn't played anything quite like this before, but once I finally got good I was really enjoying myself, and that's not even mentioning the fantastic story. So far I have only played as a human noble, but I absolutely plan on going back through and playing the other origins. 

The characters are also all wonderful and they play off of each other nicely. The camp offers a quick and easy hub for you and your party members making those special character moments hard to miss. My favorites were easily Morrigan, Alistair, and Oghren. 

The story is full of interesting and important choices and missions can even vary slightly depending on who you have in your party. You have a wealth of dialogue choices and lore is oozing from every conversation in this game. There's loads of intrigue and wit that will surely keep you invested in every conversation.

Combat plays surprisingly well. I went into this game thinking it would be stiff and awkward, and while it can be a little tricky get the hang of at first if you're someone like me who has never really played a game like this up until now, once you do start using the abilities and tactics system, the combat is very satisfying. There are loads of abilities and passive traits you can apply to your character to give them various boosts and specializations. The amount of builds you can make is seemingly innumerable.

I only really have a couple of gripes about this game. I found that there were a few points where the game play difficulty seemed to spike really abruptly and I also felt there were some puzzles in the game that were a little too vague and I ended up solving them by trial and error. But these issues were few and far between and they certainly shouldn't give you any hesitation to buy this game. 

The only other tip I have is this: After you leave the kocari wilds in the beginning of the game, and you are truly out on your own with your party, make sure you explore the village of Lothering thoroughly. My first time through I accidentally missed a character I could recruit and had to reload to acquire them.

After fiddling with settings, I was able to get a stable experience- but my first dozen hours were not pleasant. I have decided in retrospect, however, to let that slide. But before you play, I strongly recommend that you tweak things FIRST and ensure the game is stable, before arriving at a difficult battle and losing 2 hours of unsaved progress.

Now, on to the meat and potatoes.

Story: While it appears relatively generic insofar as it follows a traditional fantasy arc, Origin's story line is nevertheless as engaging as it is robust. More than any other game thus far in the Dragon Age franchise, it builds steadily to a crescendo by using the lore surrounding its characters to produce an impactful conclusion. The standalone DLCs are also enjoyable, and provide an extra dozen or so hours of gameplay packaged as a welcome epilogue to the player's story.

World Building: The team at BioWare did a fantastic job introducing players to the world of Dragon Age, without overwhelming them with cutscenes or boring them with tutorials. Though there are some topics that are not explored as thoroughly as I would have liked, there is significant depth available to anyone who is willing to read codex entries. That, unfortunately, is one of the major shortfalls of Origins. With a codex that is poorly organized and frustrating to use, I found myself lacking the patience to sift through information that I didn't need to complete quests.

Characters: While the range in quality between the worst and best squad mates might be larger in Origins than in other Dragon Age games, the best really do stand out. Not only are most of the romance options extremely well written and developed, but even the more bland members of the player's team have a plethora of interesting dialogue contributions throughout the story. And, though I dislike the mechanic of gaining squad mate approval through gift-giving, there are nearly enough opportunities to avoid this by simply talking with them frequently at camp throughout the story. The massive excitement over characters like Morrigan returning in Dragon Age: Inquisition is a good example of how fantastic Origins was in terms of allowing the player to connect with their team.

Gameplay: Origins was created at a crossroads in game design evolution, and it tends to divide audiences into hostile camps. Personally, I don't mind the somewhat old-fashioned RPG style combat, but it certainly doesn't appeal to everyone. Overall, one of the more frustrating aspects for me about the gameplay was the challenge of trying to use any class other than a mage. This continues somewhat in Dragon Age II, but is even more noticeable in Origins. Magic- perhaps intentionally- is very, very strong in this game. Trying to use a rogue or warrior main character is not only somewhat boring, but also less effective. Add to this the insane strength of some enemies, and the game can become frustratingly challenging, to the point where it sometimes tore me away from enjoying the story and character elements that really make Origins shine.

Music: If you launch Origins and listen for a few moments, any words I use to describe the quality of the game's soundtrack will be unnecessary. But it isn't just the background music, it's the inclusion of songs at key moments in the story that really took me by surprise. Hearing Leliana sing (no spoilers) was shockingly emotional, and of a quality that I did not anticipate. The music and sound of Origins is expertly threaded through all of its other elements, and makes for a delightful and impressive experience.

Conclusion: After having played all of the Dragon Age games currently released (three of them at the time of writing), Origins holds a special place in my heart. Without any pressure from EA, BioWare was able to pour so much of their creativity and time into Origins that it's no wonder Dragon Age II- which was developed from start to finish in 16 months- endured so much criticism. This game is massive in the breadth and depth of its lore, and still extremely enjoyable even 15 years after its release. Whether you're one of those people that jumped straight into Inquisition, or you've never played any games in this franchise, I highly recommend that you give Origins a try.",1627573912,1629413312,True,0,0,0.447585374116897583,0,True,False,False

More than any other RPG I have played, it achieves the rank of epic.

What I was especially impressed with were two things:
1) Dragon Age: Origins rarely offers you simple moral choices. The game's introductions give a good foretaste of how often finding the right thing to do in this game is not so simple, if there is a right choice. For example, when you have to make political choices, your choices are almost always a case of weighing the lesser of two evils. The world of the game is complicated and nuanced enough to make cause and effect difficult to predict, and you frequently encounter choices where good arguments could be advanced for each option, and that really helps the immersion factor. 

2) Dragon Age: Origins makes great use of its M rating to bring you some dark fantasy and horror you might not have been expecting. Rather than feeling gratuitous, the horror elements helped the story by showing you what was at stake in the world and how far people can fall. It also made some villains very easy to hate, which shows the writers were doing their job.

Gripes? Well, I was annoyed at some of the game mechanics, especially how much backtracking I had to do due to lack of rapid transit systems.
It may also just be my PC or the Steam version of the game, but I've had a lot of trouble with weird textures on models and environments, and with game crashes.
Oh, and I was disappointed with how little there was to do with the elves out in the forest. So many of the other places you visit felt flushed out and complex, but that part of the game felt very small-scale.

In spite of these issues, I still found Dragon Age: Origins (and its expansions, especially Awakening and the brutal Golems of Amgarrak) a compelling, thought-provoking, disturbing, and challenging RPG on an epic scale.",1629081038,1629081038,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game was my introduction to Dragon Age back in.. I believe 2017? and I've been playing ever since. 

It was worth getting this copy. No matter the bugs. At least in my opinion. Now I get to finally experience all of the DLC as well. Something I had never been able to do.

100/10. One of the best games I've played. Has amazing characters, amazing story. Amazing dlc..I've cried a good amount of times with this game series.

As I have never played any Dragon age games but only heard about them, this was a new experience for me. For 2021 of course the gameplay is old and clunky which was a hell pain for me as a rogue. Mage class is the best and most OP class in the game. I realized it very late...very...
I loved the whole story and the impact you make with your choices. I did have some questions to some moments in the story where logic was thrown into trash but overall it was nice.

I couldn't finish Awakening because of a glitch that crashed the game when trying to chat with a story character. 
I did finish the With Hunt DLC because I did romance Morrigan in the base game and wanted to complete the story.

You will ask why I have not that many hours even with finished Base game. Pretty simple. It gets very boring the more you play. The further you progress, the more you have a feeling that the game is progressing very slowly and you mentaly have no health to continue. I didn't fiinish other DLCs.

I think it'd actually be an OK (at least mediocre) game if I hadn't been so let down from the lofty expectations from this title. I understand that there's no accounting for taste, but here's my criticisms with the game itself (and not related to performance based issues).

Combat is pretty slow and felt to me like it lacked crunch. I don't enjoy baldur's gate the way I enjoy xcom or final fantasy tactics, so maybe I'm being unfair somehow. It's just not clicking for me. The strategy aspect of character building feels off. Here, I feel obligated to make a tank, a thief, a wizard, and a healer. And gear sucks. And half the spells seem either bad or uninspired. And moving around and looking around feels bad. And companion AI is braindead, so you have to fix their dumb behaviors.

I was struck by just how thin the camp hub experience is. Companions are laconic, not compelling, not memorable cast of inserts that have little to no motivation to actually be around the main character. Their overly shiny eyes roll around in their eye sockets to sickening effect. I wish I knew where they were looking. You're sometimes punished for trying to talk with them about their already uninteresting topics. Punishment that is totally erased and made meaningless by the absurd gift system.

The themes themselves are somewhat flat. I think the problem here is Bioware uses the trope of ""special warrior caste beats ultimate evil"" with a sprinkle of formulaic twist fantasy theme a bit too much. After kotor and jade empire and mass effect, I've seen it ad nauseum.

There's no denying that it's a well-built world full of lore to explore and sprawling locales. The visuals are really not that bad, either. I've read in other reviews that the storyline opens up and becomes a lot more palatable. But I can't imagine myself suffering through the rest of the game to get there.

So, did I very probably ruin my chance to experience this game at its peak by waiting a decade and some change to play it? Did my curmudgeonly ass overindulge on Bioware leading up to that point? Do I just not care for cRPGs? Whatever the combination of factors, I wouldn't recommend playing DA:O",1628719709,1628719709,False,0,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False
