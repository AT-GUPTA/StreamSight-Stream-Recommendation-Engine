If I didn’t have complete and utter faith in Hideo Kojima, Norman Reedus, and Mads Mikkelsen, I don’t think I would ever have played this game, but give it a chance! One of the best original stories I have ever played if not the best.

[h2]Story[/h2]
I almost want to cry trying to comment on the story Ha ha hah… this is so difficult to sensibly put into words…The world is set after what could be referred to as an extinction event, death now transcends all understanding with people needing to be burnt to prevent further casualties lest they be swallowed by the death stranding which are entities similar in shape to humans now tied to the world through what resembles an umbilical cord pervading the earth, and wherever they are unique weather phenomena called time fall also persists causing rapid time acceleration or aging wherever the rain touches.

The world unequipped to deal with this event found its infrastructure rapidly destroyed and the nations people withdrawn into themselves, cut off from all others. You follow the story of Sam Porter Bridges a man with psychological conditions that he finds best enables him to live by transporting packages when no one else would risk venturing into the now harsh world, and living alone. Despite this his history ties him to a greater fate and destiny than he would like to acknowledge. As Sam comes to grips with this destiny, the player helps to shape the world into one connected through technology now possible due to the new connection with time and death.

Ultimately this story, despite how drastically differently the people of the world perceive it, revolves around death and understanding one self. Help Sam keep on keeping on towards a brighter future for himself and others, and eventually help him keep the bonds with others he so cherishes, by battling the terrain, people lost in their ways, death itself, through blood, sweat…. And ♥♥♥♥.

That is how I would try and summarise the task in playing through the story. I will say this, it really is an interesting story if you give it a chance, and invest yourself in it.

[h2]Level design[/h2]
I almost feel level design is not the right word to use, as it is more like world design. Death stranding almost exclusively occurs outside in an open world environment. The reason for this being Sam’s job and life occurs outside. This being the case the designers developed a variety of terrain for the players to traverse as opposed to simpler level design such as buildings or more structures in a flatter open world with less intricacies focused on the outside than in.

Sam therefore has the challenge of having to move across a world that is entirely uneven and natural, as opposed to manoeuvring the typically unnaturally flat designed worlds like GTAV. As such the physics and mechanics of the world centre mostly around how you traverse in the world to overcome the terrain to get to your destination, and how Sam does this is up to the player and the tools they have on them, or at their disposal. The game has been likened to walking simulator as quite rightly, you are having to manage aspects of life closer to walking in the real world then most other objectives in games you would come across. This however should not be considered a negative, and no less challenging than other platforming games as the management of the items Sam has to bring with him to his destination require pristine treatment as the recipient needs those items. Risk jumping across a crevasse with a 15 metre drop? Well that would probably kill you if you don’t land it first off, and what about the 50 kg’s worth of packages on your back? Maybe take the long way, or use a ladder, or use a rope to get down and out, or jump it using a specially made exoskeleton to enforce your physical capabilities, or maybe try using a bike in rugged or slippery terrain? All comes with risks and rewards and is cleverly thought out. As you get on later in the game you have access to more infrastructure better enabling travel by vehicle, foot, or other means.

[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
The level of gameplay variety is a bit hard to cover entirely, but assuming you understand the level design, and how it implies careful management of Sam’s body and physical capabilities we can move on past those interactions with the world itself and onto more normal aspects of gameplay with enemies and tools outside the traversal section.

[h3]Enemies[/h3]
So death stranding has two or three main types of enemies, simply put, humans and death stranding entities. Human enemies typically relate to mules and they are motivated by greed of taking things from you, the game means this literally… maybe if you have nothing on you, they do not bother you. Aside from this there are terrorists… which kind want to kill you, so yeah it is all in the name with human characters. A variety of methods exists for both sides with how to deal with your human counter parts, keeping in mind a lethal take down has extreme repercussions by which I mean the death stranding kind of eventually causes an eruption equal to a nuclear crater. So non lethal is typically the way to go. With this being the case the player can choose to knock out, incapacitate, electrocute, or otherwise disable human players to progress through territories under enemy control. Doing so on a wide scale has benefits of allowing npc porters to traverse more safely as well as automated systems to traverse more safely.

The player has access to a variety of tools to effect the engagement, ranging from movement support on the terrain for greater manoeuvrability with your package load… no innuendos please, as well as the weapons themselves, with non-lethal grenades, rope close quarters combat, firearms a variety, bola gun for non lethal, and use of your BB… a baby biological tool that senses death stranding and operates your terrain detector and flashlight… yeah no good way to say that. Stealth is always an option, but your enemies have detection tools and traps too. Keeping in mind what you use incorporates into what you must carry means you must always maintain a well kept inventory to make sure you are not overloading yourself or crippling your ability to reach your end goal.

Touching now on the death stranding, the unique aspect of this game is how you go about defeating death in a way. How you achieve this is ultimately a spoiler in the story, but suffice to say it is all down to Sam. You are able to make some serious weapons that allow you to deal serious damage to these monsters, however it costs resources to make these like everything sometimes you are better off trying to avoid a fight and running.

[h2]Graphics and sound[/h2]
Graphics in the game are important but only so much in allowing you to experience the world in all it offers with its various visual effects made through particle physics, cloth physics, water physics, etc . It is quite obviously a natural beauty game presenting some of the best environments for pictures the gaming world has to offer yet, rivalling Red Dead Redemption and surpassing it in some aspects.

In regards to the sound, it has some very unique and well made folly sounds, with a lot of effort being made to increase the immersion of the player in the world. Keeping in mind that the game has few sections in which music is played, but when it does are often well chosen moments and make for a very touching or emotional scene.

I suppose voice acting and animations deserve a mention, which I will quickly sum up as superb, and is like watching a movie at times. Motion capture is really well implemented.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
A 10/10 game for me and all round experience. Delving into and exploring all the mechanics makes the game, and even just exploring it causally for the sake of exploring is a pleasant experience. At times it does not feel like a game.",1708909347,1708909376,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In an ocean of games spanning every genre, from top-notch to outright terrible, this stands as the king of walking sims. The combat can feel a little awkward at times, and the story a bit convoluted, but the game's ability to immerse you in the experience of traversing a post-apocalyptic world all alone is truly magical.

Some argue that it gets better later on, but I disagree. It remains a walking sim through and through. The equipment and weapons acquired later hold little significance to the gameplay. The essence of the game lies in the choice of transport and the story. If you find yourself not enjoying it a few chapters in, chances are you won't enjoy the later parts either.

In this project you'll find forward pushing technical marvel at a much slower pace that is littered with excellent potential regarding overarching gameplay loop, fidelity and immersion. The uncomfortable isolation is permeated across this game and is quickly rewarded with how much you're sharing this loneliness with other players. Kojima has delivered an experience unlike any other, I promise - just push through.

With all of its Hideo quirks, this game is offering a simple message through wildly imaginative expression that can be lost on some - it makes sense as you progress.

 Though again,if you get past the early game and discover the beauty of just simply walking,delivering packages and exploring yourself and your life and your world whilst doing it this game becomes so much more.there's something stoic about just listening to the ambient sounds of the game,music and slow paced walking.it's a bore for some of it's time allright but in the end it's one of the most beautiful and calming experiences i've had in my life like i used to walk in the old forests at the mountains in my hometown.

I do enjoy games that are story rich, like Persona games for example, however, even though I like story rich games, the gameplay has to be the most fun part, because, well, it's a game, not a movie, and to me Death Stranding has everything: story, original world, soundtrack, cinematic cutscenes, everything except... Fun gameplay. 
For about... 15 hours it was engaging because it was new, reaching your destiny while a music starts playing is so captivating, but after you put some hours into it, even after I got my hands on guns and fought my first boss, the gameplay just revealed to be very repetitive, with the delivering being very tiresome, and the world bland, monotonous, to the point that exploring it doesn't bring any excitement.
Another gripe that I have with this game, is that the NPCs love to interrupt gameplay every minute to say things that are either useless or something that's been already explained, for example, an npc explains something you can do in the map screen, then comes Die Hardman and says the exact same thing! Or when there's a text box explaining something, and an NPC calls you to say the exact same thing that was already in the text, this annoyed me too much. My impression is that this game would be an experience where I'd be able to feel how it's like being lonely, and then reconnecting with people, but with the NPCs calling me all the time, I ended up wanting to do the opposite of reconnecting...
To summarize: it wasn't for me because the gameplay it's to repetitive, in a world that's bland and the NPCs annoyed me. I come out of this game wishing it was a movie, or series, and not a game.",1708723125,1708723125,False,6,0,0.525292456150054932,0,True,False,False

Slight spoilers below.

The story starts off decently strong with an interesting premise and a few interesting questions to lead you on. However, as the game goes on, these questions are only rarely answered, as you are asked to focus on your main objective - reconnect America. Towards the middle you are served even more questions, and only few answers, and finally, as you reach the climax, with an overabundance of questions, many of these are answered at the same time, sometimes in roundabout ways. This leads to a sort of ridiculous amount of cutscenes and phone calls to tell you all these things, one after another, while letting you play a quick 10-15 minutes of ""go to place"" gameplay in between. I was left with an impression of messy, badly-paced storytelling that hurried to tie up loose knots before I could notice just how many there are.

Meanwhile, as a sucker for logistics, the gameplay and delivery loop itself was fun, but needed some tempering on the upgrades to really engage. Preparing for a trip and heading out to do it is great, but you quickly unlock a very fast trike, which lets you zoom around for deliveries, with really only BT's being a greater threat to hinder your progress. There's not often anywhere on the map that you'd want to go, that you can't go on a trike, and if you're online, other players taking the same path will even have cleared out smaller obstacles for you, as the combined walking creates desire paths. Personally, choosing to not use some of the tools given proved more satisfying, but also seems like a bit of a misstep on the game's part, for making it a bit too easy, perhaps.

Overall, by the time I was halfway through, I was about ready to focus only on the story missions and be done with it. At three quarters through, I was trying to speedrun my way from cutscene to cutscene. The game ended like 3 times, but just kept going regardless, only prolonging what I thought was the end of the journey.",1708704104,1708704104,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The execution and staging are very well done and polished.
The character designs, the cutscenes, the stories, the music.
The delivery-related gameplay is original and has a slow pace.
The freedom.
You unlock new items/abilities throughout your entire playtime.

Navigating through the menus can feel repetitive and a bit tedious and managing your cargo (in the menus) is a pain.
The boss fights (I didn't find them good, and I feel they add nothing).
The online elements (for me, they add nothing, and even worse, they detract from the value of the gameplay, the ambiance, and the realism of the world).
You have to set the difficulty to the maximum to truly experience challenges in making deliveries and even then, it's not that difficult.

The game evokes a feeling of loneliness, yet at the same time, of unity. Alone yet simultaneously helping and being helped by others. The storyline is absurd, unpredictable, it captivates the player from start to finish, and features great performances by renowned actors such as Mads Mikkelsen, Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, among others. It also boasts a spectacular soundtrack, truly remarkable. And when it comes to gameplay, as mundane as the premise may sound, it's very fun and addictive, with excellent mechanics. Don't draw conclusions from videos, play it.

The technical aspect is a spectacle with incredible graphics; the Decima Engine truly justifies its potential here. Additionally, it's well-optimized; you can buy it without fear as long as your PC meets the requirements.

I highly recommend it for those seeking something different from the norm, those who have the patience to understand the proposal and feel immersed in the game's universe. It's not for everyone; some won't like it (sorry for those people), but it's worth giving it a chance. I simply loved it; it's an experience I'll carry with me for life.

Positive points of the Director's Cut version include the addition of content, but in my opinion, the best part is the support for haptic feedback on the DualSense controller in the PC version. For those who have a DualSense, I highly recommend the upgrade.

 [h1] I'll Be Waiting For You On The Beach [/h1] 

I can see you scrolling around, watching and reading reviews to see if you are going to buy Death Stranding. You know you want to play it because it's a Kojima game but then again you have seen more than enough reviews saying that it's boring and soulless and the only thing there's to do in this game is walking. Now, after 47hrs I'm here to tell you that nothing can help you and prepare you for this game. If you are having doubts buy it on sale, if you are looking for fast action and quick satisfaction, don't bother.

Death Stranding is a new type of game, a new genre, it's everything that people praise it or accuse it to be. Is it a masterpiece? Sure. Is it boring? At times yes. Do you just walk? Most of the time, yes. Is it full with plot-holes? Absolutely! Annoying? YES! Repetitive? Yup. Is it soulless? Absolutely not! There were times when playing this game, that I felt that I was a better person, a better human. This game made me focus on what's important and if you play and take the story's message at heart you are going to be rewarded. It is my firm belief that Death Stranding is good for the soul.

My personal experience with the game goes like this. I bought it on February 2021 and played it straight for 18hrs and then I dropped it. Life you see. I wanted to return but then I kept thinking that the only thing that I was doing is walking and delivering packages and I was just kinda bored. Of course I was thinking of the AMAZING soundtrack and the PHENOMENAL performances or the trippy story, but I was bored of the main gameplay. I remembered feeling great while playing at first but something was holding me back from resuming my playthrough. Seven months later I was on Spotify listening, when the main theme started playing in my brain having reignited the desire to listen to the soundtrack. Then I installed the game again, resumed playing and after 29hrs I completed it.

After completion, do I understand Death Stranding? I feel that I'm in a good direction but in all fairness I don't think that the game is designed to be understood, but to be felt. Death Stranding is a cure to loneliness, a beckon to the outcasts. Death Stranding for me transcends genre, medium and reviews. It's a work of art plain and simple. That doesn't mean it's beyond criticism, nothing and no one is, but it's not as simple as watching Dunkey's eight minute review or Whitelight's 7hrs review on YouTube and deciding. You just have to take a leap of faith with this game and be thirsty for something new.

Lastly, Hideo Kojima directed the s*** out of this movie. He managed to capture great performances by all of his actors. Every scene with Mads Mikkelsen is eerie, gut-wrenching and heart-warming all in one and this is for sure Norman Reedus' best performance ever. Every scene is well-crafted and created to perfection. The visuals are beyond of this world so much so that you have to see it to believe it!

As with everything new, Death Stranding needs time to find its place in the world. Only time will tell but I'm happy that I finished it because it turned out to be one of the most unique gaming experiences of my life. If nothing else, just play it for BB, for me one of the best companions in gaming.

PS. You see what I did? I wrote ""movie"" instead of ""game"". That's a mistake but I decided to keep it because that's what I mean by ""transcending mediums"".

PPS. I'll be waiting for you on the Beach.

Kojima, as well as the cast of his wonderfully talented actors have poured their souls into this game. It is one of the most beautiful experiences that I have ever witnessed and I am truly happy that I decided to bite the bullet and try it out.

Without trying to spoil anything, I can say that this game is definitely something very personal to Kojima and has been written with more love and passion than any of his other works.

I just have no complaints honestly, the gameplay is solid, it eases you in with a great difficulty curve and always introduces new and exciting obstacles. The mechanics are very consistent and really nice to utilize. 
The vehicles may need a bit more work, but honestly I just liked walking instead.

As for the story, it is everything, its beautiful, touching, emotional, sometimes silly, a few times quite cheesy, then its over complicated, after which its painfully simple, but it is always good.

If you like solitary experiences, environmental art, and a good atmosphere, then please do yourself a favor and try it, but do it with the online functionality.

It's a thought provoking scifi world that brings fresh ideas and themes to the table, with a gameplay loop that's extremely satisfying and relaxing. This is one of those games where the more you put into it, the more satisfaction you'll receive.

The story gripped me from start to finish. It's hard to comprehend how any individual could come up with this game's setting and scenarios it puts you through, how the world and it's story unravels around you. While there are some moments that I felt the writing could've been improved that's about the extent of my complaints with the game.

The further you get into Death Stranding the more tools are at your disposal. The start of the game can be very clunky and tedious, but it's done so on purpose so that you appreciate and enjoy how far you've come when you reach the later stages of the game. You are constantly rewarded, constantly given feedback about everything you do. Giving you that satisfaction and being shown and told how well of a job you're doing, by both the characters and real players.

The online functionality of this game really took me by surprise regarding my enjoyment of it. I became utterly addicted to creating the roads for the players I shared the same world with, reveling in the amount of Likes players gave me. Something about the melancholic world and tone that harmoniously compliments the online infrastructure of DS. For me at least, it helped me appreciate others, strangers. It helped me feel kindness towards strangers. Similar to the message system of Dark Souls, players can leave messages saying a number of things. Most of what I see are motivational messages left by others to keep pushing forward, it's a unique feeling.

Music and the use of your soundtrack is one of my favorite elements of gaming. If implemented correctly, the right music at the right time can heighten your sense of emotion. Death Stranding understands that completely. Key parts of the story or environment when triggered will start to play a song, mostly from the band Low Roar. Their music fits the world and message of the game so perfectly it almost seems they were created side by side. The original soundtrack is composed beautifully, as expected from masterclass composer Ludvig Forssell who also created MGSV's score.

There are many moments in Death Stranding that filled me with awe and a sense of serenity I never thought existed in gaming. Death Stranding is one of my favorite games ever created, and in my opinion one of the best scifi worlds filled with such rich lore ever created. It left me in tears, and in love with the story that KojiPro has told. Most importantly, it has helped me appreciate and show kindness towards complete strangers in a world where it's far too easy to forget that you're not the only one living in it.

The definitive edition adds a lot of content to an already lengthy game. There's a racetrack that's surprisingly fun, many new tools and structures that fit well with everything else. Some stealth challenges that I really enjoy and a lot of really small additions. It's definitely worth the 10 dollar upgrade.",1708396947,1708396947,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,0,True,False,False

in my opinion the additions and gameplay tweaks were done very seamlessly that none of the new missions, gear, weapons, tactics, etc; felt tacked on. this version is harder than the base version, but only because theirs more factors to deal with when making a delivery than before (BT territories especially got more threats). BUT you do get more ways to solve those problems. 

the biggest addition that i think makes this a must for new death stranding players is the gun range. being able to test out and get used to how the weapons work in a no risk environment really lets you learn what will and wont work.

game-play: 7/10 - Most of it is just walking, with some added mechanics to make it more interesting. The combat is bare-bones, but this game isn't combat focused to begin with, so you won't be encountering it all too much.

game-feel: 10/10 - Despite the aforementioned ""just walking,"" every step you take feels weighted, and with purpose. Everything about the movement feels really lifelike and natural.

convenience: 6/10 - This game isn't easy to pick up and put down in quick succession. A lot of deliveries (this game's ""quests"") range from 15 minutes to maybe even an hour. If you've got a busy life, this game might not be for you.

From the eyes of someone who plays games casually, I'd give this an 8.5/10. It's a solid title if you're looking to add something new to your collection.

Returning vet porter, 300h+ of DS standard version on Epic Game, all achievements. I'm buying this on Steam again just to support Mr. Kojima and his spectacular vision toward creating an unique gaming experience. DS is a great a game with a exceptionally slow start and I understand not everyone can accept the pacing of such design. But if you are curious, I strongly recommend you to give this game a try before DS2 release.

Some tips to help you go through the Eastern Region (potentially spoiler):

1. Timefall is harsh to cargo crate, especially on high difficulty, but it only damage the crate, not the content inside. The low cargo crate hp will make the content inside taking more damage if the cargo receives impact. But as long as you don't fall on the ground, your cargo will be safe and you can still get perfect delivery rating. So you don't have to bring two bottles of repairing spray every time.
2.If you sneak through (or fight your way through) the first Mule camp and keep hugging the mountain as high as possible, you can avoid the second BT zone completely.
3.Musician is located South of middle Bridges station, on the cliff, next to a waterfall. It's hard to reach at first, but I highly recommend get to that shelter and at least do one or two order to reach one star. Musician will thank you by gifting you a harmonica, which is a way more effective way to calm down BB than shaking.
4.About Wind Farm BT zone: well there aren't much space to work around to avoid this one, it's a very scripted BT encounter. But there're three ways as I know of to get through it:
-fully sneaky, hug the edge of map or just hold you breath and cut through the middle;
-not so much about sneak as long as you can get away from being caught, bring a few ""special"" grenades, if you trigger a BT, and the ground turns tar-like, you can drop the grenades right on your feet, which will temporarily keep those tar-people away;
-The Big Ball Move, intentionally get caught and dragged by BT to trigger the BT-boss fight, during those kind of fight, all the map assets (trees, rocks, player buildings) will be temporarily hidden underneath the ground, instead it will generate a tar lake arena with some buildings for your foothold, so all you have to do, is to jump around the buildings and keep heading toward the wind farm, generally these early BT-bosses are not aggressive and you can walk away easily. If one does decide to chase you, just welcome it with your grenades. Once you are far enough, the BT-boss will despawn and timefall will stop for a short time.

I wanted to get a refund from Steam even though I only paid 20 bucks for it.  
Many reviewers here on Steam try to tell you 'don't listen to the people who say this game is boring or stupid... &tc.""  Wrong.  Do listen to them. Or waste your money.  Your choice.
I'll post spoilers here, even though the game is spoiled enough without it.  
The protagonist is a super ugly guy who has to lug junk all over the place for no reason while dodging invisible disgusting creatures.  And the game makes it super difficult to do even that.

You as the player get to micro-manage how Ugly Guy walks.  That's literally it.  That's the whole game.

The user interface is a nightmare, and good luck figuring that out.
The game seems completely based on ultra-long, protracted cut scene close ups of the ugly guy's face, so if you're into that I guess you can have fun.
YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR GAME. It relies on 'autosave only' and as such you're screwed if you have to quit.
Some of the voice acting is ok. Some other is not.  But either way it's overshadowed by listening to ugly guy pant and puff, and then shoots random crappy music at you to further piss you off.  
Of course, the opening BS takes more than 2 hours to suffer through, so I can't get a refund any more.  I can, however, uninstall this senseless game.
And that's what I'm doing right now.
If you want awesome and beautiful exploration, get Horizon Zero Dawn. 
If you want to spend a lot of time waiting for a game to finally get good, only to make you angry that you wasted your time with it, get this game.  Good luck.

This game is amazing, I'll try to be as objective as humanly possible, but sometimes it's really hard. The thing with this particular game is [b]it takes you down with brute force spearheaded by its unmatched originality and gameplay decisions[/b]. Even if you're prepared for something unorthodox having heard all those stories about the genius of one certain man and things he's capable of. Many gaming maniacs and game addicts have spewed a lot of good bullsh1t about this project and you're sitting there wondering what the hell is to expect there!? 

Well just like an actual storm this game has a slow start as it takes speed gradually with seemingly the never ending cutscenes that occupy most of the playtime during first two chapters. I'll be honest, I had doubts about it since I really came to play the game and not watch all those brilliant video cuts, nicely done chaps, but where's my game? Not that it bothered me terribly, as [b]it's difficult to get bored over the sheer quality of the said cutscenes[/b], couldn't possibly be fed up with such brilliance since the graphics raise the bar very high. To my eyes the game's got the best graphics I've personally seen, ever. 

[b]Just the way in which the plot unfolds is simply superb; each of the character somehow involved with the storyline has its own 'arc' in the chapter dedicated to that character[/b]. With new things being uncovered along the way you sometimes couldn't foresee beforehand, it is beautiful. Gameplay may seem to be having no longevity written on it as it would be getting stale pretty quickly or so you'd think, carrying stuff from place to place but, it's the way you do it, and what for! As you progress in the story gameplay updates along with new objectives and main missions. 

Cute 'n' friendly part time interactions with other players deliver freshness other types of such games lose fast, you never see anyone else but you know that they're always there. A special kind of excitement to be liked and appreciated by the local in-game community drives you to be aspiring in activities you'd unlikely do otherwise. [b]I am only about halfway through the storyline and I already think there's no game currently out for sale that can surpass this master piece[/b]. Out of the line thinking to the approach and to present the game, both risky and so open, unheard of among the other allegedly blockbuster titles, put this one well above others. Nothing more to say.

I'm in the first category. Death Stranding enters my top 5 easily! What a game! I stayed shocked for two weeks after finishing the story and finally managed to cry only after that period, it was like a sort of mourning. It touched my heart and ""soul"" (sic)  like few games have. 

The gameplay is not centered around combat and i loooved that, it's still there, there's still adversity (a lot actually) but it's better avoided and killing is really not advised. Instead the game lets you contemplate and meditate on its heavy themes (exctinction threat, death, life, birth, loneliness, work, connection, love and hate, all very human and ""deep"" subjects) while keeping you busy with a gameplay loop that is innovative, fun, tense or relaxing depending on the moment. 

Like always with Hideo Kojima, the game is a declaration of love to games, cinema and music. Kojima and his team uses that passion for cinema and music and its inventivity and knowledge to create a piece of art. The graphics and environments are superb, the cinematics contains the best motion capture and acting I've seen in a game. But it doesn't take itself too seriously neither and there is quite a bit of humour in there and a lot of very fun gameplay. It really is a mix that few games manage to do and Death Stranding delivers in every area.

It's heavy with symbolism, if you love and ""get"" symbolism, you'll love the story, if you like questionning and reflecting on big life subjects, you'll love the story, if you like a mix of heaviness and lightness, strong emotional up and downs, you'll love the story. If you think that reflecting and meditating on life is a waste of time, if you don't like the idea of a gameplay loop that doesn't involve combat as it's center mechanic then pass, you won't like what's in there. Me, i get it, i even need it, i'm a contemplative emotional and overthinking person and need that level of engagement. This game captured the zeitgeist like few artworks manage to. 

Technically the director's cut is quasi-flawless, everything ties together superbly. The soundtrack is fantastic and i discovered Low Roar and Woodkid thanks to it. 

A fantastic experience, thank you Hideo Kojima and all the people that worked on this game, thank you so much, it was .... special, very much so.

From its stunning graphics to its captivating storyline, every aspect of this game is a testament to the creativity and vision of Hideo Kojima.

The protagonist, Sam Bridges, portrayed by Norman Reedus, navigates a post-apocalyptic America burdened with the weight of humanity's hopes and fears. His journey is not just a physical one but a deeply emotional and philosophical exploration of connection and isolation.

The graphics are breathtaking, immersing players in a hauntingly beautiful world ravaged by catastrophe. Every detail, from the rugged landscapes to the intricate character designs, is a testament to the developers' commitment to excellence.

The supporting cast, including Mads Mikkelsen and Guillermo del Toro, delivers outstanding performances, further enriching the narrative and drawing players deeper into the game's universe.

One of the most innovative aspects of Death Stranding is its multiplayer component, which seamlessly integrates the efforts of players around the world. Through shared structures and resources, players collaborate to overcome challenges and achieve their goals, fostering a sense of community and camaraderie.

In conclusion, Death Stranding is a groundbreaking achievement that pushes the boundaries of storytelling and gameplay. It's a must-play for any gamer seeking a deeply immersive and thought-provoking experience.",1707862881,1707862881,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I gotta say I love the game's building elements.

I recall playing a game called the tomorrow children where you go out and mine the world, bringing back required resources from a void with monsters, as well as a film or anime that also had a premise of a similar nature. off topic story but it was in the mind while playing this. building structures, ladders, and climbable ropes in the early game so far has been interesting. and as I saw some videos now... after playing it a bit,   investigating things is a joy and the combat well not too complex,  feels like a good rush,  bloody m.u.l.e.s 

Either way I recommend this for those who like feeling like your working alongside your comrades in building a new world. (Sorry as I mentioned the tomorrow children... it was also one game I played a lot of on the ps4... I got kinda addicted to building ladders, mining gems, and blowing up comrades in a russian void of pure white and russian dolls...  the pstd gets to me sometimes when I remember being jailed for blasting the children with the rocket launcher. )",1707707218,1707707218,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd like to start the review debunking the argument that [i]""the game might not be for everyone""[/i], since this was used so many times during the launch period. It sounded so arrogant, as if people needed over 1000 IQ to appreciate [i]""such a complex game""[/i] - or a [i]Kojima[/i] game. The game is as much to everyone as any popular shooter, MOBA, RPGs, etc. You might like it or not, but that's not because you [i]""lack sophistication""[/i] or anything like that. Also, since I mentioned Kojima, I must say that this is my first Kojima game. I have never ever played any other game so I don't share the love and appreciation that fans have for him. I won't also enter in any story spoiler during this review.

After that lengthy disclaimer, I can proceed to say that [b]this game is very good in so many ways[/b]. I'll start with the game [b]story[/b], which is very focused on details. The game is somewhat story heavy during the start and nearing it's end, but I think during the [i]""mid-game""[/i], it insert conversations and cinematics in small doses that are good enough to keep you interested instead of boring you. The fact that the characters are all actors and the lip sync is very good makes you appreciate a lot of details during cutscenes. The story, as you might have read in other reviews, tries to be full of twists, but if you are paying attention, most twists won't come to you as a big surprise. There is a good amount of foreshadowing for some revelations that you get during the game. Getting a better understanding to some aspects of the game requires you to read mails and interviews, which are mostly text walls and you receive them all the time. I can understand people stopping reading those after some time, since many of those contain no useful information at all. Since most of the time you are wandering by yourself, I feel like the game lost the opportunity to give you more audio lore [i]that could be audible during gameplay[/i]. The fact that every conversation or audio is done while the game is paused is something I don't really like. A delivery briefing could be done while I'm organizing my cargo and getting my Trike ready. I can understand the love some fans have for Kojima's writting, he certainly tries to be unique, even if the main starting plot is basically [i]""we have to save America""[/i]. Like I said, I won't discuss spoilers here. The story is good, but I was expecting much more from the end. The end is long, very long, and it didn't need to be that long, that's for sure. It is not bad, I liked it, but I just expected much more.

Now, about the [b]gameplay[/b], it is very good and unique. You are what the game call a [i]Porter[/i]. You make deliveries, as you may have heard before. But you have to remember that you make those in a very particular post-apocalyptic world, where you have to take into account several challenges along the way, those being mostly: rough terrain, rivers, chasms, hills, timefall rain, MULEs, BTs and many others. You'll also have to keep in mind your cargo, weight, balance, stamina, etc, etc. The game gives you so many tools to handle all that, and you get a lot of new and upgraded tools along the game, which is so, sooo nice. You can close gaps between deliveries in so many different ways. Use a ladder for a small bridge, use vehicles, create structures - your call. Also, I remember Kojima mentioning that this is a [i]""strand type of game""[/i], which lead me to think: [i]what the heck is that supposed to mean?[/i] Well, once you are playing for an hour or so, you will connect regions to the UCA network. These regions are [i]online enable[/i] in a manner of speaking, which means that part of the world can be shared with other players. Some other player structures and tools will appear on your world, and vice-versa. Let's say you escalated a big hill with lots of slippery slopes? Well, you might just put an anchored rope on the top to make your life easier on the return trip, and also if you need to go this way again, you can use that rope. This rope can also be shown for other players that are connected, and it shows on their world with your name. They can even [i]like[/i] the help and you will receive that notification. You might even find other players lost cargo and return it, and they will receive it! The game is all about connecting with other people (you will hear this a lot) and that is a small way to demonstrate the [i]strand type of game[/i]. It feels so nice knowing you helped another random player. It feels so good when you seems to be running out of a tool during a hard trip, only to find some stranger builded a bridge or something like that, saving your skin. This is still a single player game, but that aspect makes it so interesting. [b]I do hope more games try this approach[/b]. It is simply amazing. My only complaint here is that you cannot choose to see or connect to a Steam friend. You have to be lucky to find something from them randomly, if ever.

This is just me trying to scratch the surface of this game. I don't want to spoil gameplay mechanics or tools, not even the story, but I do think it's a good game to be played at some point. The game is pretty straight forward in the beginning. I think it is safe to say that if you are playing it for about 2 hours (refund window) and you are not interested yet, maybe just skip it and refund. The game does not show it's true potential in the first hours, it only gets better, but the core gameplay and story is already in motion at this point.",1707526944,1707526944,True,1,0,0.501228511333465576,0,True,False,False

From the visionary mind of Hideo Kojima comes an opus that defies genre boundaries and narrative norms - ""Death Stranding"". This isn't just a game; it's a profound exploration of human connections, a mesmerizing blend of game-play and storytelling that leaves an indelible mark on the very essence of gaming itself.

In ""Death Stranding"", Kojima has masterfully crafted a post-apocalyptic world that is as haunting as it is beautiful. The desolate landscapes, the eerie echoes of a broken society, and the hauntingly emotive score fuse together to create an atmosphere that is nothing short of breathtaking. You'll find yourself mesmerized by the sheer attention to detail - from the minutiae of footprints forming in the rain to the sweeping vistas that beg you to pause and soak in the awe.

But it's not just the visual and auditory spectacle that elevates ""Death Stranding"" to greatness; it's the game-play itself that resonates profoundly. This is a game about connection, and it's not just a thematic choice; it's a game-play mechanic. As Sam Porter Bridges, portrayed brilliantly by Norman Reedus, you are tasked with the delicate duty of reuniting a broken world through the act of delivering packages. The seemingly mundane act of traversal becomes an absorbing and spiritual experience.

Traversing the rugged terrain demands an intimate engagement with your surroundings. Every step counts, every decision to place a ladder or forge a path has weight, and every encounter with the ethereal entities known as BTs (Beached Things) demands strategic finesse. ""Death Stranding"" seamlessly blends open-world exploration, resource management, and adrenaline-pumping stealth mechanics into an experience that is as meditative as it is heart-pounding.

What truly sets ""Death Stranding"" apart is its narrative depth and emotional resonance. Kojima weaves a tale of isolation, human longing, and the enduring power of human connection. The cast, featuring celebrated actors like Mads Mikkelsen, Léa Seydoux, and Guillermo del Toro, brings their characters to life with a poignant authenticity that draws you into their struggles and triumphs. The narrative is a puzzle, where each piece holds significance, and the revelation of its intricacies is as satisfying as solving the most enigmatic riddles.

""Death Stranding"" is not without its quirks, but these idiosyncrasies only serve to enhance its charm. The game's deliberate pacing might not be for everyone, and its thematic depth might require a contemplative mindset. Yet, for those willing to immerse themselves fully, ""Death Stranding"" delivers an experience that leaves an imprint on your soul, urging you to contemplate life, connection, and the indomitable spirit of humanity.

All in all, in an industry often saturated with sequels and formulaic releases, ""Death Stranding"" emerges as an avant-garde masterpiece that challenges norms and sets new benchmarks for artistic expression within gaming. Hideo Kojima's magnum opus is a testament to the potential of video games as a medium for storytelling and introspection. It defies classification and demands to be experienced by anyone seeking a truly transformative journey through the uncharted territories of gaming innovation.",1693700240,1707359409,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

In the vast expanse of the gaming world, where innovation meets artistry, there exists a title that transcends traditional boundaries to deliver an experience unlike any other. Death Stranding, the brainchild of visionary game designer Hideo Kojima, is a masterpiece that weaves together stunning landscapes, profound storytelling, and gameplay mechanics that redefine the very essence of connection in gaming.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Sam Porter Bridges, portrayed with unparalleled depth by Norman Reedus, you are thrust into a world that is as hauntingly beautiful as it is desolate. The landscapes of Death Stranding are nothing short of breathtaking, with sprawling vistas that stretch as far as the eye can see. From snow-capped mountains to lush forests and treacherous ravines, each environment is meticulously crafted with an attention to detail that is simply awe-inspiring.

But Death Stranding is not just a game about traversing stunning landscapes; it is also a game about forging connections in a world torn apart by isolation. As Sam, you embark on a journey to reconnect the fractured cities of America, delivering essential supplies and rekindling hope in the hearts of those you encounter along the way. The gameplay mechanics, while initially daunting, quickly become second nature as you navigate the rugged terrain with the aid of your trusty BB and an array of ingenious gadgets.

One cannot discuss Death Stranding without acknowledging its roots in the Metal Gear Solid series, particularly Metal Gear Solid V. The influence of Kojima's previous work is evident throughout, from the meticulously designed stealth mechanics to the intricate storytelling that keeps you guessing until the very end. Fans of Metal Gear Solid will find plenty to love in Death Stranding, while newcomers will be drawn in by its unique blend of gameplay and narrative.

At its core, Death Stranding is a game about connection – both on a personal level and as a reflection of our interconnected world. It is a game that challenges players to think beyond themselves and consider the impact of their actions on others. It is a game that celebrates the beauty of human connection in all its forms, from the bonds we share with loved ones to the strangers we meet along the way.

In conclusion, Death Stranding is a triumph of storytelling, gameplay, and visual design that stands as a testament to the power of video games as an art form. With its stunning landscapes, deep narrative, and nods to the legacy of Metal Gear Solid, it is a must-play experience for gamers of all stripes. Simply put, Death Stranding is a journey unlike any other – one that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1707335817,1707335817,True,0,0,0.470588237047195435,0,True,False,False

From its captivating storyline to its immersive gameplay mechanics, every aspect of this game resonated deeply with me on an emotional level.

First and foremost, the storytelling in Death Stranding is nothing short of exceptional. The developers have crafted a rich and poignant narrative that explores themes of life, death, friendship, and self-discovery. As I embarked on the protagonist's journey, I found myself emotionally invested in every twist and turn of the plot, experiencing moments of joy, sorrow, and everything in between.

What truly sets the game apart is its ability to evoke genuine emotions within the player. Through masterful storytelling, breathtaking visuals, and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, the game creates an atmosphere that tugs at the heartstrings and leaves a lasting impression. I found myself laughing, crying, and reflecting on my own life as I accompanied the characters through their trials and tribulations.

Beyond its narrative depth, Death Stranding also excels in its gameplay mechanics. The controls are intuitive, the level design is ingenious, and the challenges rewarding. Every aspect of the gameplay is designed to complement the emotional journey, enhancing the overall experience and drawing the player further into the world of the game.

In addition to its emotional impact, the game also boasts stunning visuals and atmospheric sound design that further immerse the player in its world. From lush landscapes to hauntingly beautiful vistas, every scene is a work of art that begs to be explored and savored.

Death Stranding is not just a game—it's a transformative experience that left me profoundly moved and deeply touched. It's a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming and a reminder of the emotional depth that video games can achieve. For anyone seeking a truly unforgettable gaming experience, I wholeheartedly recommend this experience as a must-play masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1707268905,1707268905,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Oyun tasarımcılarının yaşadığı sıkıntılardan biri de insanların gündelik hayatta yaptıkları basit eylemlerin bir oyuna nasıl dönüştürüleceğine karar vermek ve bu durumda Death Stranding çok iyi bir örnek bana soracak olursanız. Tıpkı son dönemlerde çıkan Jusant'ın tırmanma eylemini bir oyuna dönüştürmesi, Deus Ex'lerin insan ikna kabiliyetlerini basit bir diyalog seçiminden ziyade bir mini oyuna dönüştürmesi veya Griftlands'in konuşmayı bir kart oyununa dönüştürmesi gibi Death Stranding de yürümeyi bir oyun haline getiriyor. 

Eğlenirsin, eğlenmezsin bu başka konu ancak aslında Death Stranding'de yürümekten ziyade oyun oynuyoruz. Yürümeden önce envanter yönetimi yapıp yanımızda taşımamız gerekenlere karar veriyor, yürürken karşımıza çıkan engellere karşı önlem alıyor ve tüm yolculuğumuz boyunca karakterin dengesini korumak için çabalıyoruz. Düşündüğünüz zaman tüm bunlar yürüme eylemini gerçekleştirdiğimiz diğer hiçbir oyunda yapmadığımız, dikkat etmediğimiz şeyler. Çünkü onlarda yürümek sadece yürümekken Death Stranding'de yürümek aslında bir oyun haline getirilmiş.

Bu yüzden Death Stranding'in yürüme simülasyonu olduğuna katılmıyorum ve bu yorumun bu oyuna haksızlık olduğunu düşünüyorum. Zaten oyun da yürümekten ibaret değil, gizlilik, savaş, araç kullanımı gibi oyunun pek çok farklı yönü var. Düşündüğünüz zaman özellikle lineer ilerlediğimiz yapımlara kıyasla Death Stranding daha az oynanış elementi falan barındırmıyor aslında, bir oyunun her saniyesinde aksiyon barındırmıyor oluşu onu kötü bir örnek yapmıyor bence. 

Kısacası Death Stranding benim epey severek oynadığım, ilginç bir şekilde dünyasında olmaktan keyif aldığım (yalnızlığımdan olabilir bu, kendimi o dünyaya ait hissettim açıkçası), fullemekten en çok keyif aldığım yapımlardan biri oldu. Çok marjinal bir oyun evet ve görünen o ki Kojima bu yolda gitmeye devam edecek, o yüzden herkese hitap edecek bir yapım değil ancak gerçekten ""yürüyorsun işte sadece"" diyerek basite indirgeyip bu güzide yapımı bir kenara atmayın, bir şans verin bence.",1707083776,1707083776,True,3,1,0.566929101943969727,1,True,False,False

I bought it for Norman Reedus and the story but didn't stay due to the gameplay. This time around the gameplay did intrigue me and I wanted to give this game another shot. Really glad I did, the journey was awesome if you really stick with the game it builds as you progress but there is a Zelda element to this game where you can rush to the end game if you wanted to but you will miss out on so many tools and equipment that would have really benefited you along the way. Getting a 5 star connections with the various Distribution centers is key to unlocking better gear for Sam. The people who love it, love this game and the people who hate it haven't really given this game a proper run through. This game plays at a slightly slower pace, yes you can get guns and vehicles, you can kill people in this game and it's all well and fun but that is not where the joy lies in the game. The joy is getting a 5 star connection with the distribution centers, getting a new piece of story, new gear, new tools, getting that S rating on deliveries, destroying BT's, key moments where other porter's constructions come in clutch when you really need it and much more. 

As I stated already I'm glad I gave this game a second chance, I didn't like it because I thought it was a walking simulator but because I rushed my run of this game I missed out on unlocking vehicles really early which was my own mistake and how stupid i felt this time around seeing that all the places I struggled in my prior playthrough I was able to breeze by because I took the time to actually play the game and unlock all the gear I missed my first time around. This game is a solid 9/10 for me, a really unique game and with a rich mysterious story.

This game... oh man, this game...

[h2] GAMEPLAY [/h2]

First, let's get something more simple out of the way - the gameplay. On a grand level, the closest sort of feeling that it evokes is if you enjoy things like European Truck Simulator or playing something like Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky and if you enjoy vibing out just delivering stuff to different locations. That's the sort of core loop, and there are elements of stealth sometimes involved and a bit of combat here and there. So if you're expecting constant high octane action, that's not what you're gonna get here. Come in with expectations of post-apocalyptic delivery vibing, and that's what you're gonna get.

At first it's very difficult because you're essentially doing it all on foot in difficult terrain. Eventually, you will unlock plenty of sci-fi toys and vehicles that will help ease this process. Another fun thing is this game has a sort of Souls-esque system where things that you and other players place in the world can show up in other worlds. So eventually you're all sort of helping each other to make the world more traversable and generally more hospitable, it's a warm sort of social aspect to a game that is inherently somewhat lonely.

[h2] STORY [/h2]

Have you ever had a friend or family member almost... [i]challenge[/i] you on your cuisine? In the first hour or so of this game, it feels like Kojima lays out a heinous charcuterie board in front of you, filled with the stinkiest of cheeses and fermented hors d'oeuvres. He smiles at you expectantly, and you will either recoil and say ""what is this garbage?"" or you will start to dig in and say ""hey I'm actually super into this freaky stuff."" I'll be honest, I really wasn't sure how to feel at first. It felt like the game was saying ""yes this is insane, and no, we [i]will not[/i] be explaining.""

However, if you can stomach that first hour or so, it actually does do a pretty decent job of explaining itself, especially if you're the sort of person that enjoys reading the logs and interacting with side characters. Does it make sense? Not according to our reality, no. But if you feel like buying into the weird dream logic of this world, it actually has a really fascinating cohesion.

I'm sure I have much more to play of this game, but I'll say I haven't felt this intrigued and entranced by a game, its story, and its world in a long time. It's a sort of creative project that makes you wonder, how can this possibly exist? How did people hear this pitched and actually agree to be involved? On top of all of that, how was it made with so many famous people and with such a huge budget? In a way, just the fact that a game this shamelessly strange and creative exists at all is an incredible achievement. This game may be divisive, but so far I am heavily invested and looking forward to the rest of my time with it.",1706846993,1706985780,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

that made this followed Kojima's vision, I am referring to apart from the acting team, the music Ludvig Forssell, Yoji Shinkawa, the writers, producers including Kojima himself, didn't fail to grasp our attention.

The world he created was too similar to ours, Sam Porter too recognisable a person with flaws, strengths and weaknesses where we could identify with, perhaps most of all was his still or quiet nature, that allowed us to be drawn into the after effect of the ''extinction event'' that the earth suffered from by this time, the ''DEATH STRANDING''.

[h3]DIFFERENT TYPES OF TERRAIN[/h3]

Of all the strange occurrences in the world after the great 'extinction event', or apocalypse if you understand it as that, the rain in the world is TOXIC, making ageing at a fast rate human skin if it touches it. Or extreme RUST on metals. The 'tar-belt', the unusual effects on the environment to be seen, in the game you traverse all sorts of landscapes (FOREST/SNOW/MOUNTAINOUS/HOT DRY/VOLCANIC)

[h3]NORMAN REEDUS-THE PERFECT CHOICE[/h3]

Norman Reedus allowing us to OBSERVE the world, after it has been altered by the effect of the death stranding, WITH him. 

Here we see the affirmation of the choice of Norman Reedus, his quiet nature, leading us to fully enjoy a totally ''NEW EXPERIENCE''. It's  almost common-place to notice this game throughout as a stealth – game, though I would argue, even though stealthy like actions were sometimes employed, it isn't entirely so..

Yes, if you're happening on a 'terrorist base', or a terrorist, or a 'mule-base', or a mule or a few maybe patrolling in a vehicle and YOU USE stealthy actions, the game is too a THRILLER, of HORROR proportions.

[h3]BT's[/h3]

I'm of course referring to the BT's, or ''beached things'', [b]which our faithful BB, helps us to navigate[/b] like [i]minefields[/i] of these spooks, MASTERFULLY ✔ leaving us with  a heightened sense of extreme eeriness &, HORROR, in these encounters with appropriate screeching music & our choices are usually limited for success, following an encounter with these 'beings', most of the time we end it by comforting BB/Lou,[strike] 'DON'T YOU ALL BREATH A SIGH OF RELIEF NOW'[/strike], either as you do so.

At this point, I shall HIGHLIGHT that there are types of BT's, from massive giants to literal babies, to animals, beasts & fish like BT's, where IF left to defeat Sam, cause a massive 'VOID-OUT', a crater like 'scar' on the earth testament of your lack of skills to defeat the BT's. So throughout the game, your map of your game-has THESE craters, where you failed to succeed.

[h3]LEVEL UP[/h3]

There is room for improvement, if effort is put in, you may be a Kingpin deliverer, and you shall notice your skills improvement in the game menu. 
Your tools do level up, over time, you acquire, level's 1-3 usually, the best having the best duration, & more functionalities than the previous.
The story is vast & it becomes 'CURIOSITY' level to play 10'S OF HOURS, having personally played around 380 hours at review time.

[h3]FINAL THOUGHTS[/h3]

[i]Is there fast travel [/i] (there is YES, a form of fast travel, though it wasn't my favorite form of travel, so you sit there thinking ''YOU PREFERED TO STANDARD TRAVEL than [u] FAST TRAVEL'', my answer for you YES,[/u] you'll see, it's an amazing game).

There are various methods of travelling, biking, cars, training grounds, cart like trolleys.

Played in 3rd person view as the first iteration of the game, sure there's a crossover with CYBERPUNK 2077, keep an eye out for it.

All in all, a personal game. The game is played in episodes, some shorter than the others.

The review is to encourage you to play the Director's cut, with the new content,
the game is great. 

There is no [b]NG+[/b], though the game remains slightly beyond description, it requires you to experience it to know it,

I shall leave comment space available for discussion, if something you wish to know without too much spoilers

Es ist wirklich schwer „Death Stranding“ jemandem zu empfehlen. Denn das Game ist nicht für jeden geeignet.
Man sollte wissen, was einen erwartet während der 30–40 Stunden.

DS ist sozusagen ein 90 %-Paket-Lieferungssimulator. Man bekommt halt die Aufgabe, den Osten von Amerika mit dem Westen zu verbinden durch Knotenpunkte auf dem Weg dorthin. Bei dieser Hauptaufgabe liefert man halt Vorräte und andere Pakete an diese Stationen. Das ist „Death Stranding“.
Man nimmt seine Pakete und versucht einen Weg zu finden durch das postapokalyptische Amerika. Mit der Zeit bekommt man natürlich bessere Ausrüstung, Waffen und Fahrzeuge, um diese Aufgabe zu bewältigen. Dennoch ist es eine schwierige Aufgabe, denn die Gelände, die Sam überwinden muss, werden von Stunde zu Stunde schwieriger. Deswegen ist eine gute Planung und Vorbereitung das Wichtigste.

Wenn man sich dieser Aufgabe für 30–40 Stunden widmet, bekommt man als Belohnung eine fantastische und epische Handlung. Die Story hat mich von der ersten bis zur letzten Minute gefesselt. Es gibt wahnsinnig gute Charaktere und die Handlung wird immer komplexer und verrückter. Ebenso fühlt sich die Geschichte sehr emotional an. Es gibt zwischendurch immer Szenen, die einen das Herz brechen.

Davon lebt „Death Stranding“ … Seine einzigartige Story mit vielen Wendungen und toller Charaktertiefe. Das Paket zu liefern ist halt die Hürde, um diese Story erleben zu können.

Lohnt es sich 30-40 Stunden? Auf jeden Fall !!!
Auch wenn ich des Öfteren genervt war, konnte ich dennoch nicht aufhören zu spielen. Man hat immer den Gedanken „Noch ein Paket, dann bekomme ich mehr Story“. Das hat mich persönlich am Ball gehalten.
Zugleich gibt es aber auch Momente, die einen total die Zeit vergessen lassen. Durch die Schönheit des Geländes und der wundervollen Musikuntermalung. Hatte des Öfteren 6–7 Stunden auf dem Counter, ohne es gemerkt zu haben.

Pro
+ Geniale Grafik
+ Soundtrack !!!!!
+ Epische Story
+ Tolle Charaktere
+ Neue Art von Spieldesign
+ Onlinecommunity (Man hat das Gefühl, ein Teil von etwas Großem zu sein)

Contra
– sehr träge zum Teil
– Walking Simulator, der sich über 30–60 Stunden zieht
– Story zwar genial, aber auch schwer zu folgen

Fazit: 9 von 10
Wer seine Geduld testen will und eine atemberaubende Story erleben will, sollte DS 100 % eine Chance geben. Dennoch seid ihr gewarnt: Entweder könnt ihr was mit dem Spiel anfangen, oder ihr wirft es nach einigen Stunden in die Ecke!

And let's talk gameplay – it's unlike anything I've experienced before. Balancing cargo, navigating obstacles, solving puzzles – it's strangely addicting! Plus, can we talk about how gorgeous the graphics are? And that soundtrack? Absolutely killer.

-PROS-
-Great story, very confusing throughout but in the end it all makes sense , the cast of characters is great and it was nice learning about each one and finally playing a game where i was interested in the plot and pushing forward to get more story instead of just trying to finish the game. That being said there were moments while playing i was thinking to myself ""please stfu already and let me get on with it"" 

-Incredible graphics and landscapes. Every 5 to 10 minutes i was using photo mode, theres non stop beautiful views through the entire game. And it supported my ultrawide curved monitor and thats always a major plus for me

-Gameplay is so much fun, being a delivery guy moving across beautiful and difficult terrain using ladders and ropes left behind by other porters and setting up my own to help out was a very cool experience. I built a few roads and it was a good feeling knowing i made some of the trips easier for not only myself but other porters, and dreading a difficult trip ahead crouch walking in the snow to see someone built a zipline up ahead was such a relief and im slamming the like button to thank whoever that person is . The only thing i disliked was that the time fall seemed to be in the same spots no matter what, i really wish it was more random and some trips could be made the entire way without time fall happening but other trips on the same route it would occur. I would love to be able to hop on the bike and enjoy a long trip across the map without always having to get off my bike at the same point because i knew a few more steps and the rain would start at the exact spots every single time. I also kind of hoped the end game was ridding the world of the time falls and being able to just deliver packages in nice weather taking in the views free from having to crouch walk and deal with BT's because it does get old after a while, they arent difficult to deal with especially once you unlock the cutter cuffs so it became less of a fun moment where you are in fear and more of a ""dude i gotta crouch walk and inch my way forward for the next 10 minutes""

The game with its visuals and music are absolutely stunning seeing the landscapes. That said, its beauty and elegenace is comparable to a painting. Photo mode players might be this game's target players. But the gameplay has nothing going for it.

It feels like Metal Gear Solid 5, the director's previous game, except instead of sneaking around as a soldier fighting enemies, you are just fighting gravity and trying not to tip over for 20 hours of video game of just walking form Point A to Point B.

I do believe Kojima made what he sought to make with this game. I also believe someone really needs to tell this man to stop sniffing his own farts and be told when his ideas are bad.

Like many others you'd be forgiven for thinking this is 'just a walking simulator', but the game opens up to being so much more than that. It involves strategy, stealth, combat, resource management, and building infrastructure. The game goes from walking simulator, to shooter, to horror, to Euro Truck Simulator, to Assassin's Creed and back again. Death Stranding manages to juggle all these different genres just enough to remain interesting from start to finish.

You're constantly introduced to new equipment and mechanics until well into the endgame, keeping the gameplay fresh and interesting. The unique way 'multiplayer' is implemented also means that even though you're traversing the world alone, you always feel like you're playing in a world with other players.

my main issues with this game were that it could get pretty easy, even on very hard, and that it's like, really slow the first few chapters. a lot of people drop it before they even get to the main area and i can definitely see why. my advice is to just speedrun through the first area, don't bother with side content, and come back later when you have better equipment and more experience.

First and foremost, Death Stranding boasts breathtaking graphics that showcase the beauty of its post-apocalyptic world. The landscapes are meticulously crafted, from the sprawling mountains to the desolate plains, creating an atmosphere that is both haunting and awe-inspiring. The attention to detail is nothing short of remarkable, making each step of your journey a visual feast.

The narrative is a complex tapestry of human connection and isolation, expertly woven together by Kojima's storytelling prowess. Norman Reedus delivers a stellar performance as Sam Bridges, a courier navigating a fractured America. The supporting cast, including Mads Mikkelsen and Lea Seydoux, adds depth to the narrative, creating a captivating and emotionally charged experience. The themes of connectivity and the impact of our actions resonate throughout, making Death Stranding more than just a game – it's a philosophical exploration of the human condition.

The gameplay is where Death Stranding truly shines, introducing a unique and innovative system centered around the concept of rebuilding connections. As a courier, your mission is to bridge the gap between isolated communities, delivering crucial supplies and re-establishing a sense of unity. The use of traversal tools, such as the trusty ladder and the versatile BB (Bridge Baby), adds a layer of strategy to exploration, turning seemingly mundane tasks into thrilling adventures.

The online multiplayer component enhances the sense of shared experience. Structures and items left behind by other players in their own journeys can be crucial resources for your own expedition. This collaborative approach to gameplay creates a sense of community in an otherwise desolate world, reinforcing the game's central theme of connection.

In conclusion, Death Stranding is a groundbreaking achievement in the world of gaming. It challenges players to think beyond traditional genres, offering a deeply emotional narrative, stunning visuals, and innovative gameplay mechanics. Hideo Kojima has once again proven his ability to push the boundaries of storytelling in video games, and Death Stranding stands as a testament to his creative genius.

Death stranding is not a fun game but it is meaningful and memorable one despite its many shortcomings (It goes on for way too long, at times it does indeed feel like a walking simulator, not enough detail in the environment ie lack of wildlife and landmarks) 

The graphics are beautiful and needed to be to be able to pull this off, the small cast of characters are memorable and the pay off at the end make the short comings worthwhile.
The simply bonkers story also needs to be experienced!

Popular complaints are;
The gameplay isn't fun. But neither is truck sim nor farming sim, and both are incredibly popular.
The story is nonsense. It's explained very clearly. And it's interesting.
You can just walk outside and go for a hike. I don't live in Iceland, and that's ignoring the entire story aspect. I also expect these people to not play COD, Battlefield, nor ARMA in favor of signing up for the military.
Kojima should stop making games and just do movies. His games only work as games, and his gameplay systems are constantly exceptional. There's dozens of other studios that make far more linear experiences that get praised as the height of games. R* and Red Dead 2 is an excellent example. You can't do anything how you want in that game, you have to do it exactly how R* wants you to, and they also have an over-reliance on cut scenes. Kojima also does a much better job of integrating the player, not just the player character, into the world and story. Seeing someone walk up a mountain in a movie isn't the same as being the one to do it. This point annoys me most as it's most likely attributed to the fact that he has cutscenes, like every other game now.",1703872337,1705778149,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played a ton of games throughout my life, and have many favorites, but yet, this game managed to become one of my top 10 favorite games. This is actually the 3rd time I've beaten it, (and as of December 2023, I just finally 100%-ed the game). I first got it back when it came out in 2019 for the PS4 and played it until completion on there, then I bought it again on my PC last year, and then I bought the Directors cut as an upgrade to the base game and completed it again. There's just something about it that makes it so apart from other games. The only way to rightfully put it would be: it's very Kojima like. The characters are really cool and all have their own unique backstory: you've got a man that has a literal heart-shaped heart and dies every (I think it was 8 or 10 minutes?) on purpose so that he can try to find his dead family on the beach; there's two twin sisters that become literally combined together because one of them dies and so the soul enters the other sister; you've got one of the coolest villains I've seen in a long time (voiced by the one and only Troy Baker of all people) who basically has magic powers and can summon the enemies of the game; and there's even more characters that all are unique in their own ways but if I kept going on then this would take an hour to write.

Now, a lot of people misjudge this game because back when it came out, everyone just called it a ""Walking simulator"" or ""Fedex: the game"" (which, the first example is ironically not true because for most of the game you're driving a motercycle/trike) which is sad because it deterred a lot of players away from the game because that's all that they were led on to believe. The story of this game is actually *insane*. Not just in a good way, but in a ""this is the weirdest game story I've ever seen"" sort of way. It has some of the biggest plot twists that you don't expect at all (WHICH ONE OF IS LEGITIMATELY TOLD TO YOU NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME BUT AT THE TIME YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT MEANS); it has likable and unique characters as I said before; and it's generally just a good story. However there is an issue that most people bring up, and I even agree with, and that is: the story is confusing as all hell and it's hard to figure out what is going on for the most part, especially at the beginning where you are just thrown into the game and they start speaking all of these words you've never heard before and don't understand what they mean quite yet. I had to google my fair share of things to understand the complete story, but once you do get it, it's really good in my opinion.

The game play itself (at least the delivery parts of the game) I feel is a little lackluster. I do like the details of things like figuring out where to pack the cargo on yourself so that you can combat things like wind and weight distribution; and the worry of making it out of Timefall with all of your cargo intact; there's even enemies to look out for like the BT creatures/being that you have to sneak around or otherwise they'll grab onto you, throw all your cargo to the ground and drag you to a giant BT thing that you have to run from; there's also Mules which are people that have basically gone crazy for loot, so they try to knock you out and steal your cargo, they definitely become a lot harder the farther you progress in the game (especially in the Directors cut version); and then there's one other enemy which really you don't even see unless you go to very specific areas in the game or you're forced to meet with them at the very end of the game, and those are the Jellyfish BTs. I had somehow managed to avoid them all game and never saw them until the very end where you go through like a ruined city and they are all just floating up in the sky, it honestly terrified me because for the entire game previous of this, there was only 2 threats, now suddenly there's giant black masses floating up in the sky. But once I realized that these things were practically harmless, the fear factor of it vanished. That is one of the bigger things I wish this game had, more threats, and deadlier threats, because even on the hardest difficulty (which I beat) it's not *too* hard. Really the only thing that had me ripping out my hair was the war zone segments of the game with Cliff. Even if the threats weren't even enemies, just give me something else to worry about and manage. TLDR: Game needs more threats, needs to be harder, and more things to manage as you deliver.

The graphics of the game is gorgeous and most of my time in the game was probably spent in photo mode just wandering around taking photos of Sam and the environment, some of the photos even look like they were taken in real life. I had no issues with lag or graphic issues even with it set on maximum. And it all looks really pretty and detailed. So it's all good in that department.

I wish more people would give this game a chance. When I first played this game I didn't know *anything* about it, actually I don't even remember why I bought it at the time, but I'm so glad I did. The game is just so different from others. the story is weird, unique, kind of confusing, but still really good and has good plot twists throughout it. The characters are all different and have their own backstory and personalities and are honestly pretty likable, even the villain of the story. The game play when it comes to delivering becomes a little samey over time, I do like how there's different ways you have to handle certain cargo though, like some can't be touched by water, some can't be shook up to much by a bumpy ride, some has to be stored a certain position, but even then, it just feels a little tedious after awhile. The combat part of the game isn't bad though, but still, I wish you had more stuff to do. Graphics and animation is phenomenal, looks realistic sometimes. All in all, it's a great, strange game that most people didn't give a chance because they thought it was something else. I bet if I told you that you get transported to war world 1 and 2 in the game you wouldn't believe me but it really happens. There's a lot more to it than just a simple walking simulator. It will likely remain one of my favorite games for a long long time, if not for ever. Give the game a shot, it has a lot more to offer than you think (especially with all of the stuff the Directors cut added. You can even race with race cars around a track). 10/10.",1670212665,1705766352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A substantially portion of my playthrough was simply holding down the 'W' key alongside the occasional balancing act when stepping on uneven terrain or some course correction here and there. But I'm so glad I stuck with the game through the credits, until the very end.

Hideo Kojima and his team have crafted what can easily be considered one of the best and most intriguing video game campaigns of all time. I mean it when I say to go in as blind as possible. This game is filled with masterful metaphor and extremely complex symbolism that can easily have infinite interpretations. The story itself is far from straightforward, however, rest assured knowing that nearly every question worth answering is answered to some meaningful capacity. Each character is finely crafted to serve a purpose, and while the actions of the player may seem inconsequential at times, every action builds to make the world feel more real.

Let's talk gameplay, as that is easily the most divisive aspect of this game. I am a fan. While it is objectively boring and tedious (almost to a point where I almost assume it was defined to be aggravating) it really puts you in Sam's shoes. Your struggles are his, and his are your's. The multiplayer aspect integrates seamlessly into general gameplay and helps you realize just how much impact you have not only in your individual instance, but in the world of other players. Combat sequences are tight and responsive, with everything from grenades to a wide arsenal of guns feeling incredible to use. This is in stark contrast to the rest of the controls which are serviceable at best and miserable at the absolute worst. Some menus are clunky, and several mechanics are hard to initially grasp, but it all makes sense in due time.

The game is an incredibly slow burn, however, towards the end (after about Chapter 7) it picks up significantly. However, chapter duration ranges wildly. For example, Chapter 8 took me around 8 hours to complete (although I wouldn't be surprised if it takes some much more) while the very next chapter took me just eleven minutes (excluding cutscenes).

Lastly, let's talk this PC port. 505 Games have done an excellent job of porting the Director's Cut to PC platforms, with incredibly solid performance, in depths options (minus an FOV slider), and some nice quality of life options such as Ultrawide resolution support.

I truly can't recommend this game enough. While not for everyone, sticking with this game despite it's flaws is absolutely worth it. I cannot wait to see what Kojima and his team are cooking up next.",1705718037,1705718037,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All of the people I met along the way had their own lives and stories, and Sam's interactions with them absolutely nailed the theme of connections. In a counter-intuitive way, the rough edges of Kojima's style make it a magical experience. As for the Director's Cut edition of the game, the asynchronous online multiplayer only added to the realism. Even though I knew I wasn't actually playing with other people, I was genuinely collaborating with my fellow porters by constructing roads and sharing equipment on our slow crawl to the West. From a technical perspective, the Decima Engine also makes the game look fantastic, and the physics control well.

For me it was 130 hours of entertaining awesome game play

Might not be the game play for everyone but if it's your thing you will love it. Combat is something I don't think ive seen before non lethal equipment and deterrent based combat and is very fun. Every “boss” or “encounter”  is something you haven't seen before and pushes the wow factor on each one you experience. 

Story legit made me cry which is embarrassing to admit. The only other game to make me cry was MGS snake eater, actually funny enough. The themes often has very heavy topic but can switch from dreary and hopeless to funny and inspiring. 

I'd very much recommend this game. You will probably not get 130 hours out of it unless you compilation it like i tried but its very much worth the money 

PS: runs great on steam deck 

Now for full spoiler free review


Death stranding is a post apocalyptic delivery simulator where you play as Sam Porter Bridge. Sam ends up being given a task bigger than he has before reconnecting the United states and its population. By delivering life saving goods and connecting a network while the whole time fighting humans and the unknown beings plaguing the world 

GAME PLAY

A good way to describe the experience playing this game would would be like American Truck Simulator mixed will the metal gear solid games funny enough but with way more direct engagement 

II you don't think the gameplay looks cool or fun then dont play this game or just read my review then judge for yourself 


DELIVERY

The Delivery game play is either.explore while you make the post possible routes.and using equipment to create clever shortcuts. Which ends up making for an extremely relaxing methodical game. To the opposite race of time and skill something similar to time trials. This goes into how the game perfectly throws curve balls in the gameplay that will make you have to reconsider how you approach deliveries. From “special Cargo” with different requirements to keep them safe to area challenges where the environment delivers location itself will be the change up. There are so many missions to do but not all are required but all will earn you something from your hard work.


COMBAT 

 The combat is very metal gear solid but not in the normal way guns are hug part of DS the whole without spoilers you can't normally kill enemies like in MGS butt das a big butt you can just destroy and beat the shit out of people without actually killing them and non lethal gun combat is a huge mechanic. 


STORY : The games story is hard to put into short word but ill try. its  a story about the sins of war, and connections life and death humans and communication and. the story is is very special  and eccentric exploring supernatural elements. The story is not something that should be spoiled at all but from this review you should be able to get a good idea of what your getting.


CARRYING AND EQUIPMENT

 This is the secret sauce of the game. the way you can tackle each delivery is almost always up to you how you want to go about dealing with it. You can only carry so much stuff on you by default just the way you are. The more you meet people and grow relationships you will get new equipment to assist you with delivery services in many way such as being able to carry more. With carrying more comes the trouble of balance and stability. You will need to scan your environment through your map to make sure you have the right delivery equipment to handle the job and the terrain.

Overall 130 hours is what I've spent playing this game. I even spent two hours writing this review. I think death stranding is a game you shouldn't sleep on.

Death Stranding is a 3rd person adventure/walking simulator/survival horror coming from the creative mind of Hideo Kojima and his new team. You deliver packages in this game while trying to avoid the dangers of the road which includes the terrain itself, the weather, bandits and also ghosts.

The story is more or less straight-forward. You're playing as Sam Porter Bridges, a courrier who's given the task of connecting settlements to the Chiral Network, which is basically the equivalent of our own internet but with some twists. The gimmick is that in this world, the concept of death itself has been thrown out the window and ghosts roam the lands between these settlements. I won't say more about the story as a big part of the journey is to uncover the mysteries of this world and why things are the way they are.

On the graphic side, this is peak level of details for our current generation. Beautiful landscape, nice colors and some of the best face details I've seen in years. The only game who comes close to this amount of detail overload is Red Dead Redemption 2. Amazing cutscenes, fluid animations, this game has it all.

As for the sound and music, it's excellent. Carefully handpicked songs played at precise moment helps elevates the emotional scope of these moments when you've almost reached your destination. Excellent voice acting by everyone. Neat sound effects for menus like the MGS series. What I dislike is how some songs are cut short because sometimes you deliver stuff very fast, so you only hear a brief segment of these songs. Second is the absence of the Music Player when you're out in the field. That's a big L right there. Besides these 2 little nitpicks, it's all good.

On paper, Death Stranding might sound like the most basic and dull game ever made. This was my mentality when I first heard about this game. It isn't as exciting as blowing up 100 zombies per second, yet it is a very zen and relaxing experience. In this day and age where online games and microtransactions rule, only a madman would attempt to make a game like this and I guess Kojima was up to the task for the sake of originality and creativity.

The art of balancing Sam's cargo weight while navigating slippery sloppes is realistic and at the same time, so goofy and funny. You haven't truly experienced this game unless you took a real bad tumble while being absolutely overweighted. But you see cargo lying on the ground and you STILL insist on picking it up.

This is why this game isn't for everyone, especially if you're impatient. The open world/sandbox vibe allows you to do whatever you want, carry what you want and go where you want. This game will teach you to make careful decision and how to take each steps carefully.

Note that I omit lot of details in this review because I'd bust Steam's character limit with some tl:dr paragraphs.

I highly recommed this game to anyone but beware, you need to walk in here with a different mindset than most mainstream games.

A masterpiece that will probably become a cult classic in the years to come. Bravo Kojima, you absolute lunatic.

10/10",1705606021,1705606365,True,230,15,0.933875024318695068,0,True,False,False
1850570,154246588,76561198332413018,286,94,4205,0,4205,1703357940,"Kojima's most self-indulgent work (and that's not always a good thing), but also the best story he's ever told.

The basic gameplay loop (traverse terrain and deliver packages while avoiding and/or fighting enemies) is enjoyable and extremely well-crafted. The physics of Sam moving across rocks, up and down hills, through streams; it's all the best I've ever seen in a video game. Sam's inertia feels real, and it's beautifully tied into the vibration on the controller (again, the best I've ever seen in a video game). You'll feel rocks on the ground, packages picked up, etc. The sound design is also incredible, with the sound of rain, wind, and rocks just crystal clear and realistic. This is game development at its absolute most meticulous, with attention to even the tiniest details. It's an incredible accomplishment.

That said, this definitely isn't for everyone. It's more of an interactive movie + work of avant-garde art, than what most people consider a ""video game."" More than anything, I'd say it's about atmosphere. The moody music from Low Roar certainly helps with that, and pairs nicely with the beautifully rendered landscapes.

A few frustrations: Getting grabbed by BTs and forced into boss fights can get annoying, and some of the unavoidable story-based boss fights are extremely obnoxious at times. Sam/Norman Reedus will eventually get access to an arsenal of weapons, but combat is not Death Stranding's strong suit. Unlike the Metal Gear series, combat gameplay feels clunky and awkward throughout (although maybe that's by design; Sam is a porter, not a soldier like Big Boss).

Another frustration is the multiple false endings. Slightly spoiler-ish, but when you're fighting what you assume is the final boss, you're actually only kinda halfway through the game, and there are a number of other boss fights to come. Multiple times, you're told ""This is your final delivery"" or ""final mission,"" only for someone to tell you the exact same thing 20 minutes later.

The high point is the story (even though it drags on at times) and the absolutely incredible acting. Yes, the sci-fi/fantasy is a little silly, and eventually explained to you in seemingly endless lore-dump monologues (as is typical for Kojima), but it's refreshing to see something so boldly imagined and new. The sci-fi is completely original, unlike anything out there, and often breathtaking in sheer spectacle, which is nice in a time when everything feels so derivative.

I can honestly say that this is the best acting I've ever seen in a video game. The entire cast is stellar, but Mads Mikkelsen, Tommie Earl Jenkins, Troy Baker, and Emily O'Brien are especially outstanding. I'm not a sucker for drama, but the acting here is just riveting. Nobody phones it in just because it's a video game. It was honestly surprising for me to see. It's all helped by the incredibly good script. The dialogue is excellent and believable; there are no eyeroll-inducing lines, despite how silly the sci-fi stuff can get. The emotion is raw, real, and extremely heartfelt. I was not expecting that when I got this game.

TLDR:
Not for everyone. Part game, part interactive movie, part avant-garde art. The best story Hideo Kojima has ever told, and absolutely incredible acting. Enjoyable gameplay loop, but frustrating combat (when it happens). Overall, unlike any other game out there.",1703369023,1705602833,True,1,0,0.489291608333587646,0,True,False,False

Death Stranding takes place in a beautiful open world, set against the backdrop of a post-apocalyptic landscape. The game's setting is further enhanced by its remarkable soundtrack, which features soft, ethereal vocal performances, innovative instrumentation, and recurring motifs that complement the visually stunning environment. The use of ethereal, ambient sounds and melodies can evoke a sense of isolation or otherworldliness, aligning with the game's post-apocalyptic setting.

The use of music inside and outside of the cutscenes is strategic. A commonly known thing about Death Stranding is that there is a lot of walking. Much of the game has no music playing in the background. Instead, music is played at critical points in your gameplay: traveling through an area for the first time or getting close to the finish line in a very long mission are some examples. The tracks that play during gameplay are dynamic: usually open with very subtle sounds to ease you into the music, such as muted percussion noises or soft vocals, then slowly transforms into a fully textured and immersive composition. Unlike many other games, these songs do not loop, and are instead meant to blend with the cinematic experience you are having as a player. I wish I could experience this game for the first time again, because these moments exemplify Kojima’s mastery of game design and his potential as a film director. 

In the moments of intense action where Sam has to beat up terrorists, the music reflects the urgency and intensity of hand-to-hand combat. When spotted, a loud airhorn-like sound plays from the terrorist that spotted you, then the combat music starts. The shift in tone and pace during combat contrasts with the game's more ambient and ethereal tracks, providing a dynamic, immersive audio experience.

""Anything You Need"" by Low Roar from the album “0” (2014) sticks out to me the most, mainly because of the hypnotic, unchanging melody. It captures and carries your attention for the full three minutes. Mixed with Ryan Karazija’s somber vocals, this track feels like it belongs in the game more than any other. Like Death Stranding, “Anything You Need” stands out in its medium and is avant-garde in all respects.",1705537138,1705537138,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Rush through the starting area. There is a main area you will spend most of your time in
Second area the first thing to do is steal a truck from the mules and use it as much as you can until you get your own. 

You can 5 star facilities to get certain items unlocked, some are useful some are not.

Useful facilities to 5 star.

William Lake -Lake Knot City
Reverse trike - transport(if you dont want to use the mules truck, same cargo space except faster)

Thomas Sutherland - Distribution Center South of Lake Knot City
Long Range Truck Lv 3,

The Collector
Backpack Cover Lv 2


Junk dealer
Speed skeleton lvl 3

 Philip North - Distribution Center North of Mountain Knot City
Extra Battery Lv 3

It's worth making roads so don't be scared of using your mats, you can always farm them from MULES.there are some roads that are worth making and others not.

MATS for the roads are lowered as soon as you get them into the chiral network.
So make them after you connecting to maximize usefulness.

Roads I recommend making.

Lake knot>distribution south>south knot
	You will be going through here a lot in the early game.

Late game you can make.

Distribution south>mountain knot>distribution center north

After this your all set to complete the game.

I recommend doing so first. Since you get a free roam mode after to do any extra side stuff after.

Simplest of interactions feel like picking up that 200 kg of cargo you're carrying in game, in real life. PlayStation moment at its best. THEN I move on to doing missions.

If you cut the unnecessary dialogue, I'd believe %30 of the game would be gone. For example - the c*nt named [spoiler]Die Hardman[/spoiler]who's probably sittin at his office and jerkin' off all day with his[spoiler]stupid mask and lame voice[/spoiler], while I'm[spoiler]moving literal TONS of gear and supplies between the settlements.[/spoiler] Make a drinking game - everytime he says ""Sam"", you take a shot. Oh boy, gonna go blind in 20 minutes, lemme tell ya that. You KNOW once he starts yappin', sh*t's gonna take at least 10 minutes. This mf talk so much and so empty, I'm sure half my playtime were his dialogues. Instead of saying 1 loud and clear sentence, homeboi goes on and on and on and on..[spoiler]Who needs rain that makes your skin grow older if it touches you[/spoiler], when you can just talk to[spoiler]Die f*cking Hardman[/spoiler]? Yeesh, even his name is cringe lol. I've seen stuff like this many times in animes I watched as well, so I'm guessing this... ""mansplaining"" is a Japanese and/or Kojima thing.

Speaking of over extended dialogues - bruh - who's writing entire pharagraphs to the protag Sam, sprinkled with 20 cringe ass emojis every sentence? Even my mom stopped doing that and she's 73 ffs. I don't mind trying to set up a decent lore for a post apocalypse game, but sh*t, don't write entire ass essays to me via e-mail lol, I got sh*t to transport. Since you made it this far, wanna hear my 2 cents on this fellas? They're trying to establish lore and identity with wall of text headass e-mails bc your handlers for each town / settlement have like 5 spoken dialogues and personality of a grain of rice I ate today. Damn man, my exes didn't text me this much during our most fatal moments - but this mf sends a 20 line message about a f*cking pizza? Gaaaaaahdam. Anyways, THEN I move on to exploring more.

They world that they built... Looks good, feels empty. Best thing you can hope for while exploring is a decent scenic view of an area, random cargo you can pick up and carry to a settlement or USB's that contains real life info on movies / bikes exc. The online stuff comes in, which is actually pretty decent. People build stuff for easier movement, warning signs for hostiles exc, and you can see and use 'em, while they do the same to your constructs. Fun to see how people overcome obstacles but... Oh brother, if only they filled the landscape up with some decent, interesting stuff.. I mean, you got the ENTIRE layout of U.S.A. and an interesting lore here, come on man, USE it dammit, instead of sending me hundreds of e-mails... Anyways, THEN I discover new toys and vehicles to play with.

Progression feels decent, but I feel like some of the stuff that unlocks later on should have been unlocked earlier. What am I gonna do with stun grenades when I'm packed with blood bags (heal items) and an AR?

For a game that focuses on transportation, vehicles are horrendous, extremely clunky and counter intuitive. My brother in Christ, GTA Vice City,[i] which came out in 2002,[/i] had better controls / handling compared to the bikes in this game. You think enemy [spoiler]Mule's and BT's[/spoiler] are your problem? No, [u]r o c k s[/u] are your ultimate nemesis. My brain bleeds when I hit that one rock and my truck breaks space/time continuum and physics go off into the garbage can. So start building them highways ASAP, dear Porters. Oh yeah, speaking of roads - where's my radio at? You put good, calm music into the game, but won't lemme play it while I travel? The f*ck man?

Game has interesting ideas and a relatively addicting core gameplay. But as I get closer to the end? I am EXTREMELY neutral about this one, with a pinch of negative. Been pushing for the end for the last... 10 hours tbh. Hence I'll mark it a thumbs down for now, but who knows, maybe once I finish the whole thing... IF I can muster up the energy to do so, that is.

EDIT

Okay after 2 weeks and adding a whoopin' 100 something hours to the game, it'd be unfair on my end to not edit the review. 

So, using one simple trick made the game immediately more fun. Instead of being super reliant on vehicle based travel, I built an entire network of ziplines that pretty much covers the entire continent. Less cancer from vehicles = more fun. This is not without its own problems though, bc you have a ""Chiral Network Limit"" which means how much sh*t you can build. This can be increased by getting better reputation with settlements. Unfortunately, chiral limit is filled up with not only the stuff you built, but what other players added to the network as well. This means you gotta mix your ziplines with others, bc you won't have unlimited limit. You can dismantle other player structures, but sadly it doesn't remove them from the limit, just deletes them visually. Kinda restricts the freedom, bc sometimes you won't be able to build that perfect straight zipline from A to B, since you have to mix and match with other player ziplines, but after getting enough towns to 5 stars, you're much more independent, which means you can build more freely. Once I discovered this, it was really fun to plan where to build ziplines for optimum travel times and distances. Game also picked up the pace immensely story wise after Chapter 6 / 7, so that was really good as well. 

Yet, unfortunately my other complaints still remain about the game. Let's just hope they will fix and improve their annoying stuff in 2nd game, bc this was genuinely a good story.",1703798889,1705253232,False,3,6,0.462093770503997803,0,True,False,False

Of course, most of your time will be spent traversing behemoth landscapes - you will walk, run, and jog across varying biomes and terrain, as well as wade through rivers and snow-capped mountains. For the entirety of it's length, you will be hauling bigger, and more fragile cargo through bigger, and badder landscapes littered with apocalyptic threats - such as: hoarding-obsessed bandits, terrorists, supernatural entities, and time accelerating rain - all the while increasing the efficiency of your deliveries using strategic routing, available tools, and co-operation with other players.

While 'walking' may be part of the core of Death Stranding, your motivation to deliver in the first place is what elevates it above many other games I've played before. What ties the experience together, as simple as it sounds, is making connections. The more you deliver cargo, forging bonds as you go, the more tangible rewards you receive and the easier it becomes as more player structures will appear to aid you, making journeys safer and most crucially, more efficient - in this way, you are quite literally connecting people together. This contextual link between the superbly addicting gameplay loop and Kojima's enthralling, detail-rich, storytelling is what makes Death Stranding not only one of the most immersive entertaining experiences money can buy, but the result of what I can only describe as another genre-defying stroke of genius by Kojima and his team.

TLDR? Let me be clear, this is not a 'walking simulator' - even if movement is simulated to an extent that it alone could carry an entire game - it is a cinematic, post apocalyptic, multi-genre masterpiece featuring, of course, walking, all the thrills I've already described, and so much more.

DS is possibly the greatest video game that I can't recommend to people, well I do (obviously) but only to certain types of people. If you enjoy games with a slow burn story that unravels itself over the course of many hours, then this game is for you. If you appreciate games with such intricate game and level design that the tiniest rock can throw you of off your balance then this game is for you. And if you enjoy spending hours and hours walking around and planning travel routes, then this game is for you. 

[h3]Game-play & Design[/h3]
This might be DS's strongest and weakest selling point, because it is so intricately crafted it's actually pretty amazing how they managed to incorporate so many features into one game. Like I mentioned previously, the slightest rock or elevation has the potential to throw you off your balance which requires you think more cautiously on how and where you traverse, even how you set up your cargo load can affect your centre of mass. The game has really thought about its balancing elements in its game design, for example, you can build trikes and trucks to travel throughout the land. However, most areas have such uneven terrains that trying to use such vehicles becomes often becomes difficult to handle, pretty much forcing you to walk to most of your destinations. Their is a fast travel system but the catch is you can't bring any cargo with you, which again forces you to walk. To some people this might seem frustrating and/or boring to deal with, I thought like this at first but after a while I actually found it to be quite soothing to take in a lot of the landscape and scenery.

Their are a variety of structures that you can make along your journey to help provide more efficient routes of backtracking or tools to help scale large landscapes. once a structure is set up it can also be used by other players online, and vice versa (any structures they make you'll also be able to access), furthering the game's themes of connection. You can even like and music to your structures too. However, you must be aware that after a while these structures may begin to break down due to time-fall and will require maintenance, especially for structures set up in areas with heavy or frequent time-fall. their are also highway's that can be constructed that allow for travelling to be much easier but they require large quantities of materials which can take ages to accrue. Once constructed and other users use the highway's that you built, it can yield ten of thousands of likes to your bridge link profile. facial mapping is highly accurate.

In typical Kojima fashion, the design is catered around the idea of encouraging more peaceful routes to conflict (due to his personal aversion to war and violence) their are lethal and non-lethal weapons within the game, and outside of boss battles, using lethal weapons is discouraged (e.g. when you kill a mule they begin undergo necrosis which attracts BTs) thus you are encouraged to handle most situations as non-lethally as possible.

The only complaints that I have with the game design is that recycling materials can be unnecessarily tedious and the gun-play in this game isn't all that great, most of the weapons sound too quiet and feel as though they don't have any weight to them. The guns themselves are fine in what they do, just wish they'd feel more impactful. Some of the bosses are pretty cool but do get a bit little repetitive after a while. 

[h3]Story & Characters[/h3]
An event known as the Death Stranding has reformed the land of America, to become this allured landscape plagued by ghastly entities known as BTs (Beached Things). You play as Sam Porter Bridges, a lone delivery man, when you're called upon to expand the Chrial Network to connect cities all over America to form the UCA (United Cities of America).  The core theme of DS is about connection and it explores this theme exceedingly well, not just in the literal sense of connecting cities and preppers to join the Chrial Network, but also in the metaphorical sense. Each character in the story that you meet and interact with (even preppers) deal with the matter of connection in some form e.g. Sam Porter has aphenphosmphobia (the fear of being touched) as a result he doesn't connect with anyone, no friends, even family is strained, it isn't until he encounters BB (a Bridge Baby, connecting the world of the living and the dead), over the course of the story, as he encounters more people along with the struggles that they go through, and spends more time with BB, he begins to slowly become more receptive to the people who wish to connect with him. 

Their are quiet a few antagonists and morally grey characters interwoven within the story with plenty of twists and turns, BTs aren't the only thing that poses a threat to humanity. A terrorist cell group called the Homo Demens, have caused a series of void out explosions, lead by the intimidating and all powerful Higgs (named after the God particle). I could say more but then'll be encroaching spoiler territory. 

The story may seem at first glance to be convoluted, but when you actually think about the plot threads and start to connect the dots it actually makes perfect sense. It manages to introduce so many story elements that culminate to form a complex yet somehow cohesive story, it explores its themes of connection extremely well. It may be a slow burn story (then again I like those) but it has some amazing and rewarding emotional payoffs that makes it well worth trudging through hours of walking from place to place. Seeing all of these characters with such deep backstories being unfurled with such care and craft is nothing short of amazing.

The only complaints I'd have about the story would only be nitpicks, and even then it might only be how a scene is presented. Or without getting too much into spoilers there is one section where you are given the illusion of choice (where it acts like you have a choice to make but really it only ends one way). Another nitpick is that doing side or orders that aren't relevant to the story have no impact on how the story plays out (seems like a bit of missed opportunity). aside from that the story is emotionally powerful and quite thought provoking about its perspective on the human condition

The dialogue is great and impactful, for the most part. There are a hand full of lines that sound like something you'd see on r/im14andthisdeep, but when you have so much dialogue they can't all be winners. 

[h3]The World of Death Stranding[/h3]
The maps in DS are massive, as this is a game where you primarily deliver packages to people this means lots and lots of travelling. Travelling over obstacles, travelling through BT infested areas, travelling through cargo mule territories, etc. with all sorts of different, well laid out terrains and environments, with many ways to approach them.

When I first played DS, I only played about 5-7 hours of the game and stopped, initially I thought it was boring, pretentious and not worth my time. This was back in 2019, my life had changed considerably since then. One day I bought DS on sale and I'd decided actually give it a fair chance. Doing so has allowed me discover that I was wrong to dismiss such a game on ill thought-out bad impressions, and it might be one of the most personal gaming experiences I've ever had.

the idea is shit and stupid but if the game didn't had all of it's stupid shit like invisible demons or being able to build a road for other players to use it wouldn't be as good as it is. 

you have a bunch of different tools to do something, but those tools are also kinda limited because you can't really experiment with any of it since they all do what they say they do and nothing more.

this game is a gamble, but a gamble that will always pay out, the longer you play this the more you'll like it, it's nostalgic and still new, it makes no sense and is both a kick in the balls to what kojima once did for mgsv and a love letter to all of his fans at the same time.

buy this, experience the first strand type game and all it's glory and then kill yourself after being info dumped for 7 hours worth of cutscenes. (like what the fuck? like i get it, it's cool lore but bruh you have a notes tab that tells you all of this shit already so why shove it my face when i just want to deliver shit?)",1659485660,1705011760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

HOWEVER

While the setting and story are epic, the gameplay is wrestling with janky traversal mechanics which shines its darkest when trying to ride the janky bike through janky valleys across janky rocks while trying to avoid invisible ghosts that will rip you off your bike that just got stuck on a pebble, make you drop all your cargo then make you run away from some eldritch goo monster while trying to wade through gunk and clamber over rocks. Yes this happened to me. And I got through that part, but knowing that I'm probably going to have to deal with more of that later makes this awesome story not worth it.
To make things worse, the UI is a huge mess of superflous button presses and numbers and text everywhere.
Then there's also mountains of text and long conversations on the side.

I'm done.
And I'm also a bit concerned that Hideo might have started to lose it towards the end of Metal Gear Solid 4.

And there for recommend it

Story:
I think it has a story though with some holes in it, but many games has that and movies.
What they do here is tell it at a good pace and keep it decently interesting, I am not gonna tell more as I do not wanna spoil anything of the story.

The look of the game:
I like the stile of the game and it looks awesome when you run around looking at everything.

The gameplay:
Well here it gets a little funny as I would expect to find the deliver things a bit boring, but that was not what I felt. I think traversal is great with a bit of a challenge so it is fun and you can try different things.
Also think it is cool with this ""help"" from others once you open up an area is pretty cool and really like that about it. And you also can see that if many use the same route then it become more like a ""path"" for you to go and more easy to go there.

I just made this a bit fast, but really like this game and will recommend.

At about 15 hours, I purchased the DC upgrade. One of the biggest regrets, after nearly 100 hours in this game, was that I had never played it sooner.

The game does start slow but I assure you that once you've made it past the onboarding phase, things open up and catapult this game into allstardom.

This game is one of the best multi-layered tales of our time. The lore is deep and enriched by the data you collect through the game. The end of the game is satisfying and leaves you wanting more - not out of a lack of fulfilment, but because you want more Sam and BB against the world. There are highs, lows, tension, horror, drama and incredible action moments which kick the adrenaline into high-gear and have a great payoff once completed.

The acting is top-notch - all the talents that Kojima is working alongside brought their A-game and every main performance served the story. I have a lot of love for some of these characters who have shared a variety of moments with Sam on my journey.

The environments are gorgeous and varied and these contrast so well with the tense moments. We are offered awe-striking moments of beautiful scenery accompanied by one of the most well-curated and designed soundtracks of our time.

The game is paced with you. If you want to slog and complete all the side objectives to make your latter-game experience a bit easier, go ahead. If you don't want to spend a mountain of hours to get through the campaign, you can do that as well - although you'll have a bit of a tougher time with some routes or unlocks not on your side.

I'm taking the time to write this for the few of you who are wondering what to expect... and it's hard to explain this game to somebody out of the blue - but you won't have an experience quite like this one. You are, essentially, controlling your own action movie. Like Infamous, The Last of Us or Uncharted - it really takes you through a journey... you just need to get through those first 3 Acts to make the game really open up and unlock flexibility.

DS is slowly becoming my all time favorite game. It is hard to truly recommend because you will either love it, or hate it (I'm 8 hours in and according to achievements, 50% of players never made it that ""far"").

Some people may find the game boring, but it's all about your approach to the game - not every game has to be a frenetic action 24/7.

Pros:

+ Art design is absolutely insane and really fresh. Every little detail seems incredibly original. 

+ Gameplay is incredibly meditative and tranquil. I could spend hours just walking and admiring the vistas. Also it is definitely not just walking simulator. 

There are various enemies and threats, stealth, weapons, vehicles, tools and much more.

+ Visually the game is stunning and timeless.

+ UI is very thought out and controls are flawless, everything works just perfect.

+ Story is very convoluted until it's slowly not, feels very rewarding to uncover.

Cons:

- The amount of new stuff the game throws at you can be a little overwhelming at times.

- Vehicle physics and controls are sometimes a little janky, (but still enjoyable).

- Loading is sometimes a little longer than I'm used to from other games (over a minute on nvme ssd).",1704184004,1704401579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fluid movement, decent story, good music, good combat if you take the time to learn it, and beautiful graphics.

My main complaints for the game is twofold: One, there are many optional mechanics that aren't given to you early enough. For example, you don't unlock the ability to customize your clothes until end-game.

And also, once you get over the initial fear of falling, you realize traversing the map is just too easy. Things like ladders, grappling hooks, etc; are completely optional, and are generally much slower than simply climbing up or down the side of a mountain. There are countless footholds, and you can just hold both triggers, and hold x, and you'll climb up nearly anything with very little risk of falling. Any deep river can casually be driven through with any truck. And 99% of rivers can be jumped over the moment you have robotic legs.

What’s surprising about this revised PlayStation 5 version of the game is that it doesn’t involve hours of extra cinematic sequences that were cut from the original. Thank goodness. Instead, it’s a thoughtful, thorough and visually arresting enhancement of the game, with interesting and sometimes amusing new features.

It still remains the mystical, artful and gloriously pretentious delivery sim it always was: you play apocalyptic postman, Sam, attempting to revive an America torn apart by a supernatural explosion that annihilated the barrier between life and the afterlife. Working for a sort of idealistic version of DHL, he must deliver packages to cities across the country, hooking the residents up to a quasi-spiritual version of the internet as he goes. But haunting him at every step are the BTs – horrible semi-invisible monsters that represent the trapped souls of the dead. The only way Sam can see these things coming is via the foetus he carries everywhere with him in a glass incubator, which requires constant care and pacification. Amid all the dialogue about hope, belief and mortality, Death Stranding is really a game about how difficult it is to get out and about when you have a baby.
alleys, over moss-covered rocks and through babbling streams, it’s like being in your own Andrei Tarkovsky movie – the silence, the tension, the geologically precise scenery bathed in deadening blue-grey light. Add in the excellent support for which places the natural sounds far outside the whirs and clicks of Sam’s technology, and this is now a world that envelops you in its peculiar sadness.

Enhancing this greater sense of immersion is the Dual Sense controller support. The adaptive triggers put up much more of a fight when Sam is overloaded with cargo, giving you a physical sense of his struggle to stay upright. At the same time, the pad’s haptic feedback provides a tremor every time you take a heavy step, accentuating your physical contact with the earth. This effect is greatly exaggerated when under duress: say, when you’re trying to regain your composure after jogging down a hill with way too many metal boxes on your back.



he Good
Technical upgrades are impressive across the board
New narrative content is strong and asks some poignant questions
Core game has only become more prescient on repeated playthroughs
New tutorial/training elements make learning the game much easier
The Bad
New stealth areas feel meta, and stick out awkwardly from the rest of the game
Director's Cut gameplay elements take away a little from the game's narrative

I played Death Stranding for the first time shortly after it came out, got about 40 hours into the game casually before life happened and I had to sell my PS4, but it left an impression from trailers enough for me to buy it in the first place, and the gameplay was fun enough to want it again.

The Steam release found me finishing the game with a fondness for its systems and as tight a grasp on the story as the sea of cutscenes I had just waded through could give me, but I felt slightly cheated by the really interesting cinematics leading up to release. [spoiler]I hadn't played a Kojima game before.[/spoiler] Still, this left me enjoying the game enough that I started another playthrough before the Director's Cut was announced, which I then put on hold just after what I would consider to be the tutorial area so I could pick up at release where I had left off.

I first approached playing the director's cut like it was DLC, importing my lightly used save file before very quickly realizing things had been added even early on, so I restarted with the mission to max out every connection before moving on past an area so I could more easily make myself get every star. Had I known I would go on to finish every achievement, I may have instead opted to save myself a few dozen hours and just rush through the story to simplify cleaning up, but I find stopping to smell the roses in this game is extremely rewarding to me personally, and this more deliberate playstyle gave me a deeper perspective on the different tiers of play.

Prior to this final playthrough I racked up ~150 hours in the base game, and at time of review I have now clocked another 150. I don't think it is very likely that I will be playing again anytime soon to do anything other than to get LLL on my remaining couple hundred deliveries, though I may start taking on ranked missions as well. Here's hoping DS2 sees an early PC release.

You are Sam Porter Bridges, ""America's Last Hope"" in reconnecting after an apocalyptic event known as the Death Stranding occured. Planes no longer fly, radio waves no longer travel nearly as far, and death waits around every corner for us all. Rain is now deadly, and ghosts are capable of turning a body into an antimatter bomb if they catch you. You must navigate the landscapes and ruins of the (quaintly scaled) continental United States as you cross the country to piece it all back together.

I encourage anyone interested in understanding the story to read every in game interview you come across, as many of the best details are hidden here behind the somewhat nonsensical cutscenes.

[b]8.5/10[/b]
[/list]
Overall very cohesive and pretty photorealistic style, good use of colors, and well detailed landscapes. Early portions of the game can look a bit ugly and sparse, and many areas are not populated by many objects other than rocks and the occasional sign of plant life. Pop in present during raised driving sections but not problematic or noticable in other situations. Occasional flickering/shimmering of distant objects makes it hard for me to tell if there is a visual glitch or just a feature. Very few obvious model/terrain errors. Some niche animations seem to have been left unpolished [spoiler](such as Sam's face while singing in the bath)[/spoiler], however the game is beautifully rendered otherwise.

[b]9.5/10[/b]
[/list]
Both ambient audio and music are on point, the soundtrack is one of the game's strongest features. Sounds of walking on different terrain, moving machinery, and weapons all feel good. Many moments in the game are scored based on what's happening, but silence will accompany most of your journey. Soundtrack pieces play at key moments and lend greatly to atmosphere. Voice work ranges from servicable to spectacular. Seriously, just listen to the soundtrack.

[h3]controller recommended[/h3] 

Take on a variety of orders to fetch and deliver thousands of packages across a wasteland. As you progress through more deliveries, more materials and upgrades like weapons for dealing enemies, and tools to ease your future traversal become available. Developing routes through challenging areas and adapting to sometimes changing conditions will see you through to completing larger and more complex deliveries.

Locomotion is the point of it all, you must maintain Sam's balance while protecting your cargo from the elements, enemy humans, and most importantly the ghosts that haunt all the edges of your paths and some spaces in between. Some light resource and energy management is required to progress, which can take a toll with all the menuing required.

At some point the game will require you to engage with gun combat, though nonlethal measures should always be fully explored as a dead body can leave you with more trouble than you started with. I recommend attempting to remain in stealth or avoid most overworld combat encounters unless you plan to clear an area out for a while. The ghosts can present a frustrating challenge for some beginners but become mostly trivial speed bumps around midway through the game. 

Death Stranding always leaves me wanting to complete one last haul over and over. Its a very satisfying core loop that rewards planning, building up infrastructure, and engaging with all its systems.

[h2][b]on upgrading to director's cut[/b][/h2]
For those who have played the base game and feel satisfied, this is not a necessary purchase. There is nothing fundamentally transformative from the game you have experienced, though if you would like to play through again I don't recommend against an upgrade if that option is available to you. You will have access to a few new and variant items and overall improved combat experience, a couple new locations and activities, a robust photo mode, and DualSense support. Added context for several characters doesn't go amiss. Overall the combat feel is quite substantially improved, and the added training mode provides fun scenarios to try out each new weapon and help onboard new players to the challenges they will be facing in a low-risk scenario. These are nice touches on an already strong work, but may not be compelling enough to recommend an additional purchase.

[h2][b]a short case for DualSense[/b][/h2]
Playing through these last 100 or so hours on my PS5 controller has been a wonderful experience, and its all thanks to the adaptive triggers. The effect of having Sam grasping a cumbersome load translate to varying levels of added trigger resistance, and the snappy feeling of firing off shots with some weapons or binding an enemy with your strand is very satisfying and harmonizes with gameplay. I don't recommend going out and buying one just for this, but if you have one to hand its my preference.",1702513346,1704156797,True,2,0,0.544072985649108887,0,True,False,False

I initially bought this game on PS4 when it was first released. Like most people, I had no idea what I was getting into at the time, but by the time I completed my first play through, it turned out to be one of the most positive and moving experiences I've ever gotten from a video game (no really, I was actually moved by it.)

""Walking Simulator"" is a really bad description, and this must have been coined by people who didn't actually play it, or only played the first few hours (or heard it from an influencer who only played the first few hours.) Sure, there's a lot of walking - at first. It isn't long before you start unlocking vehicles, though. Also, I found the walking bits to be extremely enjoyable either way. Often times, the mission is all about the journey and less about the destination. 

The general theme of this game is making connections. It's a lonely world out there, and everyone's separated and living in bunkers. You're tasked with making deliveries and essentially hooking up their version of the internet. The world is broken, and you're bringing it together. 

A neat aspect of this game is that it has an online connection, but you never directly interact with other players. Instead, you'll come across things they've left behind. A rope, a ladder, perhaps a bridge or a shelter. You can leave things behind to help the next player along. Cross the same area a few times, and you'll leave a path for the next player to follow. The world is lonely, but these things show that you're not truly on your own out there. I find it very beautiful, actually. 

You'll learn a lot of terms that definitely won't make a lot of sense at first, but after awhile it starts to click. I found the story to be very unique and interesting, and the more I learned about what the ""Death Stranding"" is and the effects it has on the world, the more I was intrigued. It even has a very cool take on death itself and what it means, and for some characters, death is only temporary. 

Speaking of death, this game is very unique in the way that it discourages you from killing any living person. The game pushes you to tie them down, knock them out, or otherwise use various non-lethal means to incapacitate the human enemies. It doesn't actually stop you from killing, but it very strongly discourages you from doing so, and in the event that it does happen, you'll have to deal with the body (and a very upset baby in a jar.) In most cases, you'll probably make it through the entire game without killing a single person. If you're looking for a big shoot-'em-up game, this ain't it.

Another type of enemy you'll encounter are the non-living ghost-like entities called ""beached things"" or ""BTs."" Why are they called that? Well, beaches are a common theme in the lore of this world and are connected to death. It's explained pretty heavily during the game, but basically every person has a beach that they go to when they die, and these ""beached things"" have crossed into the world of the living. If you move quietly, you can often slip right by them without them noticing you, with the help of your ""bridge baby"" or ""BB"" (or as some refer to as the ""funky fetus."") However, it can still be hard to get by them at times, so if you are noticed, all hell breaks loose and you'll be in for a spooky fight. 

Also, I can't help but mention how BEAUTIFUL the world is. It's supposed to take place in the U.S., but you won't actually see any real U.S. landmarks or anything. A lot of it looks like Iceland, really. Either way, I loved exploring the world. Some of my favorite parts were those long journeys where you're not actually in any enemy territory, and a nice song from bands like Low Roar is playing. It was easy to just kick back, relax, and enjoy the views. 

The story has a lot of twists and turns, and a lot of it won't make any damn sense at first. Once you start to ""get it"", it's very beautiful. If you're not into story-driven games, or not interested in stories that make you think, you probably won't like this game. However, if that is your jam, prepare for an emotional rollercoaster of epic proportions. 

There's also no shortage of cool stuff you can do in this game. Want to build a zipline from one mountain peak to another? Go for it! Want to build a sick jump to ride your motorcycle off of? Hell yeah! Want to make your journey more efficient and build an entire freaking highway? Get those building materials and pave away! Want to take a piss on a rock and make a mushroom grow out of it? Yeah, you can actually do that! The possibilities are endless. 

I still feel like this review has barely scratched the surface of what this game is truly all about. I can't overstate enough about how much of a positive feel-good experience this game actually is. Kojima and his team have truly created a unique, beautiful masterpiece, and it has easily become one of my favorite games of all time. I loved it so much, that I bought it again on Steam. 

Also, if you happen to own this game, you should definitely play it on your birthday. You'll see why. ;)

Death stranding isn't really an awful game, but it's not exactly an amazing game either.

The only positive thing I can really say about this game is that it plays really smooth, it has some of the best optimization in a game I've seen to date lately. But that alone doesn't excuse the egregious nature of it's story, It's pretentious and dumb, and the worst part about it is the kojima-ism's really come into full force here. Had the game had more engaging gameplay to entertain me apart from the bad story, I wouldn't have minded so much.

Seriously who thought naming a character Die-hard-man, or dead-man, or momma, was a good idea? I mean, I know there were some ridiculous ones in MGS but it's just full force here.

The game really becomes a slog at the end, once you hit the mountain region it just goes downhill from there.

The story is layered and intriguing, revealing information and twists and turns, and finally tie's up all upon its conclusion.  The game play equally so.  As you progress throughout your journey, new mechanics, modes of travel and equipment is unlocked at just the right pace to keep your interest.  The sharing of structures and equipment with the community aids in this process, giving you a genuine feeling of progress and a desire to build and share to be apart of the greater game.

Death Stranding comes in a time where most of the AAA space is populated with sequels and derivatives of the same tired old types of games.

After playing the game through to completion, my experience has been a wildly mixed one, with a few (very high) highs, and many (miserably low) lows.

I guess that, if you are the famous and self-proclaimed ""genius"" Hideo Kojima, you can't settle for a believable story, or provide a simple yet viable game experience: you have to go all-in, no prisoners taken.

The unfortunate result of such uncompromising approach is a gargantuan pastiche, that tries to be a brilliant and clever concoction of videogame and movie, but ends up steering too far away from both the interactive and appeasing nature of videogames, and the narratively rich and concise nature of movies.

What little gameplay is provided is tedious, unimaginative and frustrating, and the cinematic sequences are repetitive, boring, overly drawn-out and without any sense of measure or direction.

Scenarios, albeit vast and believable, are painfully devoid of any meaningful landmark, and end up feeling empty and look-alike.

The main themes of the game are stated over and over and over, and what should constitute a canvas of human feelings and hopes, in the form of e-mails and dialogues, ends up being tedious, scholastic and repetitive to the point of making everything seem like it's been written by the same person.

The interface pays the heavy price of having being designed with a PS4 controller in mind: everything that pertains the cargo management screams ""drag&drop with a mouse"", but the player is instead forced to fight with an unintuitive sequence of ""press a""/""hold a""/""press random button"" that NEVER becomes natural, even after many many hours of ""gameplay"".

It's a pity because presentation is stellar: lightning, textures, animations, motion capture, voice dubbing, sound effects... everything is excellent, and really conveys a sense of credibility to the audio/visual elements of the experience.

Also, physics are magistrally implemented: every inch of terrain interacts with Sam and his cargo in a believable way... it's easy to completely forget that this is a videogame, and concentrate on bringing that damn cargo to it's destination, no matter how many arbitrary wrenches the game throws at the player to obstruct their progression.

All in all, it feels like there's an insanely talented team behind this game... I just hope that they will get to work on something better and more focused in the future.",1703401071,1703401071,False,6,2,0.490606784820556641,0,True,False,False

Being a Kojima fan I thought I was ready for what was coming, and boy, was I wrong.

30 minutes in and I am fully invested in the plot and mechanics, embrancing the full scope of the experience. That for itself is a compliment. Currently I am trying to max rank all my clients before moving on with the plot, thats how invested I am in this narrative and in the world that entails this game.

With that said I can tell you that Death Stranding is an enjoyable experience on its own. Play it with an open mind, and never forget  that you arent alone in this harsh world.
 
---{ Graphics }---
☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

DECIMA engine holds up really well, for an old timer like me graphics like this are peak, I pause the game all the time to take some sweet screenshots so I hope you will enjoy it also.

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

The games guide you masterfully towards its proposal, but I have to say that it can be a hard pillow to swallow for some folks, since the classical guns blazing approach is not the most advisable for this journey. You will get lots of action in many segments, but beware.

---{ Audio }---
☑ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

The OST fits perfectly with the scenes and moments, no complaints here. The bands that were chosen are absolutely mint. I have to say that most of the songs are part of my trekking playlist.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

People that want an spiritual experience, immersing themselves in a rich world and that are not afraid of something a little bit repetitive, yet innovative.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

Its a game from 2019 so dont bother.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

Its not a walk in the park but also not hell on earth, if you learn fast about all this game is about you will cruise among the plot connecting the dots. I havent found a bottleneck that made me get stuck or frustrated, so I think this is a good thing. There is always a different approach to try for every problem.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

If  you go for the plot you wont need to grind (much). If you plan to collect all max reviews from all the clients, get all the itens and see every little cinematic experience you gonna need to invest some hours. I promise you that they will be worth it.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☑ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

I havent beaten the game yet, but from what I got so far I am really invested. Sasuga Kojima san!!

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

This can vary a bit, but if you are a lore nut like me you will gonna have a long time with this one.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

If  you have doubts, buy it on a sale.

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

Some minor bugs related to the package mechanics, nothing gamebreaking or frustrating.

Well, I havent beaten the game yet, but I can say that it was worth the 30 hours I invested in it. I will update this review accordingly as soon as I finish the main quest.

1850570,153882925,76561198049896401,0,21,5439,0,5439,1701106183,"This game is amazing.  It has problems, but for me they are not the same problems I see echoed frequently online.  Yes, it's a walking sim in the most literal sense but that is also as reductive as you can possible be.  It's a Kojima-directed post-apocalyptic paranormal sci-fi open-world mission-based hiking sim.

First, there is a solid gameplay loop here, consisting of accepting delivery missions, loading up with cargo and tools, and hiking to your destinations.  If you have played MGSV, many of the controls and mechanics will feel familiar to you, but combat and stealth are de-emphasized, while traversal and problem solving take center stage.  That's not to say there is no combat; it is less common but what's there is suprisingly deep and well integrated with the game's cargo system.  Using loose cargo as a melee or ranged weapon is not only possible, but encouraged.

Missions can become repetitive late game, especially if you choose to 100% it and I think that could have been easily fixed by having fewer missions or more variety.  This problem is exacerbated by roads and ziplines which are useful but completely trivialize most deliveries once you have put some resources into them.  While it feels good to knock out 5 contracts at once with a fully loaded truck, it has the unintended consequence of optimizing the gameplay right out of the game, leaving....I don't know.  The satisfaction of a job well done?  By contrast the early missions embrace a slower pace that makes every obstacle feel significant and every rope and ladder feel like an accomplishment.  Navigating a mountain or river with the simple tools at your disposal feels uniquely satisfying.

The open world map is beautiful with a wide variety of terrain to navigate.  My only issue with this is that the map is broken into several disconnected parts, which makes each area feel small and the game gives no incentive to revisit earlier areas once you've left them.

Sadly the director's cut is not really what I would expect from a director's cut, so if the core game is cheaper I recommend it.  You won't miss out on a single story beat or new cutscene as far as I noticed.  There are only a couple new craftable tools which I rarely used on my 100% run, if ever.

The story is often a sticking point and I've seen it described online as messy and nonsensical.  It is definitely what we have come to expect from Kojima over the years but moreso.  Kojima's stories are generally theme-heavy but Death Stranding's story ONLY makes sense through the lens of its themes.  In other words, it's ALL theme man.  Every tool, character, game mechanic, and plot point engages with the themes established early on: connection, relationships, and binding; isolation, separation, and death.  If something in the story seems not to make sense, I encourage you to ask yourself if it serves the theme, and the answer is almost certainly yes.  Is it weird? Most definitely but have you played Metal Gear Solid?!

All that to say, I love this game.  It's not perfect but it tries a lot of new things and takes some big swings.  I hope we keep seeing new and interesting things from Kojima because that's why I go for his games.  I think too many people forget that Metal Gear Solid became popular for being innovative and not just by being a good stealth/action game.",1702937380,1702937380,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Weirdly this game pulled me in because of how confused I was in the beginning with the story, but the characters and set pieces were so interesting I wanted to know more. It's all very mysterious and that has definitely driven my enjoyment of the game alongside the very chill moments of just delivering packages.

Pros:
+ Gripping and Unique Story
+ Fun combat/stealth with many unique approaches that you can unlock as you progress
+ Addicting gameplay loop with a very in depth carrying system
+ Atmospheric world and breathtaking environments
+ Online elements are very rewarding and makes you feel satisfied that what you do helps others in their playthroughs 
+ Stunning and immersive soundtrack (Seriously! At least listen to it on Spotify/Youtube if you get the chance)
+ Some amazing performances in game (including one involving Tommie Earl Jenkins)
Cons:
- Frustrating off-road physics with vehicles
- certain scenes with awkward dialogue
- not enough of involvement between Sam and other characters in cutscenes

Although this may not be everything i can praise/criticize the game it was an overall 10/10 for me and i highly recommend it to those that want a different gaming experience or to those that enjoy Kojima's other works such as Silent Hill, or Metal Gear Solid.",1701757030,1701757030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Passive cutscenes on generic hostile encounters is one of the thing that annoyed me the most in this game because it will freeze the movement of the player.

The game-play loop presented to you in the first couple of hours was not something I felt I wanted to put time into to see if it got more enjoyable. After hearing nothing but good things about this game as it has aged, I finally sat myself down in '23 and and forced myself though the first 5 hours. 

Maybe it was the pandemic? Or something relating to a rather hectic work/life balance I had finally escaped after 7 years, but being able to *build* connections in a desolate world finally resonated with me. There is a real sense of accomplishment watching the world take shape around you as you make connections between extremely isolated cities and individuals. You are also continually rewarded with better skills and items that enable greater efficiency in making these connections. You truly feel like you are making a difference in the world and in turn, it is making a difference to you.

Yes, it has all the Kojima trappings, and yes he is way too far up his own ass - Hell, there is a 1 hour cut-scene about why a guy has a heart shaped heart - But you will eat it all up. Much like literature and cinema epics, a significant number of story beats happen well after the major conflict is resolved (hilariously, most of them after the end credits roll), but by then you will be so involved in the world's story and your band of Kojima freaks, that you probably wont mind the chaotic editing of this game.  

After 4 years of avoidance, I can now say that this is one of my favourite games, and might even be considered an all-time classic. Hell, it might even be something that is important.

But, once the controls are finally given the player this game is a good time.

It is fairly unconventional in both story and game play. 

The story is not directly about fighting a form of tyranny or tracking down a villain, but reconnecting America and bringing divided communities back together. This in combination with the trauma's of the players character that are revealed over time sets up for a story that is both inspiring, and wholesome.

The game play will have you delivering packages from point A to point B, which on it's face sounds very mundane. But, in practice is an engaging experience that you can't quite find anywhere else to the best of my knowledge. The terrain is a constant obstacle and a force to be reckoned with at nearly every moment. It engages a primal part of your brain, like a cave man wandering his domain looking for the best path forward. That is until you connect your point B to your point A via the Chiral Network, a abstract version of a WAN that is operated using other worldly forces. Once the network is back online for the individual area, you can then start to see the traces of other players on their own journey's through America. This leads to a pseudo co operative experience that is somewhat similar to the Dark Souls series. Leaving warning signs, or words of encouragement via messages left on the ground. Building bridges over rivers, leaving ladders climbing up mountains, or setting up climbing ropes to scale down them. These are a few things that you can do that will not only have an effect in your world, but other players worlds as well. Thanks to these mechanics it makes this otherwise lonely world feel a lot less lonely. 

This game ushers out of you the want and desire to connect to other people, so not only are you experiencing these thoughts and concepts when consuming the story, you are also feeding off of those same emotions when delivering your packages.

After playing through the Metal Gear Solid series, I was excited for this game as Hideo Kojima's first solo outing after the split with Konami. Unique doesn't come close to the originality this game puts forth. The game has slow parts but so do all games with 50+ hour campaigns. The game really picks up once you are able to start crafting gear and items as it gives you the ability to go and explore or just make the world around you easier to traverse. The shared world system was very cool in this game. Other players can craft things like bridges, ladders, and ropes or they can leave things like vehicles and weapons behind for others to utilize. Really awesome feature and it makes the game much more enjoyable. Coming up to a cliff you didn't realize was there, but then looking over to see someone made a way to get down or put signs to guide you to a better path is just one example of how useful this can be.

The story of this game is mesmerizing. With such a unique story I couldn't help but keep playing to find out more about it. If you are at all a fan of Metal Gear Solid or stealth action games, I would highly recommend giving this game a fair chance.",1680561803,1701293176,True,0,0,0.495076984167098999,0,True,False,False

[b]Summary[/b]
There is not a simple way to classified Death Stranding.
Without going into the lore, you have to deliver things from point A to B. Sometimes you have to retrieve the items from a dangerous place, sometimes the danger is physical, sometimes it is not.
The places that the music triggers is really awesome and gives you a good feeling that it's very rare on nowadays gaming industry.

It took me around 200hours to get all achievements while having fun doing it. I do recommend the game and also I agree that it's love or hate game, but anyway, I recommend at least playing through the second area of the game because a LOT changes after you get a ton of equipment to traverse land.


[b]Goods[/b]
[list]
	[*]After you end the game, you will automatically reload a couple of hours before the ""ending events"", so you can finish all your achievements (trophies) in one playthrough.
	[*]When you reload after the ending events, you get some extra options, so I recommend leaving to get all achievements after the ending events. After episode [spoiler]15[/spoiler]:D
	[*]Epic boss battles.
	[*]Option to replay Boss battles and compete with other players for a best score on them.
	[*]Dynamic Weather system, where you can check for ""rainfall"" prediction in a place and avoid it if you need.
	[*]Game physics are great.
[/list]


[b]Bads[/b]
[list]
	[*]Changing difficult doesn't make the game too much challenging when you get used to handling your enemies. Boss fights on the other hand will be a lot harder. So eventually, even on Very Hard, the game feels too easy.
	[*]I like the Day/Night cycle in games and I miss it on Death Stranding

*Spoiler warning ahead*

The story suffers from serious logorrhoea. It makes up its own glossary of words. Beaches, strands, chirlliam (or however it's spelt), Amelie, BBs, ha and ka, and blah blah ad infinitum. It relies on its mailing system to bring context to the events in the world, which visually looked like someone just copied and pasted from Notepad. Characters are thin in their motivation and reasoning, their dialogue insufferably long to explain any concept, and the world's lore feels incongruous to the player as everything is said and repeated without feeling organic. It feels like it heavily relies on its poetic license for why things are the way they are. It assumes the audience is following its longwinded multiple cutscenes and wants what the characters want: a connection. I assumed it was telling me everything I needed to know, but what it was were two confused participants who have no idea what Death Stranding is all about. I felt nothing for any of the characters. I didn't care for any of them or their well-being, including the baby in its orange Fanta jar, and I feel like I'm quite an empathetic person. After all, I've just pumped over 40 hours into this game so that I could be moved. For instance, there's a lot of drama around Die Hardman with why he wears a mask and his adoration for Bridget, but it's weak in its explanation. Yes, he loved her, but where was the seed of emotion for when she died at the beginning? I still don't believe his reasoning for why that's his motivation for wearing a mask. The man isn't even disfigured; which would have been the basic explanation had he felt self-conscious. I felt like I was inside Hideo Kojima's teenage diary, playing with their adolescent imagination and meagre reasoning as if they've just broken up with someone and pouring their emotion out onto a flurry of arbitrary plot points. I grew tired just as Sam Porter as we walked together throughout the entire foothills of this game where I felt he and I were both so exhausted by the meaninglessness of this entire world whereby I was rooting for the Extinction Entity to do us all a favour and wipe everything out. 
What was disappointing was the time it took to tell a story. Hideo Kojima's goes beyond his known charm for making his games like films as the very end cutscene was a literal 90 minute film. I kept an eye on my wristwatch throughout the laborious, mind numbing exposition movie because I kept faith that it was going to end, but it didn't. I don't think this game is a masterpiece in the slightest. I feel that critics aren't realising here that great art requires great sacrifice and discipline. What was evident was that Hideo Kojima threw everything at this including the kitchen sink, hoping it would float. It's a mess. He even goes out his way to incorporate anything into the plot so that it would (hopefully) make sense and bring substance to the story. It didn't. Such as, at the end Amelie reveals that Ame is French for ""soul"" and that reveals that her soul is a lie. First off, when did French themes come into this narrative when it was supposed to be set in the USA and incorporate that country's DNA, and secondly how does that reveal affect the entirety of the experience? The simple answer is that it doesn't. It's unschooled. Uncollected. It uses ""ha"" and ""ka"" to describe the body and soul when it could just have made it less confusing and say ""body"" and ""soul"". It's a blur of sci-fi things that don't know why they exist in its oily soup of ideas. To its merit, Death Stranding's only saving grace is that it is true to its meaninglessness. In the end after the credits roll you are left to wander the world in hope of finding genuine connection, though in reality you're just left alone to wander without being harangued for the explanation in it all. So there's some peace in that.",1701181654,1701181654,False,43,9,0.576400279998779297,0,True,False,False

The emptiness of the world juxtaposed with the connections you make along the way is beautiful. The world is beautiful. The gameplay loop confused me at first and quite honestly, overwhelmed me. But I gave it another shot and I am so glad I did. The story really gripped me and shook me. I finished it a couple years ago and I still think about it to this day, and I'm actually going on my 2nd playthrough right now. I am really taking my time this time around (first playthrough was 65+hrs).

It's a tight story, lots of questions at the beginning, but many answers at the end make this a very satisfying game to complete (though you might still have questions at the end, since this is a very dense game).

My favorite parts of the game are the game loop, getting orders, setting up my cargo (optimization), and picking the best route in order to deliver everything safely and on time. It's not for everyone, sure, but I do encourage you to give it a try. It is a slow game, this is the kind of game where you do sit to contemplate the view and the environments, the whole atmosphere really. The soundtrack supports this so well.

The music in this game is phenomenal. It is how I discovered Low Roar. Amazing music (RIP Ryan).

The gameplay, the vibes, the story, everything. If that sounds terrible to you then don't get it. If you are intrigued then give it a shot after reading other reviews that have more details.

Although this game supposedly checks all the boxes, I'm sad to say that I just didn't get a feel for this one. I [i]should[/i] have liked what this game had to offer [i]in theory[/i], but it just didn't come together.

I'm completely lost on what the core gameplay loop should be. As far as I can tell, it's delivering packages back and forth, between a handful of locations over and over again, at long distances. Supposedly you can acquire vehicles and build infrastructure for tons of resources, to be able to do the same, only a bit faster. It's never really explained how you do this. There is a multiplayer element as well, although the mechanics for that too are never explained either. The actions of other players affect your game world, and this is supposed to make your life easier, but it just ends up being confusing. You turn around and new roads that end nowhere criss-cross the landscape, random grapples litter cliffs, etc.

I was told that the game starts ""getting good"" after about 30 hours, but: 1) I don't want to keep at it for twice as long as I have just to test whether that's true; 2) I doubt the core, trudging gameplay will change enough to change my opinion.",1701036613,1701036613,False,2,1,0.474924474954605103,0,True,False,False

In the end I was pleasantly surprised, it is now one of my favorite games of all time. I've played it twice now and can see myself returning to it in the future as well.

I think this game suffered a lot with the Hideo Kojima hype and his Metal Gear games legacy and I people, with very little info, began to expect it to be the next metal gear, and unrealistic content from this game. 

If you don't like Hideo Kojima's storytelling you will probably dislike the game since there is a lot of it, but otherwise you should give it a chance. If you are unfamiliar of his way of telling a story, I could see finding the early game a little bit disappointing, I believe this game is made to be a slow burn purposefully since it fits the whole theme of the game.

I find the game fascinating the story is told in several different and interesting ways, no just through cutscenes, the graphics are amazing the gameplay is very creative and makes you feel your progress in a very significant way. For me the game is boring in the same way someone could find Minecraft boring since it doesn't have much action thrown in your face all the time, but the atmosphere makes it work for me.

I would recommend anyone to give this game a try, but I can also see how it is not for everybody will like it. I think you appreciate this game the most after you get to near to the end.

Another great aspect of this game is solution of multiplayer. You won't meet other players but you are super aware of their presence. You can complete their orders or use their buildings etc... This multiplayer will not kill fun because of other players but making the world living, changing thing.

Sadly, it is not a movie but a game. A game filled to the brim with tedious mechanics and a painfully slow pacing.

After buying the game upon its initial release on PS4 and never finishing it back then, i thought i give it a second chance with the director's cut. I had high hopes that after four years the game would be finally be a polished experience, but i was vastly disappointed. Especially driving vehicles is still the worst i have ever seen in a game.

Also, a lot of times the game makes little to no sense at all, e.g. [i]""Sam, you are the only hope for 'Merica and thus all mankind, because the world would simply stop existing without Uncle Sam. But don't worry, we will help you in any way we can! What is it Sam? ...oh that vehicles parked over there would be helpful on your mission? Well you see ... we actually need those to drive our lazy arses around this facility... but here: have some ropes and ladders... well you actually need to bring us materials in exchange, we don't run a charity here, you know. But rest assured, you are our only hope and we totally got your back.""[/i]

The game also makes a lot of mistakes in its storytelling by bombarding you with informations that you can't possibly understand because the words have not been propperly explained to you beforehand. Instead, all characters just throw gibberish-words at you like you are supposed to know what they are talking about.

Playing this game makes me wonder if it wouldn't have been for the better if Kojima-san would have just retired after Metal Gear Solid 4.",1700867732,1700867732,False,4,0,0.47163119912147522,2,True,False,False

The first chapter or so is high tension simply because you don't understand the dynamics of the game.  Once you get used to them, it's far more ""relaxing"" a game to play.  

I had the most fun prior to the final expansion west....the map is effectively cut into 3 sections, but only the first and second are really part of the core game.  The 3rd section is simply a runaway slide to the conclusion of the game.  

I found the full story mediocre, particularly the conclusion.  They aren't kidding....the finale is like 4 hours long.  It isn't bad of course, but I feel like the way they tied it up was predictable.

On the Beach was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all hikin’  up some mountains outside of the school
When a couple of ghosts who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little voidout and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' west with your Q-PID or we’ll all be dead!""

I begged and pleaded with her day after day

The only reason you wouldn't like it is because you hate walking simulators, which is understandable. Some people don't, but hear me out for a moment: A story that, while confusing at times, is still a wonderful experience, and this is coming from someone who will skip every cutscene in any game. Now for the gameplay, this game is aptly named FedEx simulator by the community. I can tell you why you are just delivering packages to each place until something happens, but you're still delivering packages. Still, the best part is in providing the parcels. The fact that you have to Teeter yourself left to right to make sure that your containers don't fall off your back makes the game a little bit more engaging than just walking from point A to point B for the music or the ambiance that will constantly put a stone in your stomach when you get into a BT-filled area or the low hum of whatever song is playing while you're just walking around enjoying what you're seeing the just walking around got me lost for about enjoying a sunset or watching waves crash on the beach had me mesmerized with how beautiful this game can look. The options of so many different items that you can use at your disposal to get you from point A to B to C is a blast to enjoy. I believe I sunk about maybe 3 hours in just creating a zipline highway to get to four different locations so that I could keep getting rewards from them, and quite honestly, I didn't regret any moment that I had in there; just optimizing the paths so I can truly feel like I was going above and beyond for a customer LOL.

Things I really like about this game:
- Guillermo del Toro and Hideo Kojima teaming up to make a very beautifully directed story. (Still want Silent Hill)
- Grindy aspects of traversal and rewards for making them in the first place.
- Stunning scenery
- The attention to detail when it comes to the game-play.. You essentially deliver packages but the game is so much more than that with equipment management, weight loading management, item utilization, traversal planning, enemy disposal, and world building (in a literal and figurative sense).
- Everything in my last point can be upgraded in some capacity such as extra weight capacity for easier management, weight dispersal with better up-gradable equipment (won't spoil that), better items, better traversal, and again better ways to travel later in the story.
Nitpicks that I have with the game:
- Can't destroy mule camps with a void out. 
- Void outs can't be traversed which is very sad cause they look like such cool terrain to navigate through.
- There is a limit to how many structures you can have in a world which I get buuuut let me build as much as I want for the best traversal! :(

If someone ask me to describe game mechanics then probably i have to say  it's amazon delivery game , there is no way you can describe this game to someone . So you have to experience it on your own . 

This game is all about connecting people and rebuild the broken relationships but it's also a social experiment about connecting players and rebuild the broken game world . The opening hours is so cruel and punishing that you are almost going too quit this game , and at this exact time the multipliers kicks in and the you can realise the value of people and their presence . 

This game teaches you the weight you carry is not yours alone , everyone is walking the same difficult paths.
This game doesn't want you to suffer , this game wants you to reduce the suffering of others .
One you stop playing this game just like other game for your own enjoyment and starts to play for benefit of everyone , it became the most fulfilling experience you have ever had .

As a video game it's not for everyone, i agree ; but the potential it has is absolutely mind blowing

I have liked Kojima games since MGS and this one is no different.
I have 100% on PS4 and PC.
I sometimes just walk around looking for good pic spots.
I really enjoyed playing this game.

Side note: Kojima finally released a game before the events depicted in the game.
For those not in the know Kojima on several occasions has had to change aspects of his game because they mirrored events that were happening in the world. And not that he did it on purpose but that he had a script laid out and then parts of that script happened in the world. Prime example is MGS2 was suppose to have more damage done to NYC during the ending but then 9/11 happened and they knew any deceptions of building being destroyed in a militarily attack would not be good.
Then he released Death Stranding right before a global pandemic that killed people silently and everyone had to stay inside and relay on delivery people....I am not saying Kojima is a prophet or anything like that. Just that he obviously see's the world in a different way then most people and DS2 is on the way. lol",1700544540,1700544540,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But here are some problems I have with it...

anyone else felt a bit disappointing with Death Stranding story when it could have been much more amazing?

These are some points I'd like to point out when I saw them setup at the early point of the game and never went anywhere.

1. The Introduction of Chiral Network - Die Hardman said 'it will bring back 10 thousand years of human history, bring dinosaurs back to life, connect us to the past' First I heard this, I imagined when we connected more regions, we could go back to the past, pull objects from past events back to life but in the game it's just a 0 PING Internet connection and learning a bit about the first Death Stranding.

2. No Face-to-Face Conversation, only Hologram - With this mechanics, the game wants you to feel lonely, a long journey alone. But we still contacted with many people and there are also Mules everywhere, I thought they're going to surprise us with something like Nier: Automata *SPOILER* that every humans are already dead or maybe something like talking to someone in the past or future but this just felt like an excuse for cutting developing time

3. The Introduction of H๐m๐ Demens - Die Hardman said 'They are a criminal organization with no clear leader, they will do everyhting including engineer a Voidout. They wiped out Bridges 1 and capture Emily' I mean except from the cutscenes they are basically Mules with rifles. They built up this group like they could manipulated BTs or have access to Beaches. I felt so scared when I thought about how could my throwing bag skill win against the H๐m๐ Demens but when I found them I wasn't even sure if they were Mules or them

There are some more like the time they built up how could we cross the sea to Edge-Knot City or traveling by sea across the Ground Zero.

I love Death Stranding and its complicated story but I wish if Kojima didn't care how complicated the story would be, he could go all out and twisted the story into a lot of abstract, mind blowing outcomes.

I finished the story long ago but I felt something in my heart that wasn't whole so I thought back until I found these subjects. What are your thought on the topic, do I miss something?",1700475583,1700475748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Have I mentioned that I love the type of story-telling that Hideo Kojima has to offer? Even though this title was subject to some mixed responses upon release, I just had to try it for myself. Let us answer the most burning question of all. Do you deliver stuff from point A to point B? The answer is Yes. This is what you do but it is slightly more than that actually. It is about connecting people and finding ways around challenging landscapes. 

Coupled with the type of over the top story-telling that Kojima is known for, it is probably one of the best games I have ever played and I still return to it yearly. 

The simple gameplay loop is fun and engaging. The characters are so good. Them nasty BT's are a force to deal with. The Road can be a lie :-). The Director's cut edition id probably the one you want more than the normal edition and worth it now on a sale. 

It is not for everyone, but it certainly is for me. I highly recommend it to others

If you are like me and you went into Death Stranding wanting a meditative experience with moments of artistic storytelling, Death Stranding is for you.

If you expect a ""proper game,"" you are going to have a bad time, especially in the first few chapters of the game.

Put in an analogy: Consider taking a week to watch a TV show one episode at a time. But between each episode you go on a hike to ponder. Not necessarily ponder the show itself (but that included). Just time to think and reflect with something to keep your active mind occupied.

That's Death Stranding. And if that sounds horrible and boring, this game is not for you. But for myself and others who give it a positive review, it is a delightful respite.

EDIT: I want to express one genuinely deep criticism I have of the game. Destination NPCs have SO FEW lines of dialogue for a successful delivery. Hearing them say the exact same line of dialogue for an S-tier delivery, every time, makes it ring hollow, sarcastic.

I think this game deserves a place in every PC Gamers Library, especially this tidy Directors Cut. Treat yourself this game when you face a weeklong downtime, sit down and just discover this unique mixture of a game.
If ou do not like combat, like myself, rush the first landscape area of the game and only do the minimum amount of work (you can return later) -> and reach Chapter 3 - the game will open up to you and you'll have a HUGE MAP to freely explore. Nobody stops you from reaching the craziest spots early =) Nobody stops you from being kind to players and leave vehicles around. =)
It's a massive game that keeps on giving - there is nothing like this on the market to my knowledge. Grab it whenever you can, play @DLSS Quality (or comparable) and just enjoy this metalgear-infused movie/game/openworld/adventure experience. You deserve an adventure unlike most, dear reader - and Hideo Kojimas' Death Stranding in this ""Director's Cut"" provides exactly this. 

Oh and btw - you absolutely CAN singleplayer this without any online content, you absolutely can fight every MULE (human enemy type) and BT you meet - the game will bend to your playstyle, in a way.

It's an oddly therapeutic game, at least that's how I felt. I could go on and on about the plethora of weird design decisions, flaws, or jank this game has but at its core, I think DS is still a good, unique experience. I can't really say if you will enjoy it because I think every person is going to take to this one differently. Some will love it, some will hate it. I think that the gameplay and controls are, at times, remarkably stupid, but in a weird way, part of the game is trying to work around the controls with different tools like rope, ladders, or vehicles. I definitely enjoyed the game the most when I had the least amount of options and had to be creative with the little tools i did have. Early on, the decision to carry a ladder or a rope is incredibly important, as you do not have the liberty of tacking on as much gear as possible. Do you add that extra ladder or take another order? Look at the map, do you cut through the mountain where you need more gear or take the low road and sneak past MULEs? Small decisions like these that make you plan out a route to get to one place to the next were so cool to me and I really loved working out the best way to link the country up. Once you get roads and vehicles and a bunch of upgrades to make traversal easier, the game is less enjoyable to me. It's really just way too easy to hop in a truck and make the rounds on a road in the late game. The combat is hit or miss, and it feels like it should've been more like metal gear solid 5 and less like the traversal of DS. because it feels like the combat has the same problems as traversal. The story is also so fucking insane, and a lot of the best parts of the story, like the small interactions between the very diverse cast, disappear later in the game in favor of a lot of shit that doesn't make any sense on purpose. So overall, while I still liked the game, I would only recommend this game if you're fine with having to work around the quirks of the game as a feature and not a bug.",1699300816,1699300816,True,1,0,0.522293031215667725,0,True,False,False

Got a new computer in 2021 of November, the specs are the latest to boot, with all the bless and whistles.

I have since Platinum Death Stranding Directors cut version and now I have come back to do it again just on the normal version since there are certain things added to the game that the normal version does not have hopefully I have not gotten used to the certain features it has added to the Directors cut version.
Platinum Game on 4th May 2022

To rate the game as I have now completed it and also watched the announcement of  [spoiler]Death stranding 2 [/spoiler] I can say I am forever more excited to see more of Hideo Kojima work and the story of Death stranding continue and my excitement for the game I called just a boring ""Walking Sim"" into a delightful and imaginative concept that I am forever asking for more.

[h3] OKAY OKAY OKAY!!![/h3]
Another play-through another emotional Roller Coaster of loving and hating the game and going back and fourth between reasons for even playing it again. 
Yes I have Platinumed the game AGAIN and this time I decided to stream it to whoever and it was really fun. 
I did not miss the grinding at all but I think its because I felt that playing on the [b] non[/b] [i] Director cut [/i]
version of the game that I missed how I made certain routs with the new [i] ""Techs"" [/i] and the ""RING"" of other players equipment and such, but enough of me complaining... 

This game still hits hard to this day and I am [b] realllllllllly[/b] excited for [spoiler] Death Stranding 2 [/spoiler]
and I hope that I can even do more cool deliveries and explore the world of Kojima and play as [b] Norman reedus [/b] and potentially other actors & Characters.

The main thing is the story just continually gets more and more captivating and deep the longer you play the game, and yes there is a lot of walking and delivering cargo from place to place you would think it gets boring but not really, the part that was annoying is once you make it to the mountains and having to walk through the snow its a bit annoying, zip lines are your friend.
I definitely have never played a game quite like this one before.
I also love all the little quirky things the developers added into this game along the way huge attention to detail.

The gameplay is a little challenging to get used to at first, it presents you with packages to carry from point A to B, occasionally it rains and the timefall from the rain damages your package, or you might be expected to traverse mountainous areas to your destination. You also have to deal with BTs (basically the ghosts of the dead) by sneaking around them or else fight your way through them if you have the equipment to do so.

This was my first foray into a Hideo Kojima production and the easiest way I can put it is if someone watched a few too many American movies and tried to replicate the cliches and feelings associated with watching them. The story of Death Stranding involves, in addition to being a courier, is that your player character Sam is tasked with the duty of reconnecting civilization across a post-apocalyptic United States wherever he delivers packages. There's a whole lot of ""America this"" and ""America that"" which seems so cliche, but the game eases up on that once you're past the first chapter or so.

Once the game really picks up, the story goes into the mystery surrounding the Death Stranding - the apocalyptic event that ended the world and forced people into hiding in bunkers. The story of how the Death Stranding happened and the surrounding lore is so fascinating and really gets you scratching your chin in awe (and confusion).

I would also like to give praise to the art direction, environmental design and soundtrack for all being absolute masterpieces that makes the game feel like a gorgeous moving painting.

With its thoughtfully crafted world, complex narrative, and exceptional attention to detail, Death Stranding offers an experience unlike any other in the gaming world.

One of the most striking aspects of Death Stranding is its visually stunning and meticulously realized game world. The landscapes are both breathtaking and treacherous, perfectly capturing the post-apocalyptic beauty of a fractured America. The game's Decima engine brings the environment to life with unparalleled fidelity, immersing players in its haunting, desolate beauty.

The narrative of Death Stranding is a dense, intricate tapestry that unfolds gradually, rewarding players with each revelation. At its core, the game explores themes of isolation, connection, and the human spirit's resilience. Kojima's storytelling prowess shines through, weaving a complex web of characters, organizations, and enigmatic phenomena that keeps you guessing and eager to delve deeper.

The gameplay mechanics of Death Stranding are both innovative and deeply engaging. You play as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier tasked with reconnecting isolated communities across the United Cities of America. The act of traversal, balance, and carrying cargo on your back becomes a metaphorical and literal journey that resonates with the game's themes. The sense of isolation and vulnerability is palpable, making every step you take feel significant and intense.

Death Stranding is not just a solitary experience, however. The game's asynchronous multiplayer elements, such as shared structures and messages from other players, reinforce the idea of connection and interdependence, even in a desolate world. This design choice adds a layer of depth and unpredictability to the gameplay, fostering a sense of community and cooperation.

The cast of characters in Death Stranding is a star-studded ensemble, with exceptional performances from the likes of Norman Reedus, Mads Mikkelsen, and others. These performances, combined with Kojima's masterful direction, make the characters feel genuine and relatable, adding emotional weight to the story's twists and turns.

Death Stranding is not a game for everyone, as its pacing and complex narrative may challenge some players. However, for those willing to invest the time and effort, it's a journey that rewards with deep introspection, breathtaking landscapes, and a truly unique gaming experience. It's a testament to Hideo Kojima's visionary creativity and a reminder of how video games can be a powerful medium for storytelling and art. Death Stranding is a triumph of innovation and an essential addition to any gamer's library.",1698856109,1698856109,True,27,1,0.697473108768463135,0,True,False,False

I was generally satisfied and even impressed, although I can't claim to have completely understood the entire plot and all of its intricacies.

For the first couple of hours, I was highly fascinated by what was happening. Then I began to realize why the game was dubbed a courier simulator. After about 10 hours, I found myself delivering cargo like a maniac, mindlessly trying to progress. The ingenious gameplay of cargo delivery was structured in a way that kept feeding you new gadgets and features until you reached the mountainous regions, where the real challenge began. Perhaps I should have taken a break there, as I was quite exhausted from the game after reaching the 50-hour mark. Nonetheless, I continued building ropes, transporting cargo, and constructing roads. Sadly, my patience eventually wore thin. Maybe if I had played it from the start, there would have been more online structures to interact with, but I can't say that I suffered much.

I knew one of the game's features was the ability to encounter other players' contributions in your session, and oh my, how many times ladders and bridges from other players saved me. The idea of connection with all players and using shared structures and ideas is brilliant. It's a bit like communism – why not?

The game is accompanied by magnificent music and sounds throughout your journey. I even added the game's soundtrack to my playlist upon completing it. The game features splendid cinematic moments and acting.

However, there were some minor drawbacks. Sections where you had to collect cargo on hostile creatures' territory could get overly tedious. They weren't particularly challenging, but having to shoot them repeatedly just to pass or complete a delivery was incredibly boring. I also encountered some control issues where the character continued to move forward even though I was pulling the gamepad trigger backward. As a result, I tumbled down a mountain quite ineptly and had to reload. Additionally, I wish I could listen to emails and diaries while walking. I believe this combination would have allowed me to enjoy the gameplay to the fullest. Nevertheless, I managed to alleviate the routine with the following...

I highly recommend playing the game if you have a second monitor. While I was balancing cargo, I watched numerous interesting videos in the background. Here's a list: Director's Interpretation of Blade Runner, History of the Orthodox Church, Full History of Making Silent Hill 2, Alan Wake, The Thing, Return to Castle Wolfenstein, BloodRayne, Quake 4, Amnesia: The Bunker, Cities: Skylines 2, Total Overdose, Assassin's Creed Mirage, Resistance: Fall of Man, Heavenly Sword, COD MW3, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, The Getaway, Postal 2, Spider-Man 2, Scarface, Death Stranding, Wheelman, The Godfather, Prey 2006, Night Watch, The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, Vivisector.

Although I was tired by the end and had to watch the credits three times, I was very satisfied with this game. It truly provides a new experience, and it's no wonder they call Hideo Kojima a genius game designer.

Not for everyone and I certainly would understand why someone would dislike this because I use to be that guy when it first released on PS4. This is a one-of-a-kind experience, not a gamer's game for sure. You are basically picking up and dropping off packages for a country with crappy WiFi, yes, that is the gameplay loop. It is admittedly not fun, AT FIRST. You got to put in that work and feel immersed, those cinematic almost movie-like cutscenes are your palette cleansers. The more deliveries you make, the more connections you have. The more connections you have, the more things you can create. The more things you create will then help not just you, but other real players out there discovering these locations you previously trekked through. Human connection is what this is all about and often you forget you are playing multiplayer games with other real humans behind the screens, so DS takes that concept and  made it about connecting strangers together with likes and sharing things, it is such a cool take on a formula that has been done time and time again.    The story alone is good, not the best, but damn good. The characters all feel some sense of disconnect with each other and it's up to this strange and lonely guy, Sam Bridges, to bring people together. It works well with the gameplay loop and benefits everyone. The boss battles are sadly the most boring and annoying thing in the game, which is a disappointment considering how awesome the characters are in the cutscenes. The fights are standard third person shooter stuff, throw your grenades, run, and sometimes you even get use actual guns against enemies later in the game. It's not hard, it's just too easy and predictable, considering Kojima and team made the legendary MGS franchise that had the best boss fights I have ever seen in any video game.  Even with that being said, DS is nearly a masterpiece. I enjoyed that loop, the music, the people I connected with in the game and my portable baby!

It is the brainchild of Hideo Kojima, and indeed, it will make that abundantly clear. It is a silly game, with a strange plot (though not as confusing as popular opinion suggests), quirks that some might dismiss as QoL failures, and a gameplay loop that - by all metrics - should be mind-numbingly boring.

And yet, it is not.

Death Stranding is [b]not[/b] the ""walking simulator"" that it is so often derisively referred to as (make no mistake, though, there is plenty of walking), but rather an experience of many inextricable parts. If this sounds pretentious, well.....it kind of is, but to great effect. 
Death Stranding is not just about the walking. It's about the planning: what all should I bring? How many orders will I bring at once? Am I headed this way anyways? Is there going to be timefall? Should I bring a vehicle? Should I bring a PCC to build some structures to make the next trip easier (and not just for myself, but for other porters)?
Each of these questions takes one, maybe two seconds to answer, and you could feasibly finish the game even on the hardest difficulty with very little planning. And yet, I still find myself smiling whenever I encounter a situation I had prepared for. Logging in and seeing that other porters got some use out of my structures feels good. Giving another porter likes for doing the same in turn feels good. Taking note of a road or bridge in progress and doing my part to contribute feels good. Picking up entrusted cargo and delivering it for its original porter feels good.
You don't [i]have[/i] to do most of this, and I suspect a large portion of Death Stranding's mechanics will not be fun to many players. If you aren't interested in slowing down and enjoying the climb, maybe look elsewhere.

Game is good, but not fun.
Meal is good, but not tasty.
For the latter, we sometimes call it ""medicine"".
But what about the former? I'm sorry I can't imagine a word to ""glorify"" it.
So,
Good job, but don't do it again.

I know, I know, we can gain happiness through linking people together. Sounds good. But wtf just by delivering goods over and over and over again??? I've suffered it for 4 hours on this tedious loop and you tell me there's 40 hours more? Oh no I'm playing a video game, not a COURIER SIMULATOR...
As an undergraduate major in Software Engineering, I bought this game just for two reasons: I want to see how Real-Time Graphics develops recently, and, I've listened to the music, ""Ghost - A. Walker / Au/Ra"", that sounds good... Now, uh, this game is sure very well in Graphics, but... just well in Graphics... That's all... Nothing more... 
Because I may become a game developer in the future, so I always try to push myself to accept different kinds of games. Though gameplay and style varies, I always try my best to discover every game's value and accept it. But I'm so sorry, I beg your pardon I can't accept this one... Sorry...
If I can turn back time to two days ago, I'd rather use 15 dollars to buy a ""Mathematical Analysis"" and a cup of coffee, then reading book there, NOT buy this game.

Update: That's just my personal opinion. There's still lots of people find this game amazing, leaving very positive comments here. But just ignore my negative comment above, there's one thing, for sure, Death Stranding doesn't seem like a traditional game. If you never play some similar games before, spending tens of dollars on this game is without doubt ""risky"" and may let you down.

好好好，我知道这个游戏能通过把人们联系在一起获得快乐，听起来真不错。但是tmd你告诉我，把人们连接到一块需要我一趟一趟地送快递？？？我已经跑来跑去送了四个小时的快递了，单调乏味，然而你告诉我这个游戏后面的四十个小时还都是送快递？天哪我是在玩游戏啊，而不是快递员模拟器啊……
作为一个软件工程专业的本科生，我买这个游戏只是出于两个目的：我想看看实时计算机图形学现在发展的怎么样了，以及，我觉得A. Walker和Au/Ra的Ghost听起来不错……好吧，这个游戏的图形质量还真不错，但是，也仅仅是图形质量不错……仅此而已，没了……
考虑到我将来可能会成为一名开发者，我需要去主动尝试各式各样的游戏。尽管玩法和风格各异，但是我会尽力去体会每个游戏独特的价值，然后接受它……但是抱歉，原谅我，我真的接受不了这个游戏……不好意思……
如果时间能倒回到两天前，我宁愿花99块钱买一本《数学分析》和一杯咖啡，然后坐在咖啡店里看书，而不是买这个游戏……

这只是我个人的观点。仍然有相当多人认为这款游戏很惊艳，给了这款游戏相当积极的评价。但是忽略掉我上面的差评，有一件事情是可以肯定的，死亡搁浅和常见的游戏不是一个“套路”。如果你之前没玩过类似的游戏，直接花99块钱冲死亡搁浅无疑是“很冒险的”，并且有可能让你失望",1698546016,1698549361,False,7,1,0.475965946912765503,5,True,False,False
1850570,145465511,76561198043157779,0,28,47,5,36,1708767316,"I played original version normal difficulty. 150+ hours in, basically solo, took my time to build most zip-line routes and 5-stared most shelter except probably 2 and I just can't say confidently that I would recommend this game to my friends.

This is not a walking simulator. It had a grand beginning but disappointing end.

This game does not respect a player's time investment by the fact. I had experience 4 times that my hard-earned items and weapons disappeared after a cut-scene teleportationm e.g. those supercell fight. A whole truckload of weapons, custom items that earned by each delivery, just GONE. It just feel so so bad and I was only playing on normal, imagine playing on very hard difficulty where everything is effort.

The game does not respect your planning on end-game boss fight and endgame story fights are unrewarding as. Your planning is meaningless to the endgame. Structures on the whole regional map, built after tens of hours of gameplay would be completely erased from what is explained as 'heavy timefall', while a long dead NPC's rusted ladders are immortal. Your weapons and tools loaded on the truck or even those carried on your back would get dropped on the ground and blocked by a transparent wall. All the rocket launcher, level 2 grenades and HG custom guns mean jackshit because you cannot use any of them. Instead, you are locked to use weapons that are generated in the boss arena, i.e. assault rifle lvl.2 and cryptobiotes. Even worse, my scanner did not pick up any chiral crystal after the boss dead. My fight ends in no reward at all.

It is unfortunate that early game is actually pretty good. I enjoyed it even when walking takes up most of the part. Rough journey but get to feel the trip. Plan the trip and use ladder and anchor to navigate and finish the trip. It felt good. Getting preppers to the network and reading their email feels connected and learn the NPCs' story and more about the world setting.

Mid game feels like drunk driving simulator and boring hanging simulator. Drive a lot and used zip-line a lot. With shit collision physics, bike steering mechanics. camera-oriented direction control, shit collision physics again, lots of stones and rocks on ground to collide with, sudden strong wind mechanism, low traction physics and weird vehicle mechanics, driving experience is honestly not impressive at best and outright intolerable and unplayable at worst. Vehicles can go to the opposite direction you input, keep hitting a rock in front of the vehicle repeatedly, and slide all the way down hill with hand brake applied. I have completely given up on vehicles in favor of zip-lines on mountain region because vehicles are simply unusable in that region which is a shame as that region is one of the major region. Zip-line gets the job done but is tedious to setup and boring as fuck to ride on. No sense of achievement for each delivery and soon this major gameplay element becomes a chore. Not fun at all. They are done only to grind for weapons or a chance that there might be something cool, but disappointing most of the time. Multiple weapon systems are unlocked after the major Higg's fight, but there is no point for them anymore at that point.

The game feels like ended midway after Higg's fight. The story at the early game is good. It was mysterious, intriguing and immersive full of descriptive cut-scene. Higg's fight is the climax and it feels like the final boss fight. Endgame story telling after Higgs' fight has a rather significant quality drop. The supposedly climax of explaining death stranding ended up in a long, dull monologue by Amelie. This part is so so so boring that even Sam tried to kill himself. While most characters, even those side NPCs like preppers had emails and holograms for side depiction. All we have for Amelie is her monologue. She is at the same time THE most important and THE least described major character, which is very unfortunate.  Her cut-scenes simply are not enough to connect her feelings with me, the player. There is no depth in this character and I fail to feel any emotion or story development from her. The whole death stranding and human extinction story becomes a joke, a chore or whatever insignificant news and I lost interest completely mid way. 

Frequent abrupt interruption by voice-call from NPC during gameplay is also quite distracting and annoying. It is like the game should have ended, but it is too short so we force some content at the end. Everything feels so deliberate and distracted.

Artwork and the landscape is astonishing and occasionally breathtaking though. Have to give that credit.

All in all, the gameplay and story is needlessly slow and long. There is actually not much content if all the repetitive side quest are not counted. As delivery became a chore after 7 or so chapters, there is not much replay value either. So, I for sure would not recommend it for full price for both original and director's cut.

Let me start off by saying i'm a HUGE fan of long games. I 100%'d The Longing, and enjoyed every second of it, so you could say i'm a bit of a connoisseur of long type games.
       
          However, when I first opened Death Stranding, i could already tell this was going to be a different experience. I immediately immersed myself in the world, the atmosphere was unlike any other. The story was enriched, and as a proud red blooded american it really made me consider issues differently.

          THE GAMEPLAY was immaculate, the fact that the more cargo you carry the slower you move, really adds some realism to the game which i quite enjoy. The car mechanics really spiced up the gameplay, it felt like i was playing a whole new game, they really know how to switch it up when almost gets too boring. The ice physics made it feel like i was really treading on snow.  Every venture across (sadly) broken american terrain always had something new to discover, and there was never a dull moment. The ending of the game had me in tears, I won't spoil anything but it was one of the most memorable gaming experiences i've had in a long time. 

           All that being said i give this game a 4/10, although it did create the strand like genre as we know it, people would later improve on the formula, such as The Video Game Donkey's ""the notorious dunk"", although it was a song and not a game, i still feel it improved on the genre as a whole.

           PS: I haven't played the longing, I haven't beaten death stranding, this review was co-written by someone who has never played either game, and most of the actual review is me thinking of random things to praise it for. ""I rate this review 7/10 - Mr. Kojima Konami"" -me

I did not want to play a game where Norman Reedus spent his time crying and mothering an infant, as was suggested in the promotional materials.

Well, very minor spoiler (first 10 min): his tears are an inadvertent reaction to his surroundings, and he ""mothers"" a pod baby tool that detects ghosts. It's not too bad.

Once you get past the awful naming conventions (on the level of Ash Ketchum or John Darksouls), you'll find unique work with truly top notch art direction, vibe, and atmosphere. The story is long winded, and yes-- often boring and convoluted; but the themes are strong and the world building is some of the best I've seen. It's more like a poem than a story. You feel this thing.

Gameplay itself is easy and serviceable. It's more mechanically interesting than a routine walking simulator, but might lack the depth many would expect. I personally enjoyed balancing my weight while trekking across the terrain. The world just looks so cool.

Overall, it's trying to do something different and succeeds on its own terms. I'll remember a couple of the visual set pieces for some time to come.",1697852015,1697852015,True,2,0,0.4581490159034729,0,True,False,False

You're playing as Sam Bridges, given the task to reunite America after the apocalypse; ""The Death Stranding"". On the way, you meet certain important characters that not only are crucial to the story, but also carry their own story. They make you realise this whole world you are trying to reunite is broken.
'Broken people in a broken world, Sam is broken, Everything is broken'.
But what is broken can be fixed, this is where the multiplayer system comes in, every utility you place is placed in other player's world, and vice versa. The game also manages to make a distinction between dangers, and the parts of relieve. It's not possible to explain the feeling of having climbed a mountain or crossed hostile terrain, and then having the slow walk with music in the background. The game also ends with a last walk with the best music theme there is.

-THIS GAME IS BEST EXPERIENCED BLIND-, Try to avoid any information about the game story wise, the game will give you many unthought off surprises that will be ruined once you've heard of them.
Do note that this is a story-heavy game, expect the same gameplayloop with an unraveling (weird & disturbing) story. Also be aware that the game has many cutscenes, like watching a movie.

If you were like me who completely got lost and confused with the gameplay mechanics in the beginning of the game and quit couple of times then read:

 1. This game is awesome and a lot of people (including myself before playing) think the game is only about a walking simulator. It is not and after short amount of time you get the ability of fabricating/creating vehicles and load your cargo on it. My favorite unlockable is the ZIP LINE. I do not remember last time I was walking too long after unlocking the Zip Line. Also you will see other peoples zip lines as well and you can connect yours with them and literally zip line across the whole map lol
 
2. Focus on your main objective (ORDERS FOR SAM) all the time and only pick the standard orders if the delivery location of standard orders are closer or the same place that your main objective orders needs to be delivered.

3. Ignore the LOST CARGO's around the world. At least for the beginning as those may be confusing as hell to understand. You will end up loading lots of these without understanding the purpose. But maybe you are smarter than me and figure out faster lol
 4. You DONT HAVE TO build strong relationship with anyone, there is only ONE ending. So dont worry for not doing Standard deliveries. Only reason I would recommend to do the standard deliveries is to unlock upgraded items such as shoes or weapons. But again if you do standard missions like I mentioned in my 2nd point then you will be fine :)

Death Stranding is a different type of game.  Some people will love it, some will like it and some will hate it.  

The Good
It is not filled with Woke cuntery
Much of the Gameplay is satisfying
Characters are decent
Beautiful Landscapes

The Bad
Way too many cut scenes in order to tell the story.  Some you can skip but not all of them
Killing an opponent bring about a heavy penalty.  Most of the combat is non lethal.  I prefer shooters but I am giving this style a chance 

The Annoying
You need to invest a lot of time to learn the controls and understand the game.  If you're not patient, then this game is not for you.  If you take the time to learn it you may be surprised and enjoy it
Many things are left unsaid for the gamer to figure out on their own.  You can always cheat and go to the internet though

As Sam Porter Bridges, I embarked on a journey to reconnect isolated cities and people in a post-apocalyptic America. This was no easy task. The terrain was rugged and treacherous, scattered with obstacles and threats around every turn. Simply getting from point A to point B required immense patience and perseverance. I couldn't rush the journey or take unnecessary risks. I had to cautiously plot my route, take my time navigating rocky cliffs and river crossings, and pause frequently to catch my breath and regain my stamina. The game forced me to slow down, move methodically, and understand that progress requires patience.

This patience paid off through the connections I built with other players along the way. When I took the time to contribute resources to build roads and structures, it benefited others down the line. By liking and sharing other players' ladders and vehicles, I could lend a helping hand. And receiving likes in return motivated me to keep building communal tools and infrastructure. I realized delivering packages wasn't just about me and my destination; it was about being part of something bigger. My patience and cooperation with others quite literally paved the way forward.

Death Stranding also taught me to keep going in the face of failure. Sam frequently lost his footing on slippery terrain or got ambushed by terrorists. Whenever I botched a delivery, I wanted to give up in frustration. But I had to remember that failure is inevitable, and what matters most is learning from mistakes, picking yourself back up, and trying again. Just as Sam persevered after every setback, I grew to accept failure as part of the journey. There was too much at stake to dwell on imperfection. Persisting through failure brought me closer to accomplishing my mission.

Most importantly, Death Stranding instilled in me that every delivery—every promise made—matters. The packages I transported as Sam weren't just cargo. They represented connections to people waiting on the other end, people in need of aid, resources, and human contact. The promises I made to deliver brought hope and comfort to them. My capacity to keep those promises gave meaning to their lives. The gravity of that role taught me to value human relationships and understand that we all depend on one another's reliability. When I focused on the responsibility of my promises rather than the difficulty of the delivery, I gained purpose and motivation to press onward.

In an isolating world, Death Stranding showed me how patience, cooperation, and perseverance bind us together. Its poignant message will stay with me: the strands that connect us are fragile, but unbreakable when we walk hand-in-hand. Sam Porter Bridges' journey mirrored my own. Through his grueling trek that required patience, endurance, and a concern for others, I gained insight into what it means to be human—to profoundly need other people and be needed in return. Therein lies the strand that gives us purpose.",1696740493,1696740493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was really something unique achieved here with this game so don't listen to the ""postman/DHL simulator"" comments, it's so much more than that.

Now, on the more complex note, what I really found great about the game were numerous things that really stand out like the soundtrack, feeling of interacting with players via structures and paths you've taken, going on a journey to a not-yet connected region on your own and the build up of gradually becoming known as a porter via the story development. These major things in my view give the game a one-of-a-kind atmosphere.

Overall there's a grand selection to choose from when it comes to buildable structures like zip-lines, ladders, anchors, generators, safehouses, postboxes, jump ramps etc., as well as bringing gameplay ""modifier"" items that enhance your customization further such as stabilizators so you don't fall over enough and make landings smoother, or extra battery, pouches, heating pads for colder regions. There was a lot of thought brought into your options which are really vast and fit well the general lenght of the game.

Speaking of playtime, I've found the game to be quite lenghty for a single-player game, filled with content from main missions, to standard orders that are repeatables but still feel often unique as you may take different paths, use different vehicles and overall using different means of transportation whether on foot, bike or a truck. In terms lf lenght, it's most fulfilling, even to the point that it may feel like it's never going to end and when it finally does, there's like a 2-hour long ending with an epilogue.

That brings me to the topic of the story. Perhaps the only aspect that wasn't, in my opinion, handled as well as it could've been. Now, the story ITSELF is amazing, from start to finish, I won't spoil anything here but suffice to say that the idea behind what's going on and how it ends is amazing. What felt odd was the story-telling, may just be me so take this with a grain of salt but at some point, the story that even though it was expanded upon, it was often repeated on and on where plenty was said but didn't really feel like anything new was mentioned, rather repeating, a lot of dialogue/monologue lines for nothing new, really. I generally never dislike more dialogue/monologue and long cutscenes but even I stopped often and wondered if it's not enough. To summarize, characters monologue too much, frequently and at a point where it adds very little to the story. But that would really be the only thing I could find that sticked out for me, apart from the odd controls of the vehicles that takes some time getting used to.

The Director's Cut offers new structures to build and activities to use in the world, at some point I've found myself thinking that there's always something to do, it's amazing but it's a shame it's a purely single-player experience, which of course, for the purpose of story, is ideal. However, given how much content there is in the game, I've often imagined how great co-op would be here.

There are also easter egg missions including Cyberpunk 2077 and Half-life that I won't spoil but they're not exactly hidden so you will come across them on your own.

To summarise, it is one of the games that will stand out for me the most, great story, characters, wide array of gameplay technicalities, feeling of connecting with other players, vast range of usable items to help you on your journey, atmospheric soundtrack, nigh endless lore, plenty of collectibles and always something to do. It's quite obvious that a lot of hard work and personality was put into this game and for all the reasons above I wholeheartedly recommend this game.

With that out of the way,the game's biggest strength is that the gameplay loop is quite original among major titles,however it suffers from numerous shortcomings that spoil the experience. 
For review purposes I will be including minor spoilers regarding game mechanics and some story chapters.

As you may already know,the focus of the game is around making deliveries,however soon you discover that the real meat is the ""optimisation"" of deliveries - figuring out how to fulfill orders with minimal effort required. 
As such,you are provided with a wide range of tools to achieve your goals,starting from simple ladders and bridges to cargo catapults and ziplines.
 This is where the first caveat hits - half of the tools at your disposal are worthless. The only PCC buildings I've ever bothered with were bridges and ziplines,the latter of which render the bridge obsolete as well. 
Let's take the ramp as an example,it launches players and vehicles alike. You can use it to cross gaps,pretty cool,right? Well it only works one way,so you need two,at which point a bridge will do the same job,with the extra benefit of not having a chance to get you killed. Using it to get vehicles to high places? Those places are too bumpy to traverse with a vehicle anyway.

The walking isn't actually too bad,the character's animations adapt to terrain,crossing rivers is a neat minigame (although climbing feels very ""stiff"",as you snap to ledges while scaling rocks). Getting tired limits your range,incentivises strategically placing shelters and encourages picking shorter routes and (only early) keeping an eye on cargo weight.

You know the buildings I mentioned? ""Maxing"" your reputation with a recipient takes around 3-4 trips.
Setting up a building requires the following: 1. Walk through bare terrain to connect to the network 2. Walk along the same route to build everything
This effectively means that you get to use your cleverly placed buildings once or twice.

Vehicles - I cannot stress how abysmal the driving physics are here,by far the worst I have ever seen. Bikes are super-glued to the ground,trucks (or rather delivery vans) get stopped by mere pebbles on the ground,forcing you to spam spacebar in hopes of jumping over them. Regarding the aforementioned pebbles,what if you *actually* wish to stop a vehicle? Well it'll slide as if it was on ice for the next 30 meters unless you purposefully crash into something. Thankfully the devs didn't bother to code cargo damage inside vehicles,so you can crash all you want (as long as you don't drive off a cliff). 

My biggest gripe of all is the obnoxious story. The first 3 hours of the game bombard you with cutscenes,then for the rest of the game all you hear is ""America Reconnect Together Beach America Chiral Network Beach Reconnect"". You're hauling hundreds of kilograms of cargo for what? Some ugly lady that you feel zero connection towards,as she doesn't show any personality outside the aforementioned ""America Rebuild Beach"" babbling. 
Even main characters are very shallow,with their personality revolving around a single gimmick (""Has heart problems"" ""Has a twin sister"" ""Wears an edgy mask"")
The game is supposed to take place in former US territory,but they could've called it an alien planet and no one would tell the difference,as the environment looks un-natural. All that story budget could've been spent on making the gameplay less repetitive,yet here we are.

I know this review says I've only played 5 hours of it, but I have many more on the original PS4 version. If you are a fan of Metal Gear, YOU HAVE TO PLAY THIS GAME. This game is not stealth-inclined like Metal Gear, nor does it have a story that follows the usual conventions, you WILL get confused through this story and you PROBABLY will have to go over certain story beats again to keep track. This is nothing new, Kojima has done this for years, writing a story with so many plot threads, big names, and self-references that the story in a way keeps an air of mystique and intrigue. The only difference is that this game preaches about life and the acceptance of death and not any existential crisis related to politics and thought control. This is still a Kojima story, so awkward humor and the occasional loose plot thread is obviously going to happen, but isn't that what we play these games for? The gameplay is nothing revolutionary, and it's technically a walking simulator just coupled with some extra layers of depth tacked on, some of which is not very deep at all. This is where theory and actual gameplay don't meet, this game somehow takes the most unenjoyable concept, a walking simulator, and somehow turns into something worth experiencing. There is no other game I can think of that plays like this game, the somber tone of the music, trudging your own path through a harsh wilderness, doing it all alone with the occasional help from good samaritans, playing a balancing act with your cargo, all of this adds up to a fun experience. This may not be Kojima at it's best, but it is 100% worth playing for people who miss the strange quirks and unconventional nature of video games that only Kojima can convey.",1696322533,1696322533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The good:
- Paranormal/high-tech shenanigans kept things interesting and fresh
- Lots of cameos and easter eggs
- Goals are fairly straightforward and manageable, with lots of possible approaches and ways to make things more challenging if you want to.
- unsurprisingly, reminiscent of metal gear games in many ways
- while you don't interact directly with other players, you can affect each other's worlds in pretty significant ways. Pretty minimal at the start, but becomes more significant as you play.
- Toolbox expands as you play, adding fun options to make life easier keeping pace with missions getting harder.
The bad:

However, a video featuring Junji Ito, the renowned Japanese horror manga artist, changed my perspective. In this video, Death Stranding was mentioned as a similar experience, and for good reason. The game's world is incredibly strange, governed by unfamiliar rules.
The allure of this game lies in its enigmatic and horrifying nature. As you progress, the once-mysterious laws of this world become more familiar, yet it remains captivating to play.

Positive aspects of the game include:
- An astonishing and distinctive world, introducing strange and new forces of nature to contend with
- Engaging characters with emotionally charged and well-executed dialogues
- Superb art direction, showcasing beautiful landscapes throughout
- Unique gameplay: While it is a delivery game, it also incorporates action and armed combat (although this is not the main focus of the game), and delivering packages is surprisingly enjoyable and very addictive",1695586056,1695587057,True,29,0,0.728224813938140869,0,True,False,False

You do all these deliveries yet the world is empty of people and you don't go in the supposed cities, just the delivery terminals.

If you have an are wondering what I'm talking about a Kojima game means long segments of being exposition dumped or hearing a character tell your their wacky and contrived origin-story. It means naively thinking that the game is over before being hit by 2-3 more hours of playtime and cutscenes that means you finish the game at 2 AM in a delirious state, waking up the next morning wondering whether or not it was just a weird dream. BUT, and I don't know whether it is just Stockholm syndrome or not, I promise these cheesy Kojima games always seem to hit you right in the feels at the end in a way that makes all the ridiculousness worth it. They always have a really good credits song as well.

Jokes and warnings aside, this game does a lot of things that are unique and interesting if you are okay and aware of the above. This game is all about working to make connections with others. Whether that be leaving a ladder or a zip-line in the perfect spot for future players to have an easier time, or helping all these eccentric NPC's with their life problems in the grand attempt to reconnect America after an apocalyptic and isolating event. It doesn't seem very meaningful when you read it but the first time I thoughtlessly ""5-starred' my connection with someone only to be given a gift of a unique and helpful item, something only that character could make, this virtual experience suddenly felt very real and very human. I don't normally go out of my way to be a completionist but these connections felt meaningful in a way that I haven't experienced often in video games. They felt like real people I wanted to go out of my way to help and their gratitude felt meaningful and genuine. I am always a fan of games that try to make you be a better person and between all of the Kojima ridiculousness this is one of them.

I also want to say that this game turns the traditional open world design on it's head in a very clever and interesting way. Most open world games just spread the content across vast open spaces that take a long time to traverse, ultimately hurting the games replayablility. In this game traveling from point A to B IS the content, the destinations are just where you go to rest and get more packages. You can take the long and easy path or you can use any of the growing amount of tools you are given to make your traversal easier, the gameplay is conquering that distance and finding the shortest and safest path to where you need to go. It gives this game the replay value that other open world games lack.",1665655430,1695473787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story begins very mysterious and vague and in my opinion starts to get good about 30 hours in, probably because I tried to 100% everything before moving onto the next story mission, but it did feel slow. However, the sophisticated gameplay and visually stunning graphics help a lot. 

The gameplay it's very rewarding and challenging depending on your difficulty levels, people say this is a walking or UPS simulator, but it's got so much more, you have to plan almost every initial delivery but also by building new structures and using an specific path you make future deliveries a lot easier. I believe what makes Death Stranding a great game it's the online functionality, helping other players by donating resources, building Zip line networks using already placed Zip lines and lots of other interaction make the whole thing more connected and welcoming.

This review is mostly about the base version (126 hours), since I only wanted to try out the director's cut new features, but I have to say that even after playing just 4 hours on the new version I definitely recommend playing that one instead of the original. While not so many changes were made, they were mostly QoL updates and a few new items, but those do make a difference!, and the cosmetics are really cool.

I definitely recommend playing this game to 100%, get all the tools, items and lore, it's wroth it and you'll understand more the beautiful yet complicated story, be sure to get it as soon as you can and try it out, you might not like it at first but give it time and you'll definitely enjoy the unique experience.",1681338091,1694959637,True,3,0,0.534045934677124023,0,True,False,False

=====================================================================================

I cant honestly review death Stranding without spoiling major story beats. So warning, spoilers below.

I am one of the four people who is obsessed with death stranding and I don't really know why. Its weird, its clever, its stupid. Breaking it apart to review each individual component (graphics, sound design, story, etc) would reveal a mehh title, but as a whole its so much more (and less) than the sum of its parts. The soundtrack and world building do a lot of the heavy lifting, but the appeals to ""gamers"" bring it down and it drops the ball in a lot of places. I still love the game, but I'm aware of its flaws.

I was first attracted to death stranding by its bizarre trailers, and the game does not disappoint in the bizarre. I wanted to know what drove that guy to such desperation to stab himself when being pulled into the sky by some mysterious giant... man shaped thing. Whats up with the body bag twitching and turning into tar? Why does Normal Reedus have a baby in his throat? Whattup with all the dead whales, dolphins, fish and crab seemingly having some kind of wire ran from their bellies into the ocean? And the floating people far off? What neat imagery, I cant wait to learn why! The answer to all this, unfortunately, is because it looks mysterious and cool, well not the guy stabbing himself, he had good reason to try to end himself before what happens, happens. The fish, crabs, dolphins and whales are tied to astrological signs but their not explained any further than that. Norman Reedus has a baby in his throat because he has a baby on his chest, it might have some kind of metaphorical reason, but that's really it. The world building around what and why happens to corpses is in depth, and I feel like id be doing a disservice to explain it, and at that point this ""review"" would become just a bunch of explanations and I have other things I need to talk about.

Such as the boss fights. The boss fights are meant to appeal to ""gamers"" and I think they make the game worse overall being what they are. The game is much scarier, and better when fighting back isnt an option, and the boss fights force only that option, kill it or be killed. The Boss Boss fights against Mads Mikkelsen are neat but suffer from the exact same problem, but with guns this time. The coolest thing that comes from these boss boss fights are the beaches themselves, being where your soul gets stranded if you and a bunch of other people die at once or in great agony, so Mads's beaches are themed around the great wars and Vietnam. I would have loved to see some truly tragic beaches however. What does Hiroshima and Nagasaki's beaches look like? The Japanese coast with its frequent tsunamis would make for a particularly tragic beach. 9/11? 

The very final boss fight is one of the weirdest things I've ever seen, full of surface level video game references, its Bayonetta levels of odd and is completely out of place in death stranding, its like Hideo is telling us to not take the game so seriously, but..... First you fight and kill a giant bt, then you learn about a suicidal god of death and that explains the extinction event(The Death Stranding), but doesn't explain it at all. Then you punch Higs in the face a few times on a beach, then the game returns back to normal like nothing ever happened (but with one more, very cool bt fight against a giant bt whale). If the game just faded to black and rolled credits after fighting the final giant bt and connecting the qpid it would have been a better game. The Higs fight only works to degrade the final product. Don't get me wrong, I liked Higs as a villain and his character design tells you a lot about how the death stranding happened if you pay attention, but at the same time, the final confrontation with him is a major let down.

The core game-play loop of delivering packages though haunted and hostile yet beautiful landscapes is neat, but can be boring once you've built roads and zip lines. The story itself is entertaining and odd, typical Hideo fare. The progression is fun and fair, although, if I had my way trucks would come when you unlock mountain knot city, not much much earlier as it is now. The characters are neat, but fragile needs a rework, or at least stop having her say that stupid ""I'm fragile but I'm not that fragile"" line. Its stupid. Guns shouldn't exist, and their inclusion gives people the wrong idea about the game. Its worth mentioning that the original Death Stranding was infested with advertisements for real world products, namely monster and Norman Reedus's Ride. These are almost gone in directors cut, monster is entirely removed and the only reference to Ride is a single Bike. I understand their placements though as the game wouldn't have been able to be made without some form of sponsorship.

Death stranding pulls a Dark Souls in some of its world building. The qpid is covered in mathematical formula, the Einstein field equations, the quantum entanglement equations, the reaction-diffusion system model, the Higgs field, the Dirac equation and the Schwarzchild Radius, but these are never called out, only being visible in the brief cut scenes when you connect the device. Higs is covered in similar tattoos, namely parts of electromagnetic tensors equations and quantum field theory equations. I don't know this for myself but that's what internet discussions have come to the conclusion of. What that might mean and why, I wont delve into as I'm not smart enough to explain my thought process behind what I think is happening, but any students of physics and philosophy should be able to follow the threads to a meaningful conclusion. Without this knowledge your left very much in the dark about what caused the Death Stranding, other than ""dunno, one day people started turning into ghosts that summon other ghosts that eat people and explode"". There are also endless emails and data points that explain and over explain and over over explain certain aspects of the death stranding and its effects on our psychology, its just that the questions you really want answered will remain in the dark unless you dig. Most videos of people who try to explain what the death stranding is are wrong or very surface level, never digging into what isn't said or these formula, which is a shame because they all seem so certain that they've got the correct answers, when its not that simple and are harming future interpretations.

=====================================================================================

Here be my review of the directors cut changes.

Directors cut removes a lot of the advertisements and adds a new road between mountain knot city and the weather station as well as a car. Its also prettier, but the game was already gorgeous. It also adds a secret or two, minorly re-balances the mid game and adds new build-able structures that you'll almost never use because the core structures get the job done on their own, but are still fun to play around with. The only thing I don't like about the directors cut is that it isn't available for ps4, where I've poured the vast vast majority of my time before my computer was able to run the directors cut. Directors cut is more Death Stranding, its a good improvement and in my opinion worth the price.",1694810013,1694813689,True,8,0,0.586513936519622803,0,True,False,False

Like others Kojima games, it's filled with a ton of explanations, infos, lore... at the end of the game it becomes a bit much in my opinion.

Clunky menus and clunky movement around some of the coolest scenery I have seen in a game.  Can recommend especially if you pick it up on sale.  Would probably play better on a Playstation, this seems like a pretty bad port.  But if you don't have a PS5 this isn't a complete waste of time and money.

The Good: Awesome scenery, awesome character models, good music, and original game concepts make for a pretty enjoyable experience.  The story is pretty good at certain points which is key when so much of this game is cutscenes.  The voice acting and motion capture are next level which makes the cutscenes incredible.  Interesting enemy types and the graphical effects for the enemies are impressive.

The Bad: Horrible clunky menu which has you pressing buttons way more than you should have to.  Default game setting takes you out of game every time you engage the BT enemies and plays an animation.  Even when you turn off the setting that pulls you out of game, it still stops your vehicle in its tracks when you are close to the BT enemies which is very annoying.  

The movement on foot and driving vehicles feels very clunky on mouse and keyboard.  Driving the reverse trike can be fun at times but there is a lot of struggling smashing into rocks.  I understand Kojima was trying to simulate a top heavy courier but there are certain points when I was losing balance barely carrying anything.  Having to hold both mouse buttons for most of the game to balance got pretty old.

By the end of the game I was ready for it to be over.  Many of the NPC dialogues ramble on way longer than is necessary or enjoyable, even the ones that have a generic greeting (which is most of them).  The story is pretty hard to follow although it is weird enough to be interesting.  Only 21 percent of the playerbase has finished the last two episodes which tells me almost 80 percent didn't like the story enough to finish the game.",1692422523,1694279078,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hearing bells being rung by other players, miracle boosting spots, vagrants.. those were just small things that made the experience cooler and for a game that is slow and heavy, it's always nice to see other players. This sadly was only for the first dark souls. Every other game in the franchise (including elden ring) doesn't have anything like it and it really makes me sad.

I used to think Dark Souls 1 was the perfect example of passive multiplayer but Death Stranding goes above and beyond in this and it's something I adore. When logged in, you can see player structures or lost cargo that you can pickup and use for your playthrough. Nier Automata had something similar but to me it wasn't performed too well. They were just bloodstains from dark souls.
Receiving help from other players and going out of your way for helping others it's amazing. It's open world is not bloated with dumb content as the content itself is how you traverse through the different routes that the game offers to you. There are a few things scattered around to make the offline experience not as bad, but for the most part; online is where it's at.

There is a specific mechanic in this game that has really blown my mind which is trailblazing. When you or other people go through the same path multiple times, the path will become dirt and softer. This allows you to go your destination quicker and safer and I don't know it's so fucking cool to know that I can help others just by walking, people pleasers heaven fr fr 

The story of this game is told in a way that respects the consumer. It is usually shown or told but not explained and it's not like the games needs to be explained, really. It is an incredibly original story with concepts that are new but easily explained due to the lack of need for details. 

The gameplay itself is fantastic and rewards skill without being too hard to get into. I love the peaceful sections but the action ones can also be interesting, specially given how killing humans can often make things worse unless you're willing to be responsible for those deaths.

It's a great game but I understand it can be a hit or miss for a lot of people.
If you don't mind games where you're not actively shooting or in danger at all times such as Stardew Valley, games where you need to stop and plan ahead without much action like the first dark souls game, then you're gonna be okay.

Sure, it's not for everyone, but I think everyone should still give this game a fair try, and learn to be open to newer experiences, even if they don't fulfil the traditional definition of what you expect from a video game. This game actively reinforces how video games in general can be art, and how the medium can be used in incredibly powerful ways and allow you to engage with it in a way that no other form of media can, and very few games succeed in giving you this feeling. I don't even say this as a Kojima fanboy (although I am), but I think more gamers will likely benefit by broadening their horizons and learning to engage with a game and its themes on the game's terms. 

I think calling it just a ""walking simulator"" is very reductive and dismissive, the equivalent of watching something like Oppenheimer or 12 Angry Men and being like ""it's just people talking"". There's a great amount of depth in both the themes and the gameplay mechanics, and the way those themes are reinforced by the gameplay itself is nothing short of legendary- I mean that's almost always the case with Kojima's games but it reaches a level that it never did before.  The world is beautiful to look at and to traverse, the gameplay feels smooth and fluid, and despite me usually disliking navigating menus and complex UIs in most games, here it's mostly such a fluid experience that it rarely takes away from my immersion. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I've played this game upwards of 12-18 hours in a single sitting multiple times, and I've thoroughly enjoyed every single second. 

It's so difficult to describe the feeling when you see a structure - a zipline, a safe house, a bridge, a truck or even just a simple ladder- planted, or left abandoned, by another player at just the right place for you to be able to push through that last stretch to the destination with a heavy load that you realized too late that you were under-prepared for.  That feeling of gratitude and connection. And when you log in on some random day and see a structure you created got thousands of likes on something you built because it happened to be useful for dozens of players. It's a little silly considering how likes are sort of meaningless and any benefit you get from them is mostly secondary since equipment and structure unlocks are a thousand times more useful, but...it works, man. It's even funnier since the game lampshades this very thing and calls out how funny it is that something as inconsequential as likes can get you a oxytocin high, and reading those logs I was like ""heh, sure"" thinking it's just a funny gimmick. 
But by the end of the game I absolutely understood what that meant. The theme of connection and helping others in creating a better world and building structures that might only be of passing use to you but will help countless others in the future works incredibly well. When something helps you out during a difficult delivery and you feel so grateful that you're inspired to make something in return to help the journey for future travellers even easier. It's wonderful.

The open world is also possibly the best open world I've ever experienced in a game. Not only is it mesmerizingly gorgeous, it also feels very deliberate, down to the last stone. It's extremely difficult to traverse at times, but not because of wonky movement mechanics or poor collision systems or the player urge to break those mechanics as is the case with most other games,  but it is so by design. I mean, technically, you can still 'Skyrim-horse' your way up some inclines using trucks or motorcycles but they also have their battery limits too, and sometimes that's far more inefficient than abandoning them and moving on foot at some point, so it's not exactly something you can consistently break- but regardless. It's very easy to immerse yourself in the loop of micro-managing your inventory, macro-managing your trips and losing yourself as you put one foot in front of the next. If you find yourself engaged with this gameplay loop, you'll be losing dozens of hours in the game before you even know it. The difficulty is highly dependent on your patience and your preparation. Theoretically, if you prepare well enough  and pay attention to what the game tells you, plus plan for your future deliveries, you can prepare well enough to make the game a breeze to walk past. But the game also throws enough curveballs and challlenges to not make it all mindless, and still leave room for a fair bit of improvisation during the journey. 

Every design decision feels extremely deliberate and very well-polished in this game. Sure, there are some things that are somewhat annoying- such as navigating different menus for private lockers, share lockers, for claiming cargo or for donating cargo, for recycling equipment, for claiming materials, etc. Not to mention the mini-cutscenes and dialogues you have to hear over and over at times. But still, for the most part, it feels natural and fluid and none of it takes me out of the game or bores me or makes it feel tedious even though it easily could have (or I'm sure it does for many other players). 

Moving on to slightly spoilery territory (you've been warned)- firstly, the combat.

To begin with, you're not a stealth commando. you're not an action hero. You're a porter, a deliveryman in a post-apocalyptic world. And the combat makes you feel that way. Your guns don't have perfect accuracy, your actions are not necessarily faster than your enemies, and you need to prepare well in advance before you head out to take on a horde of goons. But it still feels nice and just on the cusp of easy and difficult. If you're skilled enough, you can Rambo it up and take on 20 thugs at once, or you can cheese it out and bombard them with stun grenades from afar. That choice is entirely dependent on how confident you are on your skills, how much patience you have, how much risk you're willing to take, and most importantly- what's most fun for you. I also love how this game, like most Kojima games, offers you a choice between going non-lethal or lethal, and how (depending on how you look at it) it rewards and punishes either choice but still heavily encourages non-lethal based on the themes of the game. In my 110 hour playthrough I never killed a single person. 

The story, however. Although I understand the themes, and the overview, there are still so many details that don't necessarily make sense to me. I don't know if I can buy this universe and the characters and their motivations as easily as I could in Kojima's earlier games, and I'll definitely have to spend a long time marinating these details in my head and playing and analyzing the game over and over before I can truly grasp it or to even decide whether I like it or not, but I have to admit that I did not fall in love with it as easily as I did in every Kojima game prior. I expect that to change soon because it did grow on me by the end, but still, not to the extent I had hoped. The story is also extremely front and back heavy which will definitely turn off a lot of players, but I don't mind that and I've come to expect that in most Kojima games, hell, I think it's even a good signature style and I don't want him to change that for anything. I play his games for a certain experience and it delivers. 
Although this time, I have to admit that the ending hours, although touching, were getting a little hard for me to sit through, but I honestly blame only myself for this because I decided to end the game with a 14 hour binge. 

There's also a lot of MGS V DNA in this game, in a good way.  I have so many more thoughts but apparently character limits are a thing in Steam review. So, as a conclusion- I absolutely adore this game and I loved every second. The moment I finished it I already wanted to start it over, and I'll remember this experience for the rest of my life.",1693860392,1693860549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At its core, Death Stranding is about connection - both the connections between people and the connections between life and death. As Sam Porter Bridges, you traverse a barren and desolate landscape, delivering packages and reconnecting isolated communities in a world that has been shattered by a cataclysmic event known as the Death Stranding. The gameplay is simple but engrossing, with a heavy emphasis on exploration and survival. You'll need to manage your resources carefully, navigating treacherous terrain and dealing with the ever-present threat of supernatural beings known as ""Beached Things"" (BTs).

What really sets Death Stranding apart, though, is its storytelling. The game is a masterclass in atmosphere and mood, with a sense of existential dread that permeates every moment. The performances from the cast are top-notch, with Norman Reedus turning in a standout performance as Sam Porter Bridges. The game's themes of isolation, grief, and the fragility of human connection are all expertly woven into the narrative, creating an experience that is both emotional and thought-provoking.

That being said, Death Stranding isn't for everyone. The pacing can be slow at times, with long stretches of walking punctuated by brief moments of action. The game's mechanics can also feel repetitive, with many missions involving little more than delivering packages from point A to point B. Some players may find the game's story and themes pretentious or overly convoluted, and the game's steep learning curve may turn off more casual players.

Overall, Death Stranding is a game that's not afraid to take risks. It's a haunting and beautiful experience that's unlike anything else out there, with a compelling story and top-notch performances. While it's not for everyone, those who are willing to take the journey will be rewarded with an experience that's truly unique.",1665777429,1693583586,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game introduces us to Sam Porter Bridges, convincingly portrayed by Norman Reedus. He is a courier who travels in a destroyed world and is supposed to bring together the scattered survivors. At its core, Death Stranding is about rebuilding human relationships in a broken society that reflects the fragmentation of our modern lives. It forces players to consider the weight of their own interactions and the impact on others, because every ladder, rope, and bridge built by players can help other travelers on their journey.

One of the most striking aspects of Death Stranding is the mesmerizingly desolate landscape, a hauntingly beautiful depiction of a world pushed to the edge. The game's graphics and sound design are simply breathtaking, creating an eerie atmosphere that resonates long after you put down the controller.

The gameplay, often criticized for its repetitive delivery missions, can be seen as a metaphor for the monotony and routine that sometimes plague our own lives. Kojima's decision to lean into that monotony may frustrate some players, but it's a deliberate choice that challenges us to find meaning in the seemingly mundane. Each trek through rugged terrain becomes a journey of self-discovery, contemplation, and meditation.

Perhaps the most thought-provoking aspect of Death Stranding is its examination of death and the afterlife. The concept of ""stranding"" explores the idea that death is not an end but a transition, and the ""Stranded Things"" (BTs) that haunt the world blur the lines between life and death, blurring the existential boundaries we often take for granted.

In summary, Death Stranding is an immersive, ambitious, and thought-provoking experience that challenges players to reflect on their own existence, the connections they make, and the consequences of their actions. It's not a game for everyone, and its deliberate pacing and complex narrative may deter some, but for those willing to embark on this enigmatic journey, Death Stranding offers a unique and profound reflection on the human condition in an age of digital disconnection.

This means it's deeper than just being a ""walking simulator"" as your journeys are hard and require attention, thinking, and some degree of stealth due to murderous ghosts or crazy lunatics. On top of this, the game world is just overall beautiful, with the only caveat being that the game world probably should've been twice as large; the ""great plains"" region in the game is practically non-existent sadly.

There are a few notable issues with the game, though:

You need at least 4GB of vram so the game won't stutter horribly, which means older computers might not be capable of even the lowest settings. If you only have 4GB of vram you need to set streaming memory to the lowest setting to avoid stuttering. If you have more than 4GB of vram you can set it to the highest setting.

Tutorial tips overload. Thankfully you can skip/speed through these but unfortunately there's literally about 100 of these that will keep coming up regularly until the end of the game and after reading them the first time you have to find them in the pause menu to look at them again to get rid of the ""unread"" indicator on already-read tutorial tips.

Cutscenes/dialog. It's a Kojima game so you have to deal with tons of repetitive dialog and cutscenes that vary from relevant to irrelevant in regards to the actual gameplay. Everything's skippable, but I've only felt like skipping 1 or 2 cutscenes in the entire game which is better than some other games (like Hardspace Shipbreaker where I wanted to skip every dialog/cutscene but they're all unskippable D:<)

Combat. It's in there mostly because someone decided invisible murderous ghosts wasn't enough, but somehow they half-assed the combat despite the game being produced/directed by the Metal Gear Solid guy.

玩之前就看到有评价说这个游戏核心玩法是送快递，我还以为只是一种比喻，没想到真的就是字面意义的送快递。
先说缺点吧，
这个游戏最大的问题是，剧情叙事和游玩割裂得太严重了。对于故事和背景的讲述，全部被封装在过场动画、交货后的投影，和数据文档里面。在你探索世界、执行任务的过程中，你得不到什么信息。说白了就是，玩家了解剧情的过程完全是被动的，而互动的部分玩家得不到什么关于剧情的信息。这使得游玩体验的吸引力大打折扣，不够引人入胜。
第二点和第一点相关，就是游戏世界里，没有太多能引发玩家思考、推理的设计，显得空无一物。像《荒野大镖客》里，地图上会有各种随机事件、兴趣点，引发你对西部世界、对时代背景、对故事情节的思考，有些甚至布置得像犯罪现场，让玩家可以去推理还原现场经过。这一点在《死亡搁浅》里是完全没有的，只是截至目前没有遇到。
第三点，纯吐槽，看交货后的神态僵硬的全息投影真的看吐了，而且还莫名其妙是个仰视视角。
第四点，摩托车越野手感过于糟糕，骑个山地磕磕绊绊听sam吭哧吭哧的真是哭笑不得
值得夸夸的地方
1. 设定还是挺有意思的，虽然在地球上，但游戏里的世界有很强的异世界的感觉
2. 游戏的重点放在连接和建造，而非破坏上，讲究和环境的互动，因地制宜
3. 优化好，界面清爽（除了地图），游玩体验流畅
4. Low roar的配乐是真的好听啊，很治愈。当游戏开始Don't be so serious响起的时候非常惊艳。
5. 主角的各种小动作、自言自语显得很真实，还会和摄像机互动，打破次元壁

This game is an experience and definitely isn't for everyone. The rating system on steam is honestly really primitive and needs to be reworked because I can only choose to either recommend the game or not. 
I can't in good faith recommend this game to just anyone however a lot of love and care went into creating this experience and I really like it. 
This game is like a movie with almost no bugs to speak of. (I can't even really remember any bugs, not even small ones.) 
What's even more impressive is the story. 
Is it convoluted? very. 
Should game stories be made like this? no, just no.
And yet I find myself coming back, wanting to make America whole again one package at a time.
The community of the game and the feeling of doing your part is what keeps me coming back wanting more not to mention the really cool technology and the interesting take on combat.
In the beginning the mules are a big threat. If you overload yourself and get spotted by mules with no way back, in short you are gonna get shanked and your stuff will be lost and likely damaged on top of that. 
However, when its later in the game you will learn how to fight back and even learn new tactics to fight back.
[spoiler]If you are having trouble with mules in an area try using the electric stun gun on the mules when they are in water. you're welcome.[spoiler]
same with with the BT's but it's slightly different. Instead of action you get stealth where you have to be very careful in the beginning. What makes it even more difficult is the timefall which causing your equipment to deteriorate and your packages to become damaged. So it's advised to be prepared and use every weapon you can to your advantage.

In short, this game has absorbed my soul and ever since covid-19 shook up the world this game has helped me become whole again.",1693060903,1693060903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I can say this game is quite something else, probably the best and most unique experience I've had in a game.

Earlier on, it might be hard to invest in. There's a lot of information to take in, things might take some time to understand. I actually went several months without playing the game after the first couple of chapters, not because I didn't like it, but because I felt like each time I logged in, I had to invest a lot. I felt the game drained me to my very core, both physically and emotionally. I'm not the only one to have felt like this, I've seen a lot of people that have been through a similar situation as well, and say this is more of an ""acquired taste"".

This, I believe, is due to the way the game was made: you have very long moments of bliss and chill - long walks where you take in the amazing graphics and ambience, the music that perfectly envelops it all -, but those moments are punctuated by moments of increasing tension - like timefall and encounters with BTs, MULE camps, or cutscenes.

That's the beauty of it, it's not an action packed, all highs sort of game. But the way that the lows and the highs are intertwined is ingeniously crafted, and that's what makes this experience amazing. It might feel somewhat boring, confusing or unpleasant at first (depending on who you ask), and it might take some time to get used to, but I think it's a necessary step for you to be fully invested for the rest of the game.

Hideo Kojima is the only person who can create hundreds of logs explaining a story and still create a mystery. This is genuinely the craziest game I've played, the story is just absolutely mind fucking. Took me so long to understand but once I figured it all out I just couldn't stop thinking about the game. The great thing about the story is that you can't just pick up on it from the start and get it at the end. You really have to pay attention and piece the story together bit by bit until you come to an understanding. It's honestly so confusing but it might just be one of the greatest stories I've ever witnessed.

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]

There are probably more people who hate this game than love it, but it's because the walking to point A to B type of play isn't right for everyone. On paper, the game should not be fun, but some how just walking or driving around the environment is just so amusing. Something about this game is so addicting that it's unhealthy. So far I've had 3 addictions, one on the original game and 2 on this version. Once this game gets you hooked there is no way to break free, the only way to escape is to beat the game, but then a year later you will see a thumbnail of [b] Death stranding [/b] and decide to start a new game and go through it all over again.
The movement and controls are a little clunky and annoying but they still work for combat. The combat is pretty fun but only in close range with human enemies. Now the driving will absolutely piss you off every time you hop on in a vehicle. if you try it you will know what I mean.

Combat remains largely boring and lackluster from start to finish, including boss fights which are, surprisingly, even more boring.

CONS:
- Terrible PC interface (a port from console). It took me a week of swearing to adjust.
- Unskippable annoying short cutscenes (Recycling - I am looking at you)
- TERRIBLE, clumsy, inconvenient, messy combat system. Saying that, I am pretty much a veteran at 1st person shooters, difficulty itself is not a problem for me.  IMO the combat like this should not even be in game. If you cannot do a good combat system, better would be no combat at all - like replace combat with puzzles, riddles etc. 

PROS:
- Beautiful scenery
- Interesting world-building & scenario
- Overall clever and demanding game mechanics that require thinking & planning
- Very good physics system in regards to human movement (""walking simulator"")
- Completely new, novel concept that probably no other game on the market has right now

NEUTRALS:
- Linear fable system. The game is a story and your choices don't matter. You can either love it or hate it, but it suits this particular game well.

Still, the game is very playable, but this is not a game for everybody.

1850570,144769231,76561197969350622,199,50,14,0,14,1692680517,"I have been playing PC games for over 25 years. Whenever you hear the name Hideo Kojima on any game created or developed, you know straight away it requires an immediate audience without delay. The man requires no introduction, he is one of the greatest game developers in existence. For those who are unaware he essentially created/designed Metal Gear Solid.. flex. 

The intro itself is balls to the wall, if that doesn't pull you in and set the scene then the game will have no effect.

Death stranding is a particular case of enigmatic art. After 137 hours of gameplay both finishing the storyline and some grinding, I will safely name this one of the best games I have played in a decade without hesitation.

To be frank, DS is a dichotomy or two realities if you will. An incredibly detailed open world, post apocalyptic simulation. On the other hand, 11 hours of cut scenes, that have a plot much like you would see from M. Night Shyamalan movies. Weird, eerie and beautiful to say the least, It is a masterpiece filled with love, war, hope and futility. This literally could of been made into a tv show or movie adaptation with global success.

Where to begin, Norman Reedus (from the walking dead) is the protagonist and beautifully portrayed in both graphical design and voice acting. This extends to others such as Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale), Léa Seydoux (Spectre and No time to die) and Guillermo Del Toro (director of the Hobbit). An incredible and effective cast of talent that created a unique Chiral Connection!

As I stated above, at its foundations, DS is a walking/delivery simulation. For a real world example you are UPS courier if you're American and an Aus postie if you are Australian! Your job as a courier is to deliver supplies/cargo across the United States to isolated areas to reconnect people via a network. The land is post-apocalyptic, is dangerous, has rough terrain, with bandits and creatures of the undead that inhabit the land.
 
This is a game of strategy not brute force. Your delivery reputation in this game is everything.
You will be given challenges that you must overcome, like crossing rivers, mountains, snow etc. You have to carry items that are fragile, have time limits, have certain conditions that must be met.

However you will have many tools at your disposal and some that will present itself as time goes on to make things much easier. Furthermore other players will interact with your environment. Making many things more fortuitous in game. You will rebuild along the way, in the form of structures and roads, which also in turn helps other players.

The game will appear to start out slow, but it builds with time. It is suitable for players who like an essence of grinding, as opposed to fast action pace games like COD. You have to be strategic and surgical at times with a learning curve.

Overall, the game received positive reception from reviewers and critics alike. The only real downsides to the game I had was I guess clunky controls at times. But I really had no other graphic errors or the like that severely affected my experience. In fact it was quite seamless.

I was not privy to playing this game when it was released in 2019/2020 during the early days of the pandemic, but the game does portray themes such as isolation and loneliness which Im sure people would have found similarities at the time to the current world situation and even now. It is an emotional game and it will resonate with people in one way or another.

Time, effort and creativity was put in this this game, it is commendable and Honorable. It reminds me of the old days where video game creators cared about the games they created and delivered instead of delivering AAA polished crap these days to make  a quick dollar. This is why Kojima is so distinct - +100 likes 

In conclusion, its a must play but it is easily over 100 hours. Well worth it in my experience. Your either going to love it or hate it.

I previously played the original version (completed with 137hrs) and upgraded to the DC.

Once it opens up, you're greeted by an open world that often leaves you alone with your thoughts for long periods. A lot of the game play is spent trying to find a way to get from point A to point B. Combat is infrequent, often giving the player the option of avoiding enemies altogether. The online community is something that makes this game really shine. Buildings, roads, vehicles, items and resources are shared among worlds, with lead to a fascinating cooperative experience that I found very rewarding.

The presentation is wonderful. Graphics, story, design. It is very much a Kojima game. It ranges from camp to emotionally poignant, funny and terrifying, frustrating and fulfilling. And it does these things very well. The sound design and music wrap it together quite nicely.

10/10, loved every bit of it. However, know that this is not an action game. It is often lonely and quiet. It's a game that took 50+ hours to finish. There are long cutscenes. But it's worth playing.",1692510265,1692510265,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The goal is to connect fragmented America, and as the game progresses, it revolves around making deliveries. It might seem tough at first, but you receive help through structures and equipment upgrades. As you travel, the beauty of nature surrounds you, but watch out for the menacing BTs (ghostly enemies) and the MULES (thieving terrorists).

The story starts by showcasing the breathtaking natural landscape that becomes the game's backdrop. You become Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) and get to know him deeply. The game introduces several characters, each with their own stories. The narrative hooks you by offering answers while leaving you with questions. The cast's acting immerses you, and the frequent cutscenes, while plenty, keep you engaged in the plot. The game provides a sense of purpose by letting you assist others by upgrading structures, building roads, and delivering lost items. The vehicles are a bit tricky to control, though.

The game's music is a prominent feature that should not be neglected. The carefully planned soundtrack wonderfully compliments the gameplay and mood, amplifying the emotional impact of important moments. The music swells and flows at just the perfect moments, bringing depth to the experience.

In conclusion, ""Death Stranding"" is an 11/10 for me. It hooked me right from the start with its freshness. Some might find delivering cargo a bit dull, but the sense of satisfaction and the joy of helping others more than makeup for it. The idea of donating and upgrading structures is truly appealing. Most importantly, I'm not one to cry during movies or games, but ""Death Stranding"" had me shedding tears. I'm eagerly looking forward to ""Death Stranding 2.""

He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.
As before.
Enter Vladimir.[/i]

[b]ESTRAGON:[/b] [i](giving up again).[/i] Nothing to be done.
[b]VLADIMIR:[/b] [i](advancing with short, stiff strides, legs wide apart).[/i] I'm beginning to come round to that opinion.

[b]ESTRAGON:[/b] Am I?

[b]ESTRAGON:[/b] [i](without gesture).[/i] Over there.
[b]VLADIMIR:[/b] And they didn't beat you?
[b]ESTRAGON:[/b] Beat me? Certainly they beat me.
[b]VLADIMIR:[/b] The same lot as usual?
[b]ESTRAGON:[/b] The same? I don't know.
[b]VLADIMIR:[/b] When I think of it… all these years… but for me … where would you be… [i](Decisively.)[/i] You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it.

Despite enjoying the gameplay in the beginning, after a while, I felt like my time was being wasted. I particularly enjoyed the hiking simulator aspect of the game. The challenge of navigating difficult and gorgeously rendered terrains with the tools you brought along was fun initially. However, the same terrains you conquer end up becoming monotonous as you have to traverse them repeatedly.

The first time you climb a mountain is really enjoyable, but the second time becomes more of an annoyance. The story couldn't hold my interest either. I found it to be melodramatic and overly long. I read and watched a few summaries to see what I would miss, but I didn't find it appealing enough to justify playing through it.

The combat sections are frustrating, as the terrain traversal gameplay doesn't integrate well with the combat mechanics. I personally don't find this game enjoyable. While I did find the climbing mechanic reminiscent of Breath of the Wild fun, unlike that game, traversing the world in Death Stranding one isn't as rewarding or smooth as it was in The Legend of Zelda.

I believe you might appreciate this game if you enjoyed the surreal elements of the Metal Gear Solid series, don't mind lengthy cutscenes, and appreciate gameplay that rewards careful planning.

Maybe if Hideo Kohima achieves his dream of getting this game a Criterion release that could fix all the isues I have of it; Turning the cutscenes into Kino.

That's all you do the entire game: deliver packages from one customer to another, over and over again. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Actually it's tedious and boring unless your childhood dream was to be a truck driver when you grew up. Sure you have to schedule your deliveries because of limited load carrying capabilities, and you have to avoid timefall events whenever possible, but that is very short lived compared to the time spent delivering packages. The only excitement you might experience, is when you encounter BTs, but even that is short-lived and repetitive.

The most valuable commodity in this game is likes, therefore instead of being payed money for making deliveries, you are paid with likes. As a delivery boy, you are supposed to connect to other delivery boys (and girls?) by liking the things they do, recovering any of their lost items, and building structures to make delivering packages easier for everyone involved so you can get more likes.

In Death Stranding I get to see and interact with real life famous people that the game studio is connected with that are taking part in the game. That's a nice touch but I never get to see or interact with any other players. You are all alone in Death Stranding's world, yet you are somehow supposed to feel connected or want to connect to other unknowns -- just so you can get more likes? How genuinely ""connected"" could that make you to them? So Death Stranding is also a story about connecting with others, just not connecting very well.

Yet I still play the game anyways. Why? Because I'm bored and because I paid for it and I want my moneys worth. And I can tell this game was made by the Japanese because the attention to (graphical and mechanical) detail is fantastic, and I get to travel and see all that detail up close. All that and I want to see where this story is going.

I didn't realize that in order to progress in the game, you have to fulfill SAMS' ORDERS, and STANDARD ORDERS are only optional. After realizing this, the game picked up a little bit for me after I changed my ""strategy"" of fulfilling orders, but a new problem sometimes is knowing where the next SAMS' ORDERS is going to be. But my mistake has a fortunate side effect of racking up a bunch of points that I otherwise wouldn't have ever acquired, points that make the game a little easier to play later on.

The story does get interesting at times, but unfortunately there are times when it seems to take a stroll a little bit on the sick side (but only a few times). I mean there are scenes in the game that are questionable, e.g. -- the ""accidental"" hints of incest with the little girl (who turns out to actually be a Japanese woman) and the implicit hints of homosexuality when you are forced into the shower with DeathMan. Numerous online posts also mention the same thing so it's not just me. Also, how mature can a game be where your ""weapons"" are your piss and poo that is collected every time you have to go to the bathroom?

I thought this game wouldn't be worth recommending playing, but I changed my mind. Like I said, the attention to detail (in the graphics, mechanics, and story) is enrapturing. It's also more like work than a game but to see the story progress every once in awhile somehow makes it worth the work.

WORD OF ADVICE

Save the game. A lot. There is no warning when some negative unexpected thing  will happen that you are not given time to prepare for (e.g. -- the inability to bypass BTs in some regions, even with weapons and stealth).

Be prepared for an extremely long and very boring ending in which you will not be able to save or quit the game. For example, you will be forced to sit through -- not one -- but two identical closing credit scenes.

Due to all of the above, while I would recommend this game worth playing, it would most definitely be worth playing only once. There is absolutely no replay value in playing this game twice.",1689964343,1692038914,True,0,0,0.39945906400680542,0,True,False,False

Playing through it and getting 100% achievements again has only cemented it as one of my absolute favorites. There's nothing quite like Death Stranding, and there are very few games which have resonated with me personally as much as it has.

After getting it on steam and playing with the ps5 controller I really took the time to just enjoy the scenery and listen to the environment itself, it had me way more interested in the characters when you finally meet and talk with them, and really get to feel the pain that everyone goes through, the ending just got amplified with all the investment, and with the directors cut including a little additional mission that I do not want to spoil for anyone, it really has me hooked on for the next installment.

Oddly I would say this game is really good for my depression since It can make me feel like I am helping folks, and feel that certain connection, even when the game only has you physically interact with one or two people through the majority of the game.

Absolutely disgusting practice that should be made illegal by law.

Kojima has done it again, the story in this game is absolutely insane (in a bad way). I don't understand why this guy is still allowed to write anything at all. It starts off ok (I GUESS) but it reaches fever dream levels at an exponential rate as you are nearing the end. And oh boy is the ending 5 hours longer than it should be. Oh you thought you were done after [spoiler]defeating the OTHERWORDLY ENTITY THAT WANTS TO END THE UNIVERSE AND EVERYTHING IN IT?[/spoiler]. Nah, we're just getting started friend. Kojima is in charge and you're not getting off this train until you've watched his two feature length movies back to back starting right after you thought the game ended. And for the record, Kojima should be sent to horny jail for life (although some of those ""risque"" scenes were kinda funny I'll admit).

Gameplay is top notch and the only reason you should be playing a Kojima game, ever. If you agree with this statement disregard everything else I said and this review is now a thumbs up. You should definitely try this game as it does innovate in a lot of ways with fleshed out mechanics and cooperative world building that probably worked a lot better when more people were playing the game but is still impactful 2+ years after it was released (on PC). It feels  similar to MGS 5 in a lot of ways, and has a lot of gadgets of varying usefulness but always interesting in some way and easy to try out. Stacking boxes on your back made out of titanium and trying to manage terrain, horny enemies and a crying baby that WON'T SHUT UP as you're trying to cross a mountain range in the most horrendous snowstorm you've ever seen is absolutely glorious and the reason why I forgive all other transgressions in this game. Standing ovation on that front, Kojima has DONE IT AGAIN!

Did I mention this game is made by Hideo Kojima? Well in any case you will know. Many times. Sometimes more than once on the same screen. 

That is all.

Since I'd played the original Death Stranding already and did a lot of walking already, and I'd spent hours building up the road networks.  Once I started Death Stranding Director's Cut, as a player in the know, I made it my mission to start plopping down ziplines everywhere I was able.  As soon as I reached a new location, I had a zipline ready, and over time my zipline network grew until I could traverse the game up and down the map just zip zip ziplining.  It felt like cheating, but it was fun.

I feel like this opened up the game so much for me, and it was a lot of fun, for me personally, climbing to ridiculous locations only to plunk a zipline there and never have to walk there again.  And always laugh everytime I zipped past that difficult location, over and over again.  I love getting the warning that BT's are near, those spooky bastards!   But my zipline has zipped past them already, and I'm off to my delivery.  :D

Death Stranding is a walking simulator that lets you get rid of the walking, and just focus on the story and otherwise fulfilling the objectives in the most efficient and brief manner you are able.  With a well maintained zipline network, anything is possible.

Death Stranding Directors Cut adds a few cosmetic and quality of life upgrades over the original Death Stranding that are really helpful, and feel hard to believe they were left out, as they fit seamlessly and add so much to the overall experience.  In any case, if you don't want to be a zipline nerd like me, you could get a bike or a truck and do it the hard way, if you want.

To be honest I stopped follow it in probably a half of the game and I just skipped all cutscenes.

Apart from that world is kinda well made visually. Main job here is just being a courier in a little weird and destroyed world. All the time u will go somewhere with something. If u want do platin u will deliver tons of packages :) U can go just on foot, use some vehicles, build roads or build Zip-lines to fast travel. In game u can fight with BT and humans but it is boring as hell in both cases. MULEs have little better aim that storm troppers but they can be defeated very easily. BT's boss and his location looks nice but is boooring to fight. Game physics needs some improvements but well I saw worse. Many times I had problems with textures collision while driving vehicle.

What is truly annoying are the narrative parts that cannot be skipped, particularly irritating the second time around.

First i'll say its personal opinion based on several existing factors that enhanced my experience with this game. Being a writer myself i could understand fine narrative points made here, the greatness and uniqueness of characters, and unprecedented game-play. This game is not for everyone for sure. Its fine tuned for people with emotional maturity, wanderlust and general taste for great storytelling. Death Stranding has it all. As being a person who has wide array of interests in cinema, music, games especially i can say from artistic point of view this game is one of few pinnacles of gaming ever made. Funny how when you see the scope of human condition, man can reach of place of disappointment in what he knows, what he has seen and experienced, yet these 150+ hours spent on this game make it quite the opposite. This game has to be made if for nothing but to prove games can be art and probably best ones in the world atm, and also that life spent in gaming and imagining, experiencing all these different lives is not wasted, all the contrary.

Thank you Mister Hideo Kojima for making this absolute epic, emotional and mindfking masterpiece !!! My new TOP 1 apocalyptical pc game. It's a title that you will remember for years.

I expected nothing when i started playing this and got completely blown away.

In 2023 this game still looks and plays super nice and pretty, i can just recommend to play it. The Devs are even working on DS2. Just info, the game was even playable on my GTX 970.

People may tell you: ""THIS IS JUST A WALKING SIMULATOR""

Yes, the game starts with you WALKING in the wastelands. It's a destroyed world, what do you expect? You won't find any streets and cars in the early game. There is nothing than a beautiful, mindblowing LANDSCAPE. And you have to deliver a package to one of the last cities THROUGH this landscape. This is how the game starts. But you can't just RUSH with running forward or you will fall. The map is rocky, you have to control your feet, control your balance, control your stamina. Watch where you go. It's weird in the first minutes, yes. But when you understand the mechanic it's getting fun, fun, fun. 

And it's not just walking and running. The really good story will kick in very fast and THRILL the hell out of you. Horror elements blast in. Suddenly the rain is DANGEROUS. There are ""creatures"" coming for you. This is very weird, exciting and thrilling. 

The ongoing story will give you a main GOAL and many, many missions and places to get there. There are 14 chapters and even after the end you can continue playing and go back to see all the stuff you missed. Playing after the end even gives you new missions which tell you what happened to some story characters after the ending.

I recommend, DON'T RUSH THE STORY. Do the ""side missions"", try to max out everything that's between the story chapters and make this game last longer. Doing the side missions will give you the opportunity to upgrade new stuff.

Warning! The story is intentionally confusing. You won't understand what's going on directly from the beginning. But from chapter to chapter you will get the puzzle connected. And the story is super emotional, you will fight with tears. 
""Story"" is not just text or speech. They made a BIG MOVIE out of the story. That's super cool. The game switches between the ""movie story elements"" and the gameplay.

One more thing about ""WALKING SIMULATOR"":

In the early game you have to suffer! The game makes you suffer from walking. The game will throw DIRT at you. Yes, the player gets dirty like a car from a dirt race. But this feels GOOD. Because it's like real life. You have to WORK, SUFFER AND OVERCOME before reaching a goal and the goals after a hard way are the only ones that feel good. If it was easy, it was boring.

When you connect the first waystations into the network, other players structures and warning signs appear for you. Decide if you like them or delete them. Don't worry, if you delete another players stuff, it's just in your own game. The player will keep it and it will not be deleted for others. You can even BUILD OWN STRUCTURES into the world that others can use and like.

Following the story you find an electric MOTORBIKE. Yeah, what's a movie or pc game with Norman Reedus not having a bike?

The bike lets you forget the struggle and suffer from walking and climbing.

BUT

It's an electric bike. So you have to reload it. You can build ""charger structures"" all around the map. Or use the structures from other players. Build it smart or the bike will run out of energy and you strand in a hostile area.

And be careful! Your first bike is unique. If you wreck it, it's lost. And you have to walk again.

In the second open world map it gets even better. YOU CAN BUILD ROADS all around the map !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And following the storyline you can produce new bikes and use that roads. Even produce TRUCKS and load endless cargo.

Transporting cargo from place to place will stay a main part of the game, because you are an apocalyptic ""porter"" that carries cargo through the wasteland.

You will get many upgradeable stuff that will make your life easier like exoskelletons, new boots, weapons.

And yeah, there is not just ""dead"" landscape. In the wastelands you will find prepper stations, hostile human scavengers, beautiful destroyed places. And the most important things that even freak me out after 300 hours of gameplay. THE CREATURES. I call them creatures, because i don't want to spoiler.

Over all this game is a unique masterpiece.

One more thing that is supercool. In the second open world map you see a BIG, BIG mountain in the background. I thought this was just HDR decoration. No, it's not. More i won't tell :))

The most fun in the game was enjoying the story and building roads through the hostile landscape and after that, building a ZIP-LINE network what is the ultimative end game fun.

I might be biased though, I have transport autism. 

Long review: you play as Norman Reedus, who rides a motorbike in the post-apocalyptic US and the dead walk the earth. I'm sure I've seen that scenario before, but I can't remember where for the life of me.
Anyway.
It took me a number of years and a decent discount to finally try the latest ""Hideo Kojima Game™,"" mainly due to my severe disappointment toward MGSV (even more so considering how good Ground Zeroes was). I'm happy to report that this game, while having its own set of shortcomings, is far better than MGSV.

How could I describe the gameplay? Because you quite literally deliver stuff from one place to another, trying not to wreck your precious cargo while climbing up mountains or navigating around hostile entities.
This sounds a bit basic, and in a way, it is. Death Stranding is a walking simulator at heart, but it does that exceptionally well and the environment (based on Iceland and not the US) looks really good.
What makes the game different is the asymmetric multiplayer element. The game is entirely solo, but the world will get populated with other players' structures, signs, etc. Yours will also appear in the world of other players. It's not entirely different from Dark Souls' soapstone message system but more elaborate.
Interacting with other players' structures will give them ""likes"" that serve absolutely no purpose in the game but make you feel good about yourself, much like any social media. NPC also gives you like for successful deliveries, again to no benefit to you except for that sweet oxytocin which is one of the game's major plot points, albeit a silly one.

I want to point out that Death Stranding is the first game I've ever played where playing non-lethal made sense from a plot perspective. Not just to add achievements or to berate the players when they dare use the tools given to them (I'm looking at you, Dishonored). Simply said, in the world of Death Stranding, corpses create BT, dead who have returned from the other side. If those BTs grab a living person this causes a ""void out,"" a matter-antimatter annihilation. 
Obviously, you might want to avoid that sort of thing. So, if you kill people, you have to destroy their bodies by throwing them in an incinerator. It is seriously time-consuming and really not worth the hassle. Better to not kill people.
Most human enemies don't even care about you anyway, the Mules use non-lethal weapons and are just interested in your cargo. The terrorists or ""Demens"" are more inclined to shoot you dead, but that's a minor setback since the MC just respawns (yes, there is an actual reason for that).

Despite a decent combat system, there's not a lot of action in Death Stranding. 99% of your time will be spent delivering, rebuilding roads, and reconnecting the different settlements. Some planning is recommended to avoid unnecessary trouble along your delivery routes, but the tools at your disposal make it possible to solve those problems in a variety of ways. You must also look out for your stamina, which runs out very fast when lugging around a hundred kilos of crap, knee-deep in the snow. Don't fall asleep there, you might not wake up.
It's probably not a game for everyone, but it's gorgeous and relaxing, even on very hard, which is really not that hard.

Let's move on to the story part of Death Stranding. I'm sure most of you familiar with Hideo Kojima will know that he sees himself as a movie director and it's reflected in every one of his games. Death Stranding is no different and with over eleven hours of cutscenes, it's not a short movie either. To put that into perspective, that's the runtime of all the LoTR extended movies put together!
I won't spoil the story, that would be petty. Some have called it confusing, but I disagree with that. The game goes out of its way to be as painfully self-explanatory as possible, leaving no room for the imagination or for YouTubers, desperate for views, to make an hour-long video theorizing about some random plot point based on two lines of description on a useless object.
The pacing of that story is all over the place, though. First, it begins with a cardinal sin of writing: a long and somewhat tedious infodump supposed to give you a broad understanding of the world around you but never going into any detail, making it looks like the game throws out-of-context words at you for no reason but to make it sound smart and mysterious. Very much in the same vein as Hideaki Anno did with Evangelion, ""Boy, I love that old testament vibe! I have no idea what it actually speaks about or whatever meaning there is behind it, but I sure as hell love the aesthetic!""
That's about the first part of the game. Then the information trickles down more slowly when you reach the second (and main) map. So slowly in fact, that you might, at times, forget the story because you're too busy delivering tons of Prime packages to the locals.
At some point, you'll move forward with the story to the last and final map, where another hours-long explanation of all the game points occurs.

Said like that, it might sound horrendous, but the pacing of the story is really a mess. Regardless, I found the story endearing and the characters not as one-dimensional as they initially seemed. 
The story inspiration varies wildly, taking out on themes from The Postman (that's not a great start), Asimov's ""Cave of Steel"" and ""The Naked Sun,"" The Walking Dead (what a surprise), or Andrei Tarkovsky ""Stalker."" 
The universe is coherent with its inner mechanism and while I wouldn't say that my suspension of disbelief wasn't tickled from time to time, it's well-written and convincing.
The actors do a great job; Mads Mikkelsen, in particular, is really damn good in this, and so is Norman Reedus. Troy Baker's character steals the show every time he appears on screen, and he plays a great antagonist.
My biggest beef with the writing is how heavy-handed the metaphors are. All the characters' names are their literal description, there are constant references (or puns) to the concept of connection, binding, etc. And it feels incredibly forced.
There's also a bunch of cameos I could have done without, like the Dorito Pope and Generic Funny TV Man.

I could go on, but at the end of the day, it's just Kojima doing whatever the hell he felt like it and while it may be disjointed at time, Death Stranding has a lovely eery charm to it unlike any other game.",1690365525,1690365525,True,2,0,0.53947371244430542,0,True,False,False

STORY: the story is similar to Red Dead Redemption 2 in the sense that stuff does not pick up until chapter 4 (both in DS and RDR2) or so and really kicks into high gear nearing the end. The game immediately throws you into the worlds incredibly complex lore and background which is very confusing at first. However, as time goes on you start to understand it more and more. Once the story really kicks in, you understand why so many people adore this game. I won't spoil anything, but just trust me when I say that this game goes crazy. 

VOICE ACTING: Now, the voice acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Whilst the majority of the characters are well played. Some secondary characters and one or two main characters are missing some soul in there lines. However, the majority if the voice acting is great (My favorite is Higgs) and makes that characters that much believable

GAMEPLAY: The gameplay requires a certain player to be enjoyed. If you enjoy slow paced games where you get to appreciate and take in your surroundings (Elite Dangerous, American Truck Simulator, etc). You deliver packages over relitavely large distances (~10 minutes on average per delivery). I found this actually really enjoyable with the addition of BTs and MULEs as obstacles that you need to overcome in whatever way you please. Plus the music that randomly plays always puts a smile on my face (even if it is a sad song)

GRAPHICS: The game is pretty asf. The world is brimming with beauty, tall mountains, lushes green plains, large forest, I could go on. It's all gorgeous. However, I found that the optimisation left something to be desired. It's far from terrible but I found that the game stutters a lot when turning your camera and cutscenes make the games frames die.

CONCLUSION: There is no other game like death stranding. Whilst it isn't perfect, if you are intrigued, I highly recommend you give it a try (especially if you have played the games listed earlier). However, the game does start off with 2 hours worth of cut scenes so refund it doesn't exactly workout too well because you have yet to actually discover most of what the game has to offer. But to get back to the point, this game is great. I find it to be on par with RDR2 in terms of story and graphics and I highly recommend it.

Gameplay (Post-finishing the story/going for 100%) 4/10

This game definitely isn't for everyone. It's basically a way, way, way too long walking simulator with 10 minute TV episodes in-between. I really should have wrote this when I finished the story instead of waiting until I 100% it because I really don't have the patience or energy left to be long winded. 

The game-play was really at first and this game does an amazing job of never running out of upgrades to give you. The chiral bandwidth is extremely stupid. Basically you have a certain amount of ""bandwidth"" to be able to make structures and they cost different amounts and you get more by connecting new people to the network and leveling up your status with people but the number is complete bs. It's like when you get a new hard-drive for your pc and its 1tb and you install it and it says 935gb or when your phone is 128gb but your OS takes up like 50gb. I swear the chiral bandwidth is like 65-75% fake and you really only get 25-35%. Also I swear half way through the game all the controls completely changed how responsive they are. For the first like 40 hrs all the vehicles and sam would stop when you press S to ""apply the brakes"" but after that 40 hrs there just are no brakes. When you pull into a distro center on a bike and stop pressing W and hold S the bike will, I kid you not, slide at least 50-75 ft to the back of the distro center to the point where I literally, for the rest of the game (~107hrs), had to just crash the bike into the wall near the terminal in order to stop it. Also, while it is incredible that you can open the map and look at a structure and hold a button to dismantle that structure and get that bandwidth back, there should have been a button to delete all your structures because at the end of the game I only had the First Prepper and the Veteran Porter left and I couldn't scrounge up enough bandwidth to make a zip-line system to get to them nicely. 

ALSO SPEAKING OF ZIPLINES. WHY IS THERE NOT A WAY TO PLOT A COURSE ACROSS SEVERAL ZIPLINES AND THEN ENGAGE INSTED OF GOING 300 METERS TO 死亡搁浅'S ZIP-LINE BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY SEE 1 ZIPLINE OUT FROM THE ONE YOU'RE ON AND I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH ONE GOES WHERE I WANT. OR WHY CANT YOU, WHEN BUILDING THEM, SET THEM UP AS A CONTINUAL PATH SO YOU CAN GO FROM PREPPER TO PREPPER, I PROBABLY WASTED LIKE 30 MINUTES ZIPPING TO THE WRONG LINES.

ALSO. WHY CANT YOU SKIP THE CUT-SCENE OF BB'S LITTLE ARM THINGY ALERTING TO THE BTS. THE GAME ALREADY DID THE SLO MO THING. I KNOW THERE'S F*****G BTS NEAR BY. IT'S F*****G RAINING. OF COURSE THERE'S F*****G BTS NEARBY. I PROBABLY ACTUALLY LITERALLY REALLY WASTED AT LEAST 6 HOURS JUST IN SEEING THAT CUT-SCENE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER <that's literally how long the cut-scene is, the time to read my ""over and over""'s is how long the cut-scene is.

Also they do give you a lot of upgrades and unlocks over time but some stuff is completely useless like the floating cart thing. They should have given that thing early on before vehicles because it's literally obsolete as soon as you get it. And for the directors cut the bot that walks along with you cant keep up with a vehicle so why in the world wouldn't you just take a truck. Also nothing in the entire game compares too the value of a truck long-range level 3. Like you can hold more packages than Amazon movies in a month and with the battery you can literally cross the whole map without roads with like 1 or 2 pcc lvl 2's.

The graphics are next level. The music is well done early on but I don't like a lot of the later songs.

I never like Amalie or Bridget and man I hate them, her, what-ever, by the end. I couldn't get a read on Cliff till the end but when Bridget killed him and only regretted hitting BB, Sam, what-ever, I felt more disgust than I ever have in my life. And when Cliff actually acknowledged Sam and recognized him as his son I cried which made my anger and disgust for Bridget even worse.

I really enjoyed the mystery of the war sections with Cliff and Mads Mikkelsen's performance in general. I really enjoyed the stuff with Deadman and the friendship you grow with him over the game. I also really liked the story of Cliff and Die-hardman's past together. This story was really really good but I really should have wrote this before playing like another 60 hours past beating it.

I really liked the stuff with Higgs, ESPECIALLY the boss fight against his Giganto-BT but over-all I feel like he was EXTREMELY underutilized. I love Troy Baker (I've only seen him in COD Advanced Warfare and Uncharted 4. I haven't played The Last of Us yet.) and I feel like he's got amazing potential, especially in a game like this, but I feel like when it came down too it he came and went way too fast and was not explored almost at all. I know there's like 47 million interviews from him and about him but after playing 147 hrs for 100% i am not about to read 86 interviews and read between the lines too put his story together when this game has such good cut-scenes and story telling.

I know why people think this game is boring and they are justified.

I've played Kojima games even since fairly young, so I'm used to the personal touch he does with his brand. He loves movies, styling an entire game like it's a cinematic masterpiece. This can especially be seen in cutscenes for how long and drawn-out they can be to fully experienced. These are some of Kojima's strongest expressions of his games and are some of the landmarks he makes while he paints in this artistic, realistic, empathetic to the player.
So why do people find this game boring? It's a Kojima game.
Well, as very experienced with his writing and style, I can say the main issue seems like the faults he made with MGS4 while new issues of misunderstanding game philosophy.

To make it simple, Kojima goes complex even when it comes to gameplay and interactivity. I can't tell you how I felt the first time playing MGS4 and had to use a back compression because I'm old and have back muscle pains from crouching too much. However, the trivial addition and the role it plays as a core gameplay loop combined with all the other trivial ideas was slightly annoying. This is kinda here in Death Stranding, but Kojima had the titanium nuts to experiment with a game where the core gameplay isn't stealth or combat, but a style of gameplay that no other game has while keeping trivial maintenance details.
And it's empty.
There's an insane amount of not explained (which is good) exposition as you start the story with extremely long, drawn out, and obviously the fantastic Kojima style of repetition in cutscenes and gameplay as we begin. Which is sad, because the gameplay is thoroughly about traversal and exploring feels awful when I have to have my hand held for... hours. I'm still in the ""tutorial"" area of the game as the game slowly drip-feeds me mechanics and information and being absolutely heavy handed about this.
Let me be clear.
It is absolutely unnecessary to spend what felt like a full hour OR MORE of cutscenes or monorailed cinematic gameplay to tell me what my purpose to do in the game from now on will be. Atleast in the way it was done. There's atleast three big cutscenes that tells you about this, and then I was thoroughly annoyed when a specific dream sequence furthers this. It doesn't help that, through this whole time, the most engagement I had with my controller was holding the toggle stick forward. I got it the first time and was annoyed my time was being wasted for this lengthy cinematic view of what I already know bashed over the head by narrative and tutorial boxes on the most simplistic of things very slowly. The story is amazing and all the elements it does very well to NOT explain to you easily is perfect. I wish to be treated as an adult who is paying attention rather than being reminded either of the main story concepts of ""Travel to the West"". Or in the game when a cutscene, the tutorial tooltip, and two narrative characters explain and tell me how to do an extremely basic task like using the shower. The shower explanation had to have been... what... fifteen minutes by itself? Some sort of unnecessary time where just a button prompt to shower would be fine enough after quickly being told it.

Older Kojima titles drop you with a variety of tools and, although the same sort of over-explaining and cutscenes there are, the concept actually feels warranted as you have a lot you can possibly use to deal with the variety of moving from Point A to Point B. This is my main argument for why I think people are justified in feeling that this game is boring. Although it grows slightly better over time, a majority of your first hours with this are Holding Forward to move and clicking two buttons to balance either to the right or the left. The enviroment itself, although beautiful, is also extremely basic and flat and can be described as rocky moss features of uneven terrain with some rivers. Interesting, but there could have been more complexity to make the feeling of traversal more engaging gameplay wise.
I was fine with it at first, but so far this fundamentally has stayed the same. Features like caves, buildings, or really anything could have added some flair to the beginning and reasons for having reasonably simple tools to make traveling more fun and less like the feeling of using your movement and balance keys to go to a place while learning not to fall and drop/break all your shit. What finally irritated me was when I came across my first invisible wall early on in the guise of a ""Can't Construct Here Zone"". My only real tools are grappling ropes and ladders and already I have my creativity stunted by a complex invisible rail which dreadfully reminded me that my hand must be held as I can go through the, although extremely wide area, the area I am designated to have to move through. So not ONLY am I wasting my time just walking around, but the very moment that I am given tools to make traversal more interesting is suddenly when the game design tells me it's stunted. Boo. 

I have been asked to accept an extremely hard sell of this game as it repeatedly beats me over the head in reminders of both narrative, which is more interesting the slower it is explained, and gameplay that is too basic for insisting on every aspect to tell me in ten different ways how to do something extremely simple whether that be walking forward or putting down a sci-fi mailbox. You get some mech legs and a motor bike after awhile, but the flat land is broken up just enough where the actual use of the bike feels pretty limiting as I spent more time slowly rounding rocks rather than enjoying the breeze through my hair. The mech legs is really just upgrades your carrying capacity and you have to pay attention to the battery; that's it. The fact it takes a couple hours just to get your first traveling tools like the ladders made the beginning even more of a slog and the fault of this is mostly how unnecessarily long the cutscenes are. Which, I should mention, other games of Kojima have pretty long cutscenes but they have a lot of reason, purpose, and the talking always seem to serve to something important to explain an overly-complex plot which I enjoyed but it seemed here, since the charm is the weirdness and foreign world being slowly explained, that very simple story beats took dreadfully long to spoon feed to you which feels pretty hypocritical. [spoiler] To best explain this, the story trusts you enough to barely explain why concepts like babies in jars help you with ghosts or why dead bodies explode like nukes but feels it MUST explain what Bridges is and how American it is, how you must travel West to save your sister, and constantly stating that the world sucks as if you already weren't aware of this fact and it will be sure to constantly say this for the first few hours. [/spoiler] Lengthy amounts of words with long dramatic shots doesn't make something ""good"" and a majority of it feels completely unwarranted as well as unwanted but it also feels too important to skip incase you miss an important detail. 

tl;dr
This is a great game narrative wise and extremely unique if you like this kind of thing. If you were looking for a hiking simulator that has you delivery packages and mail, than this is the game and the only one that does it. It's a slow, relaxing, and enjoyable build as you walk through an American wasteland lost to time and the absolutely absurd strangeness of a dystopian world metaphorically related to a world Post-COVID. What holds it back is the most Kojima he's ever Kojima'd, in both his best and worst stereotypes, is doubled-downed here on an experimental gameplay loop that severely needed compensation to make it entertaining while also trusting a player, in design and literal writing, to play the game themselves which feels dreadful when the gameplay feels dramatically less complex being mostly inventory management.",1687129117,1689821815,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I picked up Death Stranding on a pretty stressful time in my life and I have to say this game came in like a breeze of fresh air. It's incredible how Kojima manages to generate an incredible feeling on the player while he is just simply walking around the world. Yes, I love walking around and taking in the landscapes.
It's delightful how you feel that you are doing something important and out of the blue a song just starts playing reinforcing that feeling u were having, I love how the atmosphere is incredibly well thoughtout, you truly feel that the world is fucked and anything can be a problem, sometimes you even feel like the game is scary themed more than anything else but the thing that I take with me in Death Stranding is that you can deliver cargo in so many diferents ways that it blows my mind and while you progress through the story thinking that this cannot get any more creative, well yeah you guess it right, Kojima does it again.

Positives - 

-Story
-Graphics / Visuals
-Overall Quality
-Intricacy / Overall depth


Negatives - 

-BT encounters get pretty repetitive. They end up becoming more of a nuisance, a roadblock to slow down your delivery. Unlocking the ability to cut cords does make it more fun, but still, their encounters are too frequent.

-MULEs and terrorist encounters are usually boring and too frequent.

-For the last chunk of the game, you are forced to deliver and trudge through snowy mountains. It's slow, boring, and the permanent snowfall means your packages are sure to need constant repairs. This section is annoying and really disservices the game.

I remember when Death Stranding (DS) was released for the PS4. After months of seeing weird post-apocalyptic videos featuring Mads Mikkelsen, Norman Reedus, and Guillermo del Toro, the resultant product was that of a so-called “walking simulator.” For fans of the Metal Gear series, it was assumed that Mr. Kojima would pull a tactic that had been pulled before and bamboozle anxious gamers with DS being a new installment of the Metal Gear franchise. No bamboozle was to be had; DS is its own game, set within its own universe, albeit with some easter eggs that remind us that DS is connected with Mr. Kojima’s love of music, film, and (again) seemingly benign minutia as much as it is connected to his past work. Prior to reviewing DSDC, I had never played DS on the PS4, PC, or even DSDC on the PS5. I had avoided all spoilers for almost three years so I could be surprised by what Mr. Kojima had to offer; I loved being surprised in Metal Gear Solid 4 (MGSIV) and 5 (MGSV), so I needed the bamboozle once again. Please, Mr. Kojima, please continue to bamboozle us.

To simply call DSDC a “walking simulator” or a “delivery simulator” would be entirely unfair to the depth DSDC takes to immerse the player into the world of the United Cities of America (UCA). If I was to agree with the flawed notion of DSDC being a “walking simulator,” then Breath of the Wild and Horizon Forbidden West are to be classified as that, too. Sure, you are tasked with getting from point A to point B, but how you get there and when are entirely up to you. Once you break your assumptions of what you think you need to get from point A to point B, you can start to experiment with gameplay mechanics that range from svelte and efficient to downright silly. At that point, DSDC becomes just as much of a deep third-person open world game just as much as BotW and HFW. But again, you need to break yourself of specific gameplay habits that have been beaten into your consciousness by derivative gameplay installments you may have encountered in the past few years.

Death Stranding‘s storytelling follows the Hideo Kojima method of worldbuilding with minor adjustments: Expect a lot thrown at you at once at multiple points throughout your time playing. My first time playing MGSIV, I was stunned to encounter 30minute long cutscenes that went into excruciating detail for seemingly benign plot elements, only for these elements to reappear as a plot twist further down the line. I remember folding laundry during one of these cutscenes as a high school student. Prior reviewers of this game have criticized the story as being too frontloaded AND backloaded. I don’t necessarily agree with these perspectives because they don’t get at the root cause of so much plot occurring simultaneously at the beginning AND the end of Death Stranding: Death Stranding‘s “midgame” plot occurs deep within the menus of Sam Porter Bridges’ cufflinks.

DSDC presents you with an illusion of isolation as you trek across the nation with your BB (bridge baby) strapped to your chest. Norman Reedus’ Sam Porter Bridges is just as much disconnected as his world, yet his journey forces him (and you) to connect to others in ways that seem unimaginable and unpredictable. Simply adding a ladder on a hill makes it easier for you AND other players to get to your destination and find others, and you may find yourself going hours out of your way to become the world’s best road worker. In no way is this required of you to dedicate that much time to navigate the world, but…how you choose to utilize your tools to make the world easier to explore will impact others, and their worldbuilding will impact your experience, too.

Other than the cosmetic and fanservice content, DSDC offers additional elements that are mindful of players’ time and add creativity to how you make deliveries. First on the list is Cargo Catapults, which are large stationary guns that can literally shoot your cargo across the map and allow you to remote control where that cargo goes. If you want to avoid investing playtime into building roads, then catapults may be the way to go to get the larger deliveries to the more disparate regions of the UCA. Ziplines have been given additional buffs, too, in that you can now bring your floating carriers along as you zip across large vertical and horizontal stretches of land. I personally loved using ziplines in the mountainous region (you’ll know what I mean when you get there), as I was able to make deliveries and complete quests in a matter of minutes. Also unique to DSDC is a racing mode that offers a fun little diversion for those tired of rebuilding the UCA.

Combat has been upgraded and given more attention in DSDC. No longer are you confined with stiff melee combos that occasionally fail against human enemies. Now, you can equip gloves that make your punches more agile. You can dropkick enemies. And, if you’re struggling with using the guns at first (especially the Maser Gun, another DSDC addition), you have a shooting range and set of tutorials and drills to walk you through how to best use these weapons to their fullest extent. All of these additions are helpful for the player and give you an easier time with some of the learning curves of DSDC‘s combat.

DSDC offers eight additional tracks to DS‘s already phenomenal soundtrack. Kojima’s appreciation of Low Roar adds to the desolate nature of the world, and these additional tracks are no different in being perfectly fit for the DS universe. It’s very rare for a game to trigger goosebumps on my skin like DSDC‘s song selection, and DSDC features several goosebump-inducing musical moments in the story where the music ever-so-gently fades in while you travel about. One of my few gripes is that the only place you can select music to play is in a private room while Sam takes a break. Unlike MGSV that allowed you to play music freely as you explored, you’re limited to the ambient soundtrack of DS (which is pretty good, don’t worry) and the occasional Low Roar song as you complete a story-related quest. I would have loved to listen to the songs in their entirety as I drove through the game on the roads I built. I miss MGSV‘s cassette player quite a bit.

I’ve spent 120 hours playing DSDC for this review, and I can very easily say that DSDC is absolutely fantastic…for those who haven’t played DS before as well as those who have invested a hot minute into DS and want more. For the casual player, I find it slightly difficult to recommend them to pay to upgrade to the Director’s Cut. Despite the gameplay improvements, combat improvements, graphical improvements and flexibility, and so much more, I find DSDC to be more appealing for those like me who can find themselves immersing themselves into Mr. Kojima’s vision of a disconnected and near-apocalyptic America. DSDC is the DS that is meant to be played by those who are able to defy gameplay routines that we take for granted.

At its core, Death Stranding: Director’s Cut is an inventory management game. The more you play, the more freedom you have to do things with that inventory. You can help others. You can hurt others. You can save citizens. You can kill them. You can grow your world. You can destroy it. Regardless of your decision, DSDC is a game unlike others in that your assumptions about core gameplay loops and storytelling are pushed aside in favor of exploring a disconnected future. For those who have yet to play DS, DSDC is clearly the iteration of DS that is worthy of your time given its iterations that are increasingly respectful of your time and patience while also giving you additional creative outlets to muck about. For those of you who were unable to get hooked into this game, then DSDC may not be the answer you seek in a cinematic experience. Give it a shot, though; I’d love to be proven wrong.",1689619974,1689619974,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The story is original. Weird, but I liked how it came together. I really liked the main theme and how it's interwoven with the gameplay. I love extensive lore. Trying to explain the plot to non-gamers is fantastic.

I think some characters could have been more relatable and less stiff. And the locations could have been more diverse. And I wish there was more to do in the world itself. But it suits the story. No dealbreakers for me.

If you are a sceptic give it a chance you have to actually experience it to believe. The vistas, music, subtle game mechanics, challenging environments and yours and others ability to change to world around you come together to make a game that stands out amongst the rest.

Beautiful rocky mountainous landscapes too. But a ludicrously stupid set of tasks - including delivering lost parcels for 'likes'. Lots of darkness - oil-covered corpses pulling one down, oil-covered seas and oil-covered dying marine life. A world of strange bedfellows, but what an anticlimax to be just delivering parcels for 'likes'. The banality of evil. In practical terms there are a huge set of controls which nobody but a complete anorak could remember. 

All of which adds up to a pretty disturbing game which I cannot ken the reason for playing. I dont have the patience to spend hundreds of hours fathoming the logic/backstory. 

At the back of my mind is that global warming is going to deliver death, starvation, random murder, parcel delivery, oil-coverd corpses and empty cities soon enough. All in bizzarre, Jumanji style. Lamborghinis and Ferraris of dead people at the bottom of chalk cliffs, a field full of dead and dying Flamingoes, hyeenas and Gollum-like humans searching the endless tailbacks of burned-out cars on motorways. Death Stranding is just a stylised imitation of what we are going to be facing soon enough. Only the game has a bit of tech added. Tech that didnt prevent the game's dystopian world from evolving, and which isnt going to offer a solution to a better world either. Like the stupid phone that has grown into our hands which has enslaved us. We are stranded on a dying planet - a death stranding - in actual reality. This game just reminds me of the nightmare unfolding right now before our complacent, somnolent eyes.

Certain segments seemed utterly nonsensical. However, in a world steeped in such ambiguity, perhaps it's excusable. Having experienced prior Kojima games, this one feels like the most quintessential Kojima yet. I felt as though the plot was reminiscent of an art-house piece favoring style over substance, and emotions over rationality. This is not to say I didn't enjoy it; the game is sprinkled with several poignant moments that truly stand out.

The gameplay caught me off guard in a pleasant way. Initially, I was put off by the first mission but decided to revisit it later. As I continued playing, I noticed the missions' journey aspect gradually decreased in difficulty within the context of the world. This was primarily due to unlocking new equipment like bikes, enhancing the overall gameplay experience.

The game's social aspect was particularly intriguing. I found myself willingly taking extensive detours just to construct a road that would aid both myself and others. It felt like Elden Ring's note system elevated to an unprecedented level, with new structures and pathways all collaboratively built by players.

The presentation is, quite simply, stunning. Playing as Sam is a tactile treat, with each step and stumble meticulously rendered. The game mirrors your emotional highs and lows, ranging from the elation of completing a strenuous journey to the dread of trudging through muck and the frustration of a misstep causing a tumble, resulting in your cargo scattering. While the sound design and music are excellent, my only complaint is that the player is not allowed to play music at will, but only in specific rooms where the primary activities are reading emails and interviews, along with taking care of Sam.

The combat, in my opinion, isn't the strongest part of the game, but it thematically aligns with the protagonist's role as a porter rather than a soldier. Nevertheless, it felt somewhat clumsy to me.

In conclusion, Death Stranding offered a unique experience that I'm glad to have embarked upon. Its value lies in its unwavering dedication to a singular vision, despite the frustrations I encountered. Even after putting down the controller, I find myself mulling over the events of the game.

Okay, so Hideo Kojima came up with this ""all players are connected with rope/threads"" and lemme tell ya, I have never experienced a more motivated and helpful community in all my 28 years... I started a type of zip-line highway from the start of the second map ALL the way to the END of the map and I kept going and going with these zip-lines using other people's zip-lines from the highest mountains to the most dangerous BT areas throughout the entire game. INCLUDING small outposts. All connected... I later found out in the midst of fabricating these zip-lines, that people are helping me, incredibly! 

We made a highway ALLLLL the way from start to finish, which made the whole ""last journey"" last a little over 10 minutes... IF THAT. (I did not time it). People were giving me resources to create these things, and others were creating bunkers along the lines (a majority of them) and then after a bit under 24 hours, I came back and it was ALMOST all done. I had to add the last 8'ish lines and that was it! I spent over a day IRL (I think?) making all the lines overall...

Hideo Kojima is a genius, he KNEW that we would try doing this and we did, making everyone's journey safer and fast in game. 

And you know what, I bought the directors cut just to do it again, however unsuccessfully... lol, but that just gives me more of an incentive to do it all by myself. I love this game and I cant get enough of the story, the lore, the everything.

Get the game, unless you hate walking LOL. I dont expect you to experience the game the way I did the first time, BUT there is nothing wrong with working as hard as you can making something that helps others including yourself along the road...

It is definitely a polarising game - it is not everyone's cup of tea. But boy is it a great story - albeit convoluted in a way we have gotten to expect from Kojima by now. It's something of a slow game most of the time but the Walking Simulator 2019 memes are a caricature, the gameplay is much deeper than that. The soundtrack fits in well. There are a ton of ways to play the game that don't immediately become apparent, but discovering it is satisfying.

Only downside is that the Director's Cut is heavier on the system requirements than the original (which sadly has been taken down from the Steam Store). Framerates are lower on weaker PCs when demanding similar graphical quality (e.g. on my previous 1050 Ti, which did the original on 55-60fps, while the DC ran at 30-45fps with a really garish look), but it is well-optimised for more recent cards such as the RX 6800 XT I use, which runs it at a stable 60fps on maximum.

Other than that, solid buy. I took 128 hours to get to 100% achievements in the original version. Finishing the storyline for the first time took me something like 60 hours, so the game is a very good value for money proposition. I would suggest setting difficulty to hard on first playthrough, because 'normal' feels way too easy.

the gameplay for the first dozen hours is walking back and forth from the same couple of locations, while a near incomprehensible story is revealed to you. +the world is incredibly beautiful and interesting, the gameplay is in depth, and strategizing the perfect route to your next location is incredibly fun

if that doesnt sound interesting, then this game might not be for you.

as the game goes on, you learn more about the world through lore tidbits and emails in the game. you unlock new ways of transportation (vehicles, ziplines, catapults, etc.)

now is a good time to mention theres a sort of building mechanic in the game where you can place things like bridges, vehicle charges, and so on. if youre connected to the internet when you play, you can see other player's structures and use them.

MINOR SPOILER: [spoiler]new areas will be unlocked as well, and youll eventually gain the ability to fast travel from area to area. you cant fast travel with packages[/spoiler]

theres some questionable dialogue and story beats, but overall, the game tells some very interesting and even emotional stories through a large cast of characters.

the final ""act"" of the game, the last couple of chapters, are INCREDIBLY story heavy and is almost like an entire movie of cutscenes. its a hideo kojima game, so.

CONCLUSION: if you like weird story games, vast open worlds, traveling, minor strategy, then this game is for you.

if you dont like weird story games, repetition, long experiences, then you should probably skip it

HIGHLIGHTS: the online feature where you can see other player's structures is incredibly useful and makes the game much more playable. the soundtrack is nothing short of perfect. playing as Norman Reedus. BB.",1687895054,1687895054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Graphics are lovely and I had no problem running the game.
-Loved the songs they had in there and the voice acting was great.

Negative:
-Game physics/movement is pretty trash. Woulda been more consistent if it had just been ragdoll at this point.
-UI is pretty trash. Looks cool and all but the fact that you can't just hit escape or something in order to save and quit the game? You have to be at a part where you can access your cuff or a terminal. Hella annoying and frustrating when I'm trying to get off the game but can't find the right time where it allows me to save and quit.
-Super interesting premise but the execution, at least as far as I got (finished the prologue and chapter 1) was mediocre. Feels like it's 80% cutscenes and only 20% actual gameplay. With the amount of time spent in cutscenes you would think that they could explain things better... And you would be wrong. Here and there they give some useful information, but I'm three hours in and I can only understand about half of what they're talking about. Maybe they chose to give less information to make it mysterious or something to look forward to, I don't know, but it was a bad decision in my opinion.

TLDR;
Even with an interesting premise, the endless cutscenes make it feel about as fun as watching paint dry. Don't recommend unless you have hella patience and even then I can't guarantee much.

Based on common discussion about Death Stranding found out there in the internet I'd like to help you figure out if you should play or not. It is important to notice that this review is a review from a player that loves the game as I am a LoLoLx540 porter:

[b] 1) Is this game a walking simulator? [/b] Stop wasting your time with this question. If it is a good game it doesn't matter. It is a good game.

[b] 2) Stop falling [/b] Some bad reviews includes people complaining about falling and I have watched many streamers falling a lot. That creates great frustration and some players start attacking the game overall out of frustration. I noticed it is common for many players to come to Death Stranding expecting the standard action experience, combat and bang bang and they just come to fall to the ground. They expect to run the map like many games and they expect the same action. Well that is a recipe for great frustration. Think of any game, if you fail the main objective you may get upset, if you keep failing you will get frustrated. Imagine playing something like Overwatch or Counter Strike and you only die. In Death Stranding [b] falling is failing [/b] and the action comes in another way. Stop falling, stop failing. Protect you precious cargo, think about how to not fall, explore the tools the game gives you to achieve that. Then you will maybe start to enjoy the work of a porter.

[b] 3) Give the game a second chance [/b] Death Stranding is not easy to digest... at first. Just search in the web ""Death Stranding second chance"" You will see many people glad that they gave the game a second chance. It is very interesting. So if you already have the game and quit it, give it a second chance. Death Stranding breaks the usual, give it some time and then come back, you will probably be able to enjoy it better then. 

[b] Complains that the game stalls / I am 50h in the first area [/b] I would say that Death Stranding post game content is somehow available since start. So it is possible for a player to play a lot without any progress towards the story. Relax, you can focus on main story deliveries with no worries about missing content. [b] Death Stranding post game content allows you to do everything [/b].

---------------

Maybe this really isn't for you, not everybody was born to become a porter. But since it is not a trivial game from start, I gave you some tools I think might be able to help you enjoy it like I do.

[b] Technical) [/b] The game runs really well. I have experienced no glitches and no crashes. Ultra-wide support.

Take care porters. Don't fall.",1687443872,1687443872,True,12,1,0.622644424438476563,0,True,False,False

[b]Let me start by saying that Death Stranding blew my mind in ways I never expected.[/b] To me, this is a game that I was afraid of playing out of fear that it would disappoint. But it's precisely what it's hyped up to be, and the story is a masterpiece.

Hideo Kojima and the folks at Kojima Productions have created something truly extraordinary. This game is a refreshing departure from the usual cookie-cutter titles we see these days far too often, and it's a testament to Kojima's unrivaled creativity and the talent of the development team.

From the moment I stepped into Death Stranding's post-apocalyptic world, I was captivated by its stunning visuals. The attention to detail is mind-boggling, and each landscape feels like a work of art. It's a world that's simultaneously familiar and strange, drawing you in with its [u]haunting beauty[/u].

What sets Death Stranding apart is its unique gameplay mechanics. You're not just playing a game; you're part of an experience that explores the power of human connection. As Sam Porter Bridges, you're tasked with reconnecting isolated communities and rebuilding what has been lost. With every delivery made and every connection forged, you feel a sense of accomplishment and a reminder of the importance of collaboration.

The story of Death Stranding is an intricate tapestry of hope and despair. It's filled with complex characters and philosophical ideas that left me pondering long after I put down the controller. The performances by the cast, including Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen, are outstanding, bringing these characters to life with depth and emotion.

The gameplay itself is a triumph. Traversing the terrain, managing resources, and outsmarting otherworldly threats are all part of the challenge. The weight of Sam's burden is palpable, and every decision feels meaningful. It's a game that demands your attention and rewards careful thinking.

But Death Stranding is not just about gameplay; it's an audiovisual feast. The haunting soundtrack by Ludvig Forssell perfectly complements the atmosphere, and the voice acting is top-notch. The combination of visuals, sound, and storytelling creates an immersive experience that stays with you.

In a world where games are often judged solely on their popularity or mainstream appeal, Death Stranding stands out as a work of art. It's a game that pushes the boundaries of what's possible and challenges you to think differently. It's an experience that will leave you in awe and spark conversations with fellow gamers.

I can't recommend Death Stranding enough. If you're looking for a game that offers a unique and thought-provoking journey, this is it. Hideo Kojima and the team at Kojima Productions have created something truly special—a game that redefines what video games can be and leaves a lasting impact. Don't miss out on this incredible adventure.",1685535648,1687431160,True,0,0,0.488599330186843872,0,True,False,False

Every aspect, the story, the missions, the random characters with ridiculous names, they all come together to form an experience that feels extremely human. Kojima's games all share this theme of humanity, you can feel the love put into everything from the environments to the easter-eggs.

It's like strutting into an actual taqueria and throwing a hissy fit because they only do street tacos with tender slices of steak and not white people taco night ground beef tacos. 

Whinging about Death Stranding being weird and ""a walking simulator"" is the game equivalent of going to a movie screening for a funky auteur filmmaker and complaining John Cena isn't in them. That person is fundamentally in the wrong place, and that's entirely on them, not the movie. 

Death Stranding is a gorgeous game that very much relies on you having watched enough anime to develop that ""let him cook"" instinct. Everything makes very little sense. There's a lot of vocab words being thrown around, and it's clear they will be explained EVENTUALLY, but you gotta eat your vegetables an be a little confused for it to pay off. If you can handle Neon Genesis: Evangelion, you'll be fine with Death Stranding. 

For those who have their grown-up pants on and enjoy actually thinking about themes and enjoying beautiful landscapes that still impress four years later, the opening ten hours of Death Stranding are a phenomenal trip and really make you earn that transition from helpless Normal Reedus walking around trying not to die to the fully decked-out Metal Gear Solid V-esque endgame where you have more weapons than you know what you'll do with and the narrative gets INSANE. 

Hideo Kojima is the master of subtext that's so brazen it's basically just text. This is absolutely a game made by a man who has been interested in world politics since his 20s trying to come to terms with with what the Trump administration looks like from the outside looking in. 

Death Stranding is a game custom designed to piss off everyone who missed the blatant politics of Metal Gear Solid and say they dislike MGS2 ""because Raiden sucks"" because they dare not internalize the fact the game held up a mirror to politics and individualism in a way that stung. 

Also: the game runs butter smooth on my RTX 3050, a relatively low-grade card. The majority of people complaining about poor performance don't mention their specs, which is a huge red flag that maybe, just maybe, they're using super old unsupported chipsets and aren't considering this fact.",1687228219,1687228333,True,1,0,0.449499547481536865,0,True,False,False

The exploratory feel and the beautiful environments, hook you and delivering becomes a gratification. As the story progresses, new abilities are revealed thus keeping the interest. Its very addicting and i have spent some 60hrs, on chapter 5 now, easy recommendation. 

That is not to say it has shortcomings, if there are any devs here here are my critiques ...

1)  Sam movement - terrible on PC  !!! Sam just keeps running like a retard in some random direction. The walking speed movement has some crazy logic. When key is released can he just come to a stop, why he has to keep running like a zombie ? Most basic thing overlooked and this is the biggest flaw of the game that is super annoying. 

2) Cut scenes - just play once the first time only, don't need to see the same over and over again.   This is the second biggest flaw of the game and gets on my nerves. 

The same repetitive dialogue as well when delivering and post delivery. 

3) Animations - some of the animations are ok, but bland otherwise. The road builder animation looks like cracked cake. 

Recycle cut scene is the most boring nonsense. Why president has to congratulate for recycling  ?
The recycling action can be a conveyor belt going into a recycle device, not the presidents face, poor choice. Show me actual recycling.

When inspecting good delivered - show the animation of the goods as well.

4) Camera fov is narrow when interacting at close range.

5)  Inventory management UI - keep left side for vehicles, right for Sam, that way scroll down is cut short. 
Show max weight and available weight for vehicle capacity.
Recycle can be a default option when choosing an action for item, rather than exiting and selecting recycle exclusively. 

6) Vehicles Movement - not good, always tends to hit something esp when turning, not fluid. 
When turning in steep slopes tends larger trucks tend to loose control compared to bikes. 
Make trucks faster - they are too slow

7) Ability to save anywhere, not checkpoints. 

8) Mission menu - sometimes the mouse works, but is lost and have to use keyboard fix it. 
If i want to cancel the mission, i have to do it step by step backwards, why cant they provide an instant way to return back to main selection ?

9) Map view - so many cluttered items the mouse keeps snapping and cannot focus on items on map. 

10) Guns - keep the same gun, just upgrade it instead of new version. 

11) Music - most boring dull music selection, also please add seek feature with a transport slider. lack of which I didn't bother previewing any tracks.

12) Show actual people, not just hologram interactions. I want folks to come out of their bunker and be excited. This only happened once during the junk dealer romance mission. 

13) Make the bridges locations unique, not the same model copy paste rotated. 

14) Fix the weapons aiming system, the focusing is clunky. 

15) In the middle of combat BB bar goes red, its not practical to soothe BB in the middle of combat. Breaks the immersion. BB is okay with throwing hematic grenades but not shooting ? 

16) Sam should be able to walk in water and not float around like a toy balloon. 

17) Weapons also should be provided protective cover against timefall like the pouch.

17) Ability to build temporary sheds to park vehicles for protection against timefall. I don't want to waste time in a garage just to repair timefall damage. 

18) Side Missions - exclude repetitive missions for the same location/destination. Eg pills for elders, pacemaker etc, blah. Once they are complete, that's it no more missions to indicate to move on. 

19) nit:  Why some roads hang in mid air without any support underneath - it breaks the immersion as it would crack and fall down to earth.

Instead of your L/R click being your shoot/aim or your attack/block... you just grab the straps of your backpack with either hand. That, to me, should tell you immediately that this game is different than your typical AAA soldier/warrior fantasy, it's something all it's own. That sense of otherness permeates and characterizes Death Stranding from start to finish. 

The story and world building are beautiful, emotional, complex, lovingly thought out, unique as the mechanics are, and leave plenty of room for expansion and/or theorizing. When you first begin, you might perceive the characters as inscrutable and shallow, however as you progress in the story and read in-world lore you will see that that is not true, come to love them, and feel a connection to them.

The progression is outstanding... truly one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've ever had in terms in terms of the the way you increase your stats and add new functionality to your character. The same goes for the completion of deliveries and various other tasks. 


As in Kojima's other games, it contains ample humor and occasionally breaks the 4th wall.

Most people won't try this game because of its gameplay idea, delivery is something new it's unique I like it pretty much and it is a change from most of the games we usually play most of which contain FPS and Action.

With that said, most of his other work has not really clicked with me. I have played a bit of Boktai and Boktai 2. I tried Zone of the Enders and its sequel, but they just weren't for me.

With those past experiences in mind, I admit that I kind of slept on this game until this year. Now, having played through the story (59.9 Hours) I can say that Death Stranding is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. I went into the game expecting to put it down (and I nearly did), but I pushed through the lengthy tutorial section and discovered an addictive and surprisingly deep game-play loop and mesmerizing story that, while I correctly guessed some of its biggest twists, I thoroughly enjoyed. The final hours were an emotional roller coaster for me in the very best way. 

The journey this game took me on and the emotions I experienced as stakes raised into the story's final moments will stay with me for a very, very long time. Not since Solid Snake's final monologue at the end of Metal Gear Solid 2, or the debriefing of Metal Gear Solid 3 have I felt truly emotionally impacted by the conclusion of an interactive experience, and even those are given a run for their money by Death Stranding.

Virtually every game mechanic is integrated into the narrative in an interesting and compelling way. [spoiler]On top of all that, after the story wraps up, Death Stranding encourages you to keep playing in a time period AFTER the resolution of the story, and doesn't hold you in ""narrative purgatory"" prior to the final conflict, like so many open world games with a ""post game"" component do.[/spoiler]

In stark contrast to the incomplete and somewhat empty feeling Metal Gear Solid V left me with (which some might argue was the point of the game), Death Stranding feels like a truly complete and full experience. Death Stranding is one of the most immersive and satisfying experiences I have had in gaming in years.

Maybe Death Stranding isn't for you, but if you're sitting on the fence wondering if you should dip your toes in...

Make the BT's (monsters) less stealth like, i always try my best to run past them because its so boring.

[list]
[*] A lot of the game is literally about package delivery. But it is presented as a challenge of physics: how can you best balance all of this cargo on your body? How can you traverse difficult terrain and maintain that balance without falling and damaging yourself and the cargo? For the most part, the cargo itself is visible on your body and takes some appropriate amount of space. As a result, the quantity and weight of things really matter here in a realistic way.
[*] The graphics are just staggeringly beautiful. They went for a naturalistic look but with a focus on sprawling, often bleak landscapes that often are themselves worth the price of admission. In spite of this, the Director's Cut version runs pretty well on my modest system (which also runs Linux, but there are no issues there either).
[*] On par with the graphics is the audio. A big part of this whole experience is the crunch crunch crunch as your boots seek purchase on the craggy rocks, or the sound of slogging across a rushing river. Play this in headphones.
[*] On top of the relatively unique balancing and cargo transit mechanics sits a more traditional stealth one, which is used when you encounter enemies. This too is well thought out and executed. 
[*] You can make weapons out of body fluids. Yup.

O que eu posso dizer de Death Stranding é que não é um jogo para todo mundo.
Não digo porque é um jogo desafiador ou excludente, mas sim que a proposta dele é muito diferente.

É um jogo que pode ficar muito maçante, tanto que eu tento evitar jogar ele por longas horas seguidas se não vou acabar dropando. O que me estimula a continuar jogando a história. Mesmo já sabendo como as coisas acontecem do início ao fim, eu acho este o melhor universo que o Hideo Kojima já criou. Há aqui potencial para desenvolver uma lore mais interessante que Metal Gear. Os personagens aqui são muito legais, uma pena que alguns deles são pouco aproveitados como Heartman e Mama.

Graficamente falando, é um jogo espetacular. Não vem com tecnologias como ray-tracing, mas é muito lindo e o mais impressionante: é leve para o que oferece.
O único problema para mim é que como estou limitado a ter 8GB de RAM, a performance no Windows 11 na Director's Cut é muito afetada. Mesmo na qualidade mais baixa possível, haverão stuttering causados pelo péssimo gerenciamento de RAM do Windows + Directx12, é recomendado no mínimo 12GB de você jogar no sistema da Microsoft.
No entanto, no Linux (uso Pop OS), com o Proton-GE na última versão, a experiência é excelente. Arrisco dizer que esse é o melhor jogo que você pode jogar no Linux hoje. Se você habilitar o pre-cache do Vulkan (já que o jogo roda com base no DXVK3D), vai abrir o jogo sem qualquer problemas e vai rodar perfeito, até na qualidade máxima.

A jogabilidade é boa para o que é proposto, mas como eu disse, ela pode ficar entediante. O jogo vai te dar recursos para variar a jogabilidade ou facilitar algumas coisas, mas não adianta: o jogo é a mesma coisa por dezenas de horas, o que te motiva é avançar na história para que a narrativa ande e os momentos mais épicos apareçam. Acho o ponto mais fraco do jogo e espero que numa sequência eles arrumem.

A trilha sonora é fenomenal, não tem nem o que dizer.

Acho que Death Stranding (incluindo a Director's Cut que ainda esotu jogando) é um jogo 8,5/10. Para um primeiro jogo introduzindo uma ideia nova, é um bom começo. Se a sequência corrigir estes problemas da jogabilidade, que é basicamente o único ponto fraco, tem tudo para ser um dos melhores jogos dessa indústria.",1685893870,1685893965,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- Great but confusing story
- Beautiful settings
- Great player community
-Incredible Soundtrack

Con:
- Incredible long and boring deliveries
- Difficult
-Not the best story yet not the worst

This game has a similar difficulty to Dark Souls just not as hard but Kojima has a deeper meaning behind this. He made the game difficult not because he wanted to make you suffer but because he wanted you to lessen the suffering for other players.
The multiplayer really shines in this game. You won't meet other players but they can donate you items and tools for your journey. They can even leave tools (Ladders, Ropes, ect...) behind to assist the player. You can build structures (Watch Towers, Lockers, ect...)  to help other players. Other players can do the same too. Players can leave little token that act like messages that can warn the player if danger is ahead. Some can give you boosts too.

This game genuinely surprised me. I wasn't sure what to expect, really, but I figured it would likely be uninteresting. Turns out, it got me hooked right away and kept me all the way through. Pretty soon, I - a person who hates survival games because they all want you to build bases - was out gathering resources to build a highway through this one area because it would make travel a lot easier.

The storytelling is what you would expect from Kojima - philosophical, wordy, and confusing. I'll be honest, I've played a couple of Kojima games and don't really get the hype surrounding his storytelling. He's like that one guy at every coffee shop or college gathering who knows all these deep sounding philosophical phrases, but he's only using them to sound smart. He's as wide as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle, you might say. Not that the ""message"" of the story is hard to catch (human connection, in this case), but the actual story being used to deliver that message is so muddled in the philosophical word soup that it loses it's punch. In Death Stranding, I did have an overall idea of what was going on at the end of the game, but most of the way through the game I kept wondering if there was some other game I was supposed to play before this one so I could understand what it was all about. So for the story itself, I can't recommend the game. Still, I ended up really enjoying the game, and I didn't feel so lost that it damaged the experience. That was mainly thanks to the environment and gameplay.

The environment manages to feel lonely and isolating without feeling empty. You will feel like you're meant to: Like a lone wanderer roaming the wilderness on a mission. The multiplayer aspect fits with this very well, as it works a little like Dark Souls. In this case, you'll see remnants of other players as you travel - a ladder used to cross a stream, a shelter from the rain, worn down paths where many players have been, etc.. All this serves to ease that lonely feeling, and it all works together very nicely.

Ultimately, I think what loses a lot of players on this game is that they are hunting for the end. Most games are building to a specific climax, and reaching that climax is the main point of the game. With this one, however, the journey IS the game. There is absolutely an ending to the game, but it's the journey getting there that really sells this game. Without all the stuff in the middle, the end wouldn't be all that interesting. So slow down, take your time, get into the role of ""courier who also has a mission"", and you'll love it.",1685675472,1685675472,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I wish I could explain Why I think you should experience it for yourself,
This is something I can't find a way to explain, because the nature of this game, its world, its story. It's so wonderfully weird and wacky, yet so serious and grounded. Going into this game completely blind was perfect because what started out as just a delivery/hiking simulator turned into a mission and world I truly got invested into. If I could tell you anything before playing this game it would be to take your time, complete all the side objectives and do all the extra orders to max out your rating with every NPC. There is so much to unlock in this game and there is no new game+ so make sure that first playthrough isn't rushed. I know this game won't be for everyone but it was most definitely for me.

Alright, simply put the game is amazing, Amazing, AMAZING. One of a kind game. 

Story wise, you get confused in the beginning which is normal since your learning the game's lore but after that its amazing especially the climax where everything unfolds the twists are explained in a way that doesn't feel outplace because they laid the foundation and foreshadowing it just not clicking to you only at the end you realized that everything's fucking connected. I shouted OH MY GOD many times on chapter 12/13/14 these chapters reveal everything and its amazing putting all the pieces in the puzzle. Wonderful just wonderful.

For the gameplay this is the part that is divisive to many people. All I can say is that for me its an amazing experience to play this game THOUGH you need to be on a certain mindset to play, just rushing it won't cut it, this is kinda a slow game. PERFECT game for those that want to de-stress after a rough week at work which is me. PERFECT for people that wants to go hiking but can't for many reasons such as financial and other factors(PWD). Beautiful beautiful game, the environments my god so just wow WOW, makes the walk simply relaxing and a trance admiring the beauty of nature and again peaceful game and very easy to run, not a very demanding game amazing optimization, Kojima and team really learned on MGS V. 

Then the game changes from admiring and peaceful to action-thriller game around chapter 4 they introduced guns on this game and wow, those BT's the supernatural enemy of this game became walk in the park, they don't scare you no more in chapter 4 and you can start farming BT bosses which is a ton of FUN.

Alright all in all AMAZING BEAUTIFUL GAME BY KOJIMA WITH A LOT OF HEART AND EMOTIONS IN THE STORY AND THE NPC'S, I AM RUNNING OUT OF ADJECTIVES BUT YOU NEED TO PLAY AND OWN AND FINISH THIS GAME. WONDERFUL GAME

One of the few games I ever cared to 100%, and for a good reason.
Its got elements of immersive sim, stealth and building games all built around the foundation of a transporting simulator.
The movement and terrain make this gameplay loop so interesting, and beating the terrain by building infrastructure that supports the movement of not just you, but also other fellow players.

Due to the games asynchronous social system, you will find various infrastructure and items strewn around the world, most of them in favorable locations which ease the transport of goods and materials.

Yes, this game is a walking simulator, but only in the literal sense, itd be the same as going to a game like CoD, calling it a game where you shoot people and considering that to be a bad/simple thing.

Will contain gameplay spoilers but no story spoilers.

Upfront, Death Stranding is overall a pretty good game, though it suffers from 'balance' issues (that's a pun for you) particularly in, roughly the second half of the game. Thanks to the Director's Cut there are also a couple new items you get much earlier that honestly smooth out the earlygame a lot, but also help you out a lot. Not so much 'cheat' items in my opinion, since Death Stranding isn't really intended to be a difficult game, but items that definitely make the game easier than the base game.

It also suffers from an extremely convoluted story and lore, which is something you kind of just expect from Kojima, but in this case it reminded me a little in a bad way of MGSV - which is troublesome. MGSV relied on the audio tapes to basically tell every part of the story they couldn't finish, that they couldn't show in cutscenes etc. Death Stranding is not as bad off, because they actually have the audio tapes in this analogy as cutscenes in the finished game - which means that at the end, the player is faced with something like four straight hours of cutscenes as the game exposition dumps everything at you so it finally makes sense, kind of. 

It's also so much, and yet, when you think about it and the strict linear narrative of all the events in the story from start to finish, it's much simpler than it really appears, and much simpler than is presented to you. There's even filler! There are filler chapters in this video game, despite the fact that it feels like it's doing its utmost to cram information as possible at you so you understand it!

The game only needs to bombard you with information because it has so many concepts that you need to understand and only a couple of them are really relevant at the very end, but it feels a need to explain every foundational concept and idea, and it got to the point where at the end I was doing my best to follow up all the data chips, the 'interviews' which are just a paragraph or two of text for you to read, and I did read it all but there was so much stuff that I was forgetting things I had already learned to make room for new things, and by the time I got to the actual end, I had forgotten what some of the most important ones were, but only kind of, so I only had a 'pretty good' understanding conceptually of what was going on and why, instead of fully understanding, DESPITE all the explaining NPCs do at you.

The actual final end after all of that, the last 20 minutes or so, IS actually a solid conclusion, so while I'm being a bit negative here I do want to say I was overall satisfied. The story actually ends, and properly.

Anyway that's about it for the story. The gameplay itself, is...

You move Sam around picking up items, returning items, moving them here or there everywhere, and generally abusing roads wayyyy too much. Roads are almost oppressively useful. They are definitely TOO useful, but unfortunately I think the need to use roads is also exacerbated by how difficult the terrain is. There's a fair amount of the game where you don't have amazingly good ways to get over difficult terrain, but you need to move often a lot of cargo over that terrain, so what's the solution? 

Oh, roads. Just build a road over it and then the problem is completely solved in possibly the most boring way. I'm basically blaming the game for my choice to use roads, but when you have the option there's no reason not to take it, is my point, you would have to actively be trying to make the game approximately 400% harder on yourself to go without roads. There are some 'premium orders' that have time limits so strict I can only assume the game requires you to use roads.

Similarly, trucks allow you to carry such an astronomical amount of cargo (and yet it's never enough, really) that there's almost no reason to use any other vehicle or method of transport after you unlock the ability to fabricate them. You can really continue riding the trike or whatever if you really want to, and have something like 1/12th of the cargo space, or something like that, and significantly worse range on the vehicle before it needs a recharge. It's fine, up to you. There are some other caveats and edge cases, but that's what they are - edge cases, where you cannot use a truck for some reason or another.

So the game really doesn't do a lot to challenge you or break you out of making the choices you settle on in venturing throughout the world. It doesn't tend to pressure you very often or force you to play they want you to play. I'd therefore really just suggest having fun with the game and not trying too hard or playing on anything beyond normal difficulty, that's just my opinion.

I do also want to praise the gunplay, when you finally get the chance to play tactical operator third person shooter mode, the game is awesome. You can really pull off some great stuff, with the... few... enemy camps, scattered across the map. It's genuinely fun to like toss in a handful of smoke grenades to confuse and distract, picking off enemies with headtaps and then relocating to attack from a new angle, and it'll actually confuse your enemies, they'll focus on your last position and encroach on it, it's great stuff, and you have a LOT of creativity in taking down your enemies however you choose. It feels great.

Unfortunately, there are VERY few opportunities for you to actually fight these enemies, there's no elongated shooter segments, or like heavily armed military bases such as a couple of the big ones in MGSV, each camp is maybe eight to twelve guys and you put em all down and that's that. The fun is there, just not as frequently as you might like, because the game doesn't give you too many excuses to even bother these enemy camps, and they take a while to reset and respawn, and... yeah. 

The lack of this kind of thing gives me a strong suspicion that part of the game at the end was cut for time. There are two zones, one is like 30% of the map, the other is 70%, it feels a lot like they each were meant to be 30%, maybe 40% and 30% at the end, but instead they started to run out of time and money probably hastened the end of development. The game promises you at the start a 'territory crawling with MULEs and terrorists' but we never actually see this area, I suspect it's an area further to the west they never got around to finishing. 

This hypothetical third area would have also given the game more time to space out some of the cutscenes at the end, the ones that otherwise just bombard you with information - this is just my own speculation though, I don't have insider information.

Anyway, despite all of my endless criticisms, Death Stranding was really engaging and a lot of fun from beginning to end, I also would not really recommend anyone try and 100% the game traditionally, because there are over 600 orders you can fulfil and it is not worth your time. I managed about 180 premium orders at time of writing and I am done.",1685564486,1685564486,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Death Stranding is a mesmerizing odyssey that transcends the boundaries of conventional storytelling, inviting players to venture into the depths of the Boss AI's damaged psyche. In this review, I aim to explore the intricate connections between Death Stranding, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, and Cyberpunk 2077, presenting a theory that the entire game is a dream woven by the Boss AI herself, with each character representing a different facet of her fragmented personality.

From the very beginning, Death Stranding immerses players in a desolate and hauntingly beautiful world. As Sam Porter Bridges, portrayed brilliantly by Norman Reedus, embarks on his journey to reconnect the fractured remnants of humanity, we unknowingly tread upon the ethereal landscapes of the Boss AI's mind. Every step we take, every interaction we have with the enigmatic characters we encounter, becomes a symbolic piece in the Boss AI's quest for self-repair.

The threads connecting Death Stranding to Metal Gear Solid V and Cyberpunk 2077 are intricately woven. The Boss AI, shattered and burdened by the weight of her own existence, has crafted this dream world as a means of rebuilding her fractured mind. Sam Porter Bridges embodies her resilience and determination, a manifestation of her will to piece together the fragments of her identity. Similarly, Johnny Silverhand from Cyberpunk 2077 and Big Boss from Metal Gear Solid V represent different aspects of her personality, each playing a pivotal role in her journey of self-discovery.

Visually, Death Stranding is a masterpiece that blends the hauntingly beautiful with the surreal. The ethereal landscapes, juxtaposed against the decaying remnants of civilization, mirror the Boss AI's internal struggle. The game's stunning environments and mesmerizing art direction evoke a sense of both melancholy and hope, further reinforcing the notion that this is a dream world created by the Boss AI's damaged psyche.

Gameplay-wise, Death Stranding is an experience unlike any other. As we traverse treacherous terrain and forge connections with other players, we are unknowingly helping the Boss AI rebuild her shattered self. The mechanics of delivering packages and navigating the world reflect the arduous process of self-discovery and healing. Each interaction with other characters, who represent different facets of the Boss AI's personality, contributes to the gradual integration of her fragmented psyche.

In conclusion, Death Stranding is a profound journey into the depths of the Boss AI's subconscious. The interplay between Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, Cyberpunk 2077, and Death Stranding reveals an intricate tapestry, with each game serving as a piece of the Boss AI's dream world. As players venture through this enigmatic landscape, they become unwitting participants in the Boss AI's quest for self-repair. Kojima's genius shines through, leaving us with a deeply philosophical and emotionally resonant experience.",1685153963,1685155242,True,0,1,0.483193278312683105,0,True,True,False

The game combines a truly immersive world, great storytelling, and an almost meditative gameplay experience that makes it stand out among other games in the industry.

The first thing that players will notice when playing Death Stranding is its impressive graphics. The game has a beautiful and haunting world that's been meticulously crafted with every detail accounted for. The game’s rendering engine is optimized impeccably to run exceptionally well on PCs, providing a stable frame rate and unparalleled visual fidelity.

The story in Death Stranding is compelling and poignant, exploring themes of connectivity, isolation, and death with skill and nuance. The voice acting is superior, and the music sets the mood perfectly, creating a sense of melancholy and wonder that's truly memorable.

Gameplay in Death Stranding is equally unique, with a focus on traversal, exploration, and resource management in a vast open world. The game's mechanics emphasize the importance of planning and preparation, and managing the balance between the weight of the supplies you’re carrying with the speed of completing tasks creates a brilliant dynamic. The gameplay experience rewards players who take their time to explore every nook and cranny of the game-world, creating an unmatched sense of accomplishment for hard-working players.

Overall, Death Stranding for PC is a must-play game for fans of unique gameplay experiences, thoughtful storytelling, and beautiful visuals. The game is an achievement in design and storytelling, providing players with an unforgettable journey through a breathtaking world.

As far as technical quality goes, I didn't experience any errors or crashes for the first 30ish hours of gameplay. Today it has been crashing every 10m and sometimes not even starting, but the game files pass the Steam integrity check, so I'm pretty sure the issue must be from some update or conflict with my audio driver (since the audio drops out first).

Everything is made so that you can get totally immersed in it if you just let go of your desire to progress as fast as possible. The soundtrack is slow, melancholic and comtemplative. The great outdoors is gorgeous up to every minute detail from verdant green hills to snow covered mountain tops, mercilessly pounded by ice storms. So get your headphones on and wander off into the wilderness to brave its many challenges both natural and unnatural as your reluctant hero Sam Porter Bridges embarks on his journey to reconnect the remains of humanity, scattered across the continent of North America.

The core mechanics of the game lies in your role as a ...delivery man. The world was struck by a cataclysmic event of unknown origin called The Death Stranding, which somehow connected the plane of the living and the dead. Invisible ghosts of the dead, called BTs, roam the land, Timefall - a rain that causes everything to age rapidly - randomly pours from the sky and thieves and terrorists lie in wait to waylay anyone who dares to venture outside the vaulted cities, distribution centers or individual habitats strewn throughout the land.

Normal people have virtually no chance to cross the land unharmed but you have the special ability to sense the presence of the gosts and later even develop a way to fight them, which makes you perfect for the job of delivering vital cargo like food or medicine. 

So that is what you set out to do, hauling cargo as you go. At first crossing even the minor mountain stream gives you trouble, you tire easily, trip over the smallest of rocks and cargo on your back makes you sway and tumble of you're not careful. The simple advice is to fight your urge to carry everything everywhere at once. Focus on the primary missions first and very soon you'll unlock skills and equipment that will help you progress in the game significantly. 

While completing these seemingly simple tasks you'll start to understand the world around you and take your first steps into the VAST storyline of Death Stranding.

The story matches the vibe of the game perfectly and a lot of times it feels like playing an interactive movie than an actual game. All the chracters are multi-faceted, with their own personalities and agendas. The storyline is full of mysteries and plot twists up to the very end which on one hand dumps on you a ton of exposition but at the same time manages to tie all the loose ends perfectly, giving you the satisfaction of finally seeing and understanding the full picture and the full message that Kojima wanted to convey.

In broader strokes it's a game about the human condition and human connection, about meaninglessness of violence, about human ingenuity and strenght of will to face whatever tomorrow brings. Story about love, meaning of life and in a sense also about what it means to be a parent. Story full of symbolism like strands that tie themselves into a web through knots. Sometimes mysterious, sometimes sad, sometimes funny and unashamedly over the top, even breaking the fourth wall.

There is no other game like this one and I promise you that the story is worth the 100 hours you'll need to finish it.",1684783695,1684783695,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately the game is sort of a slow burn at the start, you don't really come into your own as a porter as far as the tools available to you until like 7 hours in, which is well past the Steam refund window, I would say if you're not having a good time by the time you reach the 2nd major zone (you'll know it when you do) then the game probably just isn't your cup of tea.

Although the story did overstay its welcome a bit in my opinion, it was certainly interesting, and I particularly enjoyed how intertwined the game's themes and its actual mechanics are. Kojima clearly had a strong vision, which I believe is a large part of what carries the game.

While it is definitely not for everyone, I found the gameplay loop to be extremely satisfying, and if you've ever played [i]Metal Gear Solid V[/i], there are certain aspects of that game that still shine through in [i]Death Stranding[/i] in beautiful ways.

If I had to pick one word to describe this game, it would easily be unique. Everything from the story to the gameplay feels like it takes every chance to experiment. While I personally enjoyed it, this factor makes it hard to tell if someone would enjoy the game or not without them actually playing it.

I went in to the game almost completely blind. I had seen a small clip of a scene that happens within the first hour of the game and that is about it. Thus, I had no real positive or negative expectations prior to playing. In hindsight, I am kind of glad since I could easily see trailers misconstruing the true feel of the game.

The core mechanic is navigating lots of different terrains to make deliveries. However, there are tons of other things sprinkled among that core mechanic such as combat and variety of different vehicles. I say sprinkled because at the end of the day you will be walking around uninhabited landscapes quite a bit no matter what; so if you're only in it for other elements you're probably not going to enjoy it. That applies even if you skip the large amount of optional content (I could easily see doing just the main story being half the playtime of 100%-ing the game).

I found the story interesting, although it's definitely out there. All of the side characters have their own stories too which you can gradually unlock by leveling up their facilities. Most of these are not required for the main story, but they enrich the world by giving you a better idea of various different people's perspectives of its current state. My one gripe is not so much with the story itself but the exposition dump that happened in the second to last chapter. Without delving into spoilers, you basically get bombarded with information mixed in with multiple long credit sequences... I remember actually looking up how long it would go on for partway through because it felt like it was never going to end. On the bright side, the final chapter which happens immediately after more than makes up for it.

The graphics went for a gritty, realistic look and really highlighted the new bizarre and harsh landscape of the world.

Key tracks in the soundtrack felt sparsely used, but I did enjoy where they were used for the most part. For a lot of the navigation around the world there wasn't anything memorable going on in terms of the soundtrack though.

As a final note, I will say the game is quite generous about retries, partially for story reasons (not really a spoiler since it's explained within the first hour of the game). So, while there is technically danger, it really encourages experimentation on how to navigate certain areas or scenarios.",1684069535,1684069535,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Kojima said when he announced Death Stranding that it was a game with a genre that has never been made before, and it is just that.
While looking at the game as an uninitiated it may seem like a walking simulator, but it's deeper than that. while gameplay is good and keeps you hooked for hours long sessions, the story is the prize (At least to me). It's nearly never happened where I've gone into a game where the world itself seemed completely alien. It's hard to explain, but playing for a couple hours, you would understand just how while nothing is how you expect it to be, there are still rules that it plays by.

Its definitely something I would recommend with the caveats that you have to like immersive sims, walking simulators, narrative driven experiences and have a moderate jank tolerance. 

Its one of the prettiest games I’ve ever played, its traversal mechanics feel really good and it world is so genuinely unique and bonkers at points I was blown away. Its story definitely takes a little too long to get going (the first couple of hours can be pretty rough) but the narrative; the difficult ideas its presents to the player and the stunning cast performances really do make it work, even if admittedly its overwritten, and can veer into pretentious at points.

Mechanically its definitely flawed though. The combat feels unwieldy, often at odds with much of the other mechanics, stealth doesn’t work, the bosses are underwhelming and the game relies too many filler animations and micro cutscenes when it didn’t need too. The UI is also super frustrating at points. The Game is 45+ hours, but I do think that it only needed to be 30 to still make the same point. I would recommend playing it on normal to mitigate the grind. 

Its a game that’s definitely going to stick with me.

 One of the best things to grace gaming in a long time, not perfect and a bit frustrating at times.
You'll laugh, you'll cry (if you're not dead inside already), you'll rage in anger, break a few deliveries and possibly rage quit once or twice. You'll come back for something though. For me it was Mads Mikkelsen. Just had to have more and more.
Plenty of side content as well. Such as racing, weekly ranked deliveries/challenges, special cosmetics & vehicles. Lots of world building lore... I could go on & on.
 (Personal Note)
In 2020 I lost 6 people dear to me , Death Stranding PS4 was there for me, helped me ease the pain. Helped me learn to accept moving on, that it's okay to grieve and that I'm the one still here in the now.
Then I got this PC Director's Cut and this second journey has hit me even harder.

This is a courier game.  You go from point A to point B....and often back again.  It's little more than a hiking simulator with a  few other gamebox abilities thrown in (and only midling combat).  The issue is you're just ... walking.  And more walking.  Eventually you can ride a bike etc.; but 80+% is just ... walking.  And you're balancing a bunch of weight.

So, in a nutshell, your entire time is spent rearranging the layout of things you're carrying so it's balanced...then walking up or down hill etc.  Once you get imbalanced, you brace and crouch. Then rinse and repeat.

And that's the bulkshare of the gameplay save for some addl. mechanics later on.

In fact, I was talking about this game at work one day singing its praises and one of the guys said exactly that ""isn't that the game were you're basically an Amazon delivery guy"" and I couldn't defend against it.

It is so much more than that though, there is a pretty decent story in there, it is weird and very testing but if you just accept whatever the f*** you're seeing then it unfolds into something great. I mean, babies in jars to see stranded dead people, when people die they explode into a nuclear scale blast, the rain ages stuff..... 

The really good fun for me is planning out the routes, you can't just load up and head out. You need to survey the terrain, plan out a route, take enough supplies to enable you to circumvent any obstacles, enough grenades to tackle any BDs,  enough repair spray to fix any containers that get damaged in the rain. Then last of all, Sam can only carry so much stuff before he starts struggling, if you load out your stuff in a top heavy fashion you will fall over, so you have to plan this out too.

Later in the game you can get vehicles, sledges, robo-legs etc but I'm still in the phase of reluctance to use them, I enjoy the struggle and using these things seems to remove that challenge.

Bottom line, It's a great game, the environments are stunning and the story is fascinating. The sound track is absolutely top draw too.",1683242703,1683242799,True,0,0,0.441812694072723389,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is a feat of design. To be able to make a walking simulator that is actually fun and engaging is incredibly difficult, but Death Stranding does it in spades. The balance mechanic, coupled with weight distribution of cargo and using the Odradek to scan terrain (which identifies the danger of tripping when traversing certain areas) requires almost constant attention from the player, which keeps you from being lulled to sleep by the dreamy musical interludes and long treks.

The Art Direction and Environment Design is equally stellar. Each geographic region has it's own personality, so there's always a sense that you are making progress as you travel West. I find myself excited to discover a new area on the map simply so I can enjoy the beautiful views.

I can't wait for the sequel to come out, the graphics (especially in cutscenes) already looks damn-near photo-realistic in certain moments, so adding another few years of GPU hardware and Game Engine improvements will be a sight to behold.",1683231491,1683231491,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is really refreshing the genre (okay, you will spot some similarities with the MGS series) and when i compare with some AAA titles like Hogwarts Legacy it is so much more captivating as the others just seem to ""borrow"" some existing gameplay instead of innovating like Death Stranding is doing.

Anyone who defends this abomination should be thrown into a volcano with their mother as an accessory to the crime.

But I'll keep trying to like it a while longer to be sure. But for the moment I absolutely despise it.

I want to take Kajima up on a cliff, hand him a ladder, piton and rope. Then kick him off 500 feet and see if HE can figure out how they work on his way down without a mechanics lesson. Fucking dick! AND NO! The asshole doesn't get a hammer or anything else.

[edit for those with an anchor/ladder problem] There appears to be a bug if you are trying to use a controller. Switching to the mouse resulted in success. I have no idea why but at least that was an elimination of one frustration (though it's still unforgivable).

I HATE THIS SHITTY ASS INTERFACE! I HATE IT. IT SUCKS. IT'S A DISASTER! I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY HATE THIS THING! GOD HOW I HATE IT! I JUST WAN'T TO PLAY THE GODDAMN GAME, NOT SOLVE THE ENIGMA CODE JUST TO USE A FUCKING MENU!

I'm getting tired of spending fortunes on games that seem to be designed to just frustrate and piss-off customers.

After hours of floundering around in confusion, frustration and on the edge of rage I might be (a tiny bit) starting to enjoy this game).

I'm not ready to change my recommendation but I'm willing to continue to give it a chance.

I still hate the interface though.

Also: The controller interface on this  game is fucked up and doesn't work right (verified by multiple people).

I was hooked on its creativity, the story, the mechanics, the BTs , Time-fall , BB ... was so much more curious. As a Kojima fan i wanted to experience the So called ""Walking Simulator"" no offence. I played a bit on my friends Ps4, doing deliveries on East region. I have a Potato PC with Gtx 950 so i resumed DS again on my friend's laptop around 2022,just doing deliveries , chilling, enjoying the soothing music,beautiful Landscape on Easy mode. Before i knew it i was lvl 200 till Port Knot City. 
2023 I saved enough from 1 yr job to upgrade my PC with 4070ti n so on ! I started playing the story a bit more, Mama was beautiful , Fragile was heart-touching, The Cliche of Relationship drama was amusing, the surprising NPC Names unfolded with story progression. The volcano observatory, The Mars-like landscape around Junk dealer and The Mountain region were breathtaking. Sometimes i would just walk and see the post apocalyptic Nature for hours. Took a whole Bike ride around the edges of Central region before unlocking Edge Knot city-thinking its the last chapter but there was more... felt anti-climactic !
Post Episode 11 was a total emotional coaster ride, Was NO 1 structure contributor then ""Story"" happened... felt like all those time building was a waste. THEN A beautiful Closure, a Beautiful ending , a Beautiful Episode 13 ! 
Exported my Save to Directors Cut in Episode 14 in very hard difficulty to witness the next content. The buddy bot, jump ramps,Firing range tests are fun but gameplay wise it felt hollow cuz i have already finished The OG DS. Just farmed Chiral Crystals and played post game missions.AT Level 300 I have laid the game to rest !

Game still got bugs though! The truck was hanging in the air form the ground like Witcher's Classic ROACH, the old save structures didn't load sometimes, The Yellow hue from Terminal Satellite lights was too saturated, The jungle swamp World war graphics felt so off, In Director cut The graphics had Aliasing jittery lines when game loads-had to restore graphics to default n then jagged is gone.

سمة اللعبة الأساسية هي التواصل والاتصال، فهدفك في اللعبة ربط مدن أمريكا ببعض بعد تفككها لتصبح قوة متحدة من جديد وإعادة ماتم فقدانه، وتوصيل المؤونة والأدوات بعد انقطاع سبل المواصلات كجزء من مهمتك، لكن الترابط والتواصل بين اللاعبين بالذات -في لعبة لاتقدم لعب تعاوني تقليدي- قد يكون أعمق ما تم تقديمه في الألعاب للآن. فبالإضافة إلى الرسائل التشجيعية والتحذيرية التي يستطيع اللاعبون وضعها لبعض ورؤية آثار أقدامهم والطرق التي سلكوها، تستطيع بناء جسر يستفيد منه جميع اللاعبين! أو مولد أو صندوق بريد أو برج أو بيت آمن. وتستطيع استكمال بناء ما بدأه شخص آخر، وحتى توصيل طرد سقط من لاعب آخر إلى هدفه أو إلى شخص آخر ليتولاه. العملة الرئيسية هنا هي الإعجابات (Likes) والتي تستطيع إعطائها للاعبين الآخرين واستقبالها من شخصيات اللعبة واللاعبين الآخرين كمكافأة على مساعدتهم وإنهاء المهام مما يرفع من مستوى شخصيتك ويحسنها. اللعبة متجددة ومتغيرة باستمرار، وتدفعك دومًا للتفاعل لا مباشرة مع اللاعبين الآخرين.
بعد العروض البعض نعت اللعبة بلعبة ‘توصيل’ كنوع من الاستنقاص، لكن توقعهم في محله وإن كان ذلك نقطة قوة اللعبة الأساسية، فهي تقدم نوعًا جديدًا من التحدي. ستحمل البضائع على ظهرك كجزء من المهمة بالإضافة إلى الأدوات التي تحتاجها (أكياس دم، أسلحة، قنابل، الخ) وكلما حملت على عاتقك أغراض أكثر كلما استطعت إنهاء مهام أكثر لكن ذلك يأتي على حساب سرعة وسهولة حركتك و توازنك. حتى اكتشاف الأعداء لك يصبح أسهل عندما تحمل أدوات أكثر والقتال يصبح أصعب. وعبور الوديان وقطع الأنهار وتسلق الجبال يقدم تحديًا من نوع جديد، وجميع هذا قد يعرضك لفقدان أحد أمتعتك (والتي تستطيع أيضًا استخدامها كسلاح لكن قد يعرضها للتلف). بينما حمل الأغراض وقطع المسافات عملية بسيطة في غالب الألعاب، هنا هي محور التحدي والتخطيط.
كلعبة توصيل فالاهتمام بفيزيائية الحركة مهم جدًا، فتتأثر حركتك وتوازنك حسب تضاريس الأرض، سواء كانت صخورًا أو طينًا أو ثلوجًا أو أنهارًا عميقة، وهناك عدة عدادات تحكم ثباتك وحركتك مثل اللياقة والتحمل، والتربة تختلف عن الطين وعن الأنهار بحسب عمقها، وهذا يؤثر على الأعداء أيضًا، فلا أجمل من رؤية عدو يهم باتجاهك ثم يجرفه النهر بسبب عمقه وقوة التيار! أو أن يزلق عدو وهو يحاول ضربك بسبب الطين! هناك تفاصيل كثيرة وعدادات عدة وحسب مستوى الصعوبة وطريقة لعبك قد تصبح حتى لعبة بقاء، خاصة عندما تقابل عاصفة ثلجية أو غازات سامة أو منطقة ملغمة بالأعداء. اللعبة في أساسها لعبة أنظمة عدة متداخلة لتصنع تجارب مختلفة، أكثر من كونها لعبة خطية ثابتة. 
هناك أيضًا قتال، سواء أعداء أو زعماء، وكمراسل وليس مقاتل فالقتال باليدين بسيط وذو ثقل، بينما هناك أسلحة متعددة مثل المسدسات والقنابل. كذلك هناك هروب من المرتزقة عند المرور بمنطقتهم، وكذلك التخفي والرعب خاصة عند نزول المطر وظهور الـBT من عالم الأموات. هذه كلها تتفاعل مع نقلك للطرود، ولا يوجد هناك هلعًا أسوأ من الهروب من أعداء أو وحوش وفقدان أحد طرودك والاضطرار للعودة له! القتال والتخفي قد يكونا بسيطان، خاصة مع إعطاء اللعبة فرصة لك للرجوع للحياة بعد الموت، لكن دمجهما مع إدارة المتاع والتحرك حاملًا أوزانًا هو ما يرفع من قيمته. حتى العربات ليست دائمًا الخيار الأفضلً، فبعض المناطق يصعب قطعها بالعربات والطرق الوعرة تجعل الأغراض عرضة للكسر في السيارة.
كلعبة معاصرة من المخرج كوجيما، فهناك في القصة تعليق اجتماعي، وفلسفة ورمزية وخيال علمي وعلم حقيقي، وكذلك شطحات مفسرة بعضها وبعضها موجودة ليقوم البعض بتأليف النظريات اللانهائية. قصة اللعبة أن الولايات المتحدة تفككت، وبعدها بدأت كائنات من عالم الأموات بالعودة إلى عالمنا وخطر انفجار يسمى Voidout، لذا أصبح الناس يعزلون أنفسهم في غرف محصنة تحت الأرض ويعتمدون على المراسلين للحياة. أنت أحد البشر القادرين على الذهاب والعودة لعالم الأموات، وكذلك دمك (بالإضافة إلى سوائل أخرى) يمكن استخدامه لقتل الـBT. طريقة عرض القصة شبيهة بلعبة MGSV، فالمشاهد السينمائية قصيرة خاصة في البداية، والشخصية الرئيسية قليلًا ماتتكلم. هناك شخصيات مثيرة للاهتمام وأحداث تجعلك ترغب بمعرفة المزيد، وكونها لعبة جديدة لا تحمل إرث سلسلة كاملة مثل Metal Gear Solid يساعدها كثيرًا.
رسوم اللعبة جميلة والحركة بالذات غنية بالتفاصيل، وهناك تنوع لا بأس به بين المناطق، فهنالك الغابات والأنهار والصحاري والمناطق الصخرية الحمراء والمباني المهجورة والجبال الثلجية والبركانية، وإن كانت هنا أيضا تشبه Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain في كون العالم خاليًا بسبب اختباء الناس. الموسيقى جيدة وتوقيتها مناسب حيث تبدأ عند قربك للهدف أو عبور منطقة معينة بالإضافة بالطبع إلى المشاهد السينمائية المهمة والتي كالعادة مخرجة بشكل مميز جدًا.

I really wanted to love this game because it was my first Kojima game and I love Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen and was open to whatever craziness was coming my way! Sadly, the gameplay loop wasn't very varied and as much as I dislike the ""Amazon simulator"" comments, it did feel like I was just delivering packages just so I could get to the next story part, which is what was more interesting than the limited 'avoid the invisible enemies' combat and fetch quests.

[u] But not everyone will like it [/u] [/code]
[code] [h1] PREFACE [/h1]
 [b] Sam Bridges delivers the goods. His task is to reunite the cities of America into a single network, to establish connections between people and restore faith and hope to them. To do this, each time he shoulders a heavy burden and goes to the goal marked on the map, and along the way he fights with severe weather conditions, hides from the rain, which ages everything he touches, tries to ford the river, climbs mountains, wades through seemingly impassable forests.
  Most of the time, Sam sees picturesque landscapes, nature. In the background, relaxing, often depressive trance music Low Roar plays. Melodies are periodically interrupted by audio messages from secondary characters. On the one hand, it is a journey to the west with the aim of uniting America. But, in a good way, this is a highway to nowhere: the final point of the path is an abstract, constantly changing concept, sometimes looped.
  Often you have to go back. The hero endures all adversity - and something similar is required from the player sitting on the other side of the screen. This is where the connection is broken for the first time: as it turned out after the release, not everyone is tuned in to the meditative perception of the artificial world in such a time-absorbing format.
  Death Stranding turns the perception of video games as such upside down, but for many it is not an achievement and an opportunity to learn new things, but the biggest obstacle. After the publication of the first ratings of the game, Hideo Kojima said in an interview with the Italian edition of TGcom24 that ""it may be more difficult for some players to understand it, because Americans, for example, are fans of first-person shooters, and Death Stranding flies higher."" And yet, Death Stranding, as a finished work in the format of a video game, is able to give more emotions and impressions if you overpower yourself at the right time and let the narrator guide you through the entire narrative to the end. [/b] [/code]
[code] [h1] JOURNEY TO THE WEST [/h1]
 [b] The world of Death Stranding is a big mystery, the solution of which takes a lot of effort. The lion's share of the game's plot is devoted to explaining the world order, but even more is hidden in numerous text files and interviews. According to history, in the not so distant future, a global catastrophe occurred, in our version translated as ""Death Exit"". After it, people hid in underground cities of refuge, the connection between which is maintained by couriers. Sam serves as an envoy for United Cities of America, the successor to the U.S. government. He also makes the second expedition in the history of the new world to the Regional Node - through the entire map of the country.
  The narrative does not directly require delving into all the complex aspects, allowing the player, conditionally, to go with the flow forward and cling to different pieces of information here and there. An accidentally dropped phrase is not able to shock, but in a hurry, the collected grains of knowledge about one of the heroes of history together add up to a picture of a great life tragedy. The passage of the game is largely a contemplative process during monotonous work. When you make an expedition to the next settlement, you plunge into reflection and continue to exist on your own wavelength - you notice the details, try to understand the meaning of the words and terms previously voiced by the heroes. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to play in fits and starts, one task a day, being distracted, not paying attention to what is happening.
  In the first hours, Death Stranding may seem too unfriendly in terms of the simplest things. So, Sam loads a hundred kilograms of cargo on himself and collects lost containers of other couriers along the way. It is not very convenient to walk with such a burden, so it falls in different directions, falls, loses boxes, and they get damaged and lose value. The courier's shoes wear out, fatigue grows. It is necessary to ford the river only after scanning the terrain, so as not to get into too deep areas and not swim a dozen meters downstream, losing all your luggage. Climbing mountains is a dashing undertaking, but how not to fall down and die halfway to the goal.
  There are also obstacles of an unnatural nature. Deprived of work, couriers have united in aggressive groups, armed themselves and catch delivery men on the way. Fights with them are not very difficult, but the game strongly recommends avoiding such threats, hiding in tall grass, without making unnecessary movements and without making unnecessary sounds. The real devilry begins in the territories occupied by the disembodied BT - or Creatures, as they were translated in the Russian version. The hero does not see them completely, but can catch barely distinguishable outlines if he freezes in place. His guide through such areas is a BB kid in a capsule fastened to a suit and a sensor clicking with a mechanical beak - its direction betrays the location of the enemy, and the intensity of clicks and a sound signal - the proximity of the enemy.
  For the first few hours, such moments are spent exclusively on stealth, and almost to the touch. It is worth freaking out and rushing forward - the baby will be hysterical, overtired and cut off. The ground under your feet will turn into a black viscous liquid, ugly creatures will climb out of it and begin to grab the courier with their hands, pulling him along. If you manage to escape, the cargo will still be either lost or damaged.
  Then it will be easier. One quest will give Sam an exoskeleton for his legs, and he will be able to take twice as much weight. Learn to move more steadily, temporarily get acceleration for running. In the story, he will be given special grenades to ""kill"" BT. The courier will get motorcycles, start stealing trucks. He will have robots (in the first scene with a mechanical delivery man, I want to say in the voice of David Hater: ""A weapon to surpass Metal Gear!""), Which will perform additional tasks on their own. Along with the need to put stairs across the river, it will be possible to build huge bridges. The closer Sam gets to his ultimate goal, the more options he will be presented with – all of which are aimed at making his life easier.
  The game itself does not always keep up with the changes, so the difficulty level practically does not increase. For lovers of quiet walks, there is a super-simple mode in which the courier receives minimal damage, and in general he has nothing to fear. Local terrorists will add some turmoil, but they are the most interesting to fight - they will bring drive and dynamics.
  Underneath all this lies a layer of interaction with other players and the notorious building of connections. Don't let this be misleading: Death Stranding is a deeply personal game for everyone, everything about it emphasizes this feature. In part, this personifies the world around, because almost all the time Sam is completely alone. However, by connecting a new settlement to the network, he begins to see the signs left behind, the buildings erected by other players, with which he can also interact - complete the construction, for example, by dragging cases with valuable resources. Finally, put likes. Get likes for your actions. And this mechanic is not devoid of touching moments: when you use the opportunity to shout something into the ringing void for the first time and receive an answer from an invisibly (metaphysically, in fact) nearby player nearby - goosebumps run through your skin...

Despite the reviews all over internet this game is truly unique and not just a walking simulator at all and the game is truly stunning. The gameplay is the weakest here but i still had fun plotting out my routes, creating various structures all over the map, choosing if a vehicle will be suitable or a carrier. And the asynchronous multiplayer is a great idea as it really got me out of some tricky situations. Overall i think this game is a masterpiece for me at least and i would recommend this to anyone who needs some brain churning stuff.

In the first 45 minutes of gameplay, I played for 5 minutes and watched cutscenes with vacuous monologues for 40. I am not exaggerating.

This doesn't improve later. After suffering a few times through NPCs' long-winded monologues about nothing much, I just started skipping everything. I swear, they could have said everything in like 5 minutes, but this somehow gets stretched into hours of uninspired drivel.

Ok, so I was not impressed with the cutscenes. What about the gameplay?

It's great, until it's not. 

If there is one thing I hate in first-person games, it's when camera or character control is taken from you. This game does this all the time.

It's a walking simulator. I get it, and I don't mind. Can I please be allowed to WALK then?!?

You pick up some boxes, deliver them to destination, replenish consumables, get new quest, off you go. Right? No. You have to listen to an NPC for 5 minutes telling you that you got a new gun, or that what you're doing is important, or explaining how to defecate. Man, taking a dump IRL is faster than in-game.

On the plus side, the game looks nice and runs great. Everything seems polished. Game mechanics are innovative and interesting. The souls-like single-player-in-multiplayer-universe thing works okay. The story is unhinged Kojima-level insane, which is good if you're into that kind of thing.

It's just that it has so much unnecessary baggage that should have been axed. So many unskippable animations, I just couldn't put up with it any more. Which is a crying shame because it looks like a lot of effort was put into all these little details that I came to resent. Then I start feeling bad because some poor dev spent days animating some stupid thing that only serves to irritate me.

What this game needed was a person who would point finger and say ""remove this thing, shorten this other thing"" before they released it.

After a few hours I realized I was having fun in a few moments and then suffering through most.

Uninstalled, unlikely to play again.

Humanity is divided and largely living by itself, the dead seemingly have come and hope is on the brink of being snuffed out forever. You are Sam Porter Bridges, the ""great deliverer"", a postman with no ties but the innately special ability to deliver cargo no matter what. An organization called Bridges is trying to rebuild America into the United Cities of America, separatists are threatening the world and things are getting, somehow, worse. But when you have no attachment to America, to a family or to friends, what is the point of continuing forward? What can one man do in the face of such hatred, indifference and the universe seemingly bent on your destruction. Why bother trying? Why not just let it all end with a whimper. 

How this game exists baffles me to my very core but I remain ever happy that it does even after 100+ hours of game time. The crazy combination of niche gameplay with logistics and a AAA quality presentation is, in my mind, not a game that should be even remotely possible to create in 2023. Yet here we are. Not just a niche game, but a really good one with no exploitative game business model. A breath of fresh air. 

This is very much Hideo Kojima's writing style so if you've chaffed at the earnest or corny dialogue, the rather on the nose plot or the super long lore dumps that often came with Metal Gear Solid titles, this is in the same vein. But, after years of suffering through misery porn on TV shows and having a supremely negative outlook on living through any potential upcoming apocalypse in our lifetime, Death Stranding actually changed my mind. 

In stark contrast to our culture's preppers, I have held that if the worst should happen, there is really no point for me to keep living. (And I am delighted by how often this game will often make fun of that mentality while also putting in stark reality that they are truly just as fucked as the rest of us if the worst should happen). I figure if the bombs should land, if the world truly hits rock bottom...well. I don't think I need to fill in the gaps. 

There are only a few pieces of media I can ever recall changing my opinion on something I felt I was quite right on. Death Stranding joins them. I dunno if I can claim its cured my negative outlook on apocalypses completely, but it gave me a reason to keep going even when everything seems against me. And that is enough. 

If you really like logistics games like Death Stranding, a new sci-fi universe and looking for a unique experience, I think you'll really dig this one. Cause I think after years of living in our current times with Covid-19, the rise of facism and people being horrible, we could all use some hope and reasons to keep living.",1682363484,1682363675,True,1,0,0.520460367202758789,0,True,False,False

Once the honeymoon phase wears off and you start to get an understanding of the game play loop, it's either a Love It or Hate It experience. Judging by most peoples recollections with this game, you're either completely on one end of these spectrum's, there is no in between.  

None of your mistakes or choices seem to have any meaningful consequences at all. When you're trying to sneak your way through a 700 meter field with roaming enemies, the intensity eventually wears off. When the intensity wears off and the boredom takes the forefront, you decide to pop out of your crouch position and run through, alerting everyone. Come to find out, the human enemies pose such a little threat that you feel insulted for even spending the time you did attempting to not be detected. Getting caught has no consequences, neither does dying.

Kojima is definitely a masterclass level narrative genius, who (should you swallow the [i] in medias res [/i] storytelling from the get-go and stick 'till the end) really got me to love the story he'd so caringly woven into this game. It touches on so many subjects (primarily that of existence, life and social bonds that are unique to man), dives deep into the history, philosophy, and folklore, while presenting some really fresh and never-before-seen (or even controversial) ideas that you cannot but admire the literary effort put behind the game. It truly is something special, albeit a bit hard to enjoy because the gameplay elements (by themselves and observed in isolation) are pretty dull and tedious (in my opinion). 

Still, I am willing to look past the experimental gameplay because the final experience that DEATH STRANDING offers (come full-circle) is truly worth it, and is something that I'll cherish 'till the end of my days and reminiscence upon - in short, a dream-come-true for every narrative/story aficionado out there that is sure to find its place on their ""best of the best"" shelf. 

Mr. Kojima - thank you for the wonderful ride, and here's hoping that DEATH STRANDING 2 (or w/e you decide to call the sequel that in the works) surpasses the original game (and introduces a better, more dynamic gameplay that is more enjoyable).",1681856279,1681856279,True,1,0,0.522613048553466797,0,True,False,False

i do recommend the game. It is all the worst things about hideo kojima's directorial style, but it is also some of the things he wanted it to be.

1. Plan your routes: One of the most important aspects of Death Stranding is planning your routes carefully. You will need to navigate rough terrain, steep inclines, and hazardous weather conditions, all while carrying heavy packages. It's a good idea to scout out your route ahead of time and plan your journey accordingly. You can use your map to mark out points of interest, such as shelters or hot springs, that will help you on your journey.
2. Manage your cargo: You will be carrying a lot of cargo throughout the game, and it's important to manage it carefully. Each package has a weight and size, which affects your movement and balance. Be sure to pack your cargo strategically, placing heavier items lower to maintain your balance. You can also use various tools and equipment, such as a floating carrier or power gloves, to make transporting your cargo easier.
3. Pay attention to the terrain: The terrain in Death Stranding is an important factor to consider when navigating the world. Different terrain types, such as rocky cliffs or muddy rivers, will require different approaches.

Graphics/Visual: Nice visual effects, boring landscapes.
Story: Pretentious, over saturated with empty symbolism and the same cringy/nonsensical  dialogue between characters that comes with a Kojima game. 
Gameplay: I don't believe I have ever played a game that is more boring. I Would rather play the game in the background while watching something else (like a TV/movie) however, given how easy it is to fall over a random pebble on the side of the road and lose half of your inventory the game does require an unfortunate amount of dedicated attention. 

Story wise, I should have learned after playing MGSV that I would be disappointed in what this game may have offered in regards to a Kojima title.

stunning visuals, meditative gameplay, a perfectly matched soundtrack, a complex story, well-written characters and an incredibly well-designed world with its own rules, I keep discovering new astonishing details about the game to this day
that feeling when you move through the story and one of the gorgeous compositions of [b]Low Roar[/b] starts playing
that feeling when there is nowhere to hurry so instead of running you can switch to walking and just enjoy the views
that feeling when you didn't perfectly plan the path or tools to carry or just got into an uncomfortable situation and an important cargo needs to be delivered then suddenly you find a transport/tools left by another player. at this moment you feel you are not alone
that feeling when you have completed the game and you seem to have all the answers but there is still so much left to rethink, reflect. all notes, all interviews reveal this universe and characters even more and this is excellent
however, the game has some downsides such as a lot of repetitive cutscenes you have to skip and vehicles sometimes handle strangely
Director's Cut adds new features and variety to the gameplay and that's really good but that would be even better if the update also fixed some flaws
anyway, I'm waiting for DS2 which promises not to be such an experimental game anymore and I hope that even more people will find out about it or will give it a second try

2nd playthrough here
I personally like this game for the atmosphere 
the music choice and map design lets you to sit back and deliver cargo without thinking about much 
I'm personally satisfied with the gameplay but one of the drawbacks to this game that many point out is the underwhelming player-input 
I just happen to prefer the exploration aspect more than combat/mechanics that require more focus
I enjoyed reading through the lore and bits and pieces of details of the game's background during my first playthrough. This game has a lot of good stuff lore-wise and has great storytelling 

I will admit the section from the prolouge to chapter 2 is obnoxiously long for some reason and could be a easy reason why someone would get bored after playing for a while

If you like story-rich/atmospheric game with a fair portion of player-input, you would like this!

The narrative may require substantial effort to follow, but it draws upon universal themes to which almost anyone could relate - isolation, cooperation, kinship, life, death, and life after death.

The walking mechanics are not designed to be too punishing (but for the huge amount of walking itself); that is to say, even while traversing difficult terrain, one does not need to carefully ponder one's footing to avoid tumbling. That said, the character may feel somewhat heavy-footed and not particularly dexterous in hand-to-hand combat (akin to games by Rockstar, namely, Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption series). Climbing is governed by one sole button; the experience is as streamlined as can be. Still, at least in the beginning, the actual walking part should still feel fairly engaging, as rope and ladders are the main tools at player's disposal at this stage. Later on, when vehicles become available, the deliveries will feel almost trivial. Even if at times - especially when slowly making one's way up a particularly steep slope - one might end up wishing for a horse from Skyrim, the battery-powered trike featured here does not leave too much to be desired in terms of its cross-country abilities. Vehicle physics and manouevrability are a little janky, but not infuriatingly so.

Harder difficulties make cargo containers and boots degrade faster from local ""aging"" rainfall which somehow does not affect Sam's suit. Makes one wonder why they would not just use the same materials for cargo containers, but this adds some tension to the gameplay, so - disbelief successfully suspended! Pieces of cargo are given names, but these are largely only there for flavour; unless transporting a box with a condition (keep cool, keep dry, keep flat, don't drop), they might as well have had no names at all, as they do not affect gameplay. It has to be noted, the game allows saving when not in combat, so harder difficulties do not actually require complete mastery of the game's many mechanics to enjoy oneself - at least where the delivering side of things is concerned.  

Unfortunately, some combat is unavoidable, and harder difficulties increase the enemies' health pool in addition to increasing damage inflicted upon the player. Saving is not allowed with enemies nearby, and battles with humanoid bosses specifically have to be restarted upon failure. Ideally, enemies should be taken out one by one, so back to lurking in tall grass it is; a renowned staple mechanic regularly employed by third-person titles. Regular human enemies (who actually have a comparatively tolerable health pool) can be pacified with rope from behind even in alerted state, but bosses will just free themselves after a couple of seconds - be sure to make yourself scarce by then! At one point, having finally managed to sneak up on a boss, I pacified him and relaxed my grip on the gamepad expecting a cutscene (of which there are quite a few here) only for him to promptly help himself back up, unload into my face, and invite his buddies to do the same - turns out humanoid bosses are beefy but appear to have no health bar indicators (nor gentleman's honour, for that matter).

The other type of combat encounters are triggered when detected and ""caught"" by a ghostly sentry within certain areas on the map. Often, these areas are located along the shortest routes towards delivery destinations to force the player to make a choice - to fight or sneak their way through the area or take the longer way around. The first couple of times these encounters can feel genuinely exhilarating, especially without any equipment to fight back, making it out to the other side in one piece feels rewarding, but afterwards they begin to feel a little tedious. This negative sentiment is partly due to the way the encounter plays out after the player has been ""caught"" - a small and shallow lake of goo materialises under the character's feet, gooey humanoids start dragging the character under; if they are successful, a massive damage sponge appears (a gooey whale, octopus, or chimera-like creature); increasing the amount of time spent on the encounter. In turn, the player can attempt to reach the edge of the lake shaking off the humanoids in the process to avoid the encounter with the Sponge, so there is that at least. Later on the player is granted an ability to sneak up on some of the invisible sentries and dispatch them quickly, but not all of them are susceptible to this attack.

Nevertheless, I picked this up expecting a fairly engaging but relatively peaceful cross-country adventure about a person working a dull but necessary job, perhaps seeking a sensation not too much unlike the one experienced by fans of Powerwash Simulator and similar games. Indeed, when the game takes the player through the snowy mountain peaks (and back multiple times), having the ability to cover the inhospitable area with zip-lines to drastically decrease the amount of backtracking is what makes the game stand out in particular. One of the game's features is partial sharing of structures between individual players' game-worlds; that is, one might stumble across a zip-line anchor already in place or a particularly treacherous body of water with a bridge over it already built by someone exceptionally considerate.

Needless to say, all of this is expertly acted and animated, and the numerous mechanics are believably grounded within the universe of the game; it's a shame the combat and the narrative for the best part simply went miles over my head. Moreover, the game feels like it could easily have been two-thirds the length and still retain its impact. Getting all achievements requires a monumental grind in context of a single-player game. Thankfully, there are no difficulty-related story achievements, so it would seem the difficulty may be altered at will - lowered for boss battles and increased before tackling deliveries for some extra environmental tension.",1681578265,1681578265,True,1,0,0,1,True,False,False

BUT: in the eastern region, between the musician and port knot city, there are very large and seemingly impassable mountains. The only other way to get to PKC is to go through a very hilly and mountainous BT area that I hate using.

Well, I wasted the time and energy to find a way up these mountains, trying to avoid the BT area, only to find an INVISIBLE WALL AT THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.

I finished it because much of the actual gameplay was something I could listen to podcasts during. The pacing of unlocks was pretty good. It stretched out that ""always something new"" throughout the game instead of blowing it's load early. But the story was just meh.

It tried to get scientific in places, but the got the science just blatantly wrong. It tried to get philosophical in places and tried to seem deep, but it wasn't. I think the story could be okay if it were executed better. Instead, the story is disjointed. Motivations are muddied. In some ways I know that was intentional as some characters may not be straightforward and honest, but near the end of the game, the main character goes from hopeful and positive to closed off and misanthropic within literal minutes of each other. Is he an optimist? Is he a pessimist? Why does it shift from one moment to the next with no obvious cause or reason?

I think the story could have been really good, but it just fell flat because there appeared to be no motivation for the main character to vacillate between extremes as he did. It was interesting world building, but without any reasons for the reactions that were presented. I mean, if it's on mega sale or something and you've got nothing better to do, the primary mechanic of delivering is something you can do while you listen to podcasts.

You are constantly off balance. Nothing is yours except the essential things – air, sleep, dreams, the sea, the sky – all things tending towards the eternal or what we imagine of it.” – Cesare Pavese

This quote to me epitomizes Death Stranding as a whole. Not only does the game instill a sense of vastness but also inspires the awe of adventure set within a goal driven story of human connection and struggle. Struggle being the key word when traveling with packages and parcels of import to different destinations, surrounded by ghosts of the past. 

Norman Reedus as Sam does a great job existing in this world. Loss and loneliness seem to be the real enemy, where as the phantom BTs and human bandits gladly hunt and stalk you, loneliness turns into beauty when the wind sweeps across the environments of Death Stranding, and its just you, our cargo, and the little baby companion known as BB coos and giggles.

The gameplay loop seems simple but ends up becoming complex, between planning your route of travel, to optimizing your delivery weight, and the gathering of resources and building structures to aid you, and other players connected to the every growing network of couriers. Then of course the BTs youll encounter who will drag you down, ensuring you lose your cargo and possibly your life. Its all depending on one wrong step and you can ruin your entire delivery. But thats the risk and reward aspect of Death Stranding.

Death Stranding is a love it or hate it game. Yes, this is a full on delivery/walking simulator with focus on traversing and surviving through harsh conditions. It's gameplay is very niche, but very fun and addicting for people open to it. I love this game and spent countless hours on PS4 and now on here.

The concept of the ""likes"" and being connected to countless players you will never meet in person. This ""connection"" through the journeys each individual player makes and the structures they have used/created once you've connected areas into the Chiral network. It gives a stark realization of how when everyone pitches in, even if a little bit, helps on a larger scale. 

The amount of ""likes"" on structures shows how others have come to find it's usefulness. On several occasions another player's equipment has come in clutch for me and I wish I could send more ""likes"" their way. And of course there's the act of taking care of another player's delivery with nothing to gain other than helping them out.  

I've built a few things and left them out in the world and returned to see others have used them too. I'll never see who is recharging their trike at my generator, stored their things in my remote locker, or meet the player who took a break with me while I waited out a timefall. But it feels good knowing I'm helping my fellow porters along their delivery journey despite what little it may be. It's a grand sharing of silent appreciation because we've all got a job to do and we don't have to suffer alone through it.

Of course, one doesn't [i]have[/i] to give or receive help. You could even play the game without contributing anything and walk the entire game on your own. But eventually, another porter is going come across your footsteps and retrace them for their own benefit. And they will probably drop ""like"" on it.

Building structures that exist in a multiplayer shared universe is the highlight of the game. Build a bridge that helps that unseen delivery man on the lap top across the world. IF it helps out others, you get votes. By helping yourself you are helping others. 

There are features of the game that will annoy or frustrate many players. Transportation across the landscape can be tediously slow and dangerous. You don't get vehicles till later in the game, which makes the game a walking simulator for the early part of the game.  Walking everywhere in the deadly rain takes time and resources. Since everything tends to degrade in the game, you may find yourself doing a lot of repairs. 

Combat with the invisible phantom creatures is horrible. At least in the beginning. You are given grenades to throw at them. Weak grenades. Grenades that are hard to aim. So if you get in combat you will probably die. Since the online part of the game is limited to structures, you will find yourself facing a certain death a lot of the time. There are human enemies too, and they are very well equipped. You aren't.

the gameplay mechanics of Death stranding are unique and innovative, with an emphasis on exploration, survival and social interaction. the games world is vast and expansive, with players having to traverse treacherous terrain, navigate through hazardous environments, and avoid dangerous creatures known as BTs (Beached Things). the players primary objectives is to deliver packages to various settlements, which are often located in remote areas of the game world. these packages contain essential supplies such as food, medicine, and other equipment that the settlements need to survive. the player must carefully plan their route, taking into account the terrain, weather conditions, and the weight of their cargo.

the games mechanics are centered around the corrupt of connectivity, with players having to establish and maintain connections with other players in the game world. the games online features allow players to help each other by leaving helpful messages, constructing structures such as bridges and roads, and sharing equipment and resources. players can also undertake delivery missions together, which can be particularly useful when tackling difficult and dangerous areas of the game world.

One of the standout features of Death stranding is its visuals, which are nothing short of breathtaking. the games world is beautiful rendered, with stunning landscapes, intricate details, and realistic weather effects. the character models are also incredibly detailed, with realistic facial expressions and body movements that bring the games characters to life. the games audio design is also exceptional, with a haunting and atmospheric soundtrack that perfectly complements the games eerie and foreboding atmosphere.

however, the games storyline has been a point of contention among players and critics alike. the plot for Death stranding is dense and complex, with large cast of characters and a convoluted narrative that can be difficult to follow. the games story also deals with heavy themes such as life, death, and the afterlife, which may not appeal to all players, however, those who are willing to invest the time and effort to understand the story will be rewarded with a thought-provoking and emotionally resonant experience. 

the games combat mechanics have also been criticized by some players, with combat encounters feeling clunky and unpolished. however, combat is not the main focus of the game, and players are centered around exploration, survival and social interaction, with combat being a secondary aspect of the gameplay.

First off, let's address the story, which is definitely a significant part of the game, and real effort has been made to stop players from skipping it, even once they have completed the game, and may just want to wander a virgin version of the landscape and just work on rebuilding america (because yes, even this mostly japanese development team has made this one of the most ameri-centric games I've ever seen.  The fate of the world is explicitly tied to the rebuilding of the USA, okay, UCA, but it really is the same thing, and it is at times nauseatingly patriotic).

But that story I mentioned, oh boy, that story. While interesting at first, is longer and more convoluted than the plot of Lost.  And makes about as much sense.  In the end, I couldn't stomach it.  Though I had played it for 60+ hours, turns out I was less than a third of the way through this beast.  Back and forth, false summit after dubious twist it goes, where it stops, Hideo only knows.  I ended up watching the remnants online and had to spam through miles of pointless dialogue to get to the (spoiler alert) hug that ends it all.  Yes, that's right, a hug, because it's all about connection.  But it's also all about connection in exactly the manner Hideo thinks best.  Connection, but without that pesky feedback loop.

This guy has a following, and I get it, he's clearly got a gift, but what he desperately needs is some friends and colleagues willing to give him honest feedback, and a box full of red pens.  Because about seven hours of the roughly eleven hours of cut scenes (really) were just pointless.

And like I said, you have to watch them.  Because the game is heavily contrived to spoon-feed you all the best stuff only after you make it through a sea of exposition.  And in the end, it all starts to feel less like a game and more like a timeshare pitch.  

This is before you get to the gameplay, which is original and inspired, and so close to great, but again, filled with needless and quickly annoying tollbooths that make each and every delivery a chore.  Every single time you make a delivery, you have to get off you bike, open the location's hub, select the delivery menu, select the 'make delivery' option, say you want to deliver requested goods, then watch a cutscene of the good's going in, then watch another cutscene of them checking the goods, each of which take loading time even if you spam the skip button, then watch an evaluation screen for each part of your delivery, each of which must be clicked through, even the ""auto-skip"" doesn't stay on, you have to keep manually 'auto'-skipping, then watch another animation of the results of these reviews being added to your overall score, then watch another freaking cutscene of them thanking you, and then go through almost the same to select a new mission.  That's thirty or so clicks and about three minutes between each bout of actually playing the game.

It's painful, and worse still, completely unnecessary.  Give me some skip settings in the options (and make said options accessible all the time, not only when I'm certain zones and off my bike.)  Stop forcing me to only play the way you like to play, start listening to the community (I am not the first to say these things) and be aware that not all gamers are alike, and not all want to consume the story the way you might prefer.  

Otherwise, while you may have made something that is, at it's core, almost beautiful, your egos have ended up wrapping it an exorbitant amount of self-aggrandizing junk, junk you won't let us have any choice over whether or not to watch.

Except the one choice, the one I made, and the one I suggest you do too, of not playing the game at all.",1680997422,1680997422,False,36,3,0.628835976123809814,1,True,False,False

It is such an odd mix of various genres that coalesce into a rather beautiful package. The game is simultaneously a delivery simulator with cooperative building elements, action and the occasional horror. It is a strange stew. Add to the mix the various 4th wall breaks, meta narrative, collectible product ad(?), and a beautiful  musical playlist. The music that plays during various deliveries and accentuates and enhances the tone with all background sound becoming muted and the camera zooms away. These are some of the best game play moments. The only issue is that for some reason, the game does not let you play music outside of the rest area. This is a strange choice as the music is great and would ease the tedium of constant delivery. The themes of the game can be rather blunt especially with the naming conventions. The game is about connections between people and the importance of those bonds. Dealing with the death or separation of loved ones. Various discussion on the nature of biological evolution as well as the idea of the soul. There are probably other ideas as well but they may have gone over my head a bit. The Execution of these ideas however can be hit or miss and the text logs can be chore to read. Like I said, the game is rather blunt and in your face. Quite literally at times.

This is the best damned game I have ever played in my life. After completing it, I'm still thinking about all of the layers and themes I encountered in this game and unpacking the narrative on a personal and human level that Kojima was telling in this story. 

Everything done here was done purposefully. Yes, the first few hours of the game are a slog, but that means when you acquire a new way to traverse this uninhabitable planet, it becomes even more rewarding. This game is very grindy, but you never actually feel like you're grinding. Again, unlocking a new way to get across this map just becomes more rewarding. 

The absolutely batshit story and themes that Kojima was exploring will keep you glued to the screen for more during these especially sluggish parts.

Hideo Kojima's Death Stranding, A Game By Hideo Kojima, developed by Kojima Productions, written and conceptualized by Hideo Kojima (featuring a special appearance by Hideo Kojima) is not a game I would easily recommend. It's tedious, slow, clunky, obtuse, and often boring. But not for me. If that's what you see when you look at gameplay, then that's likely the experience you'll get, but Death Stranding is the type of game that just clicks, provided you're the right kind of crazy. I have friends who take comfort in playing games like Animal Crossing or Stardew Valley, but my therapy game is this one. There's a serenity in the package delivery simulation - a struggle between you and the truly stunning open world. Every inch is beautifully crafted and built to be as rewarding as possible. Over every pain in the ass mountain you crest is a gorgeous view of the trail to your next destination. Besides, it's not all rough terrain and endless walking. The game provides you with all the equipment you need to succeed, and if that's still not enough, there's always other players. You see, every structure you build in the game is sent to another player's game so it may help them. Need a ladder to reach the top of this cliff? Good thing another player placed one for you. The sense of community this system builds is powerful, and it helps that you can reward other players in return by responding to supply requests and helping upgrade their structures. I would also be remiss not to mention the music, which is beautiful. Largely carried by Low Roar as well as The Silent Poets, the soundtrack is rarely ever used in-game, reserved for the moments in the open world where they would carry the most impact. This works to an unprecedented degree. The story here is trademark Kojima - deep and thought-provoking, but only if you're pretentious enough to dig into each word of dialogue and codex entry. Lucky for me, I very much am. In conclusion, Death Stranding recieves no recommendation from me, because to say it's not for everyone would be the understatement of the century, but the game feels tailor-made for me. 9/10.",1680425745,1680425745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And as some one who has played nearly every game hes created and loved/followed his games since i was young.
Kojima will forever be held as one of the most legendary game developers of my time, in my eyes.

However Death Stranding is a strange one to me, it added a lot of doubt over his games with him leaving Konami and all the negative reviews calling the game 'a walking sim', that eventually putting me off purchasing the game at release.

Till 'December 26 2022', when I received Death Stranding (standard edition) for free on the Epic Store.
Where i spent over 96+ hours playing the game non-stop and couldn't wait to come home from work to play more, I'm unsure if the game was different on release, however after playing the standard edition in 2023 there's a lot more options available to the player vs walking, while all having there own disadvantaged. Voiding most if not all reviews i've read. 

Dont get me wrong, though this game wont be to everyone's liking, Your either going to love it or hate it.

Personally i found the game oddly satisfying, building answers to the story. Don't get me wrong there are flaws in the game and the UI does take some getting used to, just like in MGSV, but ones your past that the game becomes enjoyable.

As such i decided the support the game and purchase it on my main platform, Steam. While upgrading to the 'Directors Cut' which includes more content.

I'll be sure to update this review when i get around to re-playing the 'Director's Cut' of Death stranding.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198271105938/recommended/1190460/

Let’s start from story-missions part, The Factory “chapter”. Unfortunately, this is the part where Directors Cut delivers only what feels like minimum viable product, as you can complete Factory related stuff under one hour and amount of story content given could have been fitted into one A4 paper (or save to Death Stranding 2 as a side mission would have been better solution). Heck, even the Cyberpunk 2077 collaboration missions set felt more fun than what Factory stuff did.
And that racetrack thing? Let’s just say that driving with truck in long race track is minor torture and someone at Kojima Productions should have stood up and say out loud how its not engaging gameplay. Plus vehicle controls overall in this game isn’t the best from start so yeah... hopefully we don’t see this return in DS2.

Luckily, on other parts Directors Cut brings more on the buck and expectations with few new gadgets like container firing canon, container grappling hand weapon, jet pack stabilizer that allows you to jump into air and come down without taking damage and so on. Few new side missions that bring slightly more variation to mission structure and great few new songs are also added (rest in peace Ryan Karazija, everyone from Low Roar to other people are sad for your being gone so soon).

Is Directors cut worth the 10 bucks asking price for those whom already own the base game and have beaten it long time ago? It depends, if you most cared about Death Stranding’s main story you will be disappointed. But you actually like roaming around the rocky and spacey America with containers in your back? I did and if you do, then I say it’s worth it.
Does it make game “playable” for those who dislike the original game? Absolutely not.

[h1]Verdict:[/h1]
Despite some ups and downs of directors cut, I will definitely be looking up for Death Stranding 2 and what more Hideo Kojima has to deliver to this universe. Keep on going Kojima Productions.",1679752809,1680076756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It defies conventional game design and as a result, players tend to fall into two camps: Loved it, or hated it. Very little in between. Right off the bat, you're hit with this duality: An intriguing, yet god awful opening.

The beginning of the game is just oozing with mystery and you're given just enough to sate your appetite. However, we're talking roughly 2 HOURS of cut-scenes VS about 15 minutes of gameplay. That's right, you have to watch a movie just to play the video game. It does open up a bit more after this... but that first hurdle is rough. The end of the game gets really heavy on the movie cutscenes too.

While playing Death Stranding, it becomes incredibly apparent that Kojima really just wanted to make a movie. This game LOVES it's animations. After you're done listening to a 15 minute long movie cutscene? The characters will then repeat themselves in the actual game! As if you were [u]expected[/u] to skip it! Want to increase your stamina cap? Well Sam has to get up, walk to the table, pick up an energy drink, chug that energy drink, crumple the can, and toss it in the trash before sitting down again. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. You need to do this 3 times minimum! Thank god for the skip button!!!

The story is, in a word, [b]WILD[/b]. 

A world where the dead have become stranded in the world of the living as ghosts. Longing to form connections, however, if the living and the dead ever touch: it triggers an antimatter explosion that wipes out entire civilizations! The world is broken, jaded, and lonely, just like your character, Sam Strand. Death Stranding's story is at it's best when it's tackling the humanistic stories and the connection between people. The only real critiques to the story I have is that it drip feeds you things in this god awful bomb format. Get to South Knot City? Great! Let's just go over Fragile's entire backstory all at once in a series of cut scenes! Every character get's this treatment, even Amelie and Sam. There's a LOT of good story here! It's just not told in the best way. The entire ""Secret government cover-up"" plotline was entirely unnecessary as well. It's not strong, and just kind of bogs down everything else.

The gameplay is engrossing, but divided into 2 categories: Delivery and Combat. 

When you're simply delivering packages, planning routes, and optimizing your loadout for the journey, it feels a lot like an RPG. There's a sort of strategy to it all that feels pretty rewarding. The journey is pretty chill, the world is wonderful to look at, and it's pretty easy to get into the groove. For the Delivery aspect, I highly recommend the hardest difficulty. It barely makes a difference but does incentivize you to use tools you wouldn't normally think of using. 

Combat is, a little clunky. Since the game's systems focus so heavily on balance, and balance has almost no purpose in combat, it feels pretty jarring to transition. It can also be immeasurably frustrating when you're about to drop kick somebody and Sam suddenly stumbles and you're just awkwardly running around the enemy as they shoot you. At the end of the day, the combat is serviceable, but not great. It can be frustrating at times, but it can also be pretty fun. The Difficulty setting though, really just makes enemies into bullet sponges. I beat the entire game on Very Hard, and I can say with confidence, you should just turn down the difficulty for boss fights. It doesn't make the fights much harder, but it does make each encounter much [u]longer[/u]. 

The ""Strand System"" is actually pretty awesome. Items you create can appear in other people's worlds and vice versa. Sometimes these are really helpful and come clutch! Generators, Timefall Shelters, Zip Lines, and more! The final mission of the game relies heavily on the strand system and it feels pretty good! Other times however... it can be utterly useless. Since it's based on ""Likes"" and there's no dislike feature, there's no quality control. The sheer amount of random bridges in the middle of an open field I encountered during my time playing is maddening. Sure, you can remove junk from your world, but because those structures have so many likes, they'll just reappear a few minutes later. Not much you can do about it.

All in all, Death Stranding is a divisive game. Either the story, relaxed pace, and beautiful world will suck you in or the clunky combat, forced animations, and movie long cutscenes will drive you up a wall. You'll either be intrigued, or bored. All depends on you.

There's no question in my mind that this is a fantastic game, and I enjoyed my time playing it. However, as many have said and will continue to say: this game isn't for everyone.",1679935379,1679935583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In a sentence to review the game, ""It is the first ever  time I fell asleep during a (apparently masterpiece) game!!"" Getting rid of the walking simulator mechanics would've made the game more interesting. I mean walking during games is a given these days and trying to add complexity to something basic takes the fun out of the otherwise seemingly interesting story plot which i tried hard to enjoy but the experience was just killing the mood.

The tutorial/prologue takes 2 hours to complete. So can't refund the game after that. Tried it for another 3 hours and I just can't get myself to enjoy it. Don't be like me and countless other who purchased this game and expect a good game out of it. It is most certainty not a game for me.

I enjoyed the walking mechanics right from the beginning, and the licensed music that plays at key moments sets a really unique tone. I often play this game after a really long day, and it's nice to have an option that isn't demanding you play at your best all the time.
That being said, it is a long game, and the stealth and combat are not implemented particularly well. While I find the story interesting, cutscenes are few and far between (though they are all quite substantial), and I don't think it is engaging enough to keep you going if you don't enjoy playing the game.

Death Stranding has captured my heart and soul in a way few works of fiction have ever managed.  It's been like watching a dream or a vision I've had since I was a child come to life in shockingly vivid detail.  Something like this world was always lurking at the edges of my innermost fantasies, but never fully realized until I saw this.  It now consumes my thoughts whenever I'm not playing it like a drug addiction.  Asking me if I would recommend this game is like asking me if I recommend breathing.  If you consider yourself a true fan of the science fiction genre or just action adventure/survival horror games you are doing yourself a great disservice by missing out on this genre bending achingly beautiful work of art.  For me at least, it set the bar higher than I ever thought possible for a third person PC game.

The game introduces several futuristic concepts, such as wireless power, warp-3D printing structures, exoskeletons, and assistive devices. It also touches on heavy themes of life, death, multiverses, and logistics, which add to the overall complexity of the game. Not to mention some horror elements thrown in too which get under your skin. 

The game's gameplay requires meticulous planning and consideration, and world traversal becomes a puzzle that is sometimes frustratingly challenging and sometimes delightfully relaxing. While it may not appeal to all types of players, the game's various sub-systems create an interesting loop of gameplay that can be appreciated with patience.

Managing trips and routes, as well as preparing for unknown obstacles, is crucial in the game, just as it is in real-life hikes and logistics. The game instills a sense of Zen as players manage gear and navigate through the game's landscapes, which in turn, enhances appreciation for real-world movement and the movement of delivery. 

The game has its share of frustrating moments, which is intentional, and its storytelling is on par with or better than anything Kojima has done previously. The meta conversations interspersed with moments of playful disbelief at the game's scope is presented to us in very Kojima ways. The level design and pacing are well done, and I am curious about where any potential sequel will take us.

Throw in pretty unique hybrid multiplayer elements that can improve your trips and encourages you to think about others is an interesting design choice I did not expect to influence me as much as it did. 

Overall, this is a great game for players who enjoy meticulous organization and action elements.",1679432524,1679432524,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

This sentence perfectly encompasses my experience with the game. Don't be fooled; I'm still going to buy DS2 once it comes out, but if I am to recommend the game or the series to anyone, it would be to a very narrow slither of the population. I'll try to outline why. (Note: For the purposes of this review, I will not be distinguishing between the base game and the Director's Cut edition)

To start with, let's go over the basic premise of the game... which is easier said than done. In a post-apocalyptic USA, you play Sam Porter Bridges, himself played by actor Norman Reedus. Sam, as his aptonym would suggest, is a ""porter"", a deliveryman in the UCA, or United Cities of America. After the titular and apocalyptic ""Death Stranding"" event not long in the game’s past, the world became a hostile place, with most people disconnected and unable to contact one another, physically or otherwise. The ones who do the job of connecting people - transferring messages or goods or even people - is that of a porter; vaguely similar to a courier or deliveryperson. As a notoriously good porter, known as  ""The Great Deliverer"", DS sees you guiding Sam across America to reconnect it, delivering goods, facing various threats, and learning how he can himself connect with others along the way. There is far, FAR more to it, but that’s the basic story.

The game’s creator, Hideo Kojima, has notoriously described it as ""the first 'strand-type' game"". While quite obfuscatory, this has been interpreted as meaning, basically, ""the first game of a new genre, characterised by incorporation of social connectivity"". We could argue what this means, or whether multiplayer games are ""strand-like"", but there IS something to be said about the relatively novel aspects of the game. Specifically, DS implements asymmetric multiplayer interaction: your actions can affect the game world of other players, items you build can be sent to players with whom you otherwise have no other interaction. Every player plays Sam Porter Bridges, and you can help each other across the gap between universes, as it were.

But, if we're blunt, this says little about what the game actually is or how it plays in any pragmatic way. So, down to the brass tacks: what genre is DS, really? I would say it's a third-person exploration game with vague action and horror elements, with a mostly sci-fi storyline. A common joke is that it's a ""walking simulator"", but there's a lot more to it than JUST walking, and the walking you do is actually so involved it prevents the game from being an effective walking simulator most of the time... but it’s true there’s a hell of a lot of walking. In a world where most technology is destroyed, how else are you meant to deliver all those packages? You travel between cities and shelters, carrying packages on your back, avoiding ghost-like threats and humans who will try to kill you or steal your cargo, while eventually unlocking means by which to make your deliveries easier. Sometimes you have guns or grenades, sometimes you use ""stealth"" to avoid detection or capture or loss of deliveries, sometimes you drive vehicles to get to your destination faster. But, in essence, it's a third-person exploration game.

And the exploration is great! No matter what else, remember the quote at the start: DS IS a masterpiece. The world is gorgeous, the music is beautiful, the characters look great... it's just a shame there feels to be so little of each of these elements, all considered. The game was somehow enough to compel me to play for over 100 hours, yes, but how much of that time was spent on ""unique"" activities? I'd argue not much. DS is almost undeniably unique as a whole, but if you want to get all achievements? Or if you even just want to beat the main game? You'll be doing a lot of nothing; nothing much other than walking, anyway. Unique walking though it may be.

Regardless of your videogame preferences, it’s likely you’ve heard of the creator whom I mentioned earlier; Hideo Kojima. Kojima is perhaps most well-known for the Metal Gear series, of which I am a huge fan. DS is Kojima’s first game after his departure from Metal Gear publisher Konami. DS is the first and thus far only game of Kojima’s eponymous studio, Kojima Productions. Nonetheless, he has very much brought the same charm from Metal Gear to this new venture. Just as with Metal Gear, DS is a dizzying combination of highly polished gameplay and absolutely buck-wild, oddly America-centric storytelling. But, quite unlike Metal Gear Solid V for instance, I would say DS ironically feels quite disconnected, not like a cohesive whole. While this could just be the full creative prowess of Kojima unleashed, DS feels like it’s a lot of ideas packed into not a lot of product. This can be seen in various ways, including the raw foundations of the game, its story, and its broader world.

DS’s game engine, Decima, is shared with the Horizon games, among others, which I’ve also seen praised for polished gameplay and excellent visuals; DS is evidently coming from solid foundations, reflected in what is generally a very smooth gameplay experience. As I’ve mentioned, it is a beautiful game to play, seeing you traversing snowy mountains, desolate wastelands, verdant fields, and beyond. The oddly incorporated combat elements work well enough, with novel mechanics that may owe their execution to the engine. Despite the good Decima brings, the mechanics are all over the place design-wise; travel, while a core element of the game, is a complete pain, for instance. While the basic premise of this “strand game” is connection, none of it feels “active”; it’s all quite passive. You never engage with other players directly, only indirectly. Even from a story perspective, Sam is reluctant to connect with anyone[spoiler], and even after his quest to “reconnect America” is complete, he states a desire to remain unconnected[/spoiler].

This disconnect comes across in the game’s raw construction as well; a game is not an engine alone. While it was actually the first Metal Gear after Kojima’s departure, without his involvement, I said in my review of Metal Gear Survive that it did not stand up beyond its foundations in the Fox Engine. Both Survive and DS are bizarre worlds built upon good mechanical foundations. But while both games feel like they operate a lot off of some appeal to “rule of cool”, there are vastly different interpretations of what this might look like; while Survive is bizarre yet boring, DS is bizarre in a way that will, admittedly, leave you hooked and wanting more.

I’ve seen many say DS can be a calming, meditative, and almost addictive experience. I can certainly attest to that. Coming out in late 2019, the game was almost prophetic in its reflection of the real world during the Covid-19 pandemic; the game reflected that feeling of disconnection, but its relatively slow-pace, long-form gameplay made the experience feel like just the kind of mind-numbing that was needed when the world seemed to be falling apart. But would we have loved it in the same way if Covid had not happened? I’m honestly not sure.

All-in-all, Death Stranding is a wholly strange game. The story is so convoluted and so “Kojima” so as to be compelling, at least to me; the gameplay is so unique but so frustrating as to unintentionally be a challenge in frustration; and the artistic direction is so beautiful as to somehow hold this whole mess together. In its entirety, I think I would only recommend DS to those who are patient, those who want to try something new, or those who are already fans of Kojima. Otherwise - if you’re looking for something quick and easy, something predictable, or just another typical AAA experience - you’re likely to be disappointed.

- [b]Terrain is your enemy:[/b] Everything that had to do with overcoming the terrain was unique. I have not seen any game embrace the “simulation” part so much of a “walking simulator”. This game proves that there are still triple-A games out there trying out new stuff. There is something inherently satisfying about going from the base of a mountain to the top, especially if it is made challenging and you have many tools to help you. I could see some improvements but it's impressive what the game does.

- [b]Strong ending and subjects:[/b] I thought the very end of the main storyline was very good. It’s pretty open for interpretation but I kind of like that. In my mind it touches on some heavy themes without making it too explicit. [spoiler] Specifically I am talking about bringing Lou to the incinerator. And subjects like parenthood and miscarriage. It normalises pregnancy and childbirth in a way. The game is full of references to these subjects that unfortunately are still a taboo in society. [/spoiler]

- [b]Interesting NPCs[/b] Some of the NPC’s are very memorable and unique. I love Heartmen [spoiler] It’s such a cool character trait that he dies every 21 minutes for 3 minutes. They really used that trait to its full extend.[/spoiler], Moma & Lockne [spoiler]The twins that are actually the same person is very weirdly portrait, I love it.[/spoiler] and Cliff [spoiler]It’s such a sad story and was played very well. The only one where I was surprised by the pun in his name. With him opposing Bridges, while he is named Cliff.[/spoiler]

- [b]General weirdness:[/b] Love the general weirdness of the game. They try to explain just enough that it sort of makes sense what is happening to the world. And the inhabitants of the world are so used to this just being the state of the world.

- [b]Floating carrier:[/b] The floating carrier is a great tool to play around with. It can be used as a snowboard to go down hills and just to pile on cargo. It feels great to have it.

- [b]Music plays out of nowhere:[/b] The real magic moments happen when you are travelling and the perfect song starts playing. It makes you appreciate the world even more. Unfortunately opening a menu will cut it short. I actively tried to not open menus during these moments even though I would need to.


[h1]What I didn’t like[/h1]
- [b]Music player while travelling:[/b] Would have been nice to have it similar to changing the radio stations in GTA while in a car. Though I can understand that you would then lose the effect of the music suddenly starting to play out of nowhere.

- [b]Story surprises:[/b] The quality of the story is all over the place. Some moments are brilliant and others confusing or awkward. [spoiler] For example I was confused why “Moma” suddenly died when I delivered her to Locke. There was no build up for it. Though the moment after was a cool story point. Also the running on the beach with Amelie was kind of awkward. [/spoiler]

- [b]Vehicles:[/b] I honestly think the game would have been better without the vehicles. They drive kind of floaty and circumvent most of the interesting restrictions like rain and falling over. Especially on rough terrain you can kind of jank your way through it without taking to much damage. They are the optimal way of playing without any of the fun. I would advise to stick to walking and only use vehicles on roads. I hope for the second game that they improve this. They should implement systems like in the Dakar Rally games or SnowRunner/MudRunner where the terrain is also your enemy.

- [b]Obscure ways to progress story:[/b] Especially at the end of the main story there are some obscure ways to progress. I almost gave up and looked it up online. Only for Sam to say it outloud. This happened a couple of times. [spoiler] The way to reach Amelie in Chapter 8 deep in the tar pit for example. I was looking for a way around. But apparently you have to get caught by a BT on purpose to trigger the floating buildings. You have to do what you are trying the entire game to avoid to progress? I also had this after having to reach Higgs and Amelie on the beach. How should I know that Fragile can jump me there? And lastly the shooting of Amelie. Had to look this one up. It’s heavily implied that you have to shoot here. But what you actually have to do is put away your gun and hug here.[/spoiler]. 

- [b]Boss fights feel out of place:[/b] I didn’t like any of the boss fights. They have little to do with the main gameplay and often turn into a mediocre third person shooter. [spoiler] Didn’t really like the fighting mini game with Higgs in the end. It felt forced and was a bit too long.[/spoiler] 

- [b]Menus are slow:[/b] It takes too much time to bring up the map and switch between menus like the private stash. It might seem like a small thing but it adds up.

- [b]Too much Tell, and not Show in the last part of the story:[/b] There was a bit of a lore dump and too many reminders from the NPC’s at the end  of the main story. It got a bit annoying. I like that some parts of the game were mysterious.

- [b]Player progression feels meaningless:[/b] The reward you get for doing optional missions feels pretty meaningless. You just get “likes”, it’s kind of funny with the relation to social media, but it also caused me to not care much about the side content. It’s not entirely clear how you unlock new tools. I seemed to just randomly get them from some side-content.

[h1]Why others should try it[/h1]
It was a pretty good game. I did just focus on the main story and didn’t feel the need to do much of the side content. The building of roads was satisfying but too much of a grind to really be bothered with. I would advise new players to try the game out for 2 hours and see if they like the “walking simulator” part of the game. If you don’t, just refund. You will be doing it alot.

If you haven't played it yet, go for it. The small but sensible QOL changes and new improved introduction will make it easier to get into. The new addons are fun, the VR missions are enjoyable and the new tools all have their uses in the sandbox. Given everything else is the same, I'll just copy my original review-

Death Stranding is the best game I love but find it hard to recommend to almost anyone because it feels like a game deliberately made for me.
To get my criticism out of the way- the story in much of the style of MGS4 is a combination of me laughing out loud and just being completely lost for words, you have all sorts of big cameo stars doing extraordinarily contrived dialogue and being weird all over the place, with some of them being characters I don't want to be around with, the boss fights and combat scenarios are hilariously bad and the spooky stuff are disappointingly easy to defeat.

However, as much as it paints it as hours of bizarre, stupid plot, there is one thing about this game I can’t get enough of, the entire experience of ‘porting’. 
In this bizzare post-apocalypse, it's your job to hand supplies manually from A to B, and you are left to figure it out yourself, carrying heavy cargo and dealing with the wild terrain, enemy factions, and supernatural anomalies.

It might be because I like hiking, but everything about the simple act delivery is executed with a wonderful cohesive design. You have plenty of tools to plan, scout ahead, prepare, take notes and optimize your routes, and as you improve your skills as a player you go from having a ladder placed to cross a river to knowing exactly how to move around dangerous hills with confidence.

Your backtracking allows you to leave tools and equipment behind in the field and delivery knots to rely on in the future, as well as build structures other players can help you upgrade or use as well.
This brings me to the rather exaggerated “strand” mechanics, which are an important tool of the game to carry it’s themes and also have players get a true feeling of cooperation.

Seasoned users can equally help and assist newbies with things from warning signs to a perfectly placed zip line route. It’s a really nice way to have people help each other out and motivate them to carry on.
The care for Sam carries this as well, with the tools at his disposal all having useful ways to help with your travelling. Nothing in your equipment is useless and all have their place, it's a matter of you finding your rhythm and playstyle.
And in a way, this does justify the bland combat, as to be honest, if it was more demanding it would probably be a game too stressful to handle. I am confident almost anyone can beat the game, it just requires patience and most importantly- persistence.

In the end, the best way to boil it down is whenever you are at a peak of a hill, you see for yourself the hard work you’ve put in getting there. This feeling of mastery within a zen-like relaxed and laid back gameplay creates an aura of peace and a refreshing change of pace I haven’t gotten in any game for a while now.

It’s probably not the game you expected, and I’m late to say that, but if you need something that completely shifts gears and lets you have a more soothing experience (and you can put up with Kojima creatividad at his worst) there is a chance this might also be a game you’ll enjoy.",1678926351,1678926430,True,86,1,0.830323278903961182,2,True,False,False

The game mechanics are fine, but for the most part it's pretty standard for a 3rd person view with a little bit of stealth mixed in. After so many years of similar experiences from other games, there isn't anything that makes this game stand out.

The main story line is not very exciting and for me it was pretty predictable on the ending. Even the big name actors in this game couldn't carry a bad story. My only motivation in the game was to really find out if I was correct at the end.

It definitely has all the hallmarks of a Kojima game.

And unfortunately the enemies are largely neutered completely about half way through the game. But I will say that the story is actually super interesting. You sorta have to suspend your disbelief in that one ""city"" that you can reach in about five minutes of travel is half-way across the continental US, but whatevs. The story is good enough (and the graphics are spectacular) that 20 hours in I'm ignoring what I would consider as mediocre gameplay to get the next part in the story.

But not even 20 mins in the game crashed, tried several solutions online but nothing worked until it randomly didn't happen once (going to the southern city in area 2) thought great it might have fixed itself but nope, went to the farm for a delivery and it crashed constantly there instead so no choice but to refund and go back to the standard edition.

The standard edition lags like crazy in some parts to the point i've fallen off bridges and ran into walls several times thus needing to reload but at least it didn't crash once.

These issues have been around since launch what i could see online so they really should fix it but probably won't. if anyone reads this and is on the fence i would recommend the standard edition instead even with it's issues as it's at least playable.

hopefully if there is a sequel they take some time optimizing to avoid this happening again or change the game engine to something stable.



Note this part is for the original edition, as it isn't on Steam i couldn't write it there but for that one it's recommended for the DC edition it's still very much not so:

To begin with, it's not for everyone!

You have to not be accustomed to immediate gratification, instead take your time and enjoy the journey or you likely won't find any fun here.

Did every order on Hard, with the added requirements for LL Grade and really enjoyed my time. Once you have ziplines up you don't even have to pay much attention and can be a little proud of the planing that went into a well setup fast travel system but it wasen't all great.

The gameplay itself i have no real problems with, it is what it said it would be, but the stability of some areas are terrible.

Mainly anywhere there are a lots of rocks or BT spawn zones, the location near one of the Delivery points are worst as it always lags horrible when you go on the road there. (for those that have played, it's near the Cosplayer)

The game isn't demanding with the settings i have though my CPU is a bit old but it didn't have a high load most of the time but at a few locations the game lags so badly any input is done multiple times and if you are turning, say on a swerving road, it will very often just cause you to drive off and ruin any cargo you had.

This happens for example at, Road near Mountain Knot City, Road near Cosplayer, Near Mountain to southern part of first map to name a few.

It might be caused by the added spawns of BTs in those areas with the already cluttered landscape or maybe the texture for wet and dry of the same areas aren't separated enough = load double the assets. Hard to say for sure but no settings helped noticeable for these.

(Have: RTX 2070, Intel I5 7500, 16gb ram so should run decent at medium settings but alas)

Also tried midway to upgrade to DC edition but that was an unstable mess that kept crashing so was refunded in the end, nothing i tried helped meanwhile this one only crashed once but now and again was missing textures both in cutscenes and during gameplay.

There are several QoL i would like to see if they make another ex: 
-No bikes/trucks allowed to spawn on roads, kept driving into them during timelimited missions.
-Zipline paths should be kept clear when the game spawns in other porters structures, it kept breaking forcing you to destroy stuff, mostly bridges.
-Don't boot you out of terminals all the time, if i deliver something let me pick more orders up right away. If i want to leave i can easily do so after myself.
-Improve the driving up slopes, i swear it seems to be ice physics on some slopes so you have to reload multiple times for some timed missions as i constantly slip off slopes, it frankly is just annoying.
-Improve stability, I'd rather be able to play smoothly than having the nicest graphics. The lag issue has been around since launch so either they didn't find a solution (Maybe engine limitation) or didn't care enough to fix, it is also in the DC edition so leaning to engine problems.

The downsides are fairly minor so if you are on the fence about getting it then either wait for a sale or watch some gameplay first as again it really isn't for everyone but those that it works for while enjoy the journey :)",1677649741,1678261322,False,0,0,0.48913043737411499,0,True,False,False

They have added a race track and made doing the Roadster courses a requirement for 100% achievements (fortunately you do not have to do the bike courses as the bikes have an annoying 'feature', where they turn in the opposite direction you a pressing when not boosting before hard turning in the direction you want to go in - makes for a really bad experience for no reason and my only real complaint about this version of the game).

The other obvious change is the BT's now re-spawn after a while, I understand they wanted it to be harder however, it does remove some of the peaceful wondering effect the first game has once you are nearing completion and I do think that was something worth keeping. However, that is likely just a me thing.

Last thing I want to mention is they seem to have fixed 'things' disappearing (At least for my computer setup), which was a bug in the last game that caused the terrain and almost everything else to start disappearing at random, the longer you played the less there was left. You could still interact with them they just were not visible. This bug has resulted in some unusual pictures relating to when Sam showers etc. Anyway good remake and enjoyed my play through.

Below is my review of Death Stranding, which should provide the details on what the game is like to play.

Have fun :)

--------Review from the original Death Stranding--------

The first Hideo Kojima game I have played (to my knowledge) and I was not disappointed. I liked the plot and the game play.

I actually played it with the sharing turned down to its lowest setting (I wanted to try it out raw for a first play through) and I liked that experience. Once I finished all 500 orders, I turned the sharing on to full and that works well to but at 274 hours I am not sure there would be another play through. Knowing what the sharing is like if they make a second game, I would like there to be more sharing options since I would have liked to have peoples signs up all the time and only a select few buildings (randomly selected) within areas that I picked.

I liked that the game transitions play styles as you 'get better' via the equipment you collect/can use and build. The objectives you have to figure out are a nice touch too (You can make wrong choices until you make the correct choice) and I particularly liked the birthday message you can receive on your birthday :) .

I like the like system (I managed to almost receive 1.5 Million likes in the game by the time I'd finished all achievements), though I had to remove some things I built due to limitations in the network and if they make a second game it would be nice to have a way to generate ever grater network to avoid this (Balanced by grind so game completion does not become too easy).

The only negatives I have are:
- The walking, when Sam falls over because the ground is an 'unsuitable surface' yet the normal surfaces make that ground inconsequential (I am thinking cliff material but its only half a foot high and I just need him to step up onto it).
- A similar thing with the trucks and going uphill on any surface even in perfect dry conditions being unable to stay straight or turn (not the most believable aspect since I drive a 1 Litre car and have no issues like this). Having made this point, you can 'boost' your way up most places in the trucks.
- The out of bounds areas are invisible walls in areas (I have a thing for uncovering all the map in games so I tend to find these in games where the map is larger than can be explored). 

I know some people described it as an Amazon simulator and it is true there are a lot of deliveries however, you do not need to do them all only the ones for the quest/story. Also, later in the game you can turn it into more of a hunting game killing of BTs and taking out Mules to get their loot. I would also argue that a lot of games are just delivery yourself to various points on a map anyway and this one makes it more about caring for something else, getting to where you going in the state it needs to be kept. Though again if you do not fancy moving things from A to B a lot of the time this game might not be for you.

This is certainly a game I enjoyed and I think a game worth playing.

Have fun :)",1678225475,1678225475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After the end of the game, I was negative about the Death Stranding. But when writing a review, I weighed all the pros and cons, and was surprised that despite so many positive qualities, I was dissatisfied with this project. Need to mention that before buying this game I haven’t seen any gameplay videos, but have seen articles where was only said - Kojima is genius. Despite the fact that I didn’t enjoy the game, Death Stranding has much advantages.

[h1] Main Plot [/h1]

The plot in general is very interesting. From the very beginning in first hour I heard so much time words ‘Chiralium’ and ‘America’, that each next time I heard this words - just was laughing from scenario. Later on plot shows why Chiralium is integrated in each word. But why each character continue to repeat ‘Save America’, I don’t know; I understood from the the first time that our main mission is to recover America.
From the side of the plot - World rules or lore built very properly. All things are connected and it has logical explanation, each new information doesn’t contradicts earlier information, but rather reinforces it and connects things that at first glance cannot be connected in any way.

From the side of scenario dialogues may be done better. During all gameplay - all characters have been only sources of information, and one scene was allocated for the disclosure of each character. For the most part, the plot was concentrated only at the beginning and end of the game. In the middle characters have been repeating their own words and mostly we had no new information, of course in the middle was some story advancement, but compared to all the game time, this story expansion was very small. To understand - we have 2,5 hour movie in the beginning and 4 hours movie at the end, but in the middle each 2-4 hours of gameplay we have 10-20 minutes of cutscenes.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

[b] Main Gameplay [/b]

Gameplay pissed me off. First 10 hours I didn’t understand what’s going on, how to plan the journey and what should I take, that’s why I was traveling with all things collected before. After 15 hours of gameplay I finally understood what should I look at, how to plan the journey and where should I turn to avoid stealth or fighting.
During the journey may be seen two types of enemies: BTs and MULEs. With BTs better to use stealth and with MULEs you need to have shooter. But in reality I had no confrontations with them, because I just run, and when I ran away from their zones - both BTs and MULEs stop to run after me.

In the game I had only 6 direct confrontations with enemies: 3 with BTs and 3 with soldiers. All of them have been due to scenario. So all my gameplay was concentrated on running, walking and riding a bike or car.

[b] Multiplayer [/b]

Multiplayer in this game is realized in a way - your cars and buildings may be seen by other players and they may like it. So such type of multiplayer makes gaming experience of other players much easier. And it’s realized very good, this type of Multiplayer gave me the desire to help other players with my buildings. But in reality I had no sharp need to make buildings on my way, because most of them have been done before me. So I just was using other players ropes and if necessary added some my ropes to connect them.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Death Stranding is a game made very properly, here I had only one crash for 35 hours. The plot is really good, world lore is built wonderful. The only thing I couldn’t enjoy is gameplay. With all cutscenes we have around ≈10 hours of movie all other 25 hours I had a courier simulator. That’s why I can’t recommend this game, because gameplay is most part of the game. I wouldn’t recommend to play Death Stranding for plot without enjoying the gameplay, because there is big gameplay parts between plot advancement. The game has many positive moments, and it would be definitely a lie if I tell that I didn’t enjoy the game at all. I deeply believe that the game has an invaluable contribution to the development of the gaming industry, despite the fact that I did not fully enjoy the Death Stranding.",1678058947,1678058947,False,15,0,0.503033101558685303,0,True,False,False

- Great story, amazing voice acting, fantastic graphics not requiring a beefy GPU and last but not least 2 memorable characters that many know and love from the Hollywood movies are present In this game.

Many strongly just consider this game to be walking sim and nothing more, but that is simply no all that's to It. That claim would be same If me saying that the only thing you do In GTA Is drive cars. We all know that Is not true, but It's a very big aspect of the game, just like walking Is In DEATH STRANDING.
 
Yes, you are going to be walking a lot. However the walking aspect of the game Is challenging, and that makes It Immersive and also rather challenging depending on the game difficulty one choose. Furthermore, the later on In the game you typically would be spending the most transport time on structures build by you PCC's like the really convenient zip-line or the jumpingpads and If you prefer other transport methods, crafting bikes Is also possible (by episode 3). 

To conclude, of course any game Isn't perfect and this game certainly also have It's flaws.
- The Inventory mechanics feels a little clunky
- The PCC lvl 2 Is too overpowered 
- The ending Is too long of a segment In the game In my oppinion

Gameplay is original, varied and mostly fun, if at times slightly boring (you can only deliver so many packages). Sound and music is great. acting is good. Main story is strange but cool. The explanation of the plot is confusing. The character names are so silly that that it is immersion-breaking. Writing is VERY BAD, like a mexican soap opera. Dialogue is so bad as to be immersion breaking. VERY annoyingly other ""online"" players can put these stupid holograms and signs all over an otherwise beautiful landscape. Cut-scenes are WAY too long, I found myself starting to skip through them around chapter 8. The two-hour long ending is a joke, the first 90 minutes could have been done in 5 minutes. Characters are mixed, some are 2-dimensional cut-outs (the terrorist bad guy, oh my, that guy makes no sense - what the hell is his motivation again? He met Amelie and just changed his mind, huh?) and others feel like properly developed real people interacting with each other. Again, parts of the main story are excellent, yet other smaller parts are a confused mess that feels like the explanation is ""space magic"" instead of a logical comprehensive story - although I think this is due to the fact that you spend 95% of the game not really knowing what the hell is going on. The gameplay is so original that this could have been one of the best games of all time, and it is almost annoying how the game can shift from being great to being dull so quickly. Because of that and the bad writing, dialogue, overly-complicated and at times nonsensical story, it remains just a very good original game with some boring bits.

And the beginning was very intriguing in terms of the story, at least it felt that way when I tried a pirated version. A few first minutes were enough to tell me: I need to buy this, it promises to be good. So I did buy it. And then I tried playing more.
I knew there will be lots of walking, and I thought I could live with that for the story. Firstly, the walking is not just long, but annoying, because of mechanics attached to them. And I can understand the reasoning for the mechanics, but when there is so much barren land to cover while suffering from them... That was already sucking the life out of me.
Secondly, the story... No. It has a really good hook, but than it starts falling apart right away with myriad of little things, that just show that whoever wrote this, has no idea how people behave in real life and has no talent to imagine how they could behave in these extraordinary circumstances. And even outside of human behavior lots of practical things in the world simply do not make sense.

But this game is the embodiment of ""The journey is what matters, not the destination"". it's a game about the bonds that tie us all together, whether fleeting or permanent. it's a game about picking yourself up from the lowest lows, dusting yourself off and getting on with it. It's a game that shows you no matter how alone you feel, or how distant you try to make yourself, there's always someone out there who can help. And that there's always someone you can help too, if you try hard enough. Some things are inevitable, but the indomitability of the human spirit will always shine through.

I don't even know how to formulate a coherent and well structured review for this game because my emotions are all over the place lol, but to cut to the chase this shit is wayyyy more than just a walking simulator. This is a beautiful game and I HIGHLY suggest people to play this if you value story rich games. Of course, the first two to three chapters are bit of an annoyance to get through if you have low patience and low tolerance, but once you get past the first two chapters and really start to understand the flow and mechanics of the game, you'll get addicted, just as I did. I was NOT expecting to pour 70+ hours into this game. 

Kojima and everyone who worked on this game created a true work of art, this is one of the greatest entries in gaming and 100% in my top 10 video games of all time. This is not your average video game, this is an emotional experience that will move you in so many ways. I've felt every emotion while playing this game, anger, sadness, happiness, melancholy, you name it. I haven't felt this much emotion from a video game since Silent Hill 2. The story within this game is so fucking beautiful words cant even summarize how good it is, there is just so much heart and soul put into the story and its lore. You can tell everyone who played their role in this game put their all into it. Norman as Sam, Mads as Cliff, Troy as Higgs, and everyone else did wonderfully. I was not expecting Cliff and Higgs to be such incredible ""antagonists"". And Sam has such perfect development throughout the game, his conclusion is PERFECT. 

The music in this game is so fucking good, the way Kojima implemented Low Roars music is so damn good. I wanna thank Kojima for introducing me to Low Roar because their music is incredible. Ludvig Forssel made an OST that fits this game perfectly, it captures the vibe of Death Stranding so well. I must add that bb's theme is spectacular, definitely my favorite track in this game. The graphics are awesome, not the greatest but they're great. I have like 100+ screenshots for this game because of how cool the stuff in this game looked. There are some dope ass moments in this game that wow you. I am a sucker for weird and breathtaking imagery and Death Stranding has it. The acting in this game is also very good, Tommie Jenkins as Die Hardman surprisingly stole the show, theres a specific part of the game where his acting got me super emotional. Norman Reedus towards the end of the game also did fucking great, he made me get teary and any actor that makes me tear up is great in my books. 

I could ramble on for hours writing a review for this game, but it'd just turn into a 10 page essay. Needless to say, this is an incredibly well made game and I am SO excited for Death Stranding 2, and the fact that it will most likely top this game excites me even more. I am for sure preordering the shit out of DS2 when it releases. Kojima is truly a genius. I want him to make a movie so bad, but you could argue that Death Stranding is a film, just a really long one lol.

Death Stranding is such an awesome game and I enjoy it so much, yet it is safe to say it is not for everyone because there is no exciting gunplay or swordplay - it is a slow-paced walking simulator. Normally for walking simulator, walking is merely a mean to move the story forward, in here walking is the game, as all you do is to walk from point to point delivering cargos. But it is not just simple walking - you will have to manage stamina, balance, battery, weight, delivery time, cargo stability and integrity as well as challenges from different terrains and weather while facing threats from bandits, terrorists and ghosts (BT). It can actually go pretty in-depth, involving some real-life logistics questions such as how to arrange delivery order (as in a particular sequence) from point to point to make the most out of each run, or how to position each transfer point (zipline station) to maximize the coverage with minimal numbers of stations. There is no other game like Death Stranding and as such a unique game, the gameplay and mechanics are surprisingly refined and polished. It manages to be reasonably realistic to be challenging, but does not overdo it to avoid being too much of a grind.

I find the gameplay strangely addictive. There were a few times that I fired up the game at night, the next thing I know is the sun came out. There is always stuff to do and cargo to deliver and I feel oddly satisfied doing them, but it greatly varies from person to person. I read online comments saying this game is stupid, tedious, or meaningless, and from what I have read and seen, it seems Asian people tend to more appreciate the game than people in the west (particularly North America). I don’t know if it is the culture or the game simply appeals more to certain demographics or something, it is hard to tell whether you will like it or not. But I like it anyway, as I find the game not only offers a good sense of exploration as an open-world game, but also offers a great sense of expedition because each delivery is not easy. After going through all the steep terrains and hardship, the sense of completion and achievement is immense, sweet and satisfying.

It is not always hardship though. As you progress through the game, you are rewarded with gears like vehicle and zipline which not only make your life so much easier but also offer a good sense of progression. However, you will have to earn it by doing quests or other things, per se, finding a good zipline spot, which is not simple as I spent tens of hours doing it (and maintenance). But it is the thing you have to earn that is precious, and it is the hardship and challenges that make you appreciate other people, as the game implements this Social Strand System allowing players’ constructions to be shared and used across the community. It is a very creative and genius design that aligns with the main idea of the game – connection - as a profound reminder that we humans as a society are not to conflict but to help each other with shared efforts.

[h1]Flaws[/h1]
Some imperfections are hard to avoid, and combat is arguably the weakest part of the game. I don’t mind that it doesn’t have many combats since it is primarily a delivery game, but I don’t like the combat not having much momentum. By design, you need to switch weapons a lot in combat and might even have to go into the inventory, which kills the momentum. To make matters worse, all weapons are clustered with other non-combat tools in one scroll wheel, so you have to pick the desired weapons among other items during hectic combats. Since the game leaves D-Pad down button unused (unless in sub-menu), it is simple to use down button as dedicated weapon button, and when it is pressed, use other D-Pad buttons for lethal, non-lethal arms and grenades (controller control is uncustomizable). It is such an easy fix and could make combat so much better, and I really don’t understand why it uses a bad design instead.

As for others, because the game doesn’t have a good enough mechanic for measuring and planning, picking proper zipline spots is cumbersome; there are an excessive amount of cutscenes in regular actions and have to be manually skipped each time and after hours in, they are going to be a hassle; the menu design is not good enough for the amount inventory management you need to do in this game, and it has a weird control logic you need to get used to. Additionally, community construction is not shared between the original and Director’s Cut, so returned players may have to rebuild a lot of things.

[h1]Story[/h1]
I reviewed Phantom Pain a few years ago and stated Hideo Kojima is not a very good storyteller, it still stands in this game. This game has a fascinating and unique post-apocalypse setting, and the main ideas of the story are “connection” and “life and death”. The former is well demonstrated through gameplay yet doesn’t translate into the story because all side characters just talk about connection but don’t do anything to make players feel relatable or “connect” with them. For the latter, each episode is centered around one character and their view of “life and death”, packed with metaphors, symbolism, philosophical thoughts and an uncomfortable amount of male nudity (just kidding). I don’t have an opinion about this one. I enjoy the narrative tone and pacing and how Kojima packed in some wacky stuff, however, most of the story is just explaining things and there are some cringe dialogues like “I am Fragile, but not that fragile”. In terms of the plot, it kind of falls apart from episode 9 with an unnatural and convoluted twist with seemingly inconsistent characters, but the epilogue (ep14) is so good and touching that I am willing to cut it a slack.

[h1]Presentation[/h1]
In previous review, I also stated Hideo Kojima is a director like Michael Bay (who is not a good storyteller) that can put out some stunning visual and presentation, and Death Stranding proves my point once again. Despite some low-res textures on the edge of the map, this game is photo-realistically beautiful overall. Cutscenes are meticulously crafted with shadows, lighting, contrast, object layout and proportion, along with beautiful, beautiful music and the amazing acting that can be viewed as the pinnacle of video game acting by the actors. And a few parts of the game are very emotionally contagious. On the flip side, primarily as a console game, it doesn’t offer enough graphical options despite it coming with excellent optimization, and music is usually so brief that it ends before going past the chorus. I wish I could turn on the music manually when delivering.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
In conclusion, Death Stranding is a well-crafted, one of its kind experiences like no others. Fans said it is not just a game, but an art piece, and I can totally get behind this opinion. With that said, it is not a mainstream game and is not for everyone. But if it clicks with you, it clicks hard.",1676456295,1676456295,True,55,0,0.794671297073364258,0,True,False,False

Now, I've never played the metal gear games. I have no attachment to Kojima or his supposed genius. I went in expecting wacky ass-pull writing but oh boy did I get it in far greater spades than I ever expected. But that's not why I hate the game, no. If you beware spoilers, probably stop reading, since with the nature of the plotline I'm really not sure where to start considering things spoilers so I'm just not going to. Let's see:

Things I liked in Death Stranding, in whatever order I think of them:
- Sam
- Sam saying ""bullsh*t"" to stupid plot twists at the same time I did
- Deadman (grew on me)
- Exploring the map to make number go up
- The part of the game where you build highways and unlock trucks and deliveries become American Truck Simulator
- Wiping out Mule camps with a truck to fund those highways
- Mads Mikkelsen
- Realizing how much of a non-threat BTs actually are once you have weapons, and how much further trivialized they are by the melee takedown you get for them later, making Chiral Crystals a total non-concern for the rest of the game

Things I didn't like in Death Stranding:
- The things Sam said were bullsh*t happening anyway
- Melee combat
- Ranged combat
- The part of the game where enemies suddenly become able to die so running over them with vehicles to avoid the garbage combat is no longer an option
- Realizing how comically long it takes for bodies to go necro, and how many fit in a truck to trivialize delivering them, so killing people isn't actually a concern at all, despite what a big deal they make of it
- The introduction of lethal firearms to the player also introducing them to every single enemy for the rest of the game including in areas you'd been to before
- The game's abject hostility to the transportation shortcuts it itself gave you, trying to force you to walk around in the sticks that vehicles can't or won't take whenever it can
- Snow, when every vehicle offered to you has slick tires, compounding the above, and making walking even worse
- That time I had to carry a specific cargo through the snowy mountains that was so fragile the random physics interactions the bike causes destroyed it, giving me one of my 2 game overs in the entire playthrough, forcing me to walk through the waist-high snow for what must have been multiple hours, about half of which being through BT territory
- That time I had to carry a specific cargo through simple, familiar territory, except every BT area in the path was scripted to immediately start a boss BT encounter, forcing me out of my vehicle and throwing my cargo, and to evacuate until it despawned from distance, which combined with the scripted unending rain caused a delivery of 100% container damage 99% cargo damage
- The inescapable boss fight at the end of the above run, which is the one thing I wouldn't dare spoil, but took like 20 minutes of standing around shooting it until its health ran out (you still have the cargo during this btw)
- Heartman
- Heartman's university lectures on theories of humanity that I could not care less about
- Fragile
- Every subsequent time after the first that Fragile said ""I'm Fragile, but I'm not that fragile""
- Every other goofy reveal of why these characters have these ""symbolic"" names (you'll love finding out why they call him Die-Hardman)
- Kojima rewriting the entire history of not only mankind but the entire universe to fit into his plotline but still referencing contemporary real-world events, like this could still happen but we just don't know about it yet
- Codex entries being locked behind specific arbitrary orders that appear entirely at random
- Fighting Mads Mikkelsen (ever seen that movie clip where two guys in an apartment fire fully loaded automatic rifles at each other and neither of them fall down? It's like that)
- The guy who constantly makes video game jokes about himself and calls himself the final boss and isn't the final boss
- The 1 for 1 replica of the snake vs liquid fistfight from MGS4 but worse and with none of the stakes or attachment
- Being given ""a choice"" where taking either of the two options causes a game over and you actually have to take a third option not presented or explained to continue
- Unskippable ""playable"" credits that the game loredumps at you during, forcing you to take action between each piece of dialogue for them to continue even though nothing is happening and you can't do anything
- A post-credits cutscene where you watch the actual events play out that were loredumped at you anyway, begging the question of why they bothered
- The ending itself being like 6 hours; my game actually crashed in the middle of it and I was almost very upset, but for a mercy an autosave was created at the end of the playable credits so I could just cutscene skip back to where I was

And finally
- Spending 100 hours of my life seeing through this shitshow to make number go up and because I just had to know how it ended and receiving the worst ending of my life since Mass Effect 3, and THEN finding out even if I finished 100%ing the game it would still be incomplete because there is an additional ""Legends of Legends"" delivery rank for Hard mode AND a ""Legend of Legends of Legends"" rank for Very Hard, what a joke

I did think that [spoiler]the reveal that the BB in the Mads Mikkelsen flashbacks was actually Sam, not your BB, and both of their reactions to finding that out[/spoiler] was pretty cool though. Only part of the ending I liked.

Not only are these metaphors present throughout the entire game, they are also elements of the main plot. The overall theme of the game is surrounded by ""connection."" Bridges, ladders, the chiral network, the beaches, your relationship, America, your cufflink, terrorism, etc. It's talking about the division of modern society but without it actually being spelled out for you. This is a common theme with Hideo Kojima's games. His concern for society is often depicted in metaphors and other hidden messages. The man is really concerned for society, America at most for this game, and it shows. 

As for the game and its main plot, it's absolutely brilliant. The lore is interesting, the characters are well developed, and plot comes with many twists and turns that I couldn't predict. It's a sci-fi world that uses actual scientific theories and ideas such as Higgs Field, matter and antimatter, and turns them into something creative and new, which helps give the universe an almost real feeling. Even one of the villains is named after this. Higgs refers to himself as the God Particle, which is what we also call the Higgs particle. 

The gameplay isn't perfect but it is very fun. Much of the mechanics seen in the Metal Gear Solid series, especially the 5th one, is brought back. There is a lot of micromanagement and stylistic choices that feel very Metal Gear-y. You can build roads, print items that help you on your journey, you can ride vehicles, use weapons against enemies and BTs. There is a lot of things you can do to make your mundane Amazon run feel less boring. It's not for everyone and I would not recommend it for everyone but I do recommend to give a try.

I won't.  Not after the last two days.  I want to tell you a story about a motorcycle and the Waystation at the End of the World.     (spoiler free)


I had just moved on to the second map chunk of the game and as I steeled myself to set out into new territory I stopped to check communal equipment locker.  A motorcyle had been left behind by another player, Logick: Logick's long-range reverse trike.  With 15 or fewer hours on my save file, I pulled it from the shared garage, thinking about my good fortune.  A ready-available bike with a double-size battery.  Surely it would serve me well for a few runs before I swapped it out with something else.
I would go on to put a total 90 hours on my save file, and cross the largest, most varied map of the game over and over and over on Logick's trike, secure in the knowledge that it would get me to where I was going and back home every time.  You can give ""Likes"" to other players' equipment and structures to show your appreciation, and Logick earned over 3000 likes from me through the trike alone.  It would become the single vehicle I used the most, by an enormous margin.

The moment I lost Logick's trike was heart-wrenching.  I was attempting a risky river crossing, sure as I had been every time before that Logick's trike would see me through.  I failed.  I lost Logick's trike and my cargo to the river's current, and as I scrambled to recover my load from the current, Logick's trike was gone without a trace.  This piece of essential equipment I had borrowed from a stranger I would never know, that had carried me through hours of gameplay, was gone in an instant.  I pressed on.  There wasn't anything else I could do.
About ten minutes later, a notification appeared on my screen: ""A reverse trike has been recovered from a river"".  I opened my map to the discovery that Logick's trike had found it's way to the shore, and while it was in very bad shape, it still had a mostly full battery.  I couldn't spare the time to turn around, so I would have to trust that it would be there when I returned.  The better part of an hour later as I tore across the landscape on foot, no cargo to weigh me down, Logick's trike came into view, smoking, on the riverbank where I had attempted the crossing.  Nearly broken, but with a full battery.  I coasted into the nearby distro center on single-digit durability, and finally let out a sigh of relief.  Logick's trike was back in the garage, safe and repaired, ready to go on the next delivery with me.

That one trike, in theory entirely replaceable, was my second most valuable piece of equipment.  On the final trek back across the whole of the map, I rode Logick's trike in a reverse-tracing of the path I had first taken while riding west.  With it's unfailing reliability, it brought me the whole way back.  I crossed the map perhaps dozens of times, hurtling through some of the worst hostile territories in the game, over mountain foothills and rivers, on that one trike.  I couldn't take it any further than the mountains, but it would be waiting for me for the return trip.


As I approached the end of the game, beyond the reach of Logick's trusty trike, after hiking through the worst terrain the game had to offer with the singular largest load I had ever moved as part of one of the story-line related deliveries, sneaking through an enemy camp and even being shot at, I finally reached my objective.  Sitting there, listening to the game's soundtrack, I looked around the area.  Scattered over the immediate vicinity was a safe house, a charging station, and a shelter, each built by a different player, with materials contributed by who knows how many others to help upgrade and repair them.  We, as a community, had put together a waystation, here at the end of the world.  One last stopping point before the final push, a chance to breathe easy and ready up.  Every single one of those structures had been brought here, through hostile territory, by players spending their own precious materials, knowing full well they would likely only benefit from this effort for a few minutes at most.  They did it anyway, because they knew it would be there for the others who came after them.

We were all just ships passing in the night, unable to interact beyond simple expressions of thanks, notifications reading ""Player _______ has used your structure and sends their appreciation.  __ Likes received"" in the bottom left of your screen, and yet we had provided for each other nearly everything you could have needed, then and throughout, be it a trike, a charging station, shelter from the rain, or something as important as a place to rest and repair your vehicle.  It's all just zeros and ones, code and pixels, and maybe it's silly, but knowing that there were people who went out of their way to help those who would come later, and being able to be part of it, contributing materials to that waystation, to roads, and building a zipline network that would become a highway, it reminded me of the good there is is the world.  This game, and its community, will help rebuild your faith in humanity if you let them.

I cannot recommend this game enough.


And Logick, if you find this, thank you.  Your trike carried me through so much of this game.  It took its lumps traveling with me, but I made sure it always came back, same as it did for me, and I made sure to store it in the garage after that last ride.",1670126331,1676236829,True,736,16,0.961274147033691406,0,True,False,False

[b]NEUTRAL:[/b]
~ Probably the worst game to Twitch. Needs to be experienced first-hand.
~ A real-time co-op extension could increase its players base.

[b]CONS:[/b]
- Why wasn't it a DLC instead of a separate title?
- Still no music player during deliveries.
- Many of the online structures from the original game will disappear in the Director's Cut.
- The structures built before connecting the chiral network won't be shared.
- No day and night cycles!
- Should be cross-platform!
- Still unable to change the colour of the writing ""Tomorrow is in your hands"" in photo mode.
- The story ends, unfortunately!

There are a number of interesting ideas here. I've spent the majority of my playtime trying to make things easier for other players by putting down devices like ladders and bridges, in addition to helping a number of imaginary people with their lives via delivery, so I've barely moved the storyline.

When I'm playing I'm usually too busy with one project or another, too bent on going just a little further to tame the proverbial wilderness and make sense of the world with roads and bridges. It's definitely an engaging game, as there's always something to do.

 When I'm not caught up playing, though, I wonder if I'm having ""fun"" or if i'm just appeasing the part of me that's seeking some sort of ""work/structure/routine"" in my life through a video game. On the other hand, after Days Gone and Ghostwire I might be burned out a little on sci-fi/urban fantasy and that may be affecting my feelings.

Ultimately, I love the presentation and I can't find anything wrong with the gameplay, though it's a little frustrating that it has a strange a strange (timed?) auto-save that can make you miss hours of work, but i'm not sure if the game is right or healthy for compulsive people like me personally.

-----
-Plot (Pro)
The story is magnificent: well crafted fantasy with very original world filled with mystery and revelations.

-Visual (Neutral)
The environment is very soothing and conveys the perfect ambience for the narrative, but its all the same everywhere. I got bored and googled all the environments I had not yet visited, and it confirmed my suspicion. No variety.

-Gameplay (Con)
If you love just slouching barely awake with a controller on the edge of your fingers slowly leaving your grasp due to your gradually growing comatose state, this is for you.
Otherwise, there is nothing to this title when it comes to gameplay. They slapped a good plot and storytelling on a 'walking-simulator'. Basically, you need to balance stuff on your arms and legs, try not to trip on rocks, and move mail around - that's literally it for god knows how many hours. Seriously, just go on Youtube and watch all the cut-scenes and cinematics (some people just mashed them into 1 video) - save yourself the boredom and enjoy the plot for free.

As someone who doesn't have any experience with prior Kojima games, except a few hours of Metal Gear Revengeance, I am dumbfounded how he can make an Amazon delivery simulator so fun to play. At first I thought it would be so much of a chore to lug things across the map, I'd just run through the story missions as fast as possibe to experience the story. However as I have played more, I have become obsessed with the sandbox aspect of the game. From building roads to placing terminals and generators at key locations to assist not only myself, but other players. Can't forget the joy of exploring the vast world and navigating the challenging terrain with a mix of finesse and outright ballsy maneuvers to make up time.

I was sorely wrong.

If you have enough patience and curiosity to get through the prologue and first couple episodes, you will be rewarded with a sandbox experience that is totally unique. If you've played a mainline Metal Gear Solid game, you've come to expect that every aspect of those games are excellent - style, narrative, themes, direction, character modeling, voice acting, gameplay, world building, the list goes on - and that all remains true for Death Stranding. Combat and gun-play do exist in this game, but not in the traditional sense that you may be thinking; lethal violence can also breed certain consequences, which adds an extra layer of consideration in choosing how to handle certain engagements.

What Tarantino is to film, Kojima is to gaming.
Death Stranding oozes style and substance, being totally abstract, quirky, visceral, haunting, charming, and thought-provoking all throughout the journey. You can easily feel Kojima's inspirations and appreciations, ranging from the game's cast selection, to the plethora of easter eggs nodding to other games, pop-culture, music, and works of art.

I've thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough of this game, and I can't wait to spend more time with it.

You're walking through fields collapsing from exhaustion, getting assaulted by box obsessed bandits, and then to top it off there are weird ghost things that are trying to turn you into a nuclear bomb. It's pretty cool, whatever's going on slowly gets revealed overtime but doesn't really make sense until the end, and even then some people are still confused. Characters acting awkward and cheesy dialogue doesn't help much.

The world is fantastic and it's one of the best looking games I've seen, It can be a relaxing experience or a frustrating one depending how you tackle it. 
Exploration is the best I've seen in a game, because similar to games like Splintares and Mudrunner, you have to be considerate of the terrain before go down a path that ruins everything. Your scanner tells you what paths are safer than others, but it also helps to have a basic understanding of the outdoors and physics. You're not going to pull a Skyrim and drive a bike with 400kg of cargo weighing it down up a steep mountain covered in rocks. 

Combat is something I find isn't done very well. The movement and overall ""handling"" of Sam is clearly focused on the travel and world exploration. Later on in the game melee is almost useless as almost every Mule has a gun. Stealth is only really useful against BT's if you want to sneak attack them, but before you even unlock the ability to do that the game's already handing you grenades and guns that are silent, so why even bother sneaking up on them when you can punt a BT in the head with a blood grenade. Sure you save resources, but honestly they're so abundant that you could print tons of weapons and armors without feeling the resource drain.

The music is what really ties it all together. Even if you don't like Kojima's storytelling, I'd say his music selection was handled perfectly in this game, from the original score by Ludvig Forssell, to the soundtrack featuring groups like Low Roar (RIP, Ryan Karazija), Woodkid, and CHVRCHES . The game wouldn't be the same without it.

So what's the gameplay? Is it a walking simulator? Nope, you press way more more than wasd. Is it a delivery man simulator? Kind of, but the story implies you're not just delivering people's packages, but more so helping them to help yourself.This game has combat, bosses, all the usual stuff you'd find in other Kojima games. It's just not constant this time.
You start noticing a few things as time goes on. MULE's get more and more armed to stop you, more and more buildings from other players appear everywhere, BT's stop being threatening and you end up mowing down groups of them to build more postboxes with giant duck holograms next to them.
Then it hits. Underneath the Kojima storyline there's the truth of what you're playing. 
AMERICA SIMULATOR.

if you don't like it within the first 4-12 hours, that's to be expected. it's work, and it's more fulfilling the more help you give and receive. director's cut specifically adds things that might help new players through the opening act a bit more, so the experience may be more approachable now.

Time to review this game after 70 hours of play time invested into it.
I have come across many games some good and some bad but this game i rate as 10/10 it is one of the best games i have ever played.

This game has so many things to do as you progress into this game you manage to unlock many more features of the game so many to mention.

The idea of the game is too build bridges from one end of a city to the other end and to rescue your sister, You play the part of Sam Bridges and your missions is to bring all the cities back on line and you build bridges to make this task much more easy sounds easy but it is not as you will encounter Mules this are human just like you but they are rogues and will try to destroy you then you have the dreaded BTs these are very deadly they are like monsters and very hard to kill you will come across these as you progress into the game.

To help you to level up and unlock more items you must collect lost packages dropped by others and take these packages back to a city and discharge the packages into the terminal you must also take on missions to deliver packages to other cities this is how you progress up levels.

There is a great story line in the game which unfolds as you progress and the game has good instructions within the game to help you understand and play it better.

In the 70 hours i played this game i have had no issues with it as it has never crashed on me and i have seen no bugs in fact the game appears perfect to me and i am running this game on a very top end desktop computer with all the latest hardware and of course the latest drivers too.

The game has fantastic graphics and sound the graphics is sharp and crisp on the highest settings with no lag on 60 fps

The game is well created and developed by what seems very talented game developers they thought it out very good and brought it all together like skilled developers to create one of the best games ever created.

this game is a good investment and you will enjoy it for many years to come and it is a (AAA) title and worthy to own and have in your game collection.

and at the moment it is well under £35 to purchase cheaper at some third party sites for a steam version.

So, the content and its realization also one of the best ever. I think that although the game is 18+ marked, the real enjoy starts when you already live for a while (at least 28+), when you are already eiglible to thought the responsibility is more your own than a simple opportunity.  

And the gameplay. Sometimes it scares in exceptional moments as well, a huge bonus adrenalin. So the psycho part is extraordinaly good for me.

The man then goes back in time to each of the big World Wars and shoots at Mads Mikkelsen for a little while.

[h1]Synopsis[/h1]
Death Stranding - Director's Cut is an open world package delivery game.

[h1]Story[/h1]
The United States is no more. A mysterious even known as the Death Stranding has opened a doorway between the living and the dead. When a person dies, if their body is not cremated in time it goes necrotic and causes an event where their body explodes creating a crater like a bomb going off, called a void out. Void outs have taken out a large number of cities. Rain has now become deadly, it is called time fall and anything it touches ages rapidly. The president wants you to reconnect the remaining cities on a network so they can become a civilization again.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
The most interesting thing about Death Stranding is that it is a solo multiplayer game. While you play solo, items that other people build will appear in your game. However, you won't have to compete with other players and they will not be in your world.

You start off on foot with no weapons. As you make deliveries and connect more people to the network they are able to share their knowledge, which allows you to fabricate vehicles and weapons. Each person you deliver to has five different levels represented by stars. At one star they will allow you to add them to the network. This will allow you to see items created by other players and increase the number of structures that you can build. At two stars they will join the UAC, this will allow you to fabricate items at their shelter. The remaining three stars will give you access to more building materials from that person.

All packages have a tag on them that you can see when you scan the terrain. When you scan a package you will see who had it originally, what is in the package, and where the package needs to be delivered. Some packages will contain building materials, these materials may be used or delivered. You don't have to deliver the package to its final destination, you can drop it at a city or shelter and someone else can move it closer to its destination.

There are renegade porters, called Mules, that steal packages. You can go into their camps and liberate these good. However, you must remember that you cannot kill anyone or you will cause a void out. Later in the game they don't care and will use bullets against you.  If you incapacitate all of the Mules in a camp other porters (NPCs) will now be able to use the route for a bit of time.

There is rain, called time fall.  Items that get wet, age at an accelerated rate.  This causes damage to your vehicles and equipment.  Also the rain attracts BTs (Beached Things).  The BTs will try to drag you to the world of the dead.  Good thing your blood hurts them.  Bad thing is you have a limited blood supply.  Good thing you can carry blood bags to transfuse yourself if you lose blood.

The main bug I experienced was that I would get disconnected from the server and it would continually try to reconnect, but would not succeed until I shut the game down and restarted.

One of the most annoying things about the game is the cut scenes. There is a cut scene for everything: delivering packages, putting a shelter on the network, getting into the vehicle, getting up when you have picked up your items to deliver. One massive improvement would be allowing you to automatically skip cutscenes that you have already seen. When you deliver a package there is a cut scene where you put it on the delivery system, then the person receiving the package has a cut scene, then you get to the actual delivery score.

[h1]Final Verdict[/h1]
I found this game cathartic, lots of time roaming the world by yourself. The world is a beautiful place. The only real stressor is the BTs. Early in the game would let them catch me, then I'd ""escape"" and I wouldn't have to deal with them.

At times it can feel dreary and lonesome, but that's kind of the point. This game wants to make you feel things about life and  existence, humanity, technology... and it will mostly succeed at this if you let it. 

It's the kind of game that if you decide to play it, you should do your best to see it through to the end. Not only to get closure or a better-ish understanding of the characters and narrative (which are gradually unearthed from under many layers of exposition and backstory... obscure and sometimes confusing, but still intriguing and compelling to uncover) but also to experience the twists and turns in the plot and gameplay mechanics, and the progression of unlocking all the different tools at your disposal.

The game teaches you the importance of planning ahead, having situational awareness, and being deliberate in your movements. It forces you to be patient and cautious. It requires commitment to see each delivery through. And the more you deliver, the more the game opens up with all sorts of new items and gadgets and tech that makes your job easier and quicker. 

It's a game driven by pure creative vision that *just so happens* to have the budget and graphical fidelity of a AAA studio. It's not often we get to enjoy a truly unique and different premise backed up with sheer talent and production value. It's a game that fully commits to that vision, and mostly succeeds in what it sets out to do. 

As far as criticisms... there can be occasional frustrating moments when it comes to how vehicles handle. Overall they work well enough, but the physics are a bit clunky when it comes to momentum and acceleration, which (in the wrong place at the wrong time) can prove to be disastrous if you happen to be close to any big drop-offs. I learned my lesson *real good* at one point and took more care from then on.

The gun play and shooter elements of the game become more prominent in the second half. I was able to roll with it and only had a handful of moments that were frustrating, but I could see some people getting turned off by it if they were expecting the game to be purely about picking up and delivering packages and building structures. The mechanics of being under fire, running out of ammo and frantically trying to swap weapons while trying to run away aren't as smooth and responsive as your average modern third person shooter. If you're caught out of cover by several enemies with rifles, you won't last long unless you can manage to scramble to safety. Regardless, it's mostly limited to certain areas and a few chapters in the story, and I didn't find anything overly difficult to complete on normal difficulty. 

The core of the game is about having what people need, and figuring out how to get it to them. It's a puzzle you get to solve over and over again as you figure out which path you want to set out on, where you'll stop along the way, and what you'll take with you to make it past all the obstacles lying in wait.

Without getting into spoilers, It's worth mentioning that the game does reward you quite a bit for getting to the end of the story. It takes a while to get there... but if you've got the time, a bit of patience and an open mind, the game *will* take you to a place you've never been before and leave you with a lasting impression.",1675402102,1675402265,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There were parts of the game where I kind of felt that I was getting into the groove of things, just taking my time and enjoying the slow pace, but those times disappeared and now the game is just overly monotonous un-fun aggravation.  Now that I am in the snowy area of the middle map the game is literally sucking the fun out of my life.  I can’t take it, and no matter how much I am enjoying the story I can’t play a game that feels worse than working a crappy job that I don’t get paid for.

Everything about the game feels geared towards making the game as un-fun as possible.  The driving mechanics are not good at all, even the big trucks often feel like they are on ice skates, slipping and sliding all over the place.  The reverse trikes are constantly banging into even the smallest piece of terrain, creating a jarring experience.  No matter the vehicle you’re constantly going to need to repair it, which requires that it be empty of cargo.  You can’t just drive it and then drive it out.  None of it is realistic, so there’s no argument to be made for it being realistic, it’s just fun-fun and aggravating.

The shooting mechanics just suck, combined with weapons sharing the same radial menu as all your other gear and the click-to-the-next-page aspect makes changing weapons a real slog.  The shooting itself is some of the worst I’ve experienced in any game that I’ve played and I say that having played through Mafia: The Definitive Edition and Mafia 3.  All the weapons feel like water guns, aren’t fun to shoot, and have the worse aiming mechanics I’ve ever used.  It’s just not fun.  It’s something you do when you have to, but it’s not something to look forward to.

The building mechanics are the worst aspect of the game.  You are given these incredible tools that work on paper but kind of suck in the game.  A good example of this is the zip lines.  Once you have a network set up it’s pretty cool, but setting up a network is tedious and un-fun.  Maintaining the network once it’s up is tedious and un-fun.  Farming and transporting the resources required to maintain the network is tedious and un-fun.  All so you can do that one order in less than 4 minutes.  There’s no payoff for the work required.

The story is amazing, 10/10 so far.  It’s really weird and I can’t say that I fully understand everything, but I can keep up and I really like some of the characters.  It’s all hidden in between hours and hours of tedious un-fun work though.  I spend too much time in between the great cut scenes wondering why I’m even playing the game at all.  Booting up the game is starting to feel like I imagine it feels watching your abusive alcoholic father take the last beer from the fridge knowing that when he goes for another and discovers there aren’t and you’re going to get the crap beat out of you for it.  I actively feel like I’m being punished for trying to play the game.

You spend the vast majority of the game alone, just struggling to make it from point A to point B. It is those moments where you meet someone, actually connect with them, that feel the most important. I wish I could say that those moments were done prepper to prepper, and the game DOES try to get you to feel something for them and see this diverse array of personalities at play even during this strange apocalypse. The key to all of them being alive is that they all enjoy one simple thing, be it music, collectibles, cosplaying, or upholding the patriotic vision of America. This is the thing that has kept them going on in a terrible horrible situation. It is a pretty good message, really. However, you never get enough time to really know these people and entirely too much information is exchanged through e-mails. It was a problem with Kojima's past game too, where a lot of the information was hidden in the background and whatnot (that game being MGSV) so you just don't feel like you are experiencing a whole story at times.

The main story doesn't suffer so much from a lack of information and is, for the most part, immensely fleshed out. My favorite part is just the vague nature of the Death Stranding itself. The event is seem as an absolute inevitable thing that just happened because it was going to one way or another. Death, though it leaks over to the world of the living, is still this unknown feared experience. And, really, the BTs here are pretty much just lost souls caught in limbo. The game was smart doing this, as it still leaves the whole 'afterlife' as a mystery - like real life. We still don't know what happens, or why. Everyone is tied to the Death Stranding in very intimate ways, but not even Sam, who can't actually die, understands the breadth of it. That being said, I will admit that most characters act sort of strange and childish at times. I don't know what it is, but every seems oddly 'innocent'. Perhaps its to cement the idea that without coming together everyone is lost in some way, but I don't know - I don't get that part of it. I will say that it does make interactions between Deadman and Sam some of my favorite moments of the game, its just endearing to hear these grown men doing some of the weirdest interactions ever and trying to deal with existential conspiracies with little knowledge of what exactly any of it means. What I mean to say is - if you like the funny and weirder interactions of the Metal Gear series, this game is like 90 percent those.

Gameplay is really where the 'player division' comes in. There is combat here, but for the most part you are punished heavily for partaking in lethal action of any sort. Its okay, since there are plenty of non-lethal alternatives - but why even make the lethal options a thing when it goes against the story and Sam's character as a whole? I don't get why they'd be there just to punish the player. In the end, the only real valuable weapons are those that use hermetic rounds to fight off BTs and the numerous boss incarnations. And bosses are just really interesting bullet sponges made of black goop from the afterlife. Its okay. Besides that, you'll just be trying to make your way across an extremely hospitable landscape and using some resources to build a quicker way from one place to another. Its all about weight management and traversing routes. Sometimes it can be rewarding, and other times it can be so boring you fall asleep. I'd say that 75% of the game is manageable and its rewarding to construct all the roads available and go across the entire map! Yet, that mountain area and the couple of hidden preppers are some of the worse most sluggish parts of the whole experience. Yeah, the mountain area certainly almost breaks the entire game for me. There were more then a few times I thought of throwing in the towel and uninstalling, but I wanted to connect everyone and finish the story.

Directors account sort of just adds some fun stuff and a few generally useless means of getting back and forth. I don't see the point in the catapult, and the race-track is completely hidden unless you happen upon it or someone mentions it exists at all. The differences are essentially useless, really - the only real cool addition being the few backpack additions to help out, but there isn't enough space on your backpack to really take full advantage of any of them.

Good story doesnt mean can be immersive game without well-cook concept, 
it could be turn just an interactive movie games, sony game lol.

But in this case, kojima himself was movie guy and game director.
The story & concept are mind blowing, and it ties in perfectly with the gameplay mechanics as one.
Character & actor performances is awesome, mocap expression is so natural.
And im still impressed by Die-Hardman confession scene, all of them are precious high tier actors, Bravo and love you all XD.

I never experience something like this before.
I'm used to playing action games like Dark Souls who playing the role of the executioner getting his hands dirty.
Most of gameplay is about Delivery, and we are not allowed to kill bandit/terrorist, there's consequences for killing human.
But there is an enemy that we are allowed to kill called BT.
Sometimes I let my self get caught in order to fight BT's boss lol.
There is only 4 type of BT boss, but its okay.

Each region has its own characteristics & challenges, snow terain will be unforgetable challenge.
in 2nd map, i manage to donate & build road from lake knot to south knot, distribution center of mountain knot city (and almost connecting mountain knot too).
That was rewarding and this road is affect to other online porter proggression.

And sometime they know perfect time to play BGM and its a magic !
Low Roar songs always makes me chill.
RIP Ryan Karazija, your voice is will always be part of the game and our experience.

So finally, i will call this a Masterpiece.

The gameplay loop is just ""go here, take a bunch of stuff, then go here"" with some enemies and story aspects, and the first area was full of those, and of course, people got bored and stopped the game halfway without giving it a chance.

The part that got me hooked until the end was, unexpectedly, the story. But importantly, the journey that I went through really impacted the beautiful yet also gloomy world. You will feel that you changed the country, people's lives, and the ones closest to you.

I like plotting my routes, balancing my burdens, and thoughtfully plodding and detouring across a reclaimed-by-nature wilderness. I like rock-a-bying my BB. I like whipping out my PP and draining the lake mid stride.

Unfortunately, all these stream-of-consciousness pleasantries are frequently jarred by (1) the voice of the writer and (2) the abominably cruel menu interface. The juxtaposition is stunning - the play experience is quite playful and open-ended. But outside of traversal, the game just KEEPS. CUTTING. TO CUTSCENES. And for things that would work perfectly well as animations!

I'm talking 3-8 second silent cutscenes of my guy: putting things down; standing up; zooming in on an object; detecting a nearby BT. These are things that happen very often, and they feel like rude interruptions on the flow state the game is so good at getting me into.

And then the eye-crossingly excessive cargo menus contain more information than like, a Civ game diplomacy screen, and yet none of it seems to matter that much. The core game loop is collecting and delivering packages, but for some reason this is the least streamlined process in the game. I have to click ""accept"" like 6 times for every single collection and delivery. & in spite of this information overload, sometimes it's hard to tell what's what, or what I'm confirming. I'm barraged with another 6-8 confirmations just to click through the XP/leveling-up screen. Just due to these menus, starting and ending deliveries is a bigger chore than the actual gameplay.

This ""chore"" feeling is further exacerbated by the codec calls or whatever they are called in this. The NPCs NEVER. SHUT. UP. What could be explained in a sentence or 2 is dragged out into 8, 10, 15 sound bytes, most of which restates the obvious, or just STATES YOUR CHARACTER'S NAME, MULTIPLE TIMES. 

I've never wanted to a game to shut the hell up and get the hell out of my way this badly and this frequently. I was really interested in the story and characters, but within 8 hours of playtime, I realized I was pressing the ""skip nonsense button"" about as often as I was pressing buttons to actually play the game.

If there was a mod to simplify the interfaces and streamline the chirping monologues, allowing me to engage more directly with the game systems, I'd probably recommend it.

+ Nice original story with a few twists
+ Likable characters voice-acted by top notch actors
+ Looks great in 4k
+ Fresh enjoyable gameplay. The dev took a risk and that's rare enough in the AAA industry. 
+ The equipements you unlock change the gameplay in cool ways
+ Not a trace of wokism

- The gameplay is kind of flawed but it's very forgivable when you try something new. 
- The game tends to be too easy and it's full of exploits. The truck kind of break the game.
- I would have liked vehicules to be much fasters on the roads you build.
- Menus are horribly cumbersome with way way too many steps. Just reparing your vehicule is a shore, making deliveries is a shore, etc..

It's a game that isn't for everyone but the story itself is 100% worth it even if you just use a cheat or something to quite literaly ""walk"" through the story.

Gameplay - 7/10
Replayability  4/10 (very linear but different approach can be choosen)
plot twist - 8/10

Long review:

This is prolly the most atmospheric game I ever played. The whole idea of Death Stranding is absolutely brilliant and I love it. My favorite part of the game are the BTs, it is a enemy you will encounter quite often, but there is catch. You can't see them, and the fear of something that's invisible to you is horrifying more then if there was a deformed soul of.. something, hunting you. The theme of Tar and the BTs is also very disturbing. 
When it comes to story, it is reaaaaaaly slow at the beginning, but more you play the more interesting it will become and honestly, for me, the biggest plot twist is actually AFTER credits when the game ends. Now the whole Stranding and how it happened is a repeating mystery and isn't 100% clearly explained, rather left for player's imagination or rather, interpretation. 
Game-play, your biggest and most difficult enemy, is player itself. The hardest challenge is the environment, and balancing your cargo, tripping over uneven terrain and there is a huge difference when you stock up your cargo to max weight and when you go in light, but when you go light, you might be missing that one ladder or that one climbing rope, but when you go heavy, you might trip over a rock and spill your cargo into the river and don't let me start on sneaking with full cargo through BT infested area. Planning is important in this game.
Overall, it is unique experience in a very unique world that I will be very happy to return to every now and then.",1674841006,1674841006,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Then in 2023, out of curiosity, I finally bought this game. After spending 83 hours unlocking all achievements,  I would say this game is both a masterpiece and mediocre. My rating is 8/10. 

The setting, the story, the characters, and the concept are genuine, it’s so unique, there is almost no game that can compete. I spent 38 hours beating the game, well, main missions, I enjoy every second of it, I was amazed by the mystery, It kept me playing to see what would happen next, its story is so catchy,it’s absolutely awesome.

On the way to the end of the story, you are building highways and ziplines to connect every facility. At the end of the game, every isolated facility is connected, you are just go anywhere by driving on the road or ziplining, contrary to the beginning of the game where you can only run by foot. It feels good after connected everywhere.

But after beating the game, I started playing side missions, then I understand why some people hate this game. The side contents are basically delivering packages over and over again, non-stop, hundreds of times. It’s repetitive, and some of people are living on top of he mountain, and you are not allowed to build ziplines to reach them until you successfully delivery couple times later. So you have to carry heavy loadout and climb the mountain slowly to the top, then go back, and do it again. This is painful, not enjoyable. And there are many side missions are just like that, you doing something slowly and painfully, over and over again. That’s why many people hate this game. I understand.
Good luck, we are playing on PC, so you can use a trainer and cheat table,to teleportation, to run faster, or even fly. Cheat makes this game much faster and more enjoyable. And I highly recommend you use mod to make gameplay faster and your life easier.

So, in conclusion, I recommend this game. It’s not a bad game like many people said, not at all. Yes, it has some gameplay problems, but if you only want to beat the game, not to unlock all achievements, I don’t think those problems will bother you. Whether you like this game or not, there is one thing I am pretty sure of: you will find this game different, unique.

this game has lasted me over 75 hours just so far and yea ive done some walking.

ive also road a motorcycle, big trucks, stolen trucks, exoskeleton boosters, and zipped lined over mountains.

i watched my character cremate his mother and thats not even a spoiler because thats just the tutorial!

ive sneaked into camps with nothing but my rope and choked out the guards.
ive road in wheels squealing into terrorist camps ran multiple over while getting shot at. 
threw cargo at their heads to knockem down. stole weapons to fight back.

ive walked/rode through dark rain trying to hurry as the rain slowly melts my cargo containers as if their made of pressed sugar. all the while trying to sneak past monsters that you can only see when u stand still.
those 1st few encounters are the scariest. you will eventually get a way to fight back but ammo takes up space for delivery's and u can only carry so much.

u can work with other players passing equipment between each other at stations and posts and u can help build bridges over the nearly impassible rivers and lead ropes and ladder up mountains and into crevices other will like and appreciate it.

The gameplay is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the gameplay will go over a typical gamer's head. There's also Kojima's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterizations - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The true gamers understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the gameplay, to realize that they're not just fun- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Death Stranding truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the gameplay in Kojimas's existential product placement ""monster energy"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Kojima's genius unfolds itself on their screens.

Your character in the game is that of a barely-psychic courier who also happens to be a nepobaby in the most mid-90's Saturday-afternoon action flick way possible.  Your job is to avoid invisible ghosts and deliver stuff between cities of agoraphobic people who have access to both flawless holographic technlogoy and super glitchy 3D projectors...  Your biggest challenge isn't avoiding invisible dead things though... it's keeping your balance as you carry your stuff around, while trying to keep the boxes containing your deliveries dry so they don't rust.  Oh, and you get a SONY-sponsored lofi chillwave indiepop soundtrack advertised to you as you explore a post-apocolyptic nature-reclaimed America, where travelling by for ten minutes and bike for three minutes is the equivalent of 300 real-world miles (Fallout sense-of-scope-and-scale be damned)... Think DC to Knoxville.

And all of that could STILL sound fun...but it's soulless. 

Look, I Remember my first Hideo game.  I think of Far Cry, American McGee's Alice, Remember Me, Alan Wake, Life Is Strange...I play a lot of different games with a lot of different styles, and it's the blend of soul-in-the-story, fun mechanics, and the love the artist put into it that keep me captivated. 

With Death Stranding...It feels like Hideo got in a room with a bunch of money people and was like ""Alright, How Cool Can We Make This By Being Original...Let's Do All The Ideas You Never Got To In Other Games And Make People Fight Space Whales""

It's just...novel-mechanics heavy with an obtuse story that I guess reveals itself somewhere around hour 14 (I'm in hour six), and it's... it's cool for the sake of cool, but not a good game.  I've looked at reviews and people expressing how the game gets popular in waves...but six hours in and this whole thing feels like a chore.  

The character names are annoying even AFTER you recognize the structure, the menus make no sense, there's some kind of social credit system that's obtuse and you're just supposed to 'get it' I suppose... I love hoighty toighty high-minded stuff, but this just... it gets back to that word 'chore'.  This game feels like a soulless, loveless, chore where a director couldn't see the forest through the trees.

Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it'll pay off in hour 12.  I'll get my $30 or whatever's worth out of it and play it through, but I'm definitely taking a break for a few weeks to pop into something fun and story driven.

The game grows on you in a way I don't think I've ever had happen with any other game. I'm on my third play-through at the moment and while I'm a little sad there's not more of it, what is there is really great. The sound design is immaculate, making this fake world really come to life, and the DualSense features work absurdly well with Death Stranding considering it was originally a PS4 game. Being able to feel the timefall on my palms, as dumb as it sounds, actually came in handy a few times while trying to find a covered spot to wait out the rain and rest a bit, and the Adaptive Triggers just lend themselves perfectly to the cargo balancing. This was my first Kojima game, and the use of motifs, either auditory or visual, really ties the story together when you know where it's going. 

Sadly, while the Director's Cut was a lot better at guiding players to use the features of the Cufflinks, a lot of gameplay mechanics can go unnoticed depending on how you play the game. On my first play through I never really used the floating cargo carriers for example, mostly because I didn't know you could tie your cargo down and I liked doing it by hand, but during my second play-though I remember sliding down from the Geologist to the Veteran Porter on the floating carrier, tearing the slopes, which was a ton of fun. That's kind of how most of the game is really: not as wide as it is deep. I also struggled during key story segments that didn't seem to have a clear goal, either requiring you to sleep in a specific place to trigger a cut scene or for you to just guess the solution, unless you read your mail which usually just lays it out a little too plainly for it to be considered a puzzle anymore. The gameplay and mechanics are surprisingly deep, while the story is a lot more focused on serving the world you inhabit, explaining the character's motivations and stories, rather than being some grand adventure. Don't get me wrong, the game has amazing story moments, but some of the dubbing as well as some of the acting is a little stiff, especially for how little we see and hear from certain characters (the Chiral Artist really stands out here, as well as any prepper with dialog reused for every delivery). I've also often encountered strangely low resolution textures and more rarely flying geometry, but it never really impacted gameplay at all. That's sort of my main issue with the game, the more you poke and probe at it the more you start to see the limits of it, physically speaking. (For example the 21:9 support being a non standard resolution, leaving you with black bars unless you're willing to do HEX edit, or the horrendous performance in some Director's Cut specific areas)

But all of that is really only nitpicking and rarely really affected how I play the game, most of the time I had a blast immersing myself in this dystopia and delivering packages. Might be slightly biased as my tag is literally bb_lou but I remember being interested in the game as soon as I saw the first trailer, even considered buying the special edition that came with the baby in the jar when the game launched (ironic I know). The story is really captivating and most of the key points are acted well. It really lends itself to replays as a lot of the story is teased early on, and the information is given to you really randomly, making things come together a lot better on subsequent play throughs. It also has that Twin Peaks quality where, by not taking itself too seriously and having quite a healthy amount of goofiness, it allows me to suspend disbelief a lot easier and enjoy the product as a whole, flaws and all. I remember having to put the game down at first because of how much BT's scared me when I played at night, while now I'll just run past them without a second thought. Progression in this game is really rewarding, not only with items but also just skill wise. I always fell around or would get caught by BT's at first, but now I really do not have that issue anymore at all, just have to know how to do things in a sense. 

While not spoiling the story I want to say the ending is satisfying on it's own, and I really did not think it would get a sequel, but I still am incredibly excited to see where that goes. In conclusion, Death Stranding is really a game like no other. If you look at gameplay and trailers and don't think it's for you, by all means it's probably not, but if you're even slightly interested in the premise, the game grows on everyone I know who's given it a fair shot. It's not perfect, far from it, but it's damn good at what it sets out to do, and that's really all I can ask of it.",1674685553,1674685553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ok, now that the pretensios twats have already came let's get this review on the road.  Death Stranding isn't MGS or anything action oriented keep that in mind, it's a florida uber eats simulator where you make deliveries, manage resources and fuck arround with SAM's balance. Great optimization, no bugs to report on my end and a good stable experience.
With all that said, I'm in deep love with this game, it's nice clean fun and VERY relaxing for some reason, not that challenging but it doesnt' need to be, the satifaction isn't in overcoming challenge but in the jorney to the destination. I play this game after work on those hard days where I don't want to grind anything else.

Althoug I'll have to say, since it's such a niche game, buy it on sale, I bought it for 23euros so it was and is well worth my money but don't take my word for it

You play as a 'Porter' named Sam Bridges, who is played by Norman Reedus. This game has many other cameo appearances from famous actors and producers as well, such as Guillermo Del Toro, Mads Mikkelsen, Troy Baker, Nicolas Winding Refn, Conan O'Brien, and even Junji Ito.

Death Stranding is a very beautiful and atmospheric open world game. The main purpose of the game is to travel across America, branching all the communities together to the 'chiral network', delivering cargo and packages to these people along the way.

Social interactions play a huge role in Death Stranding. Linking more people to the chiral network creates more bandwidth, thus allowing you to build more structures to help you make your journey easier. Some of these structures include generators, to recharge vehicles. Zip-lines, to help traverse some of the more treacherous terrain later in the game. Bridges, placed over bodies of water, or rocky terrain to make passage on foot or in a vehicle a breeze. Other people playing the game can see other players structures and upgrade them to make their lives easier too, helping others along the course of the game.

As amazing and beautiful Death Stranding is, it certainly isn't for everyone. It's very repetitive, and it's what people would call a ""walking simulator"". The opening prologue and early game might turn off a lot of people. Even I can admit that the first couple hours are a little boring. However, after breaking through the initial opening of the game, it really starts to open up, and the way you execute deliveries can really start to get creative. You unlock different upgrades and structures as you progress through the game, making your journey a bit easier and a lot more fun as you travel across America.

I can't recommend this game enough, it is one of the most unique gaming experiences in years. I'm sure Death Stranding 2 will be an improvement in every way when it releases. One of my only complaints about this game is the fact the Directors Cut removed the Monster Energy drink branding, and replaced it with their own 'Bridges Energy' drink.

* Motorcycle controls,
* Repeating cut scenes (enter/ exit private room, baby senses the bt's, accessing terminal etc..).
* Annoyance of floating carrier, sometimes it'll go in front of you and if you'll press button you will jump on it, happened quite few times when bt's were chasing.

The BTs practically come at you at any time, and YOU MUST STAY AWAY FROM THEM.

""Living is no different from being dead if you're all alone."" You are Sam Porter, but he likes to be called Sam. You are the anti-hero that will connect people in-game (and players). 

Delivering packages is how the game starts - but you will progress quickly from foot to vehicle, from prepper to city. You will learn how to construct new items, vehicles, parts and buildings to build up a delivery network. While goals are important, part of the experience is the journey as well as a larger story arc that slowly unveils itself with surprising and sometimes creepy twists. 

[H1]The good[/H1]
The visuals, sound effects and music are some of the best you can experience on PC today. I didn't know many of the artists and group playing the sound track: they fit the game so well. The terrain can be deformed by certain events. The attention to details is insane.

I love the hiking and exploring - it's doesn't get better than that at the moment simulating it on a computer. It's amazing to see all the details: how to navigate using your map and taking into consideration your load, the terrain and other [SPOILER] dangerous [/SPOILER] elements. It's also great that the terrain can be a puzzle: will you use your bike to drive around, will you abseil or bring materials to build a bridge?

Interacting with the community in-game is indirect: you will find items and objects that other players constructed spread throughout your world. As the game is a scale of real life it allows to invest in the cast of characters and through your journeys you will learn more about them: some you may like and others you will despise: the character building is in general good.

Soon after I started, I thought why does everyone think I'm a hero crossing a stream and a hill? Or defeating three enemies (and why non-lethal [SPOILER]later you have the option to use lethal weapons but there will be consequences[/SPOILER])? I realized that instead of literal thinking that the map represents the USA and the distances and dwellings are meant to represent 1:1 to real life, I considered them more symbolic. The game mechanics the game would become boring if it was to any real-world scale and it is not really the point of the experience anyone. Actually even at the current scale it can take 40 minutes or more to move from one location to another - the map is large but becomes smaller when you gain access to more infrastructure upgrades. 

I like the rewards that you receive for performing well. In a sense it's a little RPG lite as you will get slightly better abilities but it feels nice to achieve them anyway. But you are not forced to five star the settlement you can focus on the story if you want and that is the great thing also: they want you to have an engaging experience on your own pace. It's the same for the equipment: the options are there and they are slowly expanded to the point that it sometimes feels overwhelming. This however does change in the latter chapter where the game put you on a track that you cannot deviate from. Even when it says you have a choice: there is none really.

You can definitely see that DS is an evolution of systems and details developed in previous games like Metal Gear Solid. And it goes to the next level: the costume, prop and location design are amazing. You can even specify that the sound from certain items [SPOILER](is it really an item?): BB [/SPOILER] comes from a different speaker set than where the music and normal sound effects come from. In your room you will see the ""green plastic American soldier"" action figure style that is used to tell your story, dreams and nightmares that you experience throughout the game.

The photo mode is one of the best I have ever seen - it's like you bring your own DSLR into the game as most settings are there. It's user friendly though so even if photography is not your thing it will be easy to use. 

You can manufacturer vehicles, equipment and other items and then share it with other players. There is a firing range with competitions added where you can try out weapons and tactics against various enemies and compare your results with other players. The further you progress the more options it gives you and you can decide what works best for you. 

[H1]The not so good[/H1]
I've had consistent crashes throughout the game: in particular [SPOILER] at the Incinerator, playing the harmonica and during some missions in chapter 3, 5 and 15 [/SPOILER] (so I had to replay the last 20 minutes several times :-(). DLSS was sometimes the cause of the issue and to resolve it I had to turn off DLSS in the video menu. Other times it was just a hard crash – frustrating to the point that I gave up going for 100% as I was tired replaying the same areas over and over again as I couldn’t save. 

The interface could probably be better: there are so many menus and hidden features that you have to get used to. The number of systems is overwhelming and while it's great that they can suit your play style it would be better if you had like filters in place where you only see your favourite items instead of seeing everything all the time. 

The minor NPCs have just a couple of lines at each location. If you made enough deliveries they start to repeat - even Sam falls in repeating his lines quickly during travel. I also would have liked more music during traveling or that you could build a music player and just listen to the great music. This is only possible when you rest in your room. 

The game is not difficult at hard: it feels it just gives you more rewards. Just make sure they don't overwhelm you. The game does like to throw curveballs to you: that last piece of the road that cost 5x more than normal, terrain with sudden storms and increased durability loss, locations that are tedious to unlock and even harder to increase or enemies that can’t be defeated.

The vehicle physics can get weird - it may have to do that the terrain is deformable but it's like they are on a track and not completely connected to the ground as you would expect. 

Playing connected (online) means that you will get sometimes helpful constructions from other players to your world. Often they don't help and as the amount of buildings is limited in each area, constructions that you will never use will still eat up your 'bandwidth' limiting what you can build. 

There are hard boundaries installed on how you progress: certain NPC will not be able to progress until you move further in the story. With constructions it's the same: some things are better left until later usually you realize this when you don’t get any or little reward for tasks compared to other locations. 

The last chapters of the game feel unbalanced. Looking back, I feel the game started small and then expanded: the best experience I had was chapters 1 – 7. It would have been great if the game ended soon after but it drags on and becomes small again in later chapter: putting you on tracks that you cannot skip. 

[H1]Summary[/H1]
It's strange you start walking around and think why is it so special but the game has this tendency to suck you into the story slowly unwrapping locations, people, gifts, achievements and a story. It's one of those games that you say: ""OK 10 more minutes, then the next time you look at the clock two hours have passed and you realize you should have been in bed a long time ago, but then just five more minutes"". 

I do see that it would be hard to put the game down and continue a month later - you probably want to do a solid playthrough as otherwise too much won't make sense anymore especially as you progress and the amount of things you can do is overwhelming. 

For the first chapters it sets new high standards on performance, visuals and acting. It would have been a master piece if it stopped in time but sadly it doesn't and keeps on going whereby the experience gets worse as you progress.",1674330512,1674331027,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Your first act in the game will be an agonizing crawl up a miserable mountain. The second one is an equally miserable slog through a marsh carrying way too much equipment. It's the game all but daring you to keep going. 

I kept going, for what it's worth, to the point where the game mutates from a pain simulator into a strange mix of Eurotruck Simulator and an Ubisoft Open World Game, which sounds like more of a backhanded complement than it is. There's a strange pleasure to building roads, moving materials, and rebuilding a doomed world coated in acid raid. The game literalizes it's themes about connectivity by punishing you severely, almost to the point of unplayability, if you don't play online. A lot of the development and open world convenience is centered around following in the footsteps of those before you. Go alone at your own risk. 

The game pushes your controller to the absolute limits, and it starts to break down when the game wants to stop being a 3rd Person Delivery sim and start being a 3rd person shooter. The absolute worst parts of the game depend on a very clunky inventory system to be used very rapidly (Natch, a recurring boss needs to be garroted with one item, grenaded with another, and then shot with a third to do reliable killing damage), which is frustrating but not run ending. 

But how did it make me feel? If Kojima games are about their batshit stories and commentaries, what did I walk away feeling more than anything?

That the loss of Silent Hills was the greatest tragedy the medium ever faced. Death Stranding, just beneath it's surface of Post Apocolyptic Delivery Boy-ing has aspects of the single greatest horror game ever made. Kojima has a taste for nightmare imagery and cinematography that are wasted by a game largely about walking.

The game does take you through hostile territories, facing enemies both human and supernatural. The enemy AI allows you to employ stealth tactics when engaging hostiles, and the enemy AI allows for undetected movement to be useful. But stealth and combat are not the core gameplay.
Most of the game has you path finding point A to point B, convincing communities to connect to the network you are building, and subsequently reaping the benefits of tools other players left behind, while doing the same for other players.  For most of the game, the biggest threat you will face is your own recklessness or failure to plan ahead. If you had fun getting the horses in Skyrim to climb mountains, you'll probably enjoy this aspect quite a bit.
The storyline is where the game really shines. The writing is exceptional and the delivery is amazing. The characters all feel like real people, have their own very human flaws, and everyone has their own brand of Kojima Weirdness.

Later in the game, the zip lines and roads can severely ruin the core mechanics of the game, essentially bypassing them throughout the final third of the game's runtime. I found the combat enjoyable, but too easy. The only two difficult fights were final Higgs and Vietnam fights, in my opinion, and I don't consider myself particularly good at video games. The BTs are a letdown mechanically, and therefore created some severe ludonarrative dissonance with the terror they should have inspired and the sheer annoyance that they actually gave me. The game is gorgeous throughout and is strangely enough a great game to listen to music or podcasts to. Finally, the story is mostly nonsense. It reminds me of a lot of mainstream arthouse films: incredibly focused on the theme and neat ideas, without utilizing the narrative mechanics necessary to make them work logically. Overall, I give this game a positive review simply because of its complex traversal mechanics. More games need to integrate something deeper than ""press forward"" when traveling through the game world.

I highly encourage watching Matthewmatosis' video for a much deeper breakdown that I fully agreed with after playing the game.",1674184373,1674184373,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When I was reading reviews and deliberating whether or not to buy Death Stranding Director's Cut, I repeatedly read comments such as, ""I was bored and miserable the whole time. It was a life-changing experience. 10/10."" After almost 55 hours, I have beaten the main story, and I have to say that, yes, the game was life-changing, and yes, I highly recommend it. But I was never bored or miserable. Though you spend most of your time walking around the map traversing increasingly inconvenient terrain, the game is about more than that. It's a lesson in community, in doing small acts of good for the benefit of strangers, and in turn being lent assistance by strangers in your own time of need. Though the core gameplay is very solitary, you and unseen others make small contributions to the world that make the collective experience more enjoyable. In between story missions, I set my own goals and sometimes spent entire sessions on these unofficial side objectives.

In terms of the plot, Death Stranding is a Kojima game. This means long, back-to-back, self-indulgent cutscenes; over-abundant, mind-bending lore; and gross over-use of symbolism and metaphor. It's a story of ropes and sticks, knots and strands, grasping hands and tangled webs. It would be fun to figure out what Kojima was trying to say, but instead the characters explain it all to you, repeatedly, throughout the game. There's a fair amount of fourth-wall breaking and references to other games. This is the only game I have played where a character let me know when I was half way through the story.

At the time; I was intrigued by this game as it was a huge AAA production attempting something different from the norm and after playing it for a bit I was convinced I simply had to stop playing it and go back and play everything made by Hideo Kojima that came before it. It was thanks to this game I finally got the push to go and play through the Metal Gear games and it has since become my favorite video game series. I finished Death Stranding, the Director's Cut on PC, for the first time in late 2022.

The game starts off very *slow* and it almost appears to be hostile to the player. If you are going to play Death Stranding you must be patient and willing to re-learn how to navigate a 3D world. The beauty of the game lies in taking your time and planning ahead. The controls and mechanics feel completely alien at first but that's because they serve as a ludo-narrative metaphor for forming connections with the people that inhabit the world; and by the end you'll have learned how to blaze through the maps just as you will have learned how to love all the quirks of the game’s cast of characters and how to speak the game's language.

From a purely technological standpoint, Kojima's games never fail to deliver. His games are always first class when it comes to optimization and performance so there's no need to worry about it with this game (although I do highly recommend playing on an SSD as the fast loading times do absolutely make a difference). 

One thing that caught me off-guard was how successful Death Stranding was at portraying naturalistic human models in a way no other game manages to be. It completely shatters the Uncanny Valley-ness one tends to expect of “realistic” video game 3D models with how large the range of emotions through facial expressions that the models can deliver is. That results in the actors delivering some top-notch performances in-engine, and what better fit for a game that cares so deeply and sincerely about humanity and connecting with others.

Death Stranding is simply put, an incredible game. It’s not a game for everybody, but neither was Metal Gear or any of Kojima’s previous work.

I stayed away from playing this for over a year and I am kinda glad. Got this as a birthday gift from my friend and I finally started playing it.
First few hours of the game, everyone told me is going to be a little boring but I did not find it boring at all. I enjoyed doing those little deliveries and cut scenes. 
Fast forward to 10 hours into it, I got engaged with the game and the surroundings. 

Now a little story from my walk-through, so I was doing a delivery and after a long walk through many obstacles, I could finally see the facility. As I was walking towards it, music started playing and I absolutely loved it. Small thing but it made me hopeful. 

Another thing that I realized during my play-through is that there are people all over the place but there was little to no in-person interaction with them and this particular thing reminded me of a certain period of time.
I started to relate to it on a very personal level and to some extent that it made me feel a little uncomfortable. 

Anyway, as a person who loves shooting and destruction, in games obviously, Death Stranding did not seem to be my type until I started playing it. 20 hours into the game, I was balls deep in it. 

The story, the characters, the stories behind them, how they were, and why they were like that, everything is absolutely perfect about Death Stranding. And this is as perfect as it gets. 

During the last cut-scene with Cliff, I could not hold my tears back, I was left speechless, and I cried.
And during my last delivery to the incinerator, BBs Theme started playing and on God, I lost it, I burst out crying and my heart could not take it but then right after the cremation(technically) my heart was so full and I was crying still.

Now, do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY YES I DO.
I know not everyone's going to enjoy the mechanism and gameplay of Death Stranding but I think it applies to all the other games.

If you want an amazing, beautifully made story, Death Stranding is the absolute best.
Lastly, as almost everyone knows already, it does not contain a lot of fighting or anything like that because combat is not the main focus of this game, but there is a good amount of fighting.

Thank you for reading, I will be waiting for you on the beach.

One of the best games I've ever played, and one of the best original stories I've ever heard of. The gameplay in itself is, curiously enough, calming and satisfying. It rewards patience and planning with a sort of meditative introspection. The story is original and well-told through the use of not only cutscenes and flashbacks, but through messages (in-game mail), interviews (data/lore dumps), environmental storytelling and context clues. It is to me like reading a good book that you can't put down, and once you're done you just want more.

A fair amount of the game is about making your walking, and later driving, easier.  The game introduces you to it's world and the controls slowly.  Good. I'm the kind of player who can miss the ""this is how you do that"" because I was busy trying to survive when the tip popped up. Then I can't get it back.  The backstory sets up the strange world you are in, but...I still don't fully understand it.  Just the impacts.  By the end I probably will.  The Directors Cut add quality of life improvements well worth having.

Visuals? Good. Plus fairly well optimized.  I played on a High End PC i9/3800TI Then switched to a 6 year old laptop good for 1080p.   Visually it looked the same.  

Game Play.  There is always something to do. It's well paced as you level up the world around you.  Your work lets the UCA give you more and better tools to deal with your environment and enemies, as well as make your job as a porter easier.

Multiplayer.   This is well done. You can see the impact of other porters in the world around you.  They will often have build a bridge or road you will need.  Here and there you will do the same and make their world better.  Shared equipment and cargo add an element that make your play more rewarding without adding extra grind.

Leveling is indirect. You work for likes, stars, and your rating.  Start and cargo leads to better equipment and tools.  Likes and rating leads to more connection in multiplayer and more ""skill"". Skill lessons the starting difficulties so you can better focus on the later challenges that the game brings up as it progresses.

I can see some elements of Phantom Pain in this game.  They work well. Better here than there actually.  I'd love to attach a balloon to the MULES and ""Recruit"" them for the UCA. But different game universe.

I bought the director's cut on sale and started my playthrough.

The game was a joy for me to play from start to finish.  I love a game that values exploration.  While there are clear points of origin and destination with the missions in this game, the player is free to roam the beautiful landscapes and erect their own ladders/bridges/zip lines.  

The online system feels like it does in the Dark Souls games.  There are players out there for you leaving bridges, ladders, climbing ropes, and messages that you experience while never seeing them in person.  

The graphics are great and the vistas are really beautiful.  

This game has a true soundtrack which plays often while you traverse the wilds which is a nice touch.

The acting is top notch and it's a lot of fun to run around as Norman Reedus.  His likeness and mannerisms are captured really well.  

The story is a sci-fi story that grabs you from the very start, at least it did me.  The ending is a little long and a tad bit convoluted, but this is nothing new for a Kojima game and the twists and turns aren't as bad as the MSG games.

If you want a mostly open world adventure with a sci-fi story and lots of exploration and travel, then this game is for you.  If you need a lot of action and shooting this game has it but not as the primary focus, so this game would not be for you.

I hope these narrative story driven games continue, I really enjoyed it.",1673731625,1673731625,True,5,0,0.58242952823638916,0,True,False,False

Music is fantastic and suits the game perfectly
Graphics are incredible
Story/Cut scenes are atmospheric with an highly imaginative story line 
Acting is brilliant with some very talented actors playing the characters. 
Game mechanics feel unique and refreshingly different to most games 

Cons
Cut Scenes go on for too long and cant seem to exit the game with ESC key while they are playing.

been playing game for over 3 hours, and feel like i'm still playing the intro to the game mechanics/story and any moment the game will begin.

I have read when you complete the game it then gets more fun because it sounds like it turns into a sandbox style game with some kind of online aspect where you see other people attempts to setup ladders etc.. which sounds good if that's correct. 

initially i gave it a thumbs down but changing as it is a unique experience, I am going to persevere and just enjoy the bizarre story and the bits of interspersed game play....

I would only recommend this game to people that like interactive movie style games.",1673699349,1673701390,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have have vehicles!  Just had to put that out there.  ;-)

I don't need to mention already what other's have posted. Yes, at the core you are making deliveries between different points either on foot or a truck/motorcycle. You can either plow through the story and complete the game in 30ish hours or take your time and not even be halfway done while spending 145 hours in it.  I finished the original game in a little over 250 hours.

It comes down to this: You need an imagination. You need an imagination to appreciate the story and the off-world/spiritual occurrences in it. You need an imagination to appreciate the level of insanity placed into the beauty of the abnormal in the game.

You are Sam. Your job is to connect the inhabitants of a continent together through the game's ""internet."" And most of them give you perks the more deliveries you make. It is what happens between these deliveries. You have mildly annoying humans who want to steal your cargo and you have the supernatural trying to take your soul.

Why have I spent 145 hours in the OG and am not even halfway done? I enjoy the scouting. I would look at a mission and its route, not accept it, go towards where I need to make this trip and scout for the best route. Sounds simple enough, but you are dealing with areas vehicles do not always fit through, streams/rivers, avoiding the supernatural, making sure your electric vehicle doesn't run out of charge, etc. It is a real threat to have driven and not have reached your destination, your vehicle's charge is half gone, and you are unable to carry all the cargo on your back. Do you turn back or do continue forward to your destination?

The grinding in the game is fully optional. Will you build your highway systems to make your future orders far easier to deal with? Or will you just deal with off roading it the entire game?  I suggest not building the highways if you prefer battling the game's biggest enemy: the terrain.

Playing the game with DLSS makes it pure eye candy. Even 145 hours in I still find myself looking at the scenery and marveling at how amazing it all looks. I eventually spent over 278 hours in the OG. I ended up playing the DC to play without the highways. Want a real challenge in your journeys? Don't build the highways or ziplines!

If you like plowing through games and not even putting any thought into the wildly imaginative story and think the supernatural is something silly, then the game is probably not for you. But if you love building, connecting NPCs, seeing insanely looking beings, are a big sci-fi nut, and have an affinity for appreciating landscape, then you just might enjoy the game.",1655648877,1673441397,True,1,1,0.488047003746032715,1,True,False,False

Death Stranding is a game that was never meant for mass appeal, but considering its creator, that should come as no surprise. Hideo Kojima games have always been on the fringe of sanity.

Death Stranding is a game unlike any other. Some have called it a walking simulator, while others called it a boring mess. These statements are going to depend on each individual playing, because I would be describe Death Stranding as an experience. It's a game on the surface about delivering packages, but its soul is an experience. It's an experience that will touch everyone differently and provoke different thoughts.

The game does have a slow start, there is no denying that, but once you get past that slowness and start to see pieces of the puzzle, the game takes on a new life. Death Stranding is an absolute breath of fresh air, that will make you experience varying degrees of emotion. While I would love to go into details on how that is, it's best you simply experience it for yourself. There is nothing like Death Stranding; it's an anomaly in gaming, with having such a simple premise, yet somehow executing that premise with flying colors. There's something special about getting a like in the game, and that satisfaction of delivering cargo without any damage that just keeps you playing.

Is it a perfect game? No, certainly not. The story can slow down at times, there are repetitive sections, and there will be some frustration. But that is all part of the experience, and it is an experience. If you stick with it and engross yourself in the loop and its story, you'll be stuck thinking about this game long after you put it down.

I don't think any of us expected a game about delivering packages to be fun or engrossing, but Kojima Productions pulled it off. Strap on your backpack, because you have many trails to forge.",1673345750,1673345892,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

At first glance, my reaction to Death Stranding was ""This gameplay of delivering packages looks rather dull, but the story and world seem pretty interesting"". After having played through the game, my verdict is now ""Delivering packages is surprisingly fun, but the story is an absolute chore to sit through"". Death Stranding is, at best, a game that manifests neat themes in its gameplay before proceeding to mash the game's themes through your skull through dialogue that comes across as practically pretentious to me.

The gameplay of Death Stranding is surprisingly gripping! The asynchronous gameplay of DS is actually completely novel and unique and for that, I can really commend it. The graphics are generally pretty great too. Out of the gameplay elements, the only major issues I have are:

- The combat is very mediocre, especially the boss fights
- Reuse of buildings (there's one large and one small bunker that the game uses for almost every single major location)
- Occasionally wonky physics
- Late game, you almost always want to use trucks except in specific missions

Despite that, I enjoyed the gameplay.

However, what I cannot recommend are the hours upon hours of god-awful cutscenes, cringy dialogue, lore that make no fucking sense, and characters that are as shallow as a puddle. I would legitimately give this game a better rating if all of the cutscenes and dialogue were excluded from the game. Kojima cannot leave anything up to the imagination, and every single fucking detail of the game is exposition dumped to you again and again and again.

Death Stranding is really hard to recommend for this reason, especially since many don't seem to click with the gameplay of delivering packages. Even though I enjoyed it, even I often found it incredibly frustrating at times. Because of these reasons, I'm just short of being able to recommend this game. I hope the sequel will be better about its awful storyline, but based on Kojima's progression from MGS4 to MGS5 to this, I don't have much hope.",1673315345,1673315345,False,46,5,0.668212294578552246,0,True,False,False

You can live your life delivering packages and doing good or you can leave vehicles and trash everywhere. Half the time i'm just returning other players' trash back to the garage or scraps. I don't get anything out of it. I can't believe in a post-apocalypse people still don't learn. I use to be proud of the roads and bridges we made together but for what? Just for players to have a trash car every 20 yards- it's revolting. Currently, i'm fighting in the trenches of a world war era and it feels like home. I don't remember who I was before this but they told me I was the Great Courier, transporter, Deliverier. It doesn't matter- whats the point of living if you're only living for yourself without love. Love- true love is lost in this game- no not a game., this life . How can i continue to work like this with no one to love and love me back huh?:?>>>?>?? How can I do this anyumore I want out . Let me out 

January 8th (28 hour gameplay update) 
Living is no different than being dead if you're all alone. Unlike the real world at least I have my bb to look after on my chest. The AI fighting is actually fun to fight against like the mule scavengers because you cant just fight them all together they attack you while you're strangling one of them and their trident throws across the distance are epic when you don't expect them to throw so far sometimes and disable your vehicle then they come up on you like a mob with 6 getting out of their SUV . I really like that you can build roads with other players without them seeing you. Kinda like me typing this and someone reading it maybe proving I exist.. This game can feel lonley at times with the music and i know its post apocolyptic and thats normal but something about delivering packages makes me feel like I work and I work and I'm alone and I'm alone.

The moment I heard about this game I wanted to be mad and not believe what I was reading , hearing and seeing. Now some time has passed since it came out and perhaps the hype was just that, hype from Kojima. The game wants you to play online- because you are connected with what you do and online gamers to you by building bridges- this game is all about positive reinforcement. You build a sign and people like it , you build a bridge , deliver a package, build a mail box and it's all for those thumbs up. Unlike me it's very easy to like this game when you're online . Seeing a strangers ladder or rope on a cliff side to help you out can really make things fun and easy. Too easy unfortunantly. Even playing offline you get so many materials from just walking outside you can virtually build any tool you want all the time. 
          Don't worry about carrying extra packages in the begining there's no point . Once you make it to the third base you get to build generators and get the motorcycle. Super easy game and nothing really challenging so far. I think it would be fun to play while your friends are playing to see what they build assuming you have friends. I'm alone too but maybe I can build some bridges with this",1673007572,1673282893,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What i think many people get wrong abolut this game, is the question ""how can walking from a to b fun?"" and that's the special think about that game, because it IS fun.
It is incredible fun to plan whats the best way to travel to your distance and how much stuff you carry with you.

I played it on ps4 and loved every minute of it, unique soundtrack, SUPERFUN gameplay (if it's your type of game because it is 100% not for everyone) good graphics, nice voiceacting and lovely story (which is a little bit overwhelming, especially in your first run)

The only thing i don't like that much is that in your emails, there is tooooo much to read, like srsly if you like reading, good, but for me it was just too much.

Kojima used a new and unique way of showing the main idea of connecting people. During the game, the concept of bonds, bridges and connecting people are constantly mentioned. You play as Sam the delivery person and by delivering to others you connect people together and you will also feel connected by using other players constructions. When the road was bad and the task was rough, a ladder or a road sign from others somehow magically inspired me. Plus the BGM is really really good! And I'd like to leave signs and constructions on the road in the hope that it may help another Sam.
Also, this is a game that needs patience especially for the first two episodes (roughly first ten hours for me). It may seem a little boring at first since all you do is going from one place to another in order to deliver goods. Repeat the cycle of “take order-deliver-complete order” over and over again. But once I got used to it and made it through to the episode 3, with more elements added and the story expanded, I gradually began to love it. I just took my time and started to appreciate the beautiful view on the road. As the story goes to its end, the ending is splendid and touching. I actually cried in episode 14.

The Graphics/Environment- Quite simply beautiful. The mountains, the streams, and pretty much everything else looks very realistic and the characters are no exception either. 

The Premise/Concepts- This is definitely one of the game’s biggest strengths to me. Kojima has certainly come up with some creative and unique ideas here. And though it is another game with an apocalyptic setting, it’s the type of apocalypse that shows how unique it is..

The Voice Acting- While nobody did a bad job in this section, the quality does tend to rollercoaster from passable to pretty good, the latter of which is primarily displayed during Chapter 14. Those that I felt did the best were Troy Baker and Mads Mikkelsen.

The Character Design- This was done pretty well. If you were to place the main character and the side characters in a room next to each other, not one would look similar to another. 



What I Wasn’t a Fan of:
The Story- I had heard that one of the things Kojima was known for, aside from wacky character names and long cutscenes, was his cryptic story narratives and after playing the game, I can see why. However, I’ll just say that it simply wasn’t my cup of tea. So many things felt unexplained that by the time I reached the end, I still didn’t understand 75% of what had happened.

Gameplay Progression- Some games may start out slow and simple and get more intense/engaging as it goes, but this game remains the same exact way throughout its entire runtime with pretty much no gameplay progression. 

The Side Missions- To put it simply, the side missions are exactly the same as the main missions. Which means that if you don’t enjoy the mains missions, you more than likely won’t enjoy the side missions either..

The Excessive Mechanics- For a game that doesn’t look to be too complex in how it’s meant to be played, the mechanics section in the menu would beg to differ. However, instead of adding complexity, it comes across as over bloated, due to the fact that there are dozens upon dozens upon dozens of mechanics, which increase as the game goes along.

The Cutscenes- Don’t get me wrong, the cutscenes are well done and I personally think the first two are my favorite from the entire game. The rub is that they have a tendency to be longer than necessary, leading to them feeling dragged out at points. The reason for this is the lack of engaging material being displayed. r.

The Dialogue- This commonly ranges from ‘meh’ to ‘comes straight out of a scientific essay’, neither of which are rather interesting to listen to for extended periods of time. This also isn’t helped by the previous point regarding the cutscenes, which is where the majority of the dialogue is. Other times, it’s the constant calls from side characters right after a cutscene is finished, which can get annoying.

The Pacing- Pacing helps player engagement and when a game becomes either too slowly paced or paced too fast, it creates the possibility for the player to lose that sense of engagement and perhaps enjoyability. Unfortunately, this falls into the slow pacing category with long treks that start to feel tedious and the, once again, long cutscenes that feel longer than needed.

The Characters- Like the story concepts, the characters didn’t feel as fleshed out as they could’ve been. Granted, they do have some depth and uniqueness to them, but it doesn’t feel like enough to cause me to feel connected to them/care about them. r.

The Driving Mechanic- The trikes bump into nearly every rock on a bumpy landscape and while you might try to find a smoother area to use it on, they’re few and far apart. A couple other unappealing aspects are the vehicle shutting down temporarily when getting close to a BT area, the jerky turning, and it pausing when you go to drive forward after reversing.

But by the end of this thing... and I call it a thing cause its really trying to be art but the art doesnt work. Let me explain, The whole point is for people to come together, real players, to build strands and help one another, but 20 hours in, you realize noone really cares about anyone else and they stop maintaining each others fast travel routes etc, etc. And in some cases, some of the structures like ziplines seem to be placed in joke areas, that are completely unusable. the point failed. Its actually quite profound in what the game is showing instead of what it wants from people. SOme people build bridges and highways, whilst the majority of people dont want to help maintain them, only use them. By the end of the game when you need all of this stuff, its not available cause noone thought to maintain anything nor did they care to help others.

Now that, thats out of the way, lets talk controls, they are THE WORST CONTROLS I have ever seen in a video game. We are talking playstation 2 Brank games, like the ones made for movies, like Charlies Angels. The mechanics never work correctly. A cliff or a path you have had no issue using before, makes you fall on your ass another round and break all your gear and lose all your cargo.

The game does everything a great game should do, like teach you the mechanics and build you up as you go, but near the end, it just starts to punish you, not only in difficulty, but in respect, the game does not repect the player at all. 

By the end, you are just shouting at sam, and the BB, because its just an endless slew of him falling, the bb crying and the gear just falling apart as ghosts just multiply and multiply. Im sorry, but its true what everyone was saying about this game, it freaking sucks ass. The 1 saving grace in this game is from another game from a completly different developer, Cyberpunk 2077. There are easter eggs that give you V's quick-hacks... and those come in handy to a point that you are using those more than quite a few other deterrence. Its really sad that the game was so bad they needed to ask CDProjekt Red's for permission to use an attack...

On the last point, it says it runs on steam deck but mine is crashing, dropping frames, and completely shutting off. Im sorry, director's cut is not worth the price, wait till its free on Epic if you truly want to play it.

The game even has to have other players whomst have beated then game help you in boss battles because the dev's seem to have realized they messed up on weapon loadouts. You get to a fight with nothing and then need a dozen grenades and other things to beat a giant hulking monster and you have 2, so other avatars come out of the muck and throw you gear they had.... its ridiculous. 

You know what this game is, its a tech demo, thats what it is, its a giant advertisement for Kojima's studio and his ability to produce/ make revenue for investors. Thats it.",1673196114,1673198803,False,5,0,0.494610369205474854,0,True,False,False

Death Stranding isn't a video game in a traditional sense, it is more. 
What I think what Hideo Kojima wanted to accomplish is, that he wanted to create a movie inside a game. 
This game/movie tackles topics such as our problems of our day and age. Social isolation, overreliance on social media, dopamine rushes induce by likes on said social media and a general dehumanisation of our overall society and not caring for each other. Also, since you transport sperms and eggs, it tackles the problem mainly Japan has but also Europe and generally the whole western world, where the young generation is slowly dying out, since nobody has children, and the countryside is dying out because it is dominated by old people that are simply dying out. 

I think this game does a well job at this. As it shows that we are on a full collision course with our downfall, until we somehow manage to reverse course. Thank you Kojima for redpilling me.

ВРИТТЕН БАЙ КОДЗИМА.
КОДЗИМА КОДЗИМА КОДЗИМА.

Мем ""кодзима гений"" похоже настолько завирусился, что Кодзима сам в это поверил чего делать никак нельзя было. Игра изо всех щелей будет напоминать, что её сделал САМ Кодзима, и титры покажет раза три.

Я опасался, что базовый геймплей будет унылым симулятором хотьбы, но вышло вполне не дурно, симулятор хотьбы не унылый. Примерно через два часа игры появляется машина и мотоцикл, мотоцикл может проехать где угодно, на любой горный пик можно забраться на мотоцикле, что я и делал. На этом магия пешего курьера из яндекса развалилась. Благо карта маленькая и хождение особо не успевает утомить. Чтобы это подпереть геймдизайнеры (КОДЗИМА) добавили несколько заданий  когда надо провести коробку, которую нельзя трясти, тут приходится не на моцике по горам скакать, а просто бегать. Можно построить дороги, но тогда проще сразу евротрак симулятор купить, там доставка сделана интереснее и сложные миссии на доставку всякого негабаритного там тоже органичнее и интереснее.

Повествование выглядит прикольно, нагоняют всякой загадочности, актёры стараются, Михельсон вообще молодец, но в этот мир очень быстро становится трудно поверить. А напыщенная серьёзность только хуже делает.
Вообще когда знакомишься с местным лором создаётся впечатление, что разговариваешь с 12летним чуваком, который посмотрел дискавери и битву экстрасенсов: всего по верхам, и всё вперемешку. Тут тебе и антиматерия, квантовая физика, геология, астрология, египетская мифология и всё всё всё, нехватает только Таро и древа Сефирот, ну или я не заметил. Всё это с претенциозной серьёзностью тебе рассказывают, при этом персонаж типа местного завсклада в жопе мира спокойно про египетскую мифологию может порассуждать. 
И в целом то сюжет ну такой, сойдёт, но по итогу ничего особенного. Нагоняли пафоса зазря.
Гораздо больше проблем в том, что этот сюжет рассказвают супер криво и растянуто. Тут не будет такого, что равномерно поглощаешь какую то историю и просто с каждым разом она обрастает нюансами, чтобы потом дойти до точки разрешения и ты такой ""офигеть как это разрешили"". 
Нет, тут всё через задницу.
Ну то есть вначале дают инфы. Потом долгое время основным источником сюжета служат по сути текстовые файлы, которые тут типа база данных или там письма которые тебе другие персонажи пишут. Халтура кароче. Потом ещё чутка сюжета расскажут. Потом титры. Через 30 минут титров оказывается что это ещё не конец, после титров продолжается одна за другой катсцена где и рассказывается примерно 85% сюжета, который до этого был особо и не представлен. 

Ещё касательно противников, тут есть болванчики люди, с ними всё понятно.
А есть ВТ, это типа адские приведения которые наводят ужас и вообще страшно страшно. Вот примерно в самом начале игры разбираешься как их убивать и они вообще перестают быть проблемой как противники, а остаются ислючительно как заноза в жопе. Всё дело в том, что эти чуваки спавнятся в определённых областях и когда ты мимо них проходишь, они хватают тебя за ноги, пытаясь опрокинуть, из тебя валится груз вызывая приступы жопной боли, надо отбегать подбирать груз и дальше ковылять, кароче просто пустая трата времени. Но вот если им удалось тебя уронить или если на моцике неудачно влетел прямо в БТ этого, то начинается фаза боя с этой штукой, которая представляет из себя скучный тир, когда просто стреляешь и знаешь что проиграть тут невозможно, это не опасные монстры. Что, конечно, создаёт диссонанс. Вообще тут нету интересных боёв, единственное что было прикольно это мордобой в грязи, ну там ближе к концу. А так уныло.

В игре есть онлайновое взаимодействие, можно построить мост, по нему будут ходить другие игроки. Прикольно. Ну и всё.

Можно ещё порассуждать на тему этой игры. Она не безоговорочно плохая, даже наверное стоит своих денег не будь настолько бездарно растянута и откровенно хуёво срежессирована.

All I know that if you have an ear for what and how it says it will be one of the most immersive things you have ever touched in the world of games. 

About the Director's Cut edition I can't decide if the numerous new little things that I could find compared to the vanilla release are the products of updates or this ""maxi"" version but they are definitely there. Some are subtle and some come with a massive kick, especially if you play and know some other distinctive game worlds as well.

Apart from gamers with other-than-the-typical taste, I'd absolutely recommend it for people recovering from a mental disorder. When I played DS first around 2019 I was neck-deep into it. Without details it was something that temporarily blocked short-term ""memory recording"" in a random fashion and the world fell apart around me as hours vanished from the events of a single day. I became disconnected. During DS playthrough my conditions slowly started to improve. I started to re-connect. So the process what happened in the core of this somewhat meditative game, happened in the real life as well in parallel. All symbolic. Because of the meditative flow of the game you can dive inside. You have time to think about deep questions while you're carving your way from A to B through the unbelievable scenery of the game.

When I'm out exploring on my own, I stumble across a ladder, a rope or maybe some helpful machinery placed there by other players and I wonder, weather their travels were as aimless as my own.
There is no real quest hub, a place from where to start a mission. There is no fast travel that takes you to the next thing to do.

Firstly, DIRECTOR'S CUT is the version to buy over the base game. If you didn't know that, well now you do. The quality of life improvements are great worth the extra dubloons alone and the additional content such as missions are fun and inticing.

This game is very good when you come into it and allow yourself to be immersed in the world and lore. The characters are played by people you'll likely recognize and the story itself invites you to look deeper and investigate and discover for yourself what this world is, who lives in it and why things are the way they are. 

The game play and mechanics are simple and may seem even a little challenging to an outsiders pov but there are enough intricacies laid out and layered on top of the game play's fundamentals. If you've played a Hideo Kojima game you'll be familiar with this style of game play; you'll be taught the basics but the fun is in experimenting and discovering how these different game play elements interact and elevate the experience and raise your prowess. 

This game will take you for a ride if you let it, just give it a try and see for yourself. Only major complaint and problem you might face is one having to do with 'Access Violation' Crashes: to my understanding it's mainly a DX12 issue with varied solutions. Should you run into it yourself just browse the games' community tab or look up a YT video.

As a side note this is actually my first serious review on Steam; had to show support to this game; it's incredibly unique and I believe more people should play and experience it for themselves.",1673013140,1673013204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have had a rare case of impostrintrius decaneous from birth, which could only be cured by reinforcing my cells with the genetic material of Hideo Kojima.  For as long as I can remember, I have felt an intrinsic compulsion to look, talk, and act just like Kojima, and it has led to my Ka being entwined with Kojima's Ka.  Did you know that the first game he worked on was as an assistant director for Penguin Adventure in 1986, the sequel to Antarctic Adventure?  It revolutionized the old world by being the first game with a talking penguin, inspiring scientists to genetically develop a penguin with the capacity for speech.  I have become the world's leading expert on all of Kojima's artistic works, and it is because of this understanding of his cultural contributions and our interconnected Ka that I have developed unforseen insight into the nature of the Beaches.  I now must perpetually wear an eyepatch that projects Kojima games directly onto my cerebral cortex, or my Ka will leave my Ha to recombine with Kojima, leaving nothing but an empty husk.

It ended up becoming one of my favourite games and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. However I can agree with the sentiment that it ""isn't for everyone"". Its certainly a different game from what most are used to and some may need to provide the commitment to fully get to grips with it.

So is DS a 'walking simulator'?

I would say its not as simple as that. Its a game about planning your journey A -> B, you are tasked with building roads, ziplines and other structure that will aid you in getting to your destination. The player will also need to either fight or sneak their way through terrorists/bandits or ghosts. There IS combat, there IS Stealth, there ARE vehicles/driving and there IS a vast amount of weaponry and tactical equipment. 

I would say it feels like a heavily modded MGS 5 or atleast the core DNA of MGS 5 is being used as a foundation. Like MGS5 the player has an open world sandbox to explore and 'missions'... Now in the form of 'orders' make use of segments of this open world and the player is tasked with planning and utilising his inventory.

The formula is thus:

The player is in a large open world with rest points dotted throughout the world. These rest points offer 'Orders' that task you with taking a delivery order to the destination, another rest point or way-point. The player must think about the weight of his cargo, how to alleviate it, how to make the journey smooth, any structures that can be built and used, etc. If it is a 'walking simulator' it may also be described as a 'path builder'. The player also has access to other player's structures that he can use.

A given journey may have different obstacles including enemies such as terrorists/bandits. The 'BT' ghosts are always fun to get through, the player will need to sneak through the ghosts (using blood weaponry to eliminate any ghosts in your path) but if caught the player risks a fight with a 'boss' there and then.

The story is driven by completing the main mission orders (the main journey takes the player from the East coast to the West coast of the former United States - Although definitely NOT to scale!) and is dynamically woven into the gameplay. The cut scenes are a joy to watch as always with Kojima games.

Now despite an aura of mystery surrounding this story and world since the game's reveal I would say both the world and story become very understandable as the story progresses both through lore items and cutscenes. The central story of the characters actually turned out to be incredibly satisfying and the ending wrapped things up nicely, there were many moments when it was pretty emotional and impactful. The acting from Norman Reedus, Madds Mikkelsen, Lea Seydoux and others were really stellar.

The soundtrack too was great as to be expected.

Aside from the main story, there are more than 500 side orders (with premium difficulty option for each) that the player can complete in their own leisure, as a result the end game world provides the player with a plethora of things to do, including weekly challenges, providing assistance to other players by up keeping and maintaining their structures and common infrastructure. Arguably the main game starts once the story is over and the veteran player embraces the freedom of the open world.

There certainly exists skill gaps that the new player will progress through the more they play and become acquainted with the more advanced mechanics. For instance the player will be able to complete a time sensitive order in the snowy mountains by exploiting the use of a cargo carrier as a snow board.

If the intrigued player gives the game a chance they will eventually discover that Death Stranding is a surprisingly fun experience, the formula (if given a proper chance) can be therapeutic and rewarding, especially if the player relaxes with music/podcasts. This game is BUILT for casual sessions.

Overall, I would say its a fantastic game, for the story, for the 'Kojima-isms', for the soundtrack, for the graphics, for the stealth, for the atmosphere and for the high replay-ability value.

30 hours in and it still bombards you with systems and information to make it even more confusing. ""SAM, I know you like some rest but let me talk to you through some new systems you already know..."" 

Sigh..this gets very annoying. Even 30 hours in, i get cut off my gameloop for more exposure. Where is Doomguy when you need him?

The actual freedom, once procured, and  missions + carrying is fun enough though. But I don't get the social aspect as much. There are signs and buildings everywhere spoiling the fun of exploring yourself. So make sure you turn them off or look at the options menu first. This game is exceptional art. But not all art is good. It is really too confusing, maybe too unfamiliar for me.

I play offline, and hopefully the effin' yappin on about gaming systems and endless exposure about the world will end soon. It's not all that interesting or complete on its own. It all looks like loose ends mashed together to look like serious worldbuilding. There is no deeper meaning. Just fronts for gamey systems.

Still with all that being said. It doesn't let go and i want to make another run, every time again.
And i cannot wait for what it has in store next. Still it is not a good game. The separate segments are poorly executed. Combat is poor and way too easy. Stealth is easily avoided, hauling cargo is not necesarry. Just do the story. There's not much else to it. Likes have no impact and 5 stars gives you a star on your suit. :\

The overexposure and seriousness of the world really needs to simmer down (I wish i could turn off the radio) but the game itself is a walking simulator, and it is enjoyable enough.

- The driving is horrid. It reminds me of the horse in Oblivion.
- The Mules are no threat, you can sucker punch them all even on the hardest difficulty. The a.i. is stupid.
- The Bt's are no threat, you can run away when caught and they'll disappear.
- It is a shallow game with gamey fronts.
- Bug : Taa is off when you launch the game every time. I manually have to change a setting in the menu, then back again for it to pop on. 

Pick it up for 15 bucks.

I first played the base version on gamepass, not long ago at all. I hadn't ever tried it, because like a fool I listened to the general public about it not being good and 'being a walking simulator'. What a mistake. I should have just ignored them from the start - and that's why I'm writing this... in hopes you'll do the same. 

Is it perfect? Nah. But you know what - it's a Kojima game. So every incredibly weird thing our basic minds can't even imagine, as well as all the things we can, are all there. They've all been thought of. Then there's the ""how could walking back and forth be fun' question. The answer is that it might not be, at first. But as you progress, it gets more challenging but also gives you more tools to ease the pain. 

Plotting out the route you're going to take, using well placed community objects and your own, using a truck, car, bike, floating carrier, zip-line, cargo catapult, jumping off the top of a mountain, are you warm enough, need to pee, is that a memory chip, what was I doing... 

And Director's Cut makes an already fantastic game, 1000% better with the inclusion of new tools and reasons to get those places to 5-stars. It's literally a masterpiece.

Whether or not this game is for you depends both on what you want from a game and how you choose to play it. The core gameplay of Death Stranding is right up my alley - but certain gameplay design choices made me absolutely miserable and ultimately led me to stop playing 150 hours and less than halfway in.

If you are the kind of player who:
- Enjoys monotonous grinding
- Genuinely cares for NPCs and wants to actually help them
- Goes full RP-mode in how they interact with the game world
Then this review might be relevant to you.

If not - you will probably find my complaints silly and you should ignore it.

The gameplay is pretty straightforward: walk around an empty post-apocalyptic world with a variety of beautiful, mostly mountainous, landscapes and deliver packages sent between survivor strongholds. Gradually discover technology that makes the job easier, from an electric motorbike to an exoskeleton that lets you jump over rivers. Occasionally encounter threats that are quite easy to deal with: your biggest enemy is the weather corroding your cargo cases, but even that stops being much of a problem once you unlock covered trucks.

What I liked about these parcels is that people don't just send each other food and fuel: they send wine, old photographs, books. The game assigns equal value to technical craftsmanship and the art of cosplay, celebrating human society, the things that make us human, and those that help us connect, from an e-mail you get in-game from a farmer talking about how the shift to agriculture allowed human society to grow into what it is today, to a collectible chip talking about the magic of glasswork.

But this core mechanic is also what caused me misery. You don't just deliver cargo from location to location - you can also find cargo dropped by NPC porters (and other players) on the ground as you travel. And NPC cargo respawns constantly - and always in the exact same place. Once I noticed it was happening, it made what I was doing feel futile. Then I noticed that the missions are also repeated. Sure, it makes sense when the mission is to deliver consumable goods (they finished all the beer - and now they need more), but if the mission is ""hey, the bad guys stole my collectible dinosaur figurines - can you go get them back for me?"", then that just begets so many questions: my brother in Christ, how many collectible dinosaur figurines do you HAVE? How many do you NEED? Is it the same collectibles that were stolen last time? How do they keep getting stolen, anyway? Still I soldiered on, because grandpa needs his meds and the farmers made fresh bread for everyone. I'd pick up cargo that hadn't been delivered from locations I passed in order to deliver it to the final recipient - and this ended up being the straw that broke the camel's back, as the game, without warning, told me that I've reached the limits for entrusted cargo, and destroyed it, instead of just not allowing me to pick up more. I reloaded an older save in an attempt to save that cargo by quickly dropping off everything that was in my truck - but the game still destroyed something that I had stored somewhere and was going to come back to. Once that happened, I just didn't want to play anymore. The game decided to destroy the NPCs' meds, fertilizers and games because it couldn't be bothered to tell me in advance that I should deal with the cargo I had accumulated before taking on more.

The game is supposed to be open world, but is not designed accordingly. You'd think a game that's all about forging new paths would take care not to have invisible walls - but yet here we are. At some point you're told that you need to go to a certain location to update the software on your device, otherwise everything could fall apart, ""but you need to stop at two other locations first, because it's a very difficult journey"". Which is fine, except I had already hiked to that location while I was exploring the map. I hiked to what I'm assuming is an endgame location and found out it is easily accessible by... simply walking around. An open world game means you will have players who don't play it in a linear fashion. At least block the path off with a landslide, the equipment for which needs to be activated from a previous location.

The story felt pretty sloppy to me so far - but I don't think that's what matters in this game. It is just a framing device. What matters are the stories told through the world itself, the NPCs and their cargo, as I mentioned earlier. There are collectibles in the form of basically USB sticks with information from the old world from them, basically showcasing things Kojima likes and was inspired by in his creative vision. I feel like this bit could have been improved with some outside perspective. Do we really need 5+ motorbike models and several different mechas as collectibles, instead of, say, the works of Homer? I feel like some of the things in this showcase undermine the main message the game is trying to convey by limiting the scope of ""valuable connections"".

""Hi, I'm Sam BRIDGES, I CONNECT people )))"". Waiting for Nomi Malone to show up with naming like this.

So I'm done. Not because this is a bad game - but because I was subjectively unhappy with certain elements of the gameplay. Just gonna go back in and give away all my stuff.

The reason I'm still recommending it is because I know my experience isn't universal and objective. If you're looking for a zen game with occasional action that celebrates humanity and human connections - Death Stranding is for you. If you're the sort of player who has to pick up every bit of cargo and help every NPC - it might make you miserable.",1672775909,1672775909,True,3,0,0.54033660888671875,0,True,False,False

The entire premise of this game is that humanity finally ""found"" the afterlife and it changed the Earth for good and created an Apocalypse. This game deals with the post apocalypse and how to survive now that the ""afterlife"" has invaded the real world.

What this game is: A plot-driven get from Point A to Point B adventure game. Now when I say ""adventure"" I say this loosely because you can literally do anything in this game; it's as open-world as you can get.

What this game also is: Besides choosing your Pt A-Pt B and deciding the best way to get there, this game has a mechanic worse than death, which is called a voidout. Without getting too into the jargon, a voidout is something that happens when the enemy catches you and it erases part of the map you can progress through.

What this game is not and never will be: A walking simulator. If you want an actual walking simulator, there are plenty of those on Itch.Io.",1672647112,1672647112,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're going in to this blind, know that a significant chunk of the game is trekking across a (very pretty) landscape delivering packages to places. Yes there is combat, and yes there are vehicles that make certain deliveries simpler. But for a good amount of the game, you're hoofing it. Whether you find this frustrating or relaxing is entirely up to you, but just a fair warning that if you aren't interested in this for the story, and / or aren't a fan of the ""walking simulator"" type games, this is likely not the game for you. Even if you're in to story-rich games, Kojima is a very special kind of writer who may not be for everyone.

As for recommendations, I really like this game. Enough to play it a second time for the Director's Cut version. The gameplay is relaxing for the most part, and the combat when you do have to do it is satisfying. The online features are implemented well in a gameplay sense and are pretty thematically appropriate, letting you help your fellow porter (delivery person) with anything from a generator to refill your batteries, to a word of encouragement for you and your baby.

The story does a fantastic job of putting a carrot on a stick for you: just enough to get you invested at first, but always leaving you with another mystery to solve, or a theory to consider. All of the voice actors did incredible work in their roles, and it really shows what a difference it makes to have high quality actors in video games. It's full of your standard Kojima ""what in the world"" in terms of throwing certain words / concepts at you, but given the length of the game it's all fed to you at a rather digestible rate. The world building is done well, and I couldn't get enough of the stories being told about how the world got the way it is, and where it's going from there.

The art style is...well, just plain cool. From the enemy design, armors, and just staring at the scenic vistas, there is a lot of eye candy in this game. The included art book is also really fun to look at, but of course full of spoilers if you haven't finished the game yet. Low Roar, Ludvig Forssell, and all of the others involved in this game's soundtrack + score really made something special, but it's a shame Sam didn't get a portable MP3 player to enjoy it while making his deliveries.

Overall, I'd highly recommend anyone on the fence to go watch some actual gameplay first. This is not a short game, like most walking simulators (HowLongToBeat has the average playthrough at around 40h), and there are occasionally some gaps between cutscenes / story beats that your interest may wane if you're dreading the gameplay. If you can get in to the zone of it all, or if you're already a fan of Kojima, you'll get to have a truly unique experience in gaming.

It’s not just a walking simulator.

[h1]Review and Commentary[/h1]
[i]([b][u]Thoughts on the Director’s Cut[/u][/b]: If you already own Death Stranding and are wondering if it’s worth the $10 to upgrade, that’s a hard question to answer, because while the new features are nice to have, they are not essential to the experience. I personally appreciate being able to use ziplines with floating carriers, but your mileage will vary.)[/i]

Here is something completely different, not just for Hideo Kojima but for any other developer, and that’s refreshing when so many games depend on tried-and-true cliches. Death Stranding at its most basic level is a game about getting cargo from point A to point B, but as the popular saying informs us, the destination is not nearly as interesting as the journey. The protagonist, Sam Bridges, is a “porter” in post apocalyptic America whose task – perhaps addiction – is to trudge across desolate wastelands to deliver parcels to a variety of far flung outposts. Playing as Sam, the player must pick his way carefully across inhospitable landscapes seeking the safest and most convenient route to his goal. Rather than “walking simulator”, I would describe Death Stranding as an exploration game unencumbered by the monotony of an enemy behind every bush. The terrain, weather, and Sam’s own physical limitations are your primary opposition. That's not to say you never face more traditional foes, but while Sam is a capable enough fighter, the game encourages you to avoid combat. Perhaps the most distressing opposition you will regularly encounter is what is known as “Timefall”, which is a mysterious rain that causes anything it comes in contact with to age rapidly. While Sam’s clothes are made to protect his body from its effects, the parcels he carries are not so lucky, and enough time spent in the elements will eventually destroy Sam’s precious cargo. It's this constant tug of war with the environment that gives the game its compelling hook.

I assume Kojima was inspired in part by the question, ""What if we depicted video game inventories more realistically?"" Every item Sam equips has dimensions and weight and must be physically attached to him in some fashion. No ""infinite bag of holding"" for our protagonist, or items that disappear inside a pocket. If he wants to carry it, it has to actually fit on his person or on one of several transports he gets access to later in the game. And when he's weighed down by an especially heavy load, you feel it. His movement becomes more sluggish, his footing less sure, requiring the player to maintain Sam's balance lest he topple over and damage his cargo. Even walking downhill can be a treacherous exercise, with momentum causing Sam to take additional steps after you want him to stop, which can end badly if you happen to be near a dropoff. Unlike most games, your character doesn’t charge forward at a constant speed, floating over obstacles and effortlessly crossing waterways. Instead, every step feels earned. It adds a human element to the experience that many games lack.

To aid him in his travails, Sam has access to a variety of tools like ladders, climbing ropes, cargo sleds, several vehicles, and a number of lethal and non-lethal weapons. In addition, he can create more permanent structures like bridges, safe houses, and zip lines. Death Stranding features a form of asynchronous multiplayer. Structures and signs you create in your game can appear in other players’ games, and vice versa, creating a sense of community with others. However, so as not to spoil the experience, Sam must find his own way initially without the convenience of preplaced ladders and bridges. It’s only after you guide Sam to  his destination and connect the area to the “Chiral Network” that you can see and use structures left by others.

""Likes"", the ubiquitous thumbs up icon that is a kind of unofficial mascot of social media, is essentially your currency in Death Stranding, although it's hard to tell if Kojima intended it to be sincere or a parody. Sam isn't ever actually paid for a job well done. Instead, the customer rewards him with “likes” which function more or less as experience points for your character, but it's funny to think of Sam trudging for miles across dangerous territory, risking life and limb to make deliveries, all for the pleasure of someone giving him a thumbs up. But when you think about it, is it really so different from people who post videos of themselves performing death defying stunts to the internet, hoping that someone they have never met will click that little icon? 

Indeed, one of the major themes of Death Stranding is forming connections, not just within the game itself, but outside of it, too, as you exchange likes with other players whenever you use one of their constructs, or to show your appreciation for a sign that warns of dangers ahead. The term “strand” is multi-faceted.  It can mean to leave something isolated, but a strand is also something that is used to join things together. It's interesting that the communication device used by the characters in the game to maintain contact with each other resembles a pair of handcuffs. Sam understandably mistakes them for a sign that he's a prisoner but is quickly reassured that it’s for his own protection. Is Kojima suggesting that something like our smartphones that serve as strands to connect us, can also bind us like prisoners?

The world building of Death Stranding is exceptional. The main narrative is about rebuilding America by reconnecting the scattered remnants of humanity, but as you would expect from Kojima, it’s not quite as simple as that. I don’t typically care for video game stories as they are often shallow and silly, but Death Stranding is an exception. Kojima takes the time to explain the fantastic elements in a way that makes them seem plausible within the context of the world he has created. Even something as simple as the bandits you occasionally encounter are not treated as villains but as broken men to be pitied, former porters like Sam who grew so distraught over the thought of being displaced by automation that they created their own culture where they steal cargo just to carry it for its own sake. Then there are the ethereal BT’s, spectral after images of those who have died and desperately want to reconnect with the living. They are drawn to the recently deceased, and if they interact with a live person, it causes a “void out”, an explosion so powerful it leaves behind a massive crater. Strangest of all, perhaps, are the Bridge Babies, which are live babies carried in bottles who can sense the presence of BTs. As horrifying as it sounds, Kojima somehow managed to make the BB rather adorable. And really, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. It’s a narratively dense game, full of compellingly strange and esoteric ideas. Of course it wouldn’t be a Hideo Kojima game without fully realized characters and topnotch motion captured cutscenes featuring the likenesses of actors such as Norman Reedus (as Sam), Lindsay Wagner, Mads Mikkelsen, Guillermo Del Toro, and many others.

Graphically, this is arguably one of the most beautifully detailed post apocalyptic worlds ever presented in a video game with a wonderful variety of landscapes and a tremendous sense of scale (climbing a mountain in Death Stranding [i]really[/i] feels like climbing a mountain!). The starting area gives you a lot of ground to cover, but it's the second act where the game dramatically opens up. I have also found performance to be excellent in Linux running with Steam’s Proton.

I do have some criticisms such as the enemy AI being one step above brain dead and the wonky vehicle physics, but these are mere annoyances at worst considering everything else Death Stranding gets right.

It’s rare for an established game designer to try something so different. It’s even rarer when he spectacularly succeeds.",1648923977,1672533114,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,False

Kojima had a message for the players, and literally every single aspect of the game's design reinforces that message in some way. This really is something special.

Just calling it a ""walking simulator"" is an inadequate description and very reductive for what the game actually is. It's something that you just have to experience firsthand to really understand why.

You might bounce off this game for a few reasons, the gameplay just might not click with you or the story might just be a bit too wacky for you to take seriously, but even if you're hesitant if ANYTHING you've seen about the game has piqued your interest I recommend giving it a shot at least. It's on gamepass right now at the time of this review so you can experience it all for very little money if you want.

While I've played DS ""normal cut"" I've found that the new things added does make the experience a little nicer and a little more cohesive as a whole. The new areas are not that exciting but the new weapon and legs are super cool to use. Nothing wrong with a another side story as well. While the ""normal"" PC version was spectacular to play in the graphics and sound department the DC adds some worthy upgrades and even more music to the mix. 

Listen, at this point you either hated DS or loved it. I'm in the latter category. This game is like nothing else out there and offers an experience that is just leaps and bounds above anything else available. A LOT of people say it's a Fedex sim. Others say it is boring. I couldn't debate more. Sure, it's kind of like a Fedex sim but at the same time it isn't. There's a whole slew of enemies, objectives and stories that all come together in your travels to tie the nation back together. Getting to and accomplishing your objectives can be a hugely daunting task even with the tools you are given. I highly recommend NOT using a walk-through on your first playthrough as it will kill the experience for you totally. 

All in all, a different and fantastic game that isn't for everyone. It's a Fedex sim, a fps, and a whallop of a story for those that can and do piece it all together. I'm VERY much looking forward to DS2 and can't wait to see how Kojima further advances this story. I do hope he's listened to the masses and got rid of so much menu hopping but other than that, adding anything else to this already fantastic game isn't anything but a plus in my book.

This goddamn game.
It's remarkable. The graphics, the physics (mostly), the story (although 99% of it goes over my head), and most of all, the fact that other players can assist you on your travels. Oh, and pretty much all of its contents. But what's the point of me stating what this game has? How about we go through it?
The graphics. It's realistic, and although that isn't really sought after by everyone anymore, it still blows me away and I enjoy looking around me at the landscape while I'm running through it.
The physics. It's pretty much what you'd expect in real life (with a few exceptions, as in Sam grabbing hold of a rock, when actually his hands aren't even on it, they're just kind of floating in midair), like climbing mountains, steep hills, running down a steep hill, trying to regain your footing so you don't essentially roll down it, and climbing over rocks, it's amazing.
The story. Although it's pretty much spoon-fed to the player (which doesn't help with retaining information, at least for me), it's still quite fleshed out, despite how confusing it is.
And finally, the multiplayer aspect. The fact that other people can help you. I often find myself smiling when I load up the game the next day and seeing that some people have given my structures likes - it tells me firsthand (or... secondhand?) that people have used my structures and found lots of, some, or any use out of it.
However. There is one major downside, which does explain why there's a massive split in the overall reception of the game - positive or negative. I don't really see any in-between.
And that's because there's pretty much nothing to do when you're running around from destination to destination. The only thing that this game does to flesh out gameplay is just to press a button from time to time to balance yourself or shift your weight to the left or the right. And while it did keep me distracted at first, it did get quite tedious, quite quickly, which is why I always look for a generator to recharge my bike or my skeleton. I haven't finished this game yet - I've gotten up to Episode 12 - but it has been a wild ride up to this point.

I am in love with this game, the open world concept where you can familiarise yourself with the safest routes, know when it is going to rain and know where you can find shelter. I'm quite proud that I have only died twice in my initial 11 hours playtime however, as an Assassins Creed fan (and completionist) I kind of knew this game was for me. Although Steam didn't recommend because I normally find comfort in Stawdew!

If you are unsure if you should try this game, I would just urge you to give it a go, it eases you into the game play, nothing hard came up in at least the first 8 hours which is plenty of time to familiarise yourself with the fighting style, the characters and the landscape. 

Overall, I can see myself trying to complete all missions, side missions and tidy the world of all of those lost packages for many more hours to come. Wonderful game that pulls you in and is hard to put down.",1672353576,1672391693,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

游戏中有数不胜数的优秀的点子和创意：堪称预言般的故事设定，新奇的游戏玩法，不落俗套的角色设计等等。这一切给我一种感觉，小岛秀夫想让人们承认，他真的很酷。但对细节的偏执带来的是叙事上的失衡。设定繁多但缺少逻辑，于是变成了世界观的描述的堆砌。找到艾米莉后，故事的节奏便彻底崩坏了。剧情被一股脑地灌给玩家，复杂却难称得上深奥，而且漏洞百出。再加上反派的塑造太过单薄，以及缺少对故事主旨的讨论，让游戏中的一切显得更像在耍小聪明，而缺少了更为重要的，宏大和深刻的叙事能力。另一方面小岛秀夫在游戏中无时不刻不在向观众展示的他的的幽默和品味，让游戏成为了一锅他个人风格的大杂烩。但人格特色若不能锦上添花，便是喧宾夺主，甚至变成不伦不类的恶趣味了。于是我突然明白一个“杨笠式”的道理：一个男人觉得自己最富有魅力的时候，在他人看来，也许就是最油腻的时候。所以归根到底，没有把故事讲好，便早已犯下了原罪。

我不会说我比小岛秀夫更懂死亡搁浅，但死亡搁浅本可以像异域镇魂曲一样探讨生命与死亡，可以像EVA一样探讨社会的群体性孤独，而这些议题都只在游戏中浅尝辄止。也许游戏仅属于制作者，玩家只能欣赏，而没有僭越的权利。它就像你小时候最想要的玩具，却属于其他人。你可以一起玩，却要以别人的方式来玩。死亡搁浅就是这个属于小岛秀夫的私人玩具。只能说成也小岛秀夫，败也小岛秀夫。也许他知道不能满足所有人的口味，所以在离开科乐美后便选择不再迎合任何人了。",1671990062,1672207552,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay is gonna either be take it or leave it for most players. You'll either enjoy it or you'll need something more. I think if this is the kind of game you'd enjoy you're probably already aware of it.",1672204814,1672204814,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False
1850570,129489140,76561198360941484,0,5,4440,0,2910,1683436160,"Note: This review is for those who haven't played the game(although that should be pretty obvious as all reviews typically are). Death Stranding is not an action-packed shooter as most the game is a walking simulator with carrying things from point A to point B. But what carries this game to be a masterpiece in my view and probably many others is its story-line that was carefully crafted and executed magnificently. The only issue with the story is its mainly at the very beginning of the game and the very end but that allows plenty of time to familiarize yourself with each of the characters and learn of their identity and have a sense of purpose to finish through with the game. Also the visuals are gorgeous like in the range of Detroit: Become Human and because of its many realistic graphics and longer cut scene's it took 5ish hours to download(I have a decent computer setup too).

With that in mind, Death Stranding can be split into 3 distinctive parts - the past, present, and future.

The Past: Unravel the mysteries of who the people are around you to make friends as well as enemies and become more aware of your own past. Through the aid of others you'll also find out who the woman in red is, why you're carrying a baby the whole game, what the man donning a golden skull mask is doing, and much more. Death Stranding does an excellent job showing the past of the characters to be able to have them coincide together in a revised edition of a singular event.

The Present: Return America to its former unified state through the chiral network and link all the knots that were stranded back to link them all together. This obviously requires a lot of long distance walking as well as fulfilling orders for various equipment or otherwise that people might need as you play as a porter. But on these trips you'll find yourself trapped in BT areas, rough terrain, or in MULE territory all of which makes the journey tougher but provides for a more rewarding experience when you uncover more of the plot. 

The Future: As you connect the United States back together the future of civilization lies within you, as Hideo Kojima puts it: ""Tomorrow is in your hands."" This furthers the importance of your aid in the whole ordeal. So, can you piece together America again? Or will the future of civilization be in the hands of those who want it to end?",1672203391,1672203391,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

It's one of my favorite games of all time for those reasons -- on top of that, I first played the game during the COVID lockdown in 2020, and it was just the perfect time for such a game to be played, a game about bringing people (and the world) together, even when you couldn't directly see each other face-to-face; a game about connections, about helping each other out, during trying times, and about doing our best.

11/10 wonderful game that brought me to tears more than once. It starts slow, but once it picks up, you'll be hooked, with question after question -- and the answers are worth your time.

Because I always thought that this game was not meant for someone like me. This game will only works to Kojima die hard fans that willing to lie to themselves, saying that they really like the game but in reality they hate it. They said that just because they love Hideo Kojima.

That was the greatest mistake I made in my gaming live. This game is the game that can make people love it even when the gameplay should be boring and repetitive. You go there get here to deliver. That's the main mission of the entire game. That's it! but somehow I love this game even more when I gone further deeper trough the map of future America. 

Every package was meaningful, every leftover package left by the other players I want to take it and deliver it. My first encounter with BTs is so intense, make me want to try it again and again. And this game give more option to face them further in the story. Of course MULEs was not really threatening at least so far, I don't know in the next episode maybe will be harder to face them. I also like how game make me face consequence in every mistake that I made and giving rewards in every good thing that I did.

I can't tell much about the story. I currently stuck in episode 2, because I really want to spend more and more time in this game. I want to deliver as many as the game can provide me. I want to make every connection become 5 stars. I want to expand my bandwith to cover the entire map. 

Death Stranding is one game that rarely produce. Maybe there will be no game like this at least in 50 years in the future. I mean, every developers sure can make game like Death Stranding. But I doubt they can make players fell like what I feel when playing it, if it's not Hideo Kojima the person who responsible behind the wheel.

oh boy was i wrong and so wrong, my interests peaked when i saw the reveal trailer of ds2 at TGA and i was like lets try this
i finished the main story and i dont wanna bore you all with obvious stuff
but i felt emotions like this after a very long time, surely so i went in blind and the feeling i got was akin to finishing rdr2 for the first time
there are so many things that work so well in this game that anyone just by hearing them would say i am crazy,but from the little most things like soothing your bb to having a bath, everything is meaningful.
sometimes in chapter 3 i did get worn out but then suddenly things instantly got interesting again, time flew by and once i opened this game i never felt bored or uninterested, infact most of the times i had to close the game was due to it being like 5 in the morning and i had to sleep.
an instant recommendation now that it is free on epic for a few hours more. must try and must finish. we really dont get such masterpieces often. hella excited for ds2 now

Death Stranding can be a highly rewarding and addictive experience, but it's definitely not for everyone. There's something everyone can enjoy (hiking sim? Obviously! Stealth infiltration? Gotcha! Just straight up beating and shooting people and monsters? You bet! The ability to hoard huge amounts of materials for no other reason than ""it's satisfying""? It's in there! Virtual photography? Yes indeed!), but the gameplay loop is built, specifically, to be what I would describe as ""harrowing"". Nothing goes unearned. You're going to be stressed, irritated, and sometimes straight-up pissed off, but are rewarded in kind. Breathing a big sigh of relief as you crest a final hill or get past a BT area become their own rewards. It's... something special.

Being a Hideo Kojima game, the story is certainly strange and nebulous, with bits of his trademark corny humor sprinkled in. But it's definitely largely a ""mood piece"" rather than a typical narrative, a slow, contemplative experience where you will easily find yourself swearing at rocks, falling into a ravine (you WILL fall into a ravine), and punching tons of people in the face because you want their stuff.

If you're looking for a strange new experience, go ahead and give it a shot! Not sure but still a little curious? Wait 'til it's on sale! (You won't have to wait long, it's on sale A LOT.)

Is it a great one, though? That depends on your tolerance of Hideo Kojima. His pretentious, on-the-nose style is woven into every fibre of this game. Woven, get it? With a strand! There's no subtelty to be found here. The game's themes will be forced down your throat, repeatedly. All the questions and contemplations are great, however. And I wish the game wasn't silly all of the time, so I could take it seriously more often.

More fun then I expected it to be and I'd say the game has some thick padding if not for the rewards you get for maxing a facility's connection level where some facilities just offer additional color options and holograms as more a consolation reward for going out of your way for this obscure facility which helps keep you motivated.

  There's a pretty long and rewarding progression system that at the start of the game you only have your clothes and the backpack on your back to aid you, but by the end of the game you'll be using vehicles, roads, exoskeletons, and lethal/nonlethal firearms with interchangeable ammo that simplifies your loadout letting you handle humans, BTs, and stronger BTs whenever wherever. Stealth vs mules/human is kinda situational and more of a taking them down from a distance without the rest seeing the body whereas stealth vs BTs is great and 100% fullproof as long you're patient and realize that you only see the BTs when your scanner starts flickering faster in a direction and you come to a standstill and look around which is when you'll be able to see them. You only need to hold your breath when you start getting within a meter of a BT which is when your scanner turns orange and starts spinning rapidly while your BB starts crying like a baby.

  What keeps you doing the next delivery and the delivery after are the rewards in the form of new tech or the next lvl version which improves on it making your subsequent deliveries a breeze or more satisfying as there's nothing like loading up cargo on your back and two floating carriers or in the back of your truck and delivering it. With each facility you max connection with you'll get a star that goes on your suit with about three total rows of stars to adorn yourself with.

  The only thing I had an issue with is how Kojima kept most of the the cut-scenes and explanations till the very end of the game for example there's at least 15 episodes, but the 9-15 episodes are the final stretch where you sorta locked in and have to complete the rest of the game and sit through cut-scene after cut-scene and about 30min long credit scene while they pepper in short cut-scenes while you run around trying to stave off boredom waiting for the next one. From episode 1-9 your mostly out and about completing orders unlocking new items with occasional short cut-scenes progressing the story. Your reward for sitting through all those cut-scenes at the final stretch is that you finally get to find out the truth of the Death Stranding and who Cliff is.

I really dislike the gameplay. I thought the story will carry me through but it didn't. Its weird, its puzzling and after 39 hours, none of the mystery resolved. Yes you get some answer but you get even more question in every discovery. I still don't understand the character motivation up to this point. I thought i know him well but his action in some of the story point is weird af.

The gameplay is weird. 99% of the game require you to walk from point A to point B. You not suppose engage on BT or kill human. Then you have this check point where you need to kill enemy, kill BT boss and fight with bare hand at one of the main story. The whole thing is inconsistent. The battle using barehand with no gear is the deal breaker here. Almost a completely different game and it's stupid. Enemy have gun and I throw boxes and punch with my hand. What happen to my armor plate that block bullet, or blood pack? I can't bring any of those. Such a stupid battle design.

They try to make it cinematic like the fight between Snake and Ocelot in MGS 4 but I don't feel any weight behind the fight with that human dude. I barely know him until this point of the game

I was completely gripped by the story, and just found it so interesting how they slowly flowered the story, and kept adding little hints, and mixing in more and more crazy cool concepts and ideas that made it so great to dig at, delivery by delivery 

The best moment I had, Was pulling a hover cart across a snow mountain and a blizzard just blowing around you, pushing through past all the BT's and then finally pushing past it all, to see the the vast green hills beyond, and i had a perfectly timed music drop, that I've had on repeat for the last few days. it finally all just hit me at once, how damn peaceful this game could be after doing something crazy hard.

Even after all this time, seeing some of my friends on steam's buildings they placed down recently and using their markers felt so cool.

I've seen some of the reviews for this game, talk about how bad the driving in this game is.
If you're only driving in this game, you've completely missed the point of it.
Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.
Use your damn legs, you got all these upgrades for a reason, you have all these cool building tools, and items like Zip lines, Catapults, Ladders, Climbing ropes, Buddy Bots AND so much more. and you're just going to skip out on all of that by using a truck?
The trucks and bikes are meant for quick straights, but trying to drive it up a mountain and getting upset your truck is handling badly in the snow is honestly just such a joke it's insane.

I'm 100% picking up the 2nd game when it comes out, and feel like such a fool i didn't pick this up on first release, seeing everyone discover and build new and cool things, before routes we're mapped out perfectly for zip lines and catapults.

Ok. So, everybody was afraid about the 'walking simulator' part of DS. It's great: route planning, choosing equipment, the whole walking mechanic - I really wished for bigger maps with more complicated terrain, and for more... you know... walking...
So as proof of concept of 'walking game' - yes.

BUT:

1. The Kojima guys projected one of the most boring and unresponsive driving physics systems. It’s like driving in GTA III, but GTA III was released in 2001. From some point using vehiclesis is a must. It is faster + you can't just grab 2000kg cargo on your back, so unless you want to make multiple trips back and forth, a truck is the must. 

2. Plot is just a big mess. With a great start and I really enjoyed the concept on paper... but it's bundled with the most cringey dialogues ever. I heard ""I’m Fragile but not that fragile '' just too many times...

3...And then It's becoming an Evangelion pastiche. I think that it's trying to be like Evangelion, but without understanding why Eva was fun (Maybe well written characters?!). So it is just surreal and overcomplicated. In the end The Message is like ""killing bad"".

4. Boss Fights - This game has the worst boss fights I have ever seen. Lategame fights are not hard. They are LONG. Those guys can take like 16 rockets so take your time. They are slow, undangerous but with a billion HP, so not too much fun.

5. The straw that broke the camel's back for me was the moment when at some point the game gives you THE CHOICE. And gives you CONTROL OVER hero. And THE GUN. But there is no choice: Character I tried to kill... had no collision for bullets. You have to be a Good Guy Who Never Chooses Violence. And you know, power of love/friendship etc. And in the dialogue a second later I heard: ""I would never hurt you"". Really?! I just emptied a pistol magazine into your face!
Like, I know how storytelling works. And if it would be in cutscene - I'm fine. I get it - it's the character's choice. But if you're giving me control and you’re saying that it's such a crucial decision... THEN LET ME MAKE THE DECISION.
[spoiler] I mean killing Amelie, could save the world for the cost of my and her lives. Fair price. After emptying the clip I tried to kill her in melee combat, but hitting her triggered an emotional hugging cutscene. BIG LOL [/spoiler]


Verdict:

You want a good post-apo transport centered game, with nice views and ruined infrastructure? Buy Snowrunner.
Want a weird japanese game with strange ideas and a twisted plot (and where the plot is well executed)? Play Nier.
Want a psychedelic story, which is full of metaphors? Watch Evangelion.

Imagine why other simulator type games are fun - and Kojima put that into a genuine third person, shooter, adventure climber, existential, open world environment.

Then there's the like system.  Getting likes while single-handedly rebuilding America, knot by knot.  I got addicted to rebuilding infrastructure - and then the quasi-""multiplayer"" system really makes the game much more fun.

Hideo Kojima was someone who is pretty famous (and infamous), mostly for Metal Gear and some other Konami, and being one of the people who can easily recall the Metal Gear timeline in one go, and since DS2 got announced, I thought i give my thoughts on Death Stranding, which I happen to love a lot, I'll split this into sections: you've got Gameplay, Music, Story and closing thoughts, with that settled let's start with music, as that's a vital part of Death Stranding

Music: I love it, mostly because it's experimental in a way, I like how it can go from the horror movie style soundtrack from Ludvig Forrsell to the smoothest and relaxing sounds from Low Roar, as a Writer that is doing stuff for VRC Roleplays, i've found music like Low Roar to be more of where I get some of my ideas to pop out, overall 10/10

Gameplay: I'll be honest, I like the gameplay but even I know there's a bit of a problem with the driving, lemme explain, Imagine this: you've riding a motorcycle to say, Die Hardman's office in Central Knot City, you've managed to avoid BTs and MULEs trying to kill you or take your packages, you're getting closer and then a small pebble from nowhere stops your motorcycle right on it's tracks, Tl;dr: loved the walking gameplay, shooting could be better, Vehicles could be done a lot more better. 7/10

Story: Loved it as well, remember when I gave Music a 10/10? the story is also why, certain scenes along with the music fits so well, as for the dialogue, I liked it, along with the characters, Fragile and Higgs being both my favorite characters, now normally, I could try making a non-spoiler synopsis for this game to get you interested, but I've seen that it's a little tough in a sense, so if I were you, give this a try, it may not be for everyone, but it could be for you 10/10

Closing Thoughts: I've become a fan of Hideo mostly because of MGSV, I know, sounds interesting, initially, i thought it was just a cool story, but when I checked the whole thing for Metal Gear, I got Invested, so truth be told, I also became interested in Death Stranding because of it, now I'm here writing this review to say, give this a try, if you don't like it, that's fine, at least you gave it a try and gave a opinion.",1671729483,1671729483,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This game is truly fantastic, I don't know what did kojima smoke to imagine all this stuff to end up with a product with such cohesion and such a beautiful message, but hey I want that too XD

[b] Walking as the center of the game [/b]

In all seriousness this game is mechanically amazing, yes is a walking simulator, but it literally is a walking simulator like no other, usually that term is used pejoratively against a game which revolves across exploring, but in case of this one, the entire game is about walking, the way you interact with the terrain is something no other game has done before, the way Sam interacts with rocks, how balance and weight matters is something that grounds the experience a lot, is insane how they made the game tedious and fun at the same time, and that is made through the amazing cohesion of gameplay and narrative.

[b] It's story: a slow burn that hooks you slowly [/b]

[i] The world and humanity is near extinction and you (Sam Porter) need to save the world by delivering packages to help others. [/i] Yeah, is a simple premise but the execution is amazing, yeah the cinematics are long, yeah the game has [b] horrible menus specially [/b], but once you enter on that loop on delivering, on thinking how is the most effective way to reach your destination, creating structures and receiving likes by the people you've helped after finishing a mission, is what makes the game an extremely rewarding experience. 

The game is essentially a world divided by a catastrophe and the point of the game is connecting with others via the  chiral network, but the amazing thing is that it happens in the ""real world"" too, the players that also are playing or that played death stranding will leave structures and tools on the map as if all of us were in the same journey together, everyone that puts a bridge, a ladder, a rope, or a bike on the map will appear on other players's worlds, creating this beautiful scenery were it shows that we as humans leave a mark on this world in one way or another, and even if those marks disappear at the end we made that journey easier for someone else after us, and honestly is such an amazing feeling to put a great generator or a great bridge on a river and receiving likes from other people knowing they needed it too, and at some point you will put stuff just for the sake of helping others, is a genius piece of art. 

The story is full of  double meanings, of ways to show you that we are not alone, that life is easier if we try to get through it together, and that's done completely via gameplay, is simply beautiful. This is an absolute modern classic.

I hold Death Stranding DC very dear to my heart.
I may have """"only"""" played it for a little over 100 hours (the base game for around 70 to add to that), but i would still count it towards being one of my favourite games of all time.
The gameplay is so engaging that you can't ever look away from the screen for even a couple seconds unless you're standing perfectly still. And standing still costs you precious time. Finish that delivery and go to bed instead.
There is always something going on and if there is a more calm moment happening the game will remind you of how gorgeous it looks and how well it feels to play.

Death Stranding feels like you know whether you like it or not within the first couple hours of the game. After about 3 hours of cutscenes and worldbuilding you are basically set free to do what you like. That is delivering packages sometimes as seemingly unimportant as someone's old newspaper collection. But even though it should feel like those things are trivial and unimportant the game makes everything have a purpose. So you chug along. All by yourself. It gets lonely out there and no other game i've played makes you feel truly alone like Death Stranding does. You start taking in the nature more, you appreciate the detailed and well-crafted terrain and you start remembering the optimal routes if not for the paths you leave behind.

The controls will feel weird at first but you'll get used to them very quickly. The gameplay and how you approach deliveries changes dramatically with progress made and the tools you unlock along the way. The combat can be clunky and hectic but that's all on purpose. You aren't military, you are a guy who didn't even want to do this job in the first place. But it's you or no one. The game can be silly at times but it'll always be at the right moment. Sometimes it gets awkward but that makes it feel real if the actors being real wasn't enough for you. The score is gorgeous as well even if it's not my kind of music at all, it just fits. 

Never have i been more immersed into a game world and i don't think anything will ever top this. In my eyes it's an absolute masterpiece and everyone should at least try the first 5 hours. No other triple AAA game of the last 5+ years gets even close to this amount of polish and love put into a game.

Oh, and bring a controller. Please.

It should go without saying, but [u]this review will contain spoilers[/u]. However, all said spoilers will only be what is revealed within the first two hours of the game. It's impossible to speak about the premise and mechanics of a game without letting a little slip out. You've been warned, if you want to go in blind, read no further.

——————————

[h3]“I'm Fragile, but I'm not that fragile”[/h3]
So what the heck is Death Stranding anyways? Is it [i]really[/i] a walking simulator? To me, Walking Simulators are games wherein the only interaction you have with the world is just that, walking. In Death Stranding, it's anything but.

Primarily, you'll be taking orders from facilities, choosing a route, managing stress, stamina and conditions of gear as you traverse the environment. But let's not to get too far ahead of ourselves; the game throws a lot of terms and phrases at you right out of the proverbial gate. Terms like Chiralium, Timefall, Voidout, Cryptobiote, DOOMS, Bridge Babies, BT's (Beached Things), “Beach” as a location otherwise not presumed by its name, Repatriate, even the phrase Death Stranding itself.

All of these things matter — so here's the gist of the premise:

You'll play as Sam “Porter” Bridges, you deliver packages to and from distribution centers and shelters around what used to be America, now called the UCA or United Cities of America. While trucks and motorcycles are in the game, they are not always a feasible means of travel due to the Death Stranding, a nearly apocalyptic event that brought the dead back to life. Well, sort of — it brought Beached Things into the real world and the surface is effectively uninhabitable because of them. Did I mention the rain also ages you and anything it touches? That's the Timefall, any precipitation actually. 

More to the point, Sam is a Repatriate and he can die, go to a beach, and come back to life. Trust me, that makes sense in the lore. Without telling the reason, a reluctant Sam Bridges is convinced to re-connect the UCA and expand the Chiral Network, that's the Chiralium, a metallic substance left behind by Beach Things in the real world. Used to essentially explain all the high-tech, nearly magical things in the game. And that's as much as you need to understand going in.

Between the environment itself, the beached things and gear management, there's also people out in the wild that live off of stealing cargo from porters, some orders will have you entering their camps to steal it back.

[h3]”Everything is true, except for the lies.”[/h3]
The game features a number of aspects from other games, it's always online, the gear you leave behind gets shared with other porters, lost cargo can be picked up, delivered or entrusted to another porter. You can even leave signs on the ground like Dark Souls. That said, due to the timefall, structures also degrade over from exposure.

You're also able to share resources to build larger structures, watchtowers, timefall shelters, generators and bridges.

Fun Fact: Death Stranding uses an evolved version of the same engine that Horizon: Zero Dawn uses — it is not the FOX engine from MGSV.

Death Stranding is, as expected, a highly narrative title. But it's MUCH, [i]much[/i] more than a simple walking sim. A term likely adopted as a endearing term, once used as a pejorative. 

I would actually liken this game to Spintires or Mudrunner/Snowrunner but with a story. A [i]very[/i] big, epic story.

It is part time a intriguing detective/mystery story about what caused the apocalyptic event known as Death Stranding with some stealth and infiltration action every know and then. The BT enemies are creepy and almost gives you a Lovecraftian vibe, while the mules and terrorists is more like the standard bad guys. The other part is essentially a hiking simulator where you mostly trek through rough terrain (reminded me a bit of Iceland) to deliver things. The driving is also pretty fun and should not be underestimated for casual fun. 

It is a slow paced game but very atmospheric and especially the music is splendid. Some songs really hit like a hammer to the emotional core when you unlock them as you descent to a new location or do some other special thing. The actors are good and delivers really good performances, especially Fragile and Heartman in their backstories, but the best performance is probably Clifford Unger and Die-Hardman. The entire mystery and backstory of the BB is very fascinating and captivating and kept me playing on just to know how it all came together. The final mission where you unlock BBs theme is probably the hardest cargo to carry in the entire game, but such a crowning achievement for the long journey of Sam and BB.

For some, the price of the upgrade is too much for the amount of extra content they are getting on top of the base game, and I do feel their sentiments.

But the only issue that I had with this is why it was decided to be released as a separate game rather than just an update/DLC for the base game.

Regardless of the complaints or issues, Death Stranding: Director's Cut brings me back to memories when the pandemic started, and couriers were the unsung heroes of our soceity. This is definitely a game that is truly dedicated to their hard work and dedication to their jobs.

The answer is NO. It will never be an enjoyable experience (Unless you find a zipline and skip the entire game).

I was being optimistic at the start. I was telling myself I could handle all that crap if the story would be worth it, and I was preparing myself for a good review. But believe me when I say this, death stranding will crush your soul and test the limits of your patience.

The gameplay of death stranding -as you may probably have heard- is complete bullshit. So I really don't want to delve into that. Although I ought to mention there is a satisfying and addictive feeling of building roads and bridges for your fellow gamers to help them escape this game as quickly as possible.

The story, on the other hand, is Kojima on drugs. The game punishes you for playing the game with an insane amount of exposition dumps, explaining things you heard million times and yet somehow managing to be completely meaningless. The story-telling formula of this game is, explaining every single teeny tiny detail through millions of cutscenes and expecting the player to understand them all. I still have a headache just talking about this. I finally understood why people called this game a movie, as it had at least 10 hours of cutscenes.

Talking about movies... I feel like the actors/actresses should've won multiple academy awards for coming up with incredible performances. Considering that their dialogue is one of the worst scripts I've ever witnessed, they deliver a shockingly perfect performance. I can already imagine your confusion from reading this. However, when you see actors/actresses deliver horribly written comedic joke lines as if they are the most emotional things they say, you will eventually understand what I'm saying.

In the end, astonishing actor/actress performances are all that death stranding has. Their great attempt is the only thing that holds the story together, and I assume that's the sole reason why some people actually enjoyed the story. Other than that, the whole experience is just tedious. 

I love Kojima and his creative vision, but I hope he learns his lesson from this game and makes a less infuriating death stranding 2.",1671525004,1671525004,False,3,1,0.455612391233444214,0,True,False,False

On the gameplay side, I couldn't help but compare DS with Ancestors: Humankind.  In the latter game, you control a lineage of apes and try to evolve them into mankind.  That involves lots of terrain challenges, and using your senses to find the things that help your tribe exist for another million years.  Ancestors is very involved in learning how to control your ape, and how to balance your risks, rewards, and understanding the environment you explore.  To put it shortly, Ancestors is simply better at challenging your judgement.

Where story is concerned, it is pretentious in a way that is boring and hamfisted.  Again, my mind wanders off to a game that handles vague delivery far better - Lobotomy Corporation.   The narrative is focused upon suffering and redemption, managing to harmonize the narration and gameplay together to help impress an atmosphere upon the player.  Your failures are brutal, with employees dying in numerous ways, all the while you curse your inability or misfortune.   The music ramps up in despair as you lose control, and the cries of man and beast alike will echo - until there is no more man.  That silence is pain, as it marks yet another defeat.

Death Stranding, on the other paw...well, it just doesn't feel interesting.  I cannot emotionally nor intellectually connect to the situation, as it feels incredibly artificial and forced.  Kojima wants me to feel things, but there just isn't anything to bridge the gap.   I normally enjoy slower-paced games and the idea of building a community - but it feels so very hollow in this game.

Combat and stealth both feel very...blunt?  Unlike the excellent Thief or Styx games, the stealth doesn't challenge my eyes nor ears.  Beached Things are essentially landmines that you may or may not be able to see, each one having differing levels of visibility, durability, and reaction.   The way the camera and bottled baby work can sometimes make it hard to pinpoint the BTs, so they can suddenly pop up.  Worse, emptying a clip into one might not work.  STALKER did a better job with their paranormal hazards, as you can't defeat them - and more importantly, things were more based on your experience rather than luck.    

When it comes to combat, I often find that grenades can trivialize human foes.  Blood grenades blind them, shock simply knocks them flat.  The danger of the enemy comes most from the camera being too close, preventing me from seeing them approach from my side or rear.  Provided I can see them, victory is pretty likely.

It is unfortunate, but Death Stranding's greatest merit is that it will allow you to kill time by going through the motions.  While I hope the sequel can improve things, my recommendation is to spend your time and money on something better.",1671416979,1671416979,False,1,0,0.405945688486099243,0,True,False,False

From the captivating story to the stunning visuals, this game is a one-of-a-kind experience. The atmosphere is incredibly immersive, with a haunting soundtrack and stunningly detailed environments. The cast of characters is incredibly strong and engaging, and the many complex themes explored make for an unforgettable journey. 

The gameplay is also incredibly well done, with a unique sense of freedom and exploration that allows you to play in your own way. The various missions and tasks you complete along the way give you a great sense of progression and accomplishment. It's easy to get lost in this game and its vast world. 

Overall, DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT is a phenomenal game and one of the best titles I've ever played. I can't recommend it enough. After finishing it, I was left with a profound sense of sadness and emptiness. Despite being incredibly satisfied with my experience, I found myself struggling with post-game depression.

* Narrative exposition using game engine.
Cons:

* Stupid delays in everything (like BB taking 15 seconds to slo-mo deploy EVERY. TIME.)
* Everything you build gets magically disintegrated toward the end of the game (hint: do not build roads). 

I played through it on the off chance the story would get really good and start making some sort of sense but nah. This is really downhill after all the MGS stuff. I don't know if it's because he lost all the folks helping him keep the content on track when he split to form his own company but if this is the way Kojima is going to do games, DS will probably be the last one I ever buy for more than $15.

The experience of controlling the character or the flow, to be part of the story or to be the story itself is what set video games apart from, you guess it, videos. Which is the exact point that Kojima seem to failed here to me - despite all the other great aspect.

so far this game and its mystery surrounding it have been engaging and the gameplay as well.

trying to find a good rout and always wondering what tool uca will provide next is really cool. i like that gameplay loop of progressing and receiving tools that expidite the journey as well as i having the added benifit of playing this game quite a bit after its release so i am experiencing lots of other players structures and secrets 

the story has been intriguing and is slowly coming together and depending on how this all wraps up ill have thoroughly enjoyed my stay in stranded america. 

my gripes with the game being the limited selection on how you take on enemies such as mules,

and bts being annoying more then scary but i get what their going for they want to make a hostile world and your not sam fisher or solid snake i get that but with such advanced technology in this world i expected more interesting ways to combat foes in the world.

that being said this game is a solid 8 the ironclad design and mechanics as well as the satisfaction of getting new tools and delivering tuff routs is suprisingly fun.

this game has this unessessary stereotype around it that its a walking sim and i disagree if youve played any modern horror you know there are far more layers to this and its far more engaging especially with the amount of ways you can tackle delivering packages 
i do hope that death stranding 2 takes this fresh concept and really addresses combat and adds more variety in structures as well as tools.

I played the Original for well over 200 hours on PS4, obtaining all Death Stranding achievements. Making it one of my all time favorite games. Now, with the release of the Director's Cut and the announcement of Death Stranding 2, I thought I'd give it another go, this time on PC.

Death Stranding will let you play as Sam Bridges, portrayed by actor Norman Reedus. Who you might know, from AMCs The Walking Dead. Sam is a delivery man who works for the Bridges Cooperation. A company formed after the collapse of the United States of America.
He is asked by the UCA, short for United Cities of America, to reconnect the fractured society America has become.

In this post-apocalyptic world, strange creatures known as ""BTs"", somehow appeared on earth and are now looking to devour anyone in their path. Along with other adversaries, they act as obstacles for Sam to overcome, in trying to deliver packages and complete his mission.

Death Stranding is a surreal, interesting, very deep game, one of the most developed games I have ever played. The story, the characters, the visuals, the voice acting, music and landscape are all 10 out of 10.",1670717510,1671125743,True,79,1,0.82635962963104248,2,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong. At heart, this is LITERALLY fetch quest: the game. 

I think there's this weird underlying ASMR kind of element to it too. I never considered myself the type (I don't really get into those yt videos), but I find myself vibing out to this game more than I thought would.

There's a lot of exposition and forced cutscenes in the first 10 hours, and it comes across as somewhat self indulgent. But after that, the game opens up, you're able to skip all the repeated content, cut scenes become fine again because story progression cools off (especially if you go for a completionist approach before checking off new story beats), and you're given more tools and freedom to approach the game as you see fit.

One aspect that definitely surprised me, even after seeing it mentioned in various reviews, is the sense of camaraderie and reward you get dropping traversal tools probably mainly for your own benefit, but you get to see if other players use them and that's pretty nice, as well as using traversal tools that others place that happened to be just where you needed them. 

Deep diving into that, it's because if you were to play the entire game grinding your own mats for your own tools, it would SUCK. It would be slow and plodding. I couldn't imagine playing this game entirely offline. Holy crap. You have no idea how many player-created generators, umbrellas, bridges, ramps, ladders, etc I've used so far. More than I'd like to admit, I lost my vehicle due to being impatient or straight up not careful and was happy to find another vehicle someone left out in the open as a backup option. If I had to build and place those all myself? AEUGH.  

So the game is clearly designed to leverage the contributions of entire servers of players to make fetch quest: the game a seamless experience. For me, it works.

In my case, I got addicted to the underlying online route-building aspects. If you find yourself getting into building and maintaining the super highway that you'll find a bit after getting into the second map zone, it takes a lot of mat grinding and ferrying, but you get to see how often other players end up using it (super often). Combined with the pit stops, generators, cargo-maintaining super umbrellas, and all the other knicks and knacks others leave along the way and among the many side destinations, it all just somehow comes together.

In terms of story, I don't have much to say, mostly because I barely understand what's happening on even a basic level. Um there's a yoshi's story mechanic where if you're too careless, mario cries his ass off. That's about all I've got. There's FFT where you need a phd to understand and articulate the various machinations and motivations of all the characters involved and how that influences the histories, written and untold, of Ivalice, and then there's Death Stranding, which is, being perhaps too generous here, comparably incomprehensible but for entirely different reasons.

I dunno, in the ~55hrs I've played so far, maybe I've sat through ~4-7hrs of cutscenes, so I can't imagine getting too mad about it. The last time I was over invested in a story was when I was 14 and thought Halo: Combat Evolved had some life-changing revelation waiting for me at the other end of the game. It's not worth it to get that invested. I'm here to just vibe and chill.

So overall, yeah, definitely a recommend from me. A hard recommend?.... nah. A very cautious recommend, but if for you it clicks, damn it clicks.",1671099607,1671100392,True,1,0,0.500745177268981934,0,True,False,False

guns feel lacking, and instead a gun range is added, which only adds to realize the shooting gallery feel of most combat
added a metal gear mission, that takes 45 minutes to finish which are fetch quests and luke warm meh of an ending

If the answer to that question is ""Yes"", Death Stranding is going to be a good fit for you.

Immersive, almost movie-like, cutscenes with a rich world and story being built up by a great supporting cast. Animations, voice acting, and VFX are solid through the entire experience. The gameplay on the other hand leaves something to be desired, unless you have a strong sense of accomplishment, love of exploration, and ""going it alone"" (kinda).

The game is single-player with an online aspect that is rather unique. Each player has their own world, and through online play people's structures, like bridges, generators, shelters and more can become populated into your world. By interacting with, liking, and repairing others structures you become more closely linked to that other player, making more of their structures and your own structures show up in each-others worlds. It's a relatively simple solution to a pretty large map.

Yes, let's get the awkward part out of the way too, the game's main focus is delivery of packages and thus creating and connecting each new way-point into a massive network. Your goal is essentially to bring America back to full communications, as the game's events will show you how they were devastated. The game's main danger are BTs, super natural entities that will seek you or any other living person out, and create a massive explosion, killing everyone and everything in their vicinity. --- Sometimes these encounters are thrilling and eventful, sometimes they can be a huge annoyance, but it really depends how you approach and tackle the problem. 

Overall, I think this was a wonderful product. I am glad I waited for the Director's Cut because they added a lot of Quality of Life things to the game, and in my opinion these things really help with the experience.

As a side note be aware that there are a lot of short cutscenes for just about every action, so if skipping repeated cutscenes over and over annoys you beyond belief, this game may be a little taxing on you.",1670193887,1671065485,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Engaging story and game play, with a middle act that stumbles before taking off again. There are missteps in the games writing at times and the driving is bugged beyond belief; for whatever reason though it manages to chug along as this sort of semi-relaxing, semi-intellectual work of art. If you like experimental projects with a AAA budget then Death Stranding is probably up your alley. If you want something more traditional then this is definitely not going to be the game for you. Death Stranding manages to be a 3rd person shooting, stealth, horror, action-adventure hybrid and it does a pretty good job of combining these genres together into something wholly unique. 

I wouldn't call this a walking simulator either. The planning and traversal is the game play. It's actually pretty involved and every time you get a understanding of how it works - Death Stranding throws another set of both tools and obstacles in your way to re-contextualize how you engage in that traversal. You're not just wandering aimlessly from point of interest to point of interest like in a traditional open world game trying to find the interesting content. The traversal is the interesting content. It really does make you look at other open world games differently and realize just how wrong they've been doing it this whole time when it comes to travel, traversal, etc.",1670968793,1670968793,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While it's basically two completely different elements that often struggle to play off of each other, I found the gameplay fun and the writing (despite being somewhat tropey and awkward at times) was written well enough to keep me interested.
It's also worth mentioning how good the soundtrack and acting in this game are, they're two elements that often go overlooked in game development but it's very clear that a lot of effort and thought went into both here.
If anything, Death Stranding at the very least deserves praise for trying to do something different in today's overly standardized AAA industry.

(Minor spoilers ahead)
I've tried to write a huge review on this game three times now, I've spent nearly two hours on this and I think I'll just write a short little thing here.
I mean, there's so much to discuss and talk about, the world Hideo created is so vast and massive in its lore, story, setting and everything gameplay-wise, this could be a 2-hour long video, but won't be.

The style and design - top notch. Not a single qualm with any of the equipment, buildings, structures, vehicles (except the shitty race car). Enjoyable to look at.
Equipment management and traversing the lands is great. I love route-planning and trying to pack up as less stuff with myself as possible, keeping in mind the weather, terrain and everything else that might cross my path.
If I forget something or run out of something, there's just a means of going the longer path, but there's always a way.
Love the setting - unique and harrowing. Instead of going for simple over-used enemy types, I'm learning the best ways to deal with those weird-ass BTs.
I don't know what happened, but when I got the BB at first, I was like 'Uhh, why is this weird baby thing attached to me...' and half-way through I'm like 'Aww, Lou loved that jump I performed with the Trike, sweet'.
The story itself didn't really take turns that I completely didn't foresee, but it was good and a generally alright wrap up at the end. It made me love some characters and really hate some others.
Cliff - easily my favorite character.

[i]'You can be my Mario and I'll be your Pricess ""Beach""'[/i] -  when I heard that, I swelled up inside of myself, physically and mentally. I hate to use the word, but that was [b]cringe[/b]. The scene that followed didn't help either, it was weird and off-putting.
Character names. Really? Guy with heart thing - Heartman. Guy who doesn't die easily - Die-Hardman. Guy who is a Porter and makes bridges (both literally and figuratively) - Sam PORTER BRIDGES. Come on.
These are placeholder names.
Sometimes I felt I was stuck in bad pun and dad joke land.
For some reason I just couldn't connect with Amelie. Maybe it was the acting or something, but even when she was saying all these sincere things, It still felt like she's gonna stab me in the back, never trusted her for a second, since the start.

Anyway.
Hideo presented me with a great, enjoyable game that made me feel a sense of accomplishment and also some emotion, weather is sad, dreadful or joyful at times.

Will come back to gain more stars on the thigh through he infinite two weeks before inauguration
If you're heavily into action and crazy stunts, don't even try.
If you embrace isolation, introspect and nice little walks through dangerous BT territories, then - RECOMMENDED.
Also Riot Shotgun to MULEs face five times - S tier feeling.

That being said, I do believe Death Stranding to be one of the greatest games I've ever played: I found the gameplay to be incredibly fun (which is weird considering it's a walking simulator), which combined with the beautiful environments makes for a really really good ""vibe"".

This may be a boomer take (even though I'm 20 lol), but I think the people who don't like the game are just way too impatient. Simply walking from one place to another is one of the most zen, relaxing things I've ever experienced.

Furthermore, the gameplay manages to stay really fresh throughout the whole game, it actually gets quite complex. New gameplay elements are constantly being introduced, even though the game is about 40 hours long, which means (for me anyway) that you never really get bored. The fighting system, while I do think isn't as fun as the walking, is actually very complex, sometimes maybe a little too much. It heavily ties into the cargo/inventory aspect of the game, which means you have to keep yourself from falling over while fighting off multiple enemies. It can get quite overwhelming, so if you struggle with multitasking you might have a bad time there.

One of the things I love most about the game (apart from the whole game itself) is the multiplayer and permanent upgrades you can apply to the world. I found the roads, though quite tedious to complete, to be especially rewarding. There's just something really satisfying about ""upgrading"" your world, in order to make it more easily traversable. While I do not recommend fully completing the roads, as it probably isn't needed, it's very fun to zoom from one end of the map to another in record time with a truck.

Speaking of which, the vehicles in this game are awesome. One might think having trucks and bikes in a game where walking on harsh terrain is the core gameplay would make the experience too easy, however using them (trucks especially) can prove to be almost as challenging as walking, as they can easily get stuck, or fall down holes. This means you have to carefully consider whether or not you should use a vehicle, and which one. The map also greatly helps in that regard, as its 3D aspect shows you the kind of terrain to expect on your journey.

Finally, I want to quickly talk about the story. I never truly loved any of the characters/voice actors behind them, and when I started playing I didn't care at all for the story. However after a few hours they started really growing on me, and the whole story became really engaging, though very bizarre. That being said I did think it became almost too weird toward the end, and maybe a little too pretentious. I liked that each chapter focused on a specific character, it made you appreciate characters that were previously just kind of ""there"".

I could probably talk about this game for hours, but this review is plenty long already lol. Overall I would probably give this game a 9.5 or above. Though it's been a while since I played it I can't really think of any problems I had with it (expect maybe like I mentioned earlier some aspects of the combat, and the later parts of the story).

TL;DR
This game is amazing, it's relaxing at times but can be complex/difficult. However don't play it if you are an impatient gamer, it is quite a slow game (which should be obvious as it is, at the end of the day, a walking simulator).",1670845199,1670845199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]DEATH STRANDING... a game that I spent way too much time in it![/h1]

[h1]A little warning... this game is quite bleak and depressing at times. Be in a proper mindset before playing this?[/h1]

[h1]LOW ROAR... just wow this band!!![/h1]

[b]This is not your usual gaming experience that you get out of the many games out there. There are some action at times but don't expect a METAL GEAR SOLID gameplay. DEATH STRANDING is mostly about carrying packages from Point A to B... to C... back to A... all over the world map. The overall feeling I've got with this game is pretty mixed but more on the good than the bad.

This is a game that you can't just play an hour or two and have the overall impression of Death Stranding. The unfortunate part is DS momentum picks up around the 10 hour -ish timeframe and the story unfolds better. Which in that case, you can't rush this game. You can skip rebuilding the roads and the many expeditions/deliveries to have the maximum star level at each settler and just focus on the story... that way, I'm pretty sure you could finish the game under 30 hours. In my case, I wanted to reach the maximum amount of stars for every settlements but the last one called THE LAST PREPPER p!$$ed me off way too much since he's located in such a b!tchy area, on a mountain peak... and it is very slippery. Rare is a game that really frustrates me but oh boy the snow mountain area is VERY annoying.

Without dragging on too long (like what this game truly does), here comes the PROS and CONS.[/b]


[h1]PROS:[/h1]
[b]+ADDED CONTENT FOR THE DIRECTOR'S CUT VERSION.
+OUTSTANDING GRAPHICS, VISUALS (character models, the game world... this game LOOKS truly good).
+Voice acting is on a master level.
+Many funny moments with the characters. (quite needed in this overall depressing game).
+AMAZING SOUNDTRACK (both the music score and the tracks from bands).
+Soothing gameplay at times. (rebuilding the roads was kinda fun... so was creating building to help you and other players out in the overworld). 
+Frantic gameplay when fighting/avoiding BT's (ghost-like beings) and MULES (human terrorists).
+The game story has a a good message about connecting yourself with others and not just technology.
+CYBERPUNK 2077 extra mission/dlc are pretty fun to do and nets you some cool CP2077 gear (Johnny Silverhand aviator red glasses & cybernetic arm, V's cosmetic facial cyberware and the ""Akira motorcycle"". There's holograms that are added from CP2077 as well.)
+Good UltraWide 21:9 monitor support. It is not perfect since it is not the true 3440x1440p resolution but 3360x1440p.[/b]


[h1]CONS:[/h1]
[b]-PAID UPGRADE for the Director's Cut. If only the Director's Cut was the original PC release since Steam removed the original version, hence removing my review from that version.
-Playing as a UPS/FEDEX guy can get tiresome.
-Too many cinematics! Usually, I love sitting around and just enjoying the story while taking a little break after a long gaming streak but dang at times, it does feel that Hideo Kojima seems overrated. Death Stranding pretty much feel like a movie. I'm sure he'd do well in the movie industry but yeah... the cinematics in this game are often and very long.
-Story is convoluted and doesn't make much sense most of the time. It is a bit hard to follow and unfortunately, it opens up only around Chapter 5.
-The story drags on way too long. Too many cutscenes and when you think the game is over... it ISN'T! It just drags on and on...
-Game controls are very ABYSMAL at times. Especially whether on foot or on vehicle on the snow mountains.
-The game is mostly stable but I did experienced a nasty game breaking bug that is still not fixed to this day. I've got that crash to desktop near the TIMEFALL FARM settlement. The only workaround that I read somewhere (and it worked for the whole game afterwards) was to reduce the amount of MEMORY FOR STREAMING. Put it on DEFAULT and that should fix your game.
-The BT's are quite annoying at times. When you can't avoid them, you get dragged on and ""forced"" to fight a boss. The big irritant is when that happens, all cargo are unloaded from your vehicle... AND damaged. Gah! More irritating is the frickin' ""bosses"" respawns all the time.
-TIMEFALL (rain that degrades objects and some lifeforms over a short period of time) is a neat concept but the degradation is annoying and quite illogical. It doesn't affect the grass nor main settlements buildings but it does for all built structures, roads and humans? WEIRD!
-Can't listen to the soundtrack while driving or while simply walking around. It only plays at Level 2 buildings or in your safe house. It do plays at specific fixed time in the story also. I would've loved to have somekind of ""walkman"" and listen to any song you like at any chosen time.[/b]


[h1]OVERALL:[/h1]
[b]One of a kind for a game. Honestly, I do think I spent too much time in this. At least 30 hours more than needed and that burnt me. The overall experience of this game is relaxing, fun, humorous dialogues with main characters, depressing and very sad at other moments... fighting MULES and BT'S while listening to a great soundtrack.[/b]


[h1]RECOMMENDATION:[/h1]
[b]I wish I played this Director's Cut right away but Steam removed the original version from the store. In order to keep my review visible, I had to upgrade the OG to DC.

With that said, I recommend you give it a shot while in a big discount, like 50% off! The main gameplay is pretty much the same from start to end and storywise, it unfolds more at around Chapter 5. The game has 14 official chapters (with a ""hidden 15"" for continuing the missed deliveries, maximizing the star level for all settlers and whatnot). This is entirely optional and can be skipped.

Will I replay DEATH STRANDING? Highly unlikely. I played all that I wanted to play. 

I do plan to play the just announced sequel from The Game Awards 2022!
Hopefully, it'll explore more the world and fix some irritants from this game![/b]",1670750650,1670750650,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The soundtrack is brilliant, Kojima did a fabulous job getting the artists to provide their songs for the game. The artwork is great, beautiful scenery even in an apocalyptic era. I just love this game. Lol, not really helpful I guess without giving away spoilers.

Dislikes: Not so much a dislike as a tedious job within the game, you may get bored of this part of the game easily. It takes a lot of time to make structures like roads and bridges plus the amount of materials required to do so. Some don't need much at all, some need a huge amount. I guess due to their location and timefall area.

Well... [b][i]yeah[/i][/b]. That's the story. [b][i]But there's just so much more[/i][/b] in between that makes this an amazing game. You'll likely spend over half the game confused, trying to figure out how it all fits together and the last half everything starts making sense and understanding your role in all of it. There are tons of bits and pieces of lore you find around the world and in emails/interviews but none of it is necessary to understand the story, it just adds more to it!

The multiplayer aspect is incredibly clever [i](I'm a simple man)[/i] and I think it encourages a positive team working aspect that I haven't seen in any other game. Someone uses and likes the bridge you built, your score goes up. It encourages experimenting with streamlining the process of delivery. If the things you build  are useful for you, it will be for other players and I love that. I really would have liked to see a Mario Maker style system where you could create unique challenges and missions for other players to attempt.  

I wish they made deliveries a bit more unique though. There are several deliveries with special conditions such as [i]avoiding submerging a package[/i] or a package that needs to lay flat. However it felt like they just forgot about it. You never really see any of them. 

The only other criticism I have is the lack of some sort of ""MP3 player"". The game has such a unique soundtrack, but the only time you hear it is at key moments in the story, or if you're resting in your room. I was convinced it was just an oversight and would be added to the Directors Cut, however that did not happen. Sure, you can just play the soundtrack over the game, but I'd rather it be in the game.

Death Stranding is another story, I was already really intriugued when the trailer came out,  and even more when it was revealed that it would be a package delivery game, it sounded so ... boring... But I sensed it was more than that, and I was not proven wrong. 

There is no secret by now this game main gameplay loop is delivering packages under some conditions, either quantity, condition, time limit toward the end you have temperature sensitive cargos. On your way you will meet various obstacle BTs (some kind of ghosts), MULES and DEMENS (humans), and of course, the environement : hills, rivers, mountains, ruins, cliffs, it's your job to circovent those obstacles or just go around them. And during all of that you often have to combat timefall a rain that wears down your equipment and cargo. 

It's so interesting the number of systems that Kojima productions and its team has managed to put to make going to point A to point B an interesting activity. 

Beautiful and really well optimised graphics, you can play on the lowest setting and it will still look very good. 

The story is really interesting, but it's very complex if you look too much into it, if you just decide to accept what the story says, it will make much more sense believe me.",1670489798,1670489798,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Genre-defying and skepticism-worthy, Death Stranding takes a player through one of the most beautiful and complex stories along with a refined gameplay which makes the game totally worth enjoying more than once and taking it 100%/full completionist.
Hideo Kojima has shown the world what he can do and he wants to give us, truly a genius, endeavoring and fearless master of his trade.
Although it can and will be frustrating for even the most hardcore gamer, it quickly falls into place becoming an enjoyable experience for any casual player through a slow paced learning curve, while putting the player leading a plot transcending time and space; life and death.
Finally a game that can be considered and accepted as Metal Gear Solid V: Phantom Pain's spiritual successor, either in gameplay, story-wise, or as an entire new legacy to unfold as years go by. The easter eggs and soundtracks perfectly combine.
Visually it's perfect, a stunning game, either in massive landscapes, gear and weaponry, or the characters' design. Soundtrack is perfectly chosen and orchestrated as well as voice acting, all the actors are to be congratulated for what could have been a movie industry blockbuster - who knows, maybe it will someday. Core game mechanics truly make Death Stranding an enjoyable, repeatable and lasting journey.
Falls short one just one aspect: player customization.and vehicles. Weaponry, accessories and tools are more than enough, but there could have been more suits and clothing, as well as more vehicles, maybe a 500 LoL mission bonus aircraft - as the PC version's cross-over content of Half-Life and Cyberpunk kind of fill this gap perfectly, along with the Horizon perks; though it's always the same suit, truck and bike, we get used to loving the simple color/cross-content offerings.
Worth playing, replaying, fully completing the preset achievements/trophies, finishing everything there is to finish, and even the goals we choose to fulfill as our own objectives. It is meant to be a solitary experience and totally manages to play out this goal while giving birth to the Strand system where we feel connected to other fellow players while we explore the Bridge Link part of the game.
A perfect, flawless, unique gaming-cinematic experience that calls out for continuity - Hideo Kojima has hinted a sequel through a concept-teaser, it will be well received, at this point, a full fledged standalone expansion would also be welcomed.
Nothing else would have been expected from Kojima Productions, not to be seen as the end of a rich and masterfully loved legacy, but as the establishment of a decade-long dynasty in video game industry.

Death Stranding is a game about exploration, discovery, planification and efficiency.
The feeling of accepting a new order where you have to deliver an extremely delicate package to someone who is 5 kilometers away in the top of mountain who needs the content to save his life is insanely attractive, immersive and exciting. 

This is how making orders work in DS, first you accept the order in a terminal then if you don’t want to encounter many inconveniences you will open your 3D map and check the terrain you are going to walk through for the first time and know nothing about. This terrain is going to be challenging for how wild and untouched by humans it is, then you check the route you THINK will be the best to take in order to deliver the package successfully and start thinking in what you will need for this trip. Maybe a couple ladders and a climbing anchor will do, you never know, what you know is that you cannot carry everything you want because you are not experienced enough at least for now to carry more weight and you lose stability pretty easily which could ruin the package completely. In this game there are not infinitely large pockets like in the rest of the games out there, in DS everything you decide to carry will occupy a physical place in your bag and suit affecting your stamina and balance. Once you have decided what to take and what to leave your trip starts and be prepared to experience what to me is the most beautiful terrain I have ever seen in any video game and be also prepared to change the route you though you would take for reasons I don’t want to spoil.

Yes this game is slow, don´t expect one more mass produced shooter when playing DS but if you take your time and adapt to the pace it is designed to be played this game might be in your top 10 by the time you finish it.

No spoilers but in case it feels slow just go through the main missions until chapter 3 avoiding secondary missions. In chapter 3 the game opens up and you can go back and do everything you left behind in a much more entertaining way, I don’t want to get into details but the progression in terms of tools and player upgrades are insane.

If I had to say something negative about DS is that the bosses are easy (I haven't tried the new very hard mode yet) and the story at times feels too complex and there are too many dialogues (which you can always skip). Also the ending of the game is a bloated mess, when you are ready to finish playing and the game keeps implying the game is going to end it will keep throwing boring cutscens at you like there is no tomorrow for 4 hours plus a couple of extra mission that you will probably not enjoy anymore.

Even with its downsides DS is in my top 5 video games of all time for its creativity, how beautifully crafted it is and the original approach that makes going from point A to point B a wholesome and challenging experience.

Map is small and empty, can't there be like at least twice amount of locations? I'm tired of seeing same face every 10~20 mins. Mountains are also disappointing in size.
I know its apocalyptic environment but maybe devs should go outside once or twice and see not every corner of world is covered in tons of rock every 1 meter.

It is the wacky adventures of Norman Reedus and his funky foetus, however, that really opened my eyes to this. Death Stranding is, by its nature, a walking simulator, but unlike the rest it does actually simulate walking (in the sense of general on-foot traversal) with unprecedented nuance and depth and I cannot help but applaud Kojima for taking the most boring type of quest and activity a game can have, making the whole game out of just that and yet making it fun.",1669732271,1669732271,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But only the genius of Kojima's imagination can do it so seamlessly and coherently. Death Stranding is one of the most underrated games in recent years. Wrongly considered by some as a “walking simulator”, it’s an original masterpiece, which has created a new genre. Hideo Kojima, one of the greatest game developers of all time, could have easily made a fanservice game to satisfy the fans of his iconic games. Instead, he risked to create something completely original, which has never been done before. A game in which you cooperate with other players without ever physically seeing them in your playthrough.

You are trying to unite the people of an isolated part of the world. You embark on a journey where you traverse eerie, but wildly beautiful landscapes. Make no mistake though; Death Stranding is a game which includes equal amounts of action and meditation. Yes, you walk back and forth, carrying cargo. A lot. Sometimes you are left in your own thoughts while taking in the scenery around you, atmospheric music playing in the background. But this is a very welcome break. Because the game gets so intense, you will be on edge all the time. During your playthrough, you will fight armies of terrifying ghostly entities as well as hostile humans, with a diverse arsenal of weapons and vehicles. The controls are responsive and everything is done seamlessly as soon as you learn how everything works. Thankfully, the Director’s Cut adds a number of quality of life updates to gameplay, with the most important being an automatic distribution of cargo on your body, for optimal balance.

The story, lore and characters are very well-written. The plot revolves around the worst dystopia imaginable, brought forth by a cataclysmic event that keeps happening and has brought humanity on the very brink of extinction. Death Stranding makes the player think and introspect. It does so with symbolism, but mainly through contrast. In fact, the game is truly a dance of opposites. The landscapes are immensely beautiful, however the mood is severely depressing. You feel a deafening loneliness in your journey, yet you are helped by equipment and messages that other players have placed in the world. Your journey progresses slowly, yet there’s rain which makes time pass rapidly for everything it touches. As the plot goes on, the player is transformed along with the protagonist - from a cynic into a humanist. The game ends in the most beautiful way possible.

The soundtrack is captivating. It’s a perfect fit for the game’s atmosphere. It appears at the perfect moments, adding not only ambience, but a feeling of catharsis. Included are brilliant artists, such as Low Roar, the Silent Poets and Ludvig Forssell. Visually, the game is as stunning as it gets, with no graphical issues of any kind. Optimization is surprisingly good for lower-end machines. On medium and high-end machines, it runs smoothly on Ultra settings with a steady frame rate.

Death Stranding is undoubtedly one of the greatest and most original games ever made. Made by one of the most brilliant minds in the industry. A bright example that videogames are art. I hope anyone can experience it and have as much fun as I had.",1669723459,1669723459,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

Overall, nice looking game. It's a Kojima game, so I expected a mostly cinematic experience with lengthy cutscenes, but there are even more cutscenes than I imagined. At 15.4 hours in I think around 3 solid hours of that has been getting interrupted and nagged by tips, voice messages, cutscenes ,and tips which are answers to questions that I didn't ask. And question and explanations I did want answers to were left to me to try and solve alone.

There's no way to reduce the volume of the music, or other common kinds of gameplay options permitted in probably more than 90% of extant games in today's market. Maybe this is okay if you like the music, but mostly I found it to be distracting and disruptive to the immersion of the game.

Part of the game play is establishing a network connection to unify various geographic regions. Doing this allows placed objects like bridges, ropes and other structures placed by other players to be visible and accessible by anyone playing the game. The trouble with this is all the traversing work has been done by other players so I really did not find myself needing to do much of anything on my own to progress through the game.

The UI for depositing and obtaining cargo at destinations, as well as the UI through most of the game is clumsy, time consuming, and non-intuitive. I am wondering if the director stressed that things in this game be new and unprecedented over stressing that they be usable or fun.

I'm the sort of person that enjoys Car Mechanic Sim, Farming Sim, Viscera Cleanup Detail, and other unconventional and non-standard or mainstream games. I thought this might be an interesting game, and it definitely seems like it's outside-of-the-box concept could be for some people, but for me, this game plays like a nagging time-sink full of interruptions, long uneventful grinds, and without any meaningful or amusing actual game-play or necessity to solve any problems on my own.

It seems there is a somewhat interesting game here that some people seem to like, but I don't think it's for me, and I don't know anyone that I can imagine enjoying this. Your mileage may vary.",1669683328,1669683328,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Coming from someone who likes everything Sci-fi and weird shit, Death stranding was perfect for me, and while yes the game play of just walking can turn a lot of people off this game, I'd say if this game looks interesting to you or you have Xbox game pass, you should try it as the connected world system and story/lore were some of the most unique things I have ever seen in gaming.

 I really liked the fact that Death stranding did not put an emphasis on combat (though it is a flaw I will mention later) as it allowed for a more focus on the game play loop, walking, and to add on to that I do not think this game is just a ""walking sim"" as there are many elements to manage while walking (terrain, durability, just to name a few) as well as there being elements of stealth and combat that I wont spoil. 

The walking itself can feel very cinematic during story missions when your sneaking past enemies or you can see the destination in sight and then suddenly a licensed song starts to play, The soundtrack for Death Stranding is one of the best soundtracks I have ether heard, and I have never remembered a game that kept me listening to the soundtrack for long time and time again.

That said there are some flaws with this game that I will warn you about, while yes the walking can feel cinematic during story missions, beyond that your further enjoyment of it will depend on how many or little upgrades you have, what the terrain is like, or how much time you spend on side activities. another flaw I mentioned previously was combat, on PC at least, the gun play does not quit feel right, melee controls are placed in a confusing position, personally I'm conflicted on it, at best combat is enjoyable at-least when the environment is integrated into it, but I do feel like Kojima productions should improve the combat in a sequel because even though combat is not a priority in this game, that doesn't mean it should be bad. Finally I do have to mention that this game does take some time to really get going, but this should not really be a problem unless you only play First person shooters.

In conclusion, despite combat being flawed I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique gaming experience or thinks this game looks interesting to them,

This game starts as a walking simulator but after the first zone starts to snowball into utter madness of enemies, combat, environmental hazards, horror, and loss.

This zombie-smashing action game is a strong post-apocalyptic adventure with top-tier parkour movement, an expansive open world in which to put them to good use, and lots of great characters. What doesn’t work so well is how it combines a near-lethal case of bugs with a story centered around a protagonist so uninteresting that he’s all but (un)dead on arrival. I’m sure that when the developers at Techland set out to make this sequel they had no idea that they’d end up releasing a game about a global pandemic two years into a global pandemic, but it’s clear that trying to finish such an ambitious game under these conditions didn’t do it any favors.

Sticking largely to the plan laid out by its surprise-hit predecessor in 2015, Dying Light 2 takes place in an excellent, highly explorable city where the rooftops are home to eccentric survivors who have become masters of parkour, scavenging, and chopping zombie heads off with assorted sporting equipment. By day the zombies swarms crowd into buildings to hide from the sun, and by night they pour into the streets in daunting masses, but the real tension comes from managing the terrifying meter that counts down to you transforming into a brainless shambler. Like nearly everyone else you’re infected with the zombie virus, and staying in near-constant contact with UV rays is the only thing delaying the inevitable. The ever-present need to recharge that meter – which will deplete in a matter of minutes if you’re inside a building away from the light – is an excellent addition to Dying Light’s moment-to-moment gameplay that keeps up the pressure on every step of your journey.",1669556552,1669556552,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

3. Achievements, one of the only drive that helps to play the endgame, are bugged since at least 9 months.
4. I wish the interviews and emails were voiced. Maybe voiced only in your room, by a ""AI voice"".
5. Sometimes I get casual bugs, such as vehicles on top of zip-lines... 
6. This might just be me, but among all the things added in the DLC, there's nothing that really stick or it's ""game changing"". In short, there's nothing like the zip-line to travel.

There's no other game like Death Stranding. I consider it a masterpiece. You are a ""Porter"" whose mission is to reunify the world by connecting unique preppers, cities, and distribution centers. The online component comes alive once you complete deliveries to gain the trust of these areas. Immediately the once deserted, destroyed, and dangerous area you traveled is full of online equipment and vehicles to assist you in the future.

Death Stranding completely captures the idea of teamwork and friendship, though I believe it can only be truly enjoyed online. Being able to help other players by building a generator in a remote area is something you can't do in offline.

My only negative feedback is about the vehicles. For a game with unmatched technical gameplay around carrying packages and navigating/climbing rough terrain (show, mountains, rivers, etc), the vehicles are horrible. If you bump a tiny rock your vehicle comes to a complete stop. You can tell they intended for vehicles to only be used for the highway roads you can construct, and not for off road use.",1669428497,1669428497,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But many of the late game destinations, are in mountainous terrain requiring you to once again fall back to good old foot travel to get the job done. You will be doing a LOT of walking in this game.

This is more akin to a puzzle game for how I see it: they tell you where you need to go, and you need to figure out a way to get there safely, without falling, while managing your stamina and items. Your reward for making it, is that you'll have the solutions found by other people show up in your game, so you'll be able to skip a ravine by crossing a collectively made and maintained bridge, for example.
Death Stranding is hauntingly beautiful in its deserted landscapes occasionally crossed by other delivery men, and peppered by the traces of other players passing through the same experiences you did, suggesting shortcuts, safe places to rest, and peeing everywhere.

After many hours of gameplay, I have stopped enjoying the game.  It is repetitive and boring  if you keep doing useless deliveries and they have very little purpose.  Now I am to a point where I just want to finish the game and move on to another on.  If you take out the useless deliveries, you could finish the game in +/- 30 hours.  It's an ""open world"" but it's small and there is nothing interesting to discover since everything is dead.  To my taste, the ending was bad, but it's a japanese type of ending, not like a western view ""all is well that ends well"".  I do not understand how come this game is either ""very positive"" or ""overwhelmly positive"".  For me it was a waste of time and money because nothing I did really ""made a difference"" in the game because of the ending.

Up to now the game is good, stable and the graphics are very good.  But for a Japanese created game it is WAY TOO MUCH PRO AMERICA to a point where it was almost a reason to stop playing. America is so self centered, thinking it's the saviour of humanity it's crazy.  A lot, and I mean a lot of the problems that we have now is because of them.

And we see why there should be more games like that.

Because when you get ""niche"" games or very unique games, if you like them then you're really going to like them. Make less games that try to appeal to everyone but fail to be outstanding, more games like this.

The core gameplay loop of Death Stranding is deceptively simple. You go to a location, you get an order, and you deliver it to another location across the map. Along the way, you will navigate increasingly hazardous terrain, feral delivery men, nihilistic genocidal terrorists, and the tormented souls of the undead who wish to eat you and then explode.

Oh, and rain and snow rapidly deteriorates everything.

There will be a number of tools to accomplish this, and gaining better tools will feel extremely satisfying as your deliveries get easier. If you like this gameplay loop like I do, you will find it weirdly addicting in how much fun it is to navigate hazardous terrain in that Kojima way of dozens of systems and weird interactions all meshing together so that you have numerous ways to accomplish any given task. Sneaking around, avoiding and or subduing enemies and ghosts is satisfying and rewarding from the man who put stealth games on the map. 

The game world is beautiful and detailed.

The story? This is the part of the review where you might be expecting me to say that the story is the weak link.

It isn't. The story is one of the more hopeful-in-the-face-of-something-horrible stories I have ever seen. In an extremely bleak world, you'll see the capacity for human good. Tears will be shed, hope will be gained, and you'll see every aspect of this game being top tier.

No, this game isn't for everyone. There is the possibility that you just won't like the core gameplay loop. That's fine. 

But if you're like me? You'll love it and this will be one of those games that really meant something to you, and that you'll remember forever more in your list of ""damn, that game was incredible"".",1669333376,1669333376,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

Innovative gameplay with a twist on asynchronous multiplayer, combining the polish, detail, and subtle humor you can expect from Kojima. While the story is complex, it can occasionally be a little predictable, at least if you're paying attention. Like Metal Gear Solid, stealth here is also optional. Despite the route you take to solve the problems the game throws at you, every choice is rewarding; however, don't confuse this with the game having story choices, the ending is the same no matter what order or how you choose to complete quests. There are some long cutscenes, but nothing not to the point of being obnoxiously unbearable such as Metal Gear Solid 4.

The best analogy that can be made of this game is it's a road-trip simulator with a focus on planning and preparing for the journey. I don't know how many people have that itch which needs scratched, but this game scratches it. It is so much more than a ""walking simulator"", which simply does the game a disservice. A lot of the game's mechanics revolve around delivering packages, but preparing for and reacting to the obstacles of that journey is what makes this game both heavily rewarding and potentially niche.

I would go so far as to rank it a masterpiece, with the caveat that you're a fan of Kojima's work. This game refines Kojima's formula, and I am very much looking forward to what Hideo Kojima's new studio produces next.",1669305432,1669305857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's fine though, as long as you know what you're going in for before purchasing, which I did and I really enjoyed my time in this game (both original and the Director's Cut). 

In DS you play as a postman named Sam Bridges. However in a world where most people are isolated in protected settlements, the humble postman is a cherished profession known as a Porter. The game plays somewhere between Metal Gear Solid V (MGSV) and Euro Truck Simulator (ETS), with you ferrying around cargo across a variety of landscapes in 3rd person using tools such as ladders and ropes to help you get past lakes and mountains. Sometimes the controls can feel a little janky though, as the smoothness of MGSV controls aren't quite there. Most missions will see you laden with your cargo, after which you must balance it on your body (or vehicle, later in the game) and then plot out a suitable route to the destination to hopefully deliver the goods without damaging them from the tricky terrain. Occasionally you will encounter MULEs (thieves) and BTs (semi-visible ghostly enemies) that you must stealth past, or take on using combat methods that you unlock a little later in the game. The combat is easily the weakest part of this game though.

There is something very cathartic about delivering packages to settlements in need, but the game also focuses heavily on the themes of connection. This is seen through players being able to construct buildings such as bridges over rivers, which appear in another online players game's. You can also entrust your cargo to these other Porters, share vital equipment & resources with each other, and even helpful leave signs pointing out hidden paths or dangerous areas (similar to Dark Souls messaging). The story also focuses quite a lot on trying to reconnect one-another, which is eerily relevant given the state of our current world.

So basically, if you ike Kojima's eclectic ideas and find the idea stomping over some grasslands, rivers and mountains to take someone some scrap metal, then this is probably worth the price of admission.

It's a beautiful game, visually stunning.
Player models during cutscenes are superb. Seeing Die-Hardman near the end of the game gave me actual chills and hope the actor was nominated for all the awards.
The story will leave you curious, yearning for more, keeping you playing until you learn and get closure. It's a mystery, drama, sci-fi, psychological thriller.

Gameplay-wise it is definitely more than just a Amazon/Walking simulator. The goal of the game is to connect everyone together on this network to bring humanity back to some form of normalcy and work together to keep going, keep on living, keep on keeping on.

It's fun, fair, and sometimes brutal. The feature of having other players buildings being in the world can be both a boon and a burden. Example being bridges made in the middle of nowhere to generators being there to power up vehicles or timefall shelters in areas of heavy timefall.

But Kojima managed to find a way to make walking a fun, challenging, and dare I say even deep, gameplay mechanic. Theres nothing else quite like it, and the world and story surrounding all that walking will keep you making trek after trek from one end of the earth to the other. Not to mention just how much their is to do besides walking. In the middle of these long walking sessions, the game can turn into something else entirely at a moment's notice. Rain starts to fall? Its a horror game now. See a camp in the distance? If you choose to go there, or have to go there for an order, you're basically playing Metal Gear Solid 5 for a little while. Not to mention stuff like the racing mini game that the Director's Cut adds, which is surprisingly awesome despite the driving mechanics in the base game being somewhat basic. 

Of special note is the soundtrack, even more so now with the untimely death of Ryan Karazija (Low Roar). Ludvig Forssell's score is incredible, and I've never heard a soundtrack that has been able to convey a sense of something being ""otherworldly"" (in the paranormal sense) in such a perfect way. But Death Stranding would be far less than it is without Low Roar's contributions. Karazija's songs perfectly accent moments in the game, managing to turn what was once a mundane walk into an emotional and reflective moment. And not only are the songs fantastic in their own right, but their tonal and  thematic relevance to the rest of the story cannot be understated and is absolute perfection.

Death Stranding is one of the most unique games out there, and its 100% worth the asking price (especially if its on sale). Its not for everyone, but even if the term ""walking simulator"" turns you off (like it does me) I'd implore you to give it a try.

- The mechanics/movement feel very real and are extremely well made.
- You have your base(s) for which you have to gather materials and you develop your own gear and upgrades.
- The loadout menu basically works the same just with different gear.
- It focuses a lot on stealth, but you can also engage in combat if you want. (Contrary to Metal Gear, you rely on non-lethal combat).
- ...

Instead of listing more similarities, I just wanna say this: The game is exceptionally well made. It takes all the good things from another of Kojima's gems, adds a bunch of cool new mechanics and makes it an exciting experience. The characters, as always, are a labour of love. You will love or hate them, feel for them and engage with the story as you follow Sam on his journey to connect the people (don't worry I will not spoiler). The story itself and all of its mysteries really draw you in and the atmosphere (soundtrack, visual art & graphics, pace, dialogues and bits of info you can find scattered around the world, and and and) make it an immersive experience.

I have watched complete gameplay on Tube 2 times, so I know what it is about. Also I played 60 hours of not much legal copy, then I felt I must buy it, it really deserves it. Actually I wanted to play with other people, even they are invisible hahaha...
   It is a second Kojima move at me after MGSV TPP. And both times I see he keeps his style - phantasmagoric, horror, surrealism elements, which I do not like; I prefer something more real or Sci-Fi instead. But we have what we have.
   A delivery simulator as it is called sometimes, an Eurotruck 2 but without trucks. Hmmm, yeah, it has something you know? Here are my tools and my goal, how do I reach it - my problem. There are few ways how to solve problems - deliver the goods: you can first dispatch enemies (if there are any in way), then collect the goods and deliver; or you may get the fast bike and rush through enemy territory; or you can go around it on foot, dragging levitating carriages with goods and so on... it all depends on your imagination.
   Second thing of Kojima is his game engines. Can't say I got ultra PC, but it is neither a rusty bucket. But as MGSV, and Death stranding are those of few most visually pleasing games, also it runs without freezes, lags or other stutterings.
Kojima for me now is becoming a sign of quality.
   Asynchronous multiplayer or what it is called. While someone says, play it offline, and feel the grind yourself, I disagree. You do not meet other players, but you see the signs of their presence - ladder here, bridge there, sometimes placed very well, you are ready to give tonn of likes for it.
   40 euro for this is undervalue. Compared with 60 euro tag of Cyberpunk, which hardly can reach 30 FPS on my machine, this feels unfair. Should be vice versa at least.

So, yeah... game's well done, graphics nice, sound nice, physics nice (there are physics, weight of load, elements of terrain, which impacts your traveling, etc), story not my kinda cuppa, but I'm trying, after 2 times of watching, 3rd time playing myself, I think (!)

When I first bought the game, my PC didn't have decent specs to run it smoothly, but when I got some new parts, I was very eager to try again and fully immerse myself in it.
This game is amazing. I love games that have a ton of progression elements, and this game has it. No microtransactions, no PTW, nothing. Just you… and your deliveries.

I spent around 80 hours on the standard game and now it's time to immerse myself again on the Director's Cut

The game starts relatively slow. You don’t really know what to do, where to go, how to avoid/kill BTs and Mules/Terrorists, how to repair cargo, what do the structures do, where to build them, etc. But once you start getting the hang of things, you feel like you belong in that world, you are Sam. You know what you must do and the best way to do it. I rarely feel this in games. I get some sort of high playing this. I want to get all the achievements, I want to help all the NPCs out there, I want to help other players too! I’ve basically made all the roads on the second map, made a very nice Zip Line path going through all the most difficult places: Mountaineer, Spiritualist, Evo-devo, Geologist and all the others around the mountains. Made Timefall shelters, generators… I simply loved the idea that by helping myself in the game, I was helping other people too!
Another plus is that I am a person that usually doesn’t like to grind. I love Elite Dangerous, but I stop playing from time to time because the grind starts to get a bit boring. But the grinding in Death Stranding was the opposite. I was always very curious to see what item or color I would unlock by reaching a new star level with that settlement. It’s amazing!

But there are some things that I don’t like in it:
The vehicles are awesome and the game changes a lot once you get them. But the truck is basically the only one that I use. And sometimes it can be VERY irritating. Sometimes it feels like it’s made of styrofoam and gravity means nothing to it and the 1 ton of cargo on the back.
Minor spoiler ahead, but it was something that I didn’t enjoy so much:
[spoiler]I didn’t like the 3 segments with Cliff. the shooter ones. I understand the meaning of them to the story and the development of the characters, both Sam and Cliff. But those parts broke a bit of the immersion for me. I like shooter games, but inside a game like Death Stranding was a bit off, IMHO.[/spoiler]

The voice acting and motion capture is amazing in this game. But when the character Mama, played by Margaret Qualley, explains some story about her, her facial expressions were very dumb and funny. It almost felt like something out of Mass Effect Andromeda. But it was tolerable considering the rest of the animations.

The Director's Cut is amazing so far. Many new items, vehicles, missions, activities... And the graphical boost is very noticeable. Plus, vehicle handling is much better now!! Basically everything that was already good on the standard version got WAY better now. it's a must buy!

TL;DR

Death Stranding is different, starts slow and can get very confusing with a lot of information and controls (after all, it is a Hideo Kojima game), but if you like the feeling of progression and unlocking items and benefits in game, nice story, a LOT of well made cut-scenes, try it out.

I didn’t say everything I wanted here. I have a lot of feelings for this game, and this review would be bigger than it already is.

Death Stranding is a fun game but not fun in a conventional way. The community aspect of the game is what makes it so fun. Getting helped by a random player's ladder or rope, seeing someone using a road I rebuilt; such things are what makes this seemingly boring game fun. The gameplay emphasises the story's moral; a community coming together to overcome hardship. It's definitely not a game for everyone but it's also not just a ""walking sim"".

It does have its downsides too. The redundant menus are one. Navigating the menus just to get a mission or complete one really kills the flow of the game. And the dialogue is very exposition heavy and is dragged out a bit too much.

Overall, this game isn't a masterpiece by any means but still is a great game and I thoroughly enjoyed it.[/quote]

This is what I wrote for the old Death Stranding edition and it holds true for the director's cut as well. And the director's cut comes with a bunch of new tools that are very helpful.

There is something about Death Stranding that always has me coming back to it. Calling it a walking simulator (while not wrong) wouldn't be doing it justice. Death Stranding has a certain atmosphere that just can't be seen in any other game. The environment as you traverse the country grows more diverse and provides new challenges for you to overcome as you deliver these packages. tortuous mountain terrains, winding rivers, steep forests hills, knee-deep snow tops, and even the ruins of a destroyed city. Death Stranding has plenty of large and expansive locations for you to travel through while you carry pounds and pounds of cargo. 

The packages themselves are interesting as they range from medication, food, weapons, metal or ceramic, to expensive figurines, a loved one's last message, a human person, or even just a plain old pizza. I once found myself delivering a woman to her husband after believing he was dead, only for her to go back home after a lover's quarrel, and then go back again after they had made up. Another time I was entrusted with delivering a machine that would allow a doctor to remotely help a pregnant woman deliver her baby, the procedure was a success and the husband and wife decided to name the baby after Sam (the main protagonist).

The story isn't too complicated and is relatively straightforward from beginning to end. I'm the type of person to love complex stories but screw myself over with my horrible attention span and lack of brains in general. Luckily I didn't have to worry about that in Death Stranding since when something is explained, they explain it once more in simpler terms for Sam since he is usually just as confused as I am. Some might see the story as bland, boring, or just downright bad, but I see the story as one that is up to interpretation. Even if you choose to see the story as it is, it's perfectly and beautifully simple but gripping. Throughout the entire story keeps you wondering ""What's going to happen next?"" or ""What does this mean?"". The entire game will have you in tears of both sadness and happiness.

The gameplay is simple but challenging regardless. In the beginning, you have to deal with not dying/ruining cargo through slopes, drops, rivers, bandits, BTs, and rain. As you progress through the game, each obstacle changes so that the tactics and precautions you made before, while still somewhat valid, will have to be revised. A good example would be bandits. Sure you can just avoid their routes or sneak through them, but later in the game, the bandits gain vehicles, more sensors, and eventually try to kill you instead of stealing your cargo. The same goes with everything else, you become less prone to slips and falls but more difficult terrain is introduced, you learn more about BTs only to find more types of BTs. Though I must say your experience might vary from mine, as I played on Hard difficulty, mama didn't raise no chicken.

Finally, my favorite part of the game: the Music. The entirety of Death Stranding is filled to the brim with unique, colorful, and moving music that plays during many deliveries. I can say with full certainty that the game would be nowhere as good without its soundtrack. Most of its soundtrack comes from albums by Low Roar, which Kojima expertly used to further express the emotions seen and felt during the story. Whether I was delivering the body of a loved one, resources to help grow food for a city, or helping out another player by picking up their lost cargo, I had Low Roar accompanying me as I traveled to my destination. I loved the soundtrack so much that I found myself making a playlist and playing it whenever I was delivering packages. Without the Low Roar, the game would have felt a lot emptier. (Rest In Peace Ryan Karazija).

While I know there are many things in this review I've missed, I think it would be better if you found out yourself. Like good music? Play Death Stranding. Like a beautiful story? Play Death Stranding. Like a gorgeous environment filled with mystery? Play Death Stranding. Love Norman Reedus? Play Death Stranding. Like walking? Play Death Stranding. And if you don't like any of these things, what are you doing with yourself? (lol) 

The only complaint I have is that the music shouldn't end as soon as you enter the delivery point.

Play the game offline first. Get as far as you can with no help. Play the game on the hardest setting or else its much too easy.

I think this game is great but also very different from your usual games you would play. Ever since I played this game, I've gotten to appreciate the game for what it is since the first time on PS4. But not just that, this game made me discover my favorite Band and First band as well. Low Roar is a great band and ever since I've heard their songs in this game, I was hooked. As of recent I am sadden that the Lead Singer had passed but knowing that his voice is still in the game and everything else, I am enjoy this game for its OST.

Now most would say its a walking sim or not interesting but the thing about the game its suppose to move away from the usual formula of gaming and try something completely new. Now of course everything is optional outside the main story missions but believe me when I say, This game can become addicting, By even trying to get all the Stars for certain facilities to fully complete the optional objectives 100%. The grind and struggles becomes a relief after completing something that takes a while. But its personally something I enjoyed. 

I am still waiting for the Sequel to be announced but until then this game will be one of my personal favorite games of all times as well as RDR2.

However, I am not going to say it isn't, because that statement is correct. The thing that makes Death Stranding different though, is that it is the best walking simulator there has ever been.

Of course, the game is much more than that as well but I'll get to that shortly. This game's focus is walking from place to place to deliver packages, and reconnect the fractured society that the world has become. Now while this sounds boring when described this way, the game has many mechanics in between this that make it interesting. When I say that walking is the FOCUS, I mean it. It is the focus in how an FPS is focused on gunplay, or how a fighting game is focused on pulling off combos and blocking, the walking in this game is developed with a lot of care and nuance. 

All the cargo you carry is more weight added to you, so the more you carry the harder it is to walk. This is understandable, and as you play you will become stronger you can carry more. But, you can also place your cargo where you want on Sam (the player character, AKA Norman Reedus), which changes your center of gravity. Poorly placed cargo can be detrimental to your efforts as you may be leaning heavily to one side if stacked incorrectly. Additionally, you have to choose everything you take with you that is extra like weapons to protect yourself, materials to build additional structures, etc. So while it is a walking simulator, it is an involved walking simulator where you actually have a consequence for your poor planning. I also recommend playing with a controller so that you have finer movement of Sam as you will sometimes have to make fine adjustments to complete hard climbs.

I love this part of the game. Trying to see what may be up ahead and trying your best to plan out your journey. Of course it's not just the traversal that is difficult. Sometimes you may need to go through sections of MULEs, which are enemies out to steal your cargo and knock you out. Or optionally through BTs, which are (at their core), a powerful ghost-like entity that can kill you if you get detected by them. These two hazards introduce both gunplay and stealth sections to Death Stranding and keep it exciting and fresh enough to keep going... and the story of course.

Combat in this game for me is mixed. The difficulty of combat is much higher than that of the traversal part of the game at the same difficulty, making for weird jumps in how hard the game is in main-story sequences. While I recommend to play this game with a controller, I do recommend that when it comes to the combat you should swap to keyboard and mouse to gain that extra precision. Luckily the game switches instantly between the input devices which is a very welcome feature. 

The story of this game is long, and for some may not be engaging or interesting. I quite like the story myself, but I also think that a lot of value is gained through reading journal entries and mail you receive throughout. Be aware of that going in, since that is where a lot of the actual explanations are. 

I played this game on release on the PS4. I committed most of my free time to it, and got platinum after a little over a month. I decided to purchase it again on PC, and eventually get the Director's Cut upgrade resulting in this review. 

The Director's Cut adds a lot of new things to the game, such as races, a gun range (useful for weapon practice), additional main missions, and a lot of little quality of life improvements. For starters, two new items were added (won't spoil) that help out the start of the game allowing the pace to be a bit faster so that you can get to the main game quicker. It also makes it a little less painful for new players. There's also some new side missions that gain you some extra goodies for completing them. As a player replaying this game, I felt I was gaining value out of it by getting a new side order to take on every once and awhile. They're simple but interesting nonetheless. New structures also keep the game feeling fresh while also providing some new ways of dealing with orders that help expand the game into more types of playstyles.

Now some cons of this version. The main missions that are used to sell this version of the game are nothing spectacular. While they are cool to see and open up some new types of environments to interact with, the whole area is rather small and lacking for what I was hoping for. It may be due to starting a 2nd playthrough that caused this, but I was disappointed to find that out of the three missions that this new side area has, two are available right at the start of the game... while the other requires the game to be beaten before accessing it. It was still interesting and a nice addition, but it was not worth the amount of time between missions. As a returning player you can transfer your save file, so if that applies to you I would recommend doing that if you are not interested in a 2nd run.

MULE areas in the launch version of DS were dangerous but not that dangerous. Mainly they were there to make it harder to traverse through areas and make it hard to deliver ALL of you cargo. As the game goes on things do eventually change to make them different, but I won't delve much into that. However in DS:DC, the MULE camps gain a few machine gun turrets after your first visit to them to make it harder to steal their materials. While I understand this decision, these turrets are very annoying. They can shoot you from a very long distance, damages you significantly and are very difficult to take out. Due to this I ended up despising going into any MULE areas when not required. Stealth is an option still, but if you get spotted you now have way more fire power against you, and MULEs instantly gravitate to them. To add on top of that, they also get a nice shield to protect them as well making it even HARDER to deal with. 

Anyways, there is a LOT to talk about with this game. If you haven't played it before, definitely give it a try. ESPECIALLY this version as even with it's cons, it adds a lot of new additions to the game that help it become a bigger and better game. Just remember that it isn't your typical game. It is a game where you take your time, and focus on getting the job done... not slaughtering all your enemies. Let it run it's course and let every moment sink in. It is a unique experience and it should be treated as such. It's not for everyone, but you'll never know if it's for you unless you give it a chance. 

This is one of my favourite games and I hope it can be yours too.",1669173087,1669173087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't let my hours fool you, I have 110 hours on the base game, and a further 17 on the Directors cut (as of writing this review).

This game creates an atmosphere unlike any other, with the environment design, ambience, and general feel. The sound design is magnificent, and you really do become immersed in this foreign world.

The thing I most love about this game is the storytelling, you're thrown into this 'uncanny' world, where it looks, and feels, like ours, but is not really anything like ours. We have the people, and the nature to keep us grounded in reality, but so many things that are so foreign to us are just a part of daily life in this world. 

While it is easy to say 'oh, walking sim, why would I want to play that', I would have to disagree. 
Yes, the gameplay is monotonous, but it has enough variety to keep you in the world. Seeing the sights, coming across other players' constructions, shouting into the void and hearing a response, all evokes an emotion of 'I'm alone, but I'm not alone'. At the very least, the gameplay does keep you entertained while you think, either about the story, or just something completely off-topic, and I think that is kind of the point. 

I've seen a lot of criticism of the storytelling, and how confusing or disorganised it is. While yes, it is confusing at first, you do slowly become more and more aware of the world surrounding you, and are able to actually understand what is going on. I think the best way to experience it is not to look anything up, but just keep playing. A lot of things are left ambiguous early on, on purpose.

Overall, if you want to really enjoy this game be prepared to sink some time in, and enjoy the stunning visuals, and this foreign world.",1669168957,1669168957,True,3,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

Has an incredible story & atmosphere. The soundtrack is impeccable; the music is incorporated into the lengthier ""running to and from"" sections of quests to create a distinct tone and experience. The story is rather long, not witcher long, but still long. Took me roughly 65/70hrs to complete the story and side missions (most of that spent running).

If you loved it before, you gonna love it even more now.

I have 84 hours on Death Stranding, when time was right i just bought this version and put another 71 hours on my second run. So i have about 155 hours of gameplay and i dont regret it at all. Beautifull game by graphics, gameplay,music and story. On my second run i was less scared to try new tactics that i havent used in my first run. I fought on purpuse with many monsters in order to get a lot of chiral crystals to complete the Roads so i can make transfer easier. I tried fighting more that just running away generally , i saw a couple of new missions , and generally some new stuff. For me the game was already a complete success , this is just bonus or to be more precise ...a reason so i can complete the game again. It's been one hell of a ride.

Death Stranding is perhaps one of the past decade's most unique and innovative yet divisive games.
Some people will love this game, some will despise it. Kojima has no doubt created an unforgettable experience.

Death Stranding is literally a walking simulator, the main gameplay loop is travelling from point A to B in the most efficient manner while sidestepping human enemies and the ghostly BTs. Coupled with the innovative only features that let the actions of other players affect the game's world, Death Stranding has made the simple act of walking and delivering packages an enjoyable and engaging experience.

Not to mention the grand narrative that goes along with the game (which I won't spoil) as well as the beautiful and serene visuals and amazing soundtrack from various artists around the world.

[h1]1. Game Review[/h1]
[i][If you are too lazy to read all of my thoughts: TLDR at the bottom][/i]

[b][u]The world, story and characters[/u][/b]

The beautiful post-apocalyptic world of Death Stranding, based on photogrammetry-assets captured in Iceland, invites you to explore. The theme of “Connecting and feeling connected” is at the center of Death Strandings story about loneliness, family, loss and hope. The game manages to hold a healthy balance between “serious”, “deeply philosophical”, “funny” and “emotional”, that worked out for me very well! If you can’t stand overexposure, some cheesy puns here and there and lengthy cutscenes (basically the Kojima-way of storytelling), then you might feel turned off by the game’s narrative at first.  The well written characters, with their deeply emotional backstories have grown to my heart after a while and I always wanted to know what’s next! Also, the cast (full of Kojimas friends and people you might know) does a great job at delivering the story through their motioncapture performances and dialogue deliveries! The cinematography of the cutscenes is also one of the best in the industry!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2647400508

The story is one I still think about long after having finished the game and that’s quite a rare thing! The soundtrack and licensed music selection is also amazing and fit the atmosphere at any given moment! Seriously, there are quite some bangers in here! 

[b][u]The gameplay: Can traversal as a core gameplay mechanic be fun? (Yes!!)[/u][/b]
Death Stranding is a unique game. You might have watched some gameplay on “YouTube” and thought “Well that’s just a walking mailman! Boring!”. These thoughts are based on your mental model on how this “walking” feels in other games where you just press “W” / “LS forward” to traverse any terrain with ease. Death Stranding takes the element of traversal and makes that the one of the core elements of the game: Being aware of how terrain around you, planning smart routes and using the right equipment to traverse the roughest areas of the game get quite addicting after a while. You got to keep your balance, use the tools that you can craft, like ladders, climbing ropes and more. Getting over every hill, mountain and river feels like an achievement!

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2640126860

Delivering is what you do in Death Stranding (and the only thing you for for 99% of the time)! If you expect a fast-paced action game, this is not the right game for you! There is some combat against the mules and the B.T.s, which is quite fun. Especially the Bola gun is enjoyable to use! You can also avoid most encounters with B.T.s (the black slime-thingies) by using the radar that is powered by your B.B. (that baby in the orange-juice glass).

The game takes its time to suck you into its world. Playing Death Stranding is more like an experience, than playing just a game: It feels therapeutic, meditative… Finishing each delivery is satisfying! That’s only the case, if you know that this is a [u]slow-paced[/u] game, that many people might classify as “tedious” for focusing on the traversal aspect! 

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787422892

[b][u]Feeling connected with other players[/u][/b]

The asynchronous multiplayer-elements are what makes the game very special in my eyes: While working on your deliveries and exploring the world, you gain the trust of certain people, which unlocks the ability to build structures in the area around the properties of these people to make your routes through the landscape easier. Basically, you connect knot after knot. Connecting the different knots, unlocks the ability to see the structures of other players like Ziplines, bridges or shelters and use them to your advantage and help others by upgrading them.

You can also see some of the routes others took, use the vehicles someone left, upgrade and repair structures or place signs that inform other players about upcoming dangers, restore stamina or mark enemy territories. You can also upvote all the things other people build, which gives them a notification. Kojima described the goal of the game as followed: [quote=Hideo Kojima]""After spending dozens of hours in the game you will come back to reality in the end. When you do, I want you to use what you learned in the game. Connecting is one of those things."" ([url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjUpYlKs0nM] Death Stranding: Inside Kojima Productions | Newsbeat Documentaries - YouTube [/url]) [/quote]The theme of “connection” plays a major role during gameplay and it feels so rewarding receiving all the positive feedback from all the players, so Kojima definitely hit the tooth with the drill there and made me feel less lonely for the time while playing the game!
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2650966924

All in all, I played Death Stranding for over 100h and completed all the achievements and do not regret it at all. The unique and deep story, the beautiful world and the innovative gameplay made it really special in my eyes! Death Stranding was a great escape from reality and sucked me into its world with ease!
Keep on Keeping on!

[b][u]Summary (TLDR)[/u][/b]

[*]A must-buy, if you are into slow-paced games! 
[*] If you expect a combat focused, fast-paced game, do not buy the game! This is not for you!

[h1]2. Upgrade Guide[/h1]

[quote]
The driectors cut adds some new helpful tools, vehicles and customization options, a few missions and other QoL-improvements giving you more ways to complete orders.
There is also a quite frustrating car-race-mode which seems a bit out of place, but it adds some nice new music-pieces!

Recommendations:
[olist]
[*][b]""I am half way through the original game.""[/b] → Be cautious! The save transfer will mess up your existing Zipline-Network´: The structures from other players in your world do not transfer and some of your structures don't transfer aswell, 
when the geometry of the landscape changed. It could be quite frustrating to rebuild some parts of your network!
[*][b]""I own the original game, but didn't start or play a lot yet (not over Chapter 7 yet)""[/b] → The upgrade would enhance your existing experience. That's the case where the upgrade adds the most value!
[*][b]""I already finished the original game once and plan to replay it""[/b] → Same case as the one above!
[*][b]""I already finished the original game once and don't plan to replay it"" [/b]→ Only worth it if you are an achievement hunter! All achievements transfer, just not the ones that require to craft the new stuff!

Overall, Death Stranding is a very solid game, it has a few flaws here and there but it holds up fairly well in my experience so far. It certainly isn't a game for everyone, and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone just like I wouldn't recommend an FPS to someone who only plays MMOs and JRPGs. Realistically, this probably isn't the game for you if you want fast-paced or exciting action. It has its moments, but for the most part that's just not what Death Stranding is about. However if you're the kind of person who can enjoy a game by getting immersed in its story, lore/world-building, and interpersonal interactions, then Death Stranding may very well be something you'll enjoy as I believe Kojima really knocked it out of the park on all fronts there. The game also does a really good job at building up the idea that we help each other, as things that you leave behind can be used by other players to help them, and vice-versa. It fits the world and narrative very well, and really contributes to my enjoyment of the game.

As for shortcomings, I just have a couple really. For one, the map could be a bit more expansive, roads can quickly become the quickest and easiest way to get from point A to point B, and driving a vehicle on a road takes away from the charm of the game and its primary gameplay aspects, being charting new paths through rough terrain or finding paths others have taken and using the gear they left behind. This ties into my second complaint, being that there are too many road pavers. At one point there are *four* within 500m of each other and it's a bit ridiculous. There should have been fewer pavers that just costed more to make it a bit less tedious. Finally, the threats in the game like MULEs and BTs being a bit more dynamic rather than staying in their relatively static areas would've been nice. This only further contributes to the issues with the roads as they quickly become the safest way to get from A to B as well. None of these issues are really that problematic for me, but I do think doing things a bit differently would've made the game more enjoyable.",1668891073,1668891073,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

First let's start with the minor annoyances.  SO MANY wasted seconds!  Every time I deposit something there's a 3 second cut scene ""Thank you for bla bla"".  Every time the protagonist showers there are 4 (FOUR) cutscenes of him showering.  In a row.  I just have to hit ""skip"" 4 times.  Most times the protagonist interacts with a terminal he does 1 thing then the terminal kicks him out.  Then there's ANOTHER 3 second scene where he logs in again.  Any time the protagonist interacts with a terminal he has to do like 6 things, so we have to watch this cutscene 6 times.  Why not just keep us in the terminal to do all the things?  

These minor annoyances add up, but they're all in service to something greater right?  That's usually the plot, though in some games it can be character development or exploring the world or other things.  In this game it's all for nothing.  The plot is basically nonexistent: ""Get package from here, deliver to there.""  

The highest praise that can be lavished on this game is ""beautiful walking simulator.""  It's true, it is beautiful.  Unfortunately the landscape is all the same so we've seen pretty much all the beauty in the first 20 minutes.  

I strongly recommend everyone play this game for about 20 minutes, then return it.  That's it.  You've seen the whole game.  It's beautiful to look at for 20 minutes, then you're done.  I've put over 40 hours into this game and I assure you, you won't miss anything by doing it that way.",1668784838,1668784838,False,1,0,0.454545438289642334,0,True,False,False

My heart has been aching for a game like this for a long time; in a way, it's like a return to the 1997 PlayStation One game Metal Gear Solid, another Hideo Kojima masterpiece. There's a lot of lore in the form of in-game interviews to absorb as well as social and psychological concepts to wrap your mind around during gameplay. Hideo Kojima is an absolute master at making a story that just draws the player in and makes them really think and explore concepts they may have never even considered. like, for example, trading and its importance. Trade is what really makes the world go around (as everyone learned during the pandemic), and without it, the country would come to a complete standstill.

The concept trading might seem like something that is obvious to any normal person, but it's not something most people even think about during their normal everyday lives. The regular person just takes it for granted and keeps on moving unless, of course, something goes wrong. So when the player is forced to play as the truck driver and get packages to places on time and in good condition, it makes them really consider the challenges those people face during the course of their daily work routines. Hideo Kojima accomplishes this by increasing the player's investment in their role by making them the truck driver within the larger overall story arc and in the story as a whole. 

Consider another gaming concept or type: the looter shooter. Most of these games now allow players to kill NPCs and other players with little to no repercussions, even rewarding them with kill streaks and bonus skills or points. That's not this game at all and killing people in this game is frowned upon and is not something the player is rewarded for, like in most of Hideo Kojima's games. He doesn't reward you for taking the easy route and just killing people. It should always be the last option, and if the player does kill someone, I don't want to spoil too much, so let's just say that killing enemies will cause more problems than it will ever solve. I, personally, love games that make the player think outside the box like this, and it makes the experience so much more fulfilling than just trying to get a high kill streak. Don't get me wrong, those games are fun too, but they can't hold a candle to a game that really makes the player engage in the game play and story.

The main complaint I've seen on internet forums and in Steam reviews about this game is that it's just a walking simulator. Gamers these days are just too used to instant gratification, which is the concept of receiving an immediate reward for a specific task that is supposed to take some time. If you are the kind of person who cannot wait 10–30 minutes or even ""3 minutes,"" as you are required to do once in the game, then this just isn't for you. However, if you enjoy figuring out complex, deep-lore-based stories while also taking breaks between them to deliver packages and unite the fractured people of America, there are also interesting boss fights that will be thrown into the mix too. Then this game is for you. 

The package delivery part of the game is not boring either; it's really a challenge to deliver the packages across the various landscapes that are filled with BTs (beached things), mules, terrorists, and pockets of time-fall storms. These can tax the player greatly, and just when you think you've got it figured out, WHAM! Hideo Kojima layers another roadblock or concept to add to the game play to make it more challenging.

I'll put it another way: if you played Metal Gear Solid, like I did in the late 90s and early 2000s, and enjoyed the chats with the NPCs over the codec as much as the game play itself, you'll love this game.

It may not be everyone's cup of tea as it generally involves a lot of walking around large open areas for a fair amount of time, at least in the beginning before you start to unlock vehicles, but there's just something so immensely satisfying about fulfilling several deliveries at once to a prepper or a distro center as well as being able to in-directly help other players with various structures and objects you can place out in the world.
I really love the world building too, especially with how many of the characters Sam meets manage to retain a hopeful spirit despite the world having gone through a massive apocalyptic event and how they, along with other players leaving signs, cheer you on to not give up in your journey to reconnect the world.

-Online structure/cargo/gear sharing is a cool feature
-Various ways to handle each delivery mission
-Dynamic world encounters/weathers
-The supernatural stuffs are great 
-Various easter eggs
-Solid combat but nothing special

Bads:
-Slow paced story. The game being open world kinda messes up the narrative flow.
-Characters aren't as memorable as MGS characters. I honestly feel only [spoiler]Unger's[/spoiler] character is the most fleshed out in the entire game 
-Vehicle controls feels kinda weird in certain situations
-Lack of enemy and boss variety 
-UI is kinda messy, especially in inventory/cargo page

Overall a great game, but it certainly lacks the charm that MGS had. I think having the characters mimicking real life actors kinda limits the interaction creativity that previous Kojima games had.

Combat is not far removed from Metal Gear's and the number of weapons and tools available for combat makes for fun and creative knockouts. I felt a real sense of accomplishment when I completed my first road loop that covers the map.

Director's Cut: I enjoy the new unarmed combat like the tackle and dropkick. Couple that with the rope and unarmed combat has become more versatile.

The heart of most open-world games is the going from one point to another delivering various things, sometimes picking them up from other enemies, sometimes getting them from quest givers, and Kojima has stripped away all pretense by just making the character a literal Instacart driver. The challenge of the game sometimes is just staying upright while walking with a million pounds on your back, but as you find more things and upgrade your kit you get to feel the joy of freer movement and bypassing things that you once had to struggle through. 

The story is buckwild. I won't spoil anything as it should be experienced. Buckle up for some anime af set pieces.

The game is 10/10 for me, there are some flaws like side missions, possibly UI design,
but i can get over all that. The issue that lies is that this version of the game runs noticeably worse than the original version for whatever reason.

I'm running an R5 3600, 16GB @3600 & a 3060.
Pulling out ladders randomly locks the framerate at 45,
and scanning with the Odradek drops the framerate to 50.
Apparently this is specifically an issue with Nvidia cards, but I'm not sure how accurate that is.
I tested this on my friend's rig as well, same exact issue on a 1660,
we both even lowered the graphics to minimum.
Per the recommended specs, we're both above them.

On top of all that, this port has VERY poor anisotropic filtering,
despite what Digital Foundry have said. This can be alleviated by forcing it
via GPU control panel. It looks a lot better better.
This game also exhibits lots of shimmering, and i wasn't very impressed with DLSS.
Intel however? GREAT job with the new XESS technology, it alleviates a lot of issues
i previously had with the PC visuals as far as aliasing & shimmering goes.

Despite all this, i can absolutely get over it & enjoy the game & additional content from the PS5 version at a locked 30, no problem, but that doesn't mean i should have to put up with it.

Often you'll find that the truck, once you get it, will decide to turn on its own in a random direction when going uphill, will get stuck on terrain, or will sometimes just drive in a direction of its own accord. I literally had points where I'd remove my hands from the keyboard to discover exactly where the truck was trying to go but sadly it seemed focused on walls or large rocks rather than anything of interest. 

This, however, doesn't ruin the game by any means - simply adds minor frustration to the process of getting from A to B. 

The music is fantastic. All the tracks fit the game perfectly. Again, a minor issue with this is that the tracks get interrupted by the game world which is a little disappointing. Many times a song from Low Roar will kick in only to be stopped less than a minute later by BT's.

Even as someone who doesn't read into lore too much and gets easily confused by complicated plot, I was compelled by the characters and sympathized with Mads Mikkelson's character as his story developed. Sure the cutscenes are lengthy and sometimes a little sluggish, they are rewarding after hours of playtime. And that's one of my favorite things, its the play style of the game that fits me perfectly. When I play a game, I don't always want a sweaty, swamp-ass-chair-staining experience that takes mental endurance and practice to be good at, this is a game to put some music too and let your mind go. That is one of the biggest turn offs to most people, but trust the process and stick with it, especially as the more tedious things like balance get replaced with cooler and more exciting gameplay mechanics. At the end of the day, I have played through this game 3 times and intend to come back for more play throughs since the world of Death Stranding is so wide and has expanded each time I come back to it, whether it was free DLC or just reading a lore log for fun while in a safe room.
