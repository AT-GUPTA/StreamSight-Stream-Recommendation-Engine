The game has improved considerably and demonstrates many 'labors of love' so to speak. If you enjoy Left 4 Dead 2 style games, you may enjoy this.

Buggy, limited content, awful community that kicks people out of games at the end of the campaign for no reason (with nothing you can do about it), and collector's edition isn't worth purchasing. I loved vermintide 1, but vermintide 2 is in an awful state right now.

Let me be clear. If you have a dedicated 4 man team of people who can switch characters easily, this game will be fun, else the community will be anger inducing.

Then, to boot, I spent $45 on this game, and yet I'm expected to pay $10 more for late, buggy, half assed dlc?? I bought the Collector's Edition with the INTENT to have all DLC as it arose, because I loved VT1 SO MUCH that I didn't want to miss out on any dlc. But no. All I got from that extra $16 dollars was some cheap cosmetics and some DLC for VT1, which wasn't even explained in the pkg.

For anyone who didn't play that game Vermintide is a hack-and-slash Left 4 Dead style of game, however it didn't have too much going for it. There weren't many levels to play, and the biggest issue in my eyes was that there really wasn't much reason to keep playing after you beat all the levels. Sure there are those who enjoy the challenge of beating the harder difficulties, but it's not for everyone, especially when the game is, frankly, pretty boring without friends. 

However, some of these issues are fixed in Vermintide 2. The improved item system adds a lot of replability as item rewards are less RNG dependent this time around, and you will always have item progression if you keep playing, completing quests, and earning yourself more item chests. This kept me in the game for awhile, far longer than I played the original, however it still got extremely boring after awhile, because at the end of the day you are playing the games few maps over and over again. There was 13 levels and almost any of them can be beaten in 20 minutes or less if you've experienced the level before. Therefore, even with harder difficulties as a challenge I ended up beating every level on the harder difficulties multiple times and it became way too much.

On the bright side, not everyone will have this issue. I have friends who love grinding the same levels to earn better gear. Another reason for grinding these levels is to rank-up your characters. Something that hurt my longevity with the game was that I really only found 1 character to be entertaining to play; however, there are 5 different characters, each with multiple class types, and 1 of them is sure to strike a chord with you. In fact, you may even enjoy multiple, and in that case you'll probably really love the game!

I had fun with the game when I first played through it, and even continued to enjoy just playing on the hardest difficulties while I leveled my shade to 35, but once I hit that point it was over for me. Playing the same maps over and over again can only work for a certain period of time, and if they really want players to keep playing past this point they should try to create a better daily quest/reward system, as well as better item rewards and specific challenges; after all, it's a PvE game so nobody cares if you can complete daily challenges to get strong loot.

The core gameplay here is pretty strong, it feels great mowing through giant packs of rats, and using your special ability feels dope. The enemy classes are pretty unique and some are real challenges that require a coordinated group effort to take down. Gameplay is certainly where this game shines the most; it's the systems around it and the lack of real incentives that are its weakest characteristics.

Lastly, I would highly recommend playing with friends if you're looking to pick this one up. Straight-up, this game will be boring by yourself, and even with 2 players you probably won't have the ideal experience. I'd recommend playing with a group of 3-4 and allow yourself to get a feel for each character before choosing which to primarily play, maybe even have your whole group take turns to keep it fresh.

To Fatshark, I would say great job. Yes I have some gripes, but I ended up playing the game for about 25 hours and that says a lot. My only suggestions would be to have more levels in future games, try to improve the item system, maybe even allow item trading, and give more of an incentive to keep playing the game following completion of the campaign; increasing item power and leveling heroes is certainly an incentive, but not one that will keep the casual player murdering rats any longer than they need to. This could even be done with a more interesting achievement list as the current one is full of tasks that are extremely easy or unbearably grindy with no in-between.

The sword swings all feel very realistic, especially the crits. It felt like someone in reality had just gained a burst of energy, and the swing in it shows that.

Or say if I am jumping down from a cliff and head shotting a subject, and if aim is good then it should reflect in some ways.

Also, timed blocks or parry should incur a higher crit percentage, just for the return shot.

The recent updates have changed the game-play and taken out the joy of playing the classes. Not sure why FS did this, other than to try and develop a PVP option. This game used to be really fun until FS started to change beloved classes and really nerf their weapons and skills. 
I suspect their developers do not have much experience in the game-play based on their idea of ""balance"". 

Was super fun. Now uninstalled. Got burned buying DarkTide early access with their half-baked release. And now, got burned by half-baked ""hot fixes"" to fix things that were never broke. The game mechanics are no longer what I enjoy as the result of the balancing making the classes strengths and weaknesses no longer as unique. Bland.

You can't go wrong with this game. It is still getting updates from the developers, and it's been out for quite a while. If you like 4 player co-op games you'll love this game.  

The largest problem is starting the game. The first few difficulties can be a slog, and the real fun doesn't start until champion. Open your commendation chests, and any other chests up until champion emperor chests as soon as you get them. Your item power increases from opening them, and saving them just slows your growth and ability to get to higher difficulties quickly, and get better chances for red items. 

There are currently three modes and, but only two are available without buying an additional dlc.  The ones that come with the base game are normal co-op campaigns, and the chaos wastes. The normal co-op campaigns each take about 30 minutes to finish. You will find 3 Tomes and 2 Grimoires hidden in each of these maps and getting them to the end will provide you with more xp, and better reward chests. Picking up a tome will take your med slot. you can drop them and heal if you find a med just remember to pick them up again. Grimoires reduce the teams health bars by about 31% and cannot be swapped out like a tome. You will also lose them if you get completely killed. They can be thrown if you get in a sticky spot and need more of your health bars back by equipping them and then long holding attack.  

Chaos wastes is a roguelite version of the game. There are no books in this mode, and completing one takes a little over an hour. However, you will probably get 3 of the highest tier chests for the difficulty you attempt if you make it through to the end. 2 will be highest for sure, but the third depends on maps completed and coins retrieved. You start with just the talents you've earned and white versions of the weapons you start with. You will find blue coins scattered across the maps that will let you purchase weapon upgrades, weapon exchanges, and boons. You can get some pretty crazy builds in this mode and it's a lot of fun. 

The third DLC mode, is not played much by the community and usually is looked down upon. It is only available through the purchase of the Winds of Magic DLC. It has a few unique modifiers like lightning strikes, harder armored enemies, and thorny briars spawning where you kill enemies. they can be fun but you'll probably want to have a group ready to attempt finishing those as the difficulty becomes extremely high. 

They are working on a versus mode. As of the writing of this, only an Alpha has been released. I was not able to play that and do not have any information on that mode. If you like Versus modes, like that in left 4 dead 2, that might be a bonus coming for you.

If you are a streamer, there is another sub mode that allows your viewers to vote on hazards and boons that they want to have happen in your game. It is very easy to use. At the map, just click on the twitch button and enter your twitch name. Just make sure you are host or your host has it turned on too. If a few of you are streaming, as long as the host has it on, if everyone streaming starts twitch mode the chats from each of the streamers will be able to participate in the voting of what happens. The frequency of votes and the speed in which they finish can be adjusted in your option settings. 

A few things that may help you starting out...
In the game settings there are quite a few things that are not turned on by default that can help. If you don't want the game to recommend a different hero, you can go into the network settings and tell the game not to recommend other heroes. If you are having trouble keeping track of team members, you can go into the settings and set hero outlines from ""on"" to ""always on."" If you would like to have actual numbers on your hud, you can turn on the numerical display. Also, the game has a stamina mechanic. holding block will show you your stamina in the form of shield icons. a normal hit from a normal rat can be blocked for half a shield if you are blocking it from the front in your effective block angle, but you will also block outside of that angle and block behind you as well, it just would cost a full stamina shield  to block outside of that effective front angle. Each weapon has a different cone shape for what costs half stamina to block in front of you. if you hover over the melee weapons it will show that cone in the top right corner of the box that appears. You can also push using stamina. this will cost a full stamina shield to do.  To push, hold block and tap attack. If you want to deal some damage when pushing, instead of just tapping attack while blocking, long hold your push and you will follow up the push with a melee attack. get used to dodging and blocking as they will become very necessary in the higher difficulties. 

The players in this game are usually great to work with. There will be a few bad apples. but try to be friendly and don't hog all of the supplies, and most people will be great to play with. Another small annoyance is if a host leaves, it will end your game in normal co-op campaigns. In chaos wastes it will just kick back to the start of the map you've been playing. if you do get disconnected from a game in the CHAOS WASTES, if you are quick and get back into the same game with the same character with the players you were playing with, all your boons and coins, will be restored to you upon rejoining.

This game is truly one of it's kind. In this game you can experience the authentic Warhammer world with 4 player co-op. The maps are visually beautiful and the music fits in the gameplay. In the game you can play as different heroes and choose from multiple careers and decide what fits you the best. The the combat system is super satisfying. There are bunch of weapon options for each hero and all of them has their own unique and badass mechanism to sweep, stagger and block enemies. The more I play this game the more I feel there is stuff to learn. You can also play on different difficulties. Especially the hardest difficulty is [u]very challenging[/u] and demands the players to focus like never before. Only ""downside"" in this game is that there are too many in game micro-transactions in my opinion. However it's up to you if you want to buy new maps and careers.

I've played few games that deliver such an incredible vibe and atmosphere coupled with good gameplay. The maps are really well done and the music compliments them so well. The conversations/banter between the characters is what brings the game alive though. Their conversations between each other still manage to make me laugh and it never feels like I'm listening to a conversation I've heard before. Sure, maybe it happens, but the fact that there are so many different things they say, it never feels that way. They really put work into that and it allows the game to always feel fresh, even when you're playing a map you've played a lot of times before.

[h1] The Maps [/h1]
They are really well done and all of them are detailed and have thought put into them.
There are a lot of maps and with the DLCs the pool becomes even bigger. Not to mention, you don't even need the map DLCs in order to play the maps, if the person hosting the game, has the DLCs, it will draw from their map pool, which is amazing. Buying the map DLCs unlocks other things like quests, weapons, cosmetics. 

[h1] Music and Sound [/h1]
The music and sound in this game add so much to the atmosphere. Nothing bad to say, the music is wonderful. Each special enemy has a distinct sound (kinda like in L4D), so you know they are around somewhere and you wanna make sure to kill them as quickly as possible. Those moments are especially exciting when you are fighting against hordes of enemies and you hear a special and you juggle between fighting the hordes and trying to look out for the special. 

[h1] Visuals [/h1]
I don't think I have to say anything about the visuals, they speak for themselves. If you have a solid GPU and can play on high settings, the game is really beautiful. Playing this on a 3440x1440 monitor with a 2070Super and oh boy, is it a joy to play.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
The combat is simply 10/10. When you play for the first time, you will most likely only spam left click attack and wonder why some enemies wont take any damage from your mindless left clicking, ''what is this stupid Armor sign'' you will say.
The fun of the game comes from the harder difficulties though, as the mindless left click gameplay doesn't cut it anymore. Blocking, dodging, heavy attacks will be an important part of your rotation. You will learn how every weapon plays differently, has different attributes and has a different job, some have wide sweeps for cutting down hordes, some have armor piercing, some do higher headshot damage for those precise players etc etc etc.
For me the game became way more fun once I was playing Champion, as I had to actually turn on my brain and nowadays only Legend cuts it for me. If you find a main and level that character up and get some legendaries, switch to Champion and eventually to Legend once you're really comfortable and have good gear.

After each round you get a loot chest. Higher Difficulty = Higher value chest. What I like about this system is that 1. It incentivizes striving for higher difficulties and 2. Collecting the Tomes and Grimores throughout the map makes the run even more difficult, but the chest you get at the end levels up. Carrying a tome for example takes up a Healing pot slot and Grimores take up a buff potion slot AND give you a curse that reduces your HP.

There are 5 different characters with each having 3 (some 4) different classes, so there is a lot of variety in that. They all have different talent trees, passives and playstyles. Although usually the better talent rows unlock at higher levels.

So yea, pretty sweet game.

PS: Unfortunately the Vermintide 2 community consists of a bunch of cheapskates who will cry about cheap DLC, because they are spoiled. The base game is already super cheap on a sale and offers so much content. The map DLCs have between 2 - 3 new maps each. The reviews of the DLCs are filled with cheap babies crying about how a DLC that cost 10 (5 on a sale) bucks, only has 2 maps (and extras btw, like weapons, cosmetics, quests etc). Truly mindblowing how people can complain to spend a bit of money after they put a ton of hours into the base game. The class DLC reviews are even worse. The devs decided to split the DLC into class + weapons DLC and a class + weapons + cosmetics DLC, in order to allow people with less money to buy the class + weapons only. 
But then of course you have people crying over the fact that the cosmetics aren't included. They expect a new class, new weapons and cosmetics for that class for 4 bucks. Those people blow my mind. Not to mention, the others who complain that once you buy the cosmetics pack, it unlocks the quests to get those cosmetics and some people complain about that?? I for one, prefer that not everybody is walking around wit those cosmetics and you have to do quests to get them.

People nowadays spend so much money on 1 skin in a stupid game and yet complain about 5 - 10 bucks for map DLCs and then go crying on the internet about ''gaming nowadays is screwed, there are skins everywhere and not enough traditional DLC'' but when a dev brings out ''traditional DLC'' that takes more time to make, they want that DLC to be cheaper than a skin and give a negative review.

some downsides however: beastmen. they're not fun. at all. a good word for them is 'over-tuned'.
the levelling process is slow and arduous, the crafting system isn't very good or user-friendly, and i'm not a fan of how hard fatshark are focusing on microtransactions and the game shop, but that's more of a problem with fatshark as a company than the game itself, so take it as you will.

I know, I know not everyone is like this, but coming from so many other multiplayer games I almost NEVER hear or see anyone use it in games and it makes me believe this game attracts a... certain breed of player I personally don't like or want to be around.

The game is set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe during the early days of the End Times. The game follows the Heroes of Ubersreik from the first game against the Skaven hordes of Clan Fester and their new allies, the Root Bloods (a Chaos Warband dedicated to Nurgle, the Chaos God of Disease and Decay). The only thing standing between utter defeat and victory is you and your allies. If you fall - so too will the Empire.

    [tr]
        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]With huge attention to detail that gives each map a dark, and crueling atmosphere, Vermintide 2 brings in a dark look into a world filled with chaos and destruction. The lighting looks pretty good, even though in some sections it can look kinda dull. It’s not a common issue, so not a big problem. The UI fits the game so well. It gives off this dark fantasy look that I really appreciate, also the UI is easy to understand and not painful to the eyes. The weapon and armor models look absolutely stellar, even the enemies look terrifying and intimidating. They did the enemy design so well for the Chaos. I’m just really pleased with the art style this game provides. It’s so well done![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]This game gives me a huge Left 4 Dead feel (and some may not like that comparison), but I actually enjoyed it a ton! It fit the game perfectly and I’m so happy they went with this gameplay style. Melee combat is simple, but really effective and fun. Fight many hordes while reaching the end of the level and fight a boss near or at the end. It’s all really fun and feels rewarding once completing a level. You can dodge attacks which feel satisfying to pull off, and the gore is top notch, making the melee combat that much more intense. You have up to 5 characters to play as, and each character has 3 skill trees (or careers they call it). Every character has a special ability, and you also have light and strong attacks, making the combat fun and it doesn’t feel like you are spamming attacks aimlessly. The gameplay feels fresh and addicting, and playing on a harder difficulty requires good teammates and strategy. The bots are pretty okay I guess, sadly the bots don’t scale with you. That means that if you only play with one character and decide to play a higher difficulty, the other bots won’t scale to your level, so I recommend playing with friends or go find a match publicly.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎭Multiplayer[/td]
        [td]In my opinion this is where the game shines. I highly recommend playing co-op in this game more than single player. Playing with friends in this game is so fun and addicting! Going through the map on a harder difficulty with a strong character build felt so rewarding and intense. This is how you play the game. I had no desync issues, no connection issues at all. Everything felt polished in terms of multiplayer.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]With many cool levels and character builds, you will add many hours into Vermintide 2! With many character builds to create, and difficulties to challenge yourself with friends, this game can provide an easy 40+ hours of playtime no question.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is really good. The voice acting is superb and fits the characters perfectly, and the Chaos and Skaven sound scary as well! The weapon sounds incredible, especially when you hit your enemy, it has a satisfying feeling to it![/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]I haven’t really come across any game breaking issues. Only some minor bugs but nothing too serious to bring up. The multiplayer even felt fine with no issues or crashing issues.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Now for some reason, my PC has had some serious problems here. I can’t get a good framerate on my GTX 1070 which was super annoying. This just may be my end. But when a horde comes in I get around 40 fps even on low settings. I have watched videos with similar specs and they have had no issues. I’m not sure if it’s my graphics card, because I’m able to play many new games just fine on high settings. This just may be a me issue, but I thought I might point that out. You should be okay, but just keep this issue in mind. Besides that I have had no stutters or crashes, so it could just be my computer.[/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is an absolute blast! From the intense action, the intimidating enemies, and awesome characters you can play as. The combat is truly addicting, with many action packed sections in every level. The game can get grindy, and the bots feel kinda useless in some situations. With a few friends this game will provide you with so many awesome moments and with many hours of playtime! Give this game a try if you are looking for a fantasy style action game with friends, it’s a must buy if that’s on the shopping list.[/td]

A perfect game with friends or just to kill an hour or two on your own.  I still have yet to find a game that does melee combat so well, I suppose technically Darktide does it too but I don't have much positive to say about Darktide.

Vermintide 2 is now over 5 years old, and though the playerbase is small, it is very dedicated. The content dripfeed has more-or-less dried up, but if you don't mind playing missions multiple times over, you can spend a lot of time in this game.  You really do stick around for the game's character though.  The banter between the heroes is fun and provides a mixture of comic relief, lore and character building, and tossing aside scores of skaven with each swipe of your weapon still feels great over 5 years after the initial release.

Not really much else to say.  It plays well, it runs well, the audio is great, the visuals have generally aged quite well.",1706421005,1706421005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]COOLS:[/b]
+ Perfect for beginners to jump into, it's what I did!
+ Game artstyle, theme and overall execution is absolutely fantastic and represents the Warhammer world and all it's nastiness perfectly. As a newcomer to the franchise it really engrossed me.
+ The 5 playable characters (each with 4 different classes!) are all fleshed-out, dialogue and gameplay-wise. Hearing the group banter on is half the fun. [b]Voice acting is superb.[/b]
+ [b]Combat[/b] is simple but has a lot of nuance, especially on higher difficulties. Enemy variety and design is great,  Mowing down scores of swarming rats out for your blood is thrilling and satisfying.
+ Playing together is encouraged and more fun but people often fail to mention it works just fine as a solo-player experience as well! 
+ Plenty of challenge to be had with lots of maps and difficulty options with an interesting rewards system: Find tomes during a mission that take up one of your equipment slots, the more tomes the riskier it gets but the rewards increase just the same!
+ Graphics are great. Sound design is great. Controls are straightforward and easily customizable.
+ Matchmaking is quick and the playerbase still seems plenty active! The many memes and funny fan-content is just icing on top.
+ [b]Is still being updated at the time of writing this review.[/b] Active devs who communicate with their fanbase! Great to see!
+ [b]HOLY SIGMAR APPROVES[/b]

[b]NOT-SO-COOLS:[/b]
-YMMV, joining other players through matchmaking might find you alone and confused as the party is used to rushing for loot and don't take new players into consideration.
-If you've played a while you will notice that characters repeat some lines a lot, which can get grating and breaks immersion.
-Failing a mission at any point means NO REWARDS aside from a bit of measly XP, which can feel real rough when you go down right before the end.  This harsh punishment is also part of the draw though, making failure weigh heavily means victory through hardship is all the sweeter.
-Weapon descriptions and traits are vague at best, It's really up to the player to try everything out to see how they all function in action.
-Blightstormers are camping wallhackers plz ban Fatshark :(

And that's it really. I don't have much critique aside from minor gripes about gameplay. I hear at release the game was SUPER buggy but that's all been fixed through time. The DLC's and in-game content are a bit pricey but never a must, so you can wait on sales. A bit tough to find your ground but if you spend some time with each character I can guarantee you'll find one that suits you like a glove! 

So if you've got some time to spare and feel like you could increase your heartrate with some massive plague rodent slaughter, this is definitely a recommendation!

Real Review:
This game scratches the itch for a horde clearing melee game. The game has a lot of different play styles that typically translates between different classes. If you want to play Left4Dead but don't really feel like relying too much on shooting guns, this is the game for you.

The pros:
- Amazing voice acting
- Cool character skins
- Beautiful maps (especially the newest maps)
- Twitch mode (fun to watch and vote)
- solo mode

Vermintide 2 has a great community and I've made good friends who I met playing this game. 
Vermintide 2 is always fun , there is a main character or two to suit everyone (Saltzpyre and Bardin are mine) , there are plenty of varied levels , DLC packs, different game modes and five difficulty levels to choose from. Personally, I love the Chaos Wastes .
I love the music also with Escape and Panic being played on repeat on my Spotify whenever I exercise 👀🏃‍♀️😎 Dialogue is fun and witty . ""Your aim is as crooked as your morals, Witch!""

There were a small number of nerfs to severely over performing items, characters, and abilities. With buffs to under performing  items, characters, and abilities.
A small subset of people think that PVE games should never be balanced and that you should just buff everything until the game is completely trivialized. They are now complaining endlessly about how the game is dead and that everything is ruined and there are no good weapons and blah blah blah. In reality the games playerbase doubled overnight because of a small balance patch that has been long overdue and long awaited.
 
Most of the complainers? Elves.. again... because javelin got the tiniest of nerf to be less spammable and braindead.

The other class mains took their nerfs like champs and in some cases (chad Kruber mains) didnt say a word about their nerfs and in other cases (chad bardin mains) have flat called his buffs unnecessary and in need of reverting.

The inevitable clowns on the review will be from angry forum dwellers stalking everything I have public in a vain attempt to discredit me because I DARED to disagree with them about their precious javelin. See previous SotT review for more context.

I would also like to add that all this whinging and complaining amounted to literally less than 150 negative reviews in the last 30 days.
Dont worry though guys, they arent the vocal minority.

Normal review:
Vermintide 2 is a great game that you can easily sink waaay too many hours into. The core gameplay is unbeatable, never found another game that does it as good or in quite the same way. The combat is so satisfying and weighty. The graphics are very good looking. It feels very rewarding to get better at the game and move up through the difficulty levels. Its also fairly challenging for those who want it but if you just want to enjoy the gameplay it has appropriate lower levels of difficulty. 

The DLC is fairly good as well, with the exception being Winds of Magic. The Devs have had a bit of a rocky road to getting this game going but they are trying and doing a pretty darn good job now. They are very active in the forums to help with technical problems and bug reports. They do a pretty decent job of bugfixing although it may be rather slow at times.

The community is mostly nice and welcoming. More experienced players are usually willing to help or answer questions. In my about 2600 hours I have had maybe 10 games with trolls, arsehats, or other less than desirable people. Not bad for that amount of time.

All and all give it a whirl. For 30 bucks its very well worth the money, and its frequently on sale for as low as 7.99 which is practically stealing. Very good value for money, very good game, you wont have played another like it.",1533598751,1705161882,True,8,0,0.534606456756591797,0,True,False,False

To explain what that means and why this game is so good, there are a few things to understand:
The battles feel epic to overcome as there are four heroes versus hundreds or thousands of enemies, and every enemy is capable of representing a real threat. Movement and attacks have real weight and momentum. The melee mechanics the player has control over include dodging, blocking, pushing, heavy attacks, and light attacks. While these are common elements in many action games, they have a far greater depth in this game than most. [b] It truly is a dance, and when you find the rhythm against a giant horde of enemies you feel unstoppable. [/b] The game also has FPS mechanics which heavily reward aim for headshots. Quickswapping to your ranged weapon and flick headshotting a special enemy (dangerous unique enemies) while also managing a horde full of trash rats and elites who are attempting to cut you apart is an amazing feeling.

To begin with: at higher difficulties, every single attack or movement option you make must be intentional. A misplaced attack, push, or dodge could result in an instant down on your character. Elite enemies in this game have powerful attacks, and will often surround and gang up on you. Tracking the movements and attacks of elites in chaotic situations and successfully countering them feels like a true desperate battle.

To control these enemies, you have many options which allows diverse and expressive play styles. Walking through the mechanics available to the player:

Dodging. The most important mechanic for evading damage. It requires timing as dodges are somewhat limited and dodging [b] into [/b] an attack can be very common. It is the preferred method for countering the attacks thrown at you by elites, and when mastered allows you to [b] cut down an entire horde of enemies while dancing around in their face. [/b] You can usually dodge about every second or so and not worry about running out of dodges.

Blocking. A useful tool for stopping incoming attacks, and is also limited by stamina. Some attacks from enemies can take your entire stamina out at once and guard break you. You can also time your block to exactly when an attack lands for a parry. Combining dodging and blocking alone makes a powerful and deep defensive toolkit.

Attacks. There are heavy attacks, light attacks, alt fire attacks, and dozens of unique weapons with unique attacks and combos to learn. You could spend dozens of hours learning a single weapon. Apparently some weapons have novel length guides (I'm looking at you billhook) written about them. Every combo has its place, and the weapons have unique categories they fall into such as mixed horde control (elites and trash), elite slaying, trash slaying, boss slaying.

Did I mention this game has bosses? It has several, all of which you can learn to solo. Furthermore, if the team misplays their pacing through the map, or sometimes even when they play it correctly, you can end up fighting ultra powerful boss enemies which require the full focus of at least one hero to manage. Combine this with a full wave of enemies and specials, and you have incredible and difficult battles. Overcoming horrible situations in this game feels truly special.

Anyway, this game is really good",1704844925,1704845110,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I thought to refund it while playing the first prolog mission because that one was really horrible made but If you play a few hours and play some missions you might like this type of co-op game so its not an easy start to get into this game.

You only need to buy these items to enjoy the game (I would recommend to wait for a steam sale):
1. Vermintide 2: Starter Bundle: It has the base game + mission DLCs
2. Necromancer carrer DLC: Its a great new class to play with
3. War Priest DLC: Its a great new class to play with

The start into this game is a bit of a grind and your class will most likely feel a bit weak. Your class starts with level 1 and you unlock the last talent on level 30. Thats not a big deal for your first class because you wanna play all those missions and maps anyways. But it can be boring to grind all those levels and talents for your 3rd, 4th and 5th class because at that point you might want to play hardmode. So its kinda boring to unlock all classes for late game. You better try out which class is in your favor and maybe stick to 1 or 2. This games has a lot of weapons. Try them out while leveling your class up. Some are really cool and strong, others could feel weak and useless. Each class has different weapons, only some are standard for multiple classes.

Its a loot game. You get 3 items after each mission if you completed it, failure will give you class XP but no items at all.

Very fun combat system, everything from slashing enemies with swords to burning skaven alive with fire magic feels great.
Successfully using mechanics like blocking and pushing feels rewarding and is basically necessary for higher difficulty play.
A varied and atmospheric collection of maps, great for replay value. Also, the OST is pretty awesome.

Not a big fan of the weapon acquisition loop, since you will constantly find newer, higher value weapons after just a couple missions, and the old gear will just sit there waiting to be broken down into crafting materials from the get go.
Plus the whole inventory crafting system and similar features feel like a chore more than anything.

A big issue I've found is that random players with a MUCH higher level may join your game and completely delete everything they see, which takes the fun out of the game since they'll feel very overpowered in comparison to a new player. Even the difference between a 4 lvl and a 17 lvl is extreme. But that hasn't been too much of a problem so far.

And when that doesn't happen, you've got yourself an absolute Gem of a Co-op Hack n Slasher.
I'm really glad Warhammer Fantasy has games such as Vermintide 2, it makes the setting that much more immersive.

Overall 9/10, may Sigmar bless this verbose Review. 🌠🔥⚡

Only issue, you can't create your character and have to instead base off of which ever class you want and abilities that class will have.

The game have had its issues over the years most of which in my opinion have been resolved at this state.
they changed the marketing strategy from paid dlc to content being free and releasing paid dlc skins 
which is good for new players since it means a lot more content for them.
They added chaos wastes mode which is a great 2-3 hour mode where you go through several maps with other players and progressively get stronger get better weapons and perks as you go quite a large addition about the size of the campaign. 
They are in the making of a versus mode which i suspect is going to be a lot like the one in left for dead which basically is where this game got its core gameplay from the way it plays is very similar apart from the added rpg mechanics like levels and loot which in my opinion is honestly also where the game runs into its biggest issue its bordering on openly hostile to new players in terms of how fast you level and get the talents that make a huge difference later on.
The same with the overall gear power it just takes to long for new players to get into.
i have had several friends that have put down the game because of this which is a shame.
once you get to max gear level and you hit 30+ on your characters and play on higher difficulties the game really shines the most it can be brutally punishing at times however.
but once you learn how to go about melee combat in terms of switching up your attack patterns to get certain attacks at certain points and when to use which attacks for stagger armor pen or cleave etc it really does end up with some of the most satisfying melee combat ive ever played unfortunately the game also does little in terms of teaching you this as a new player.
the amount of content available to you with the base game at this point is very good with about 21 levels without dlc plus chaos wastes which is more or less the same size as the base campaign.
The dlcs are decent the 4th careers are priced reasonably in my opinion but the winds of magic dlc is way way overpriced if you do not want to play weaves which most people ive played with do not
So an option to buy only the mission and weapons related would be a better move for newer players because the pricing issue is not adressed unless its on sale.
The gameplay in terms of combat is what makes the game what it is so if you do not find the combat enough to keep you coming you will not get much out of the game the weapons and gear is not what is gonna keep you coming because once you get weapons that are 300 the difference between orange gear and maxed out red gear is honestly negligible it is nice that it always rolls with maxed out stats but even at 800+ hours i find myself using just as many orange weapons as red ones which is a plus because it means that getting gear to be able to play on the hardest difficulty with the properties and traits you want is very fast once you hit 300.
That also means that the reward you get from red gear is not that noticeable playing which in my opinion it is good because it takes focus away from gear and puts it on you improving your playstyle which is easy to learn and very hard to master.
Playing on anything above legend does not net you better rewards in terms of gear it only let you complete challenges to earn portraits, skins and frames which i do think is a good choice since it makes it easier to go for red gear if you for some reason feel like you need to get that legend is a lot easier and it puts cataclysm as a thing to only do if you want a challenge and some very brutal punishment for making mistakes.
The fact that gear from chests carries over from character to character in terms of power is a great thing because it means that you get going way faster and it means a lot less grind because once you get trinket charm and amulet with high stats you will be able to use it across all characters so you only really need to look towards weapons which takes us to the weapon differences
I don't really find any weapon not usable even at high difficulty however there are some weapons that will preform better on cataclysm than others of course. 
There is a good variety of movesets in your arsenal and it does change up how you should approach combat quite a bit in especially since there are is a very large difference of how effective the weapons will be against certain enemies and in certain situations and it forces you to change your playstyle around the weapons you play with to make the most out of them.
You do have some very easy to pick up weapons that will preform very very well on cataclysm without being all that hard to use effectively but there are also weapons that have a very large skill ceiling and require you to be a lot more aware of your surroundings and which targets to engage as they tend to have some movesets that require you to be very good at shaping your comboes and animation canceling. 
The classes are very varied and as of this review the only class that felt lacking (pyromancer) has been buffed and now every single class is in fact viable on the harder difficulties some will of course preform better than others but every class is quite playable on the unmodded dificulties.
speaking of modding this game has an official realm for you to play on which actually does allow for some modding as long as it is a sanctioned mod that has been approved for official servers.
And it does have a modded realm to go wild in if you wanna do that.

If you enjoy playing with friends and have a couple to play this with its in my opinion one of the best games around in terms of coop it requires you to plan ahead and on the fly in terms of who does what and when to do so.
it requires you to play as a team and communicate and work together to play on high difficulties and feels massively rewarding when you do so sucssesfully.
if you intend on playing it alone this will significantly limit the game because playing on cataclysm with bots is just borderline impossible 

at this state the only real gripe i have with this game is its hostility to new players in terms of the amount of time they have to put in before the game is at its best.
The devs also seem to keep focusing on new content and no end in sight so far so you can surely expect more content to be added with time even with the release of Darktide however we did have a whole year(2022) with almost no new content apart from 1 new level which surely had to do with the main focus being switched towards Darktide even with the game being released in that mess of a state that it was in.....

9-9,5/10 in the games current state for me. 
However the issue of progression for new players will take this score down a point or two so 7.5-8/10.
If you intend on picking this up with some friends my recommendation would be to wait for a double or triple exp event before doing so to increase the speed of which you will progress to the endgame they tend to come around 3-5 times a year for the most part.

I could simply point to the number of hours I've played this game and leave it at that, but I'll try to put in a little more effort. I've been a big fan of first-person melee games ever since Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, I've put hundreds and hundreds of hours into titles like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare over the years, so when I saw footage of Vermintide 2 back in 2018 I was immediately intrigued, despite not having played the first game. I resolved to try it out to see if it was as good as it looked. 

I vividly remember struggling a bit at first, with memorizing the map layouts and book locations, dealing with specials during hordes, figuring out the best way to defeat specific bosses, and learning the hard way that I should be wary of getting stabbed from behind by little ambient rats when I least expect it (there's always at least one). I often got frustrated, mostly with myself. Still, despite having a demanding job at the time, I persevered, and soon enough I was playing on Legend difficulty with relative ease (we now usually play on Cataclysm, albeit without taking books). This might sound a little dramatic, but I can say without exaggerating that I had many of my all-time best gaming moments while playing this game. There's just something special about forming a line or circle with your teammates, and then staying mobile as you're fighting a horde, elites (possibly a whole patrol), and a boss at the same time, all while hearing the menacing, telltale sounds of several specials approaching. You get into 'the zone', your muscle memory takes over, and you and your comrades get to experience that very satisfying, visceral sensation of power as you slaughter hundreds and hundreds of enemies while remaining mostly unscathed yourselves.

Summarized, this is a very specific sort of game, almost in its own genre, as it is both co-op and mostly melee-based. It's not going to be for everyone. You have to decide for yourself if it is something that speaks to your preferences. I got lucky in the sense that Vermintide 2 seems almost tailor-made for me, and I happened to make some very good friends while playing it - you know who you are. Fatshark are also known for their occasionally baffling, counterintuitive, or poorly implemented design choices and balance changes, so keep that in mind.
However, for these same reasons, if the game [i]does[/i] end up clicking with you, it's a completely unique and intoxicating experience, like nothing you've ever played before. That's why I would ultimately recommend that you check it out if you're on the fence, unless you already know for certain that this style of gameplay doesn't appeal to your sensibilities at all.",1704371877,1704371877,True,47,0,0.798164308071136475,2,True,False,False

Grafics are beatiful, gameplay is on point of you are ^^ and the sound is awesome! All together makes a perfect first person waveorientated coop shooter. Don't expect to much of a storymode (all the stages have a story) due to the whole gameprinciple and style. It's like d3 endgame but directly from the start - and thats fine due to the whole gameprinciple and style^^

The devs are still up on this with events and dlcs for chars aso + the community is still there and I must say it's way more fun than many other online shooters. The thing here is: diff is heavy!! like really hard.. on easy and mid it's pointless but the diffs above and higher get really mental.. it's still fun but without a team thats working like a din confirmed gearing mechanism you'll be struggling and cursing. 

You have a dozen maps each seperated in different sections you have to fight through and fullfill some tasks but basically you move across maps and kill hordes of enemies.. like, a lot! I mean really many rats and orcs and shit. Not 20, it's way more and you fight sometimes on open fields sometimes in lil halways trying to find the right way in or out just to encounter a boss or the next wave of enemies. Your team is 4 player based and if you stick together and play to your strength you can make it to the exit. But as I said. Being good in this game means to collect some experience first cause as easy it looks like it's hard as hell.

Def recommending it to warhammer fans, coop waveshooter enthusiasts and in general to people who are into fps in fantasy setting with a high threshold of pain. Can't wait to play darktide.

The combat is really satisfying and well-made, rewarding quick thinking, good reaction time and mechanical skill. The RPG aspect of the game is also well designed, there are a multitude of characters with their own classes, made for varying playstyles but can also be further adjusted and customized via Talents, the weapons you equip and the properties/traits on those weapons and your Necklace/Charm/Trinket.

DLC classes are very fun but not OP/P2W, pretty cheap but the only problem is that the cool cosmetics for DLC classes are locked behind another DLC which is more expensive than the DLC classes themselves for some reason.
DLC campaigns give (reportedly) very good weapons but are locked behind a fairly high paywall for only a small amount of missions. For the price of Winds of Magic, I could get another good game or two small neat games.

Let your hearts be filled with zeal as we delve into the essence of this virtual crucible.

Behold, brothers and sisters, a game where the righteous purge the world of vile rats in various forms – armored rats, big rats, even bigger rats, sneaky rats, ratatat-rats, and the foul stench of stinky rats! As if the minions of the Horned Rat were not enough, chaos and beastmen emerge, their malevolent forces adding further torment to this perilous journey.

Yet, take heed! Though you may not embody the rat in this sacred digital crusade, you are blessed with the opportunity to embody noble warriors of diverse statures. 

Rejoice, for the community that gathers in this digital realm is largely benevolent, ready to extend a hand of aid on your treacherous pilgrimage. Alas, occasionally, amidst the harmonious camaraderie, you may encounter a nerd or two – their labored breaths and questionable remarks may assail your ears and insult thy kin. Fear not, for in the name of Sigmar, thou canst forsake these heretical Gamers and seek refuge in the embrace of a more virtuous gathering.

Marvel at the accessible entry point of this sacred endeavor, a low skill floor inviting all who wish to vanquish rats with shoot-smash-singe-stab fervor. Yet, as you ascend the ladder of proficiency and equipment mastery, a high skill ceiling awaits, challenging thee to become a paragon of rat-slaying efficiency.

Adjust thy trials, noble warriors, for there exist various difficulty levels to suit thy preference – control the rate at which rats meet their demise or the severity of thy own trials. As you march forward, consecrate your chosen warrior with the sacred rites of experience, unlocking divine equipment to tailor your righteous playstyle and strike the rats with even greater ferocity.

In this sacred congregation, be excellent unto each other, converse with your comrades in pure umgak, revel in the joy of fellowship, and above all, my brethren, revel in the sublime ecstasy of rat-slaying.

[b]The Good parts:[/b]
[list]
[*]Great combat, lots of weapons and classes.
[*]Good co-op, you can also solo all the game if you want.
[*]Good enough main campaign to play trough.
[*]Lots of maps to play.
[*]Chaos Wastes Mode is fantastic, has lots of replay-ability, loots of fun with randoms or friends.
[/list]

[b]The Bad parts:[/b]
[list]
[*]Horrible loot system, the classic chest loot roulette, very annoying and tedious.
[*]Weapons level up system is bad once you get to orange, sometimes even blue, its pointless to upgrade.
[*]Mediocre bot AI, just learn how to solo it or find some good friends.
[*]""Premium content"", DLC, microtransanctions or whatever you wanna call it, its just mediocre.
[/list]

[b]Final Thoughts.[/b]
Great at parts, mediocre at others. The dialogue is entertaining, the weapons are fun as hell and the enemies are always fun to kill, the bad thing its all the modern gaming aspects like the loot system that sucks b**t.

First of all, ""I just wish they played their own game.""

2nd of all, they made OP all-round Javelin and Coruscation Staff to be absolutely unusable so nobody played with them I guess? Why don't you delete them if you hate them that much? Scared of being hated by your community? Well, you can fear not, FartShat, you just already did it yourselves releasing ANOTHER untested patch as you always do~

Warrior Priest career nobody complained about was significantly buffed for whatever absolutely unknown even to devs themselves reason

Outcast Engineer which needed slight adjustment is now absurdly insane
He ALONE is now better than the rest characters and their careers together
I'm pretty sure you can solo the highest existing modded difficulty with ease on him (Death Wish Onslaught Dutch Spice difficulty, if I'm not mistaken)

And instead ACTUALLY rebalancing, they decided to do Javelin type of ""balance"" to already weak career - Bounty Hunter. His only upside was ranged high damage ultimate to stun and kill bosses and it was his ONLY purpose in this game. Now he's absolutely useless cuz they nerfed his ultimate talent (I'm not talking about 3rd one, which was and STILL IS untouched by them. Long Story short - picking 3rd talent decreases your ultimate damage from 400+ damage to around 16-20 damage points for most of the time)


""Versus Mode will be fun"" they say... yeah, looking at how ""fun"" this game is right now, I really doubt it.
Especially if they kept peer 2 peer host system without saving mid-progress of the match, it'll be SO MUCH FUN killing that host elf and seeing him leave and shutting down whole match to everyone. Mmmmm-MMMMM. Tasty!",1528971955,1703342893,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A career is underperforming but one weapon is viable, so they reduce the damage by 20% for the only role it's good for???? Oh, and do we get refunds for paid DLC content that's now nerfed into uselessness?

They get the game down from 100gb to 60ish roughly for the Necromancer drop, and then just nerf the shit out of the game and its just been back-to-back updates, the one today being 22gb itself. I uninstalled and gained 100gb space back.  They just don't seem to get it.

I love a lot about this game, but I find it difficult to recommend. Got up to the higher difficulties and the game sure does become unforgiving, but for the wrong reasons. Enemy reach has always been a bit ridiculous, and the worst combination of enemies get thrown at you with no lube, repeatedly. Unless you're using the OP DLC career fields then good luck. 

To date, can't decide if A.I or actual players are worse teammates. 

And re-mentioning the DLC careers, I know the end times have basically oofed up warhammer fantasy and creative assembly, fatshark and others have basically been given carte blanche on doing whatever the hell they want but none of the background for the DLC careers sit right with me. Kruber is just a Holy Knight Boy now, Bardin magically becomes a master steamwork engineer, Saltzpyre is a Paladin now which may suit his zealotry but not his actions & Kerillian, oh my girl Kerillian - she's barely even alive at this point and it just breaks my heart after all the little bits and pieces of development of her getting closer to these ""mayflies"" and opening up to the world just to become a fucking tree-person that refers to people as ""meat"". 


I don't want to end this on a bad note

- Each career and weapons for them do have a great unique, but still balanced feel to them, even my least favorite ones out of the stacks. 
- The maps are stunning and I just catch myself looking around the map even 5 years after it's been released
- the recent free content updates are pretty good if challenging in their own ways, though I am hoping for more on the Dwarf series because it did feel just a tad short
- Dialogue between all of the non-DLC characters makes this game. My friends and I quote Saltzpyre and Bardin extensively when playing other games

Problem is - there's a lot of stupid stuff by design, not coding problems or bugs, although there's plenty of that as well. But it's more efficient to name the things that are bad and in my opinion need to be changed for this game to be enjoyably good. (I have every character on lvl. 35, full red gear and usually play on legend)

 - Blightstormers need to either teleport more often, have their range decreased or be required to have line of sight to the blightstorm. Right now a fun run can end in a blightstormer that cast it's tornade from so far away you can't even tag them and everybody dies.

 - dedicated servers were promised before the game came out, it didn't happen, it sucks but that's fine. But The host disconnecting right at the end of a mission not even giving you the XP you would've gained if the mission failed, that rips out a piece of my soul every time i see the ""Taal's Horn Keep"" loadingscreen after wasting 20 minutes.

 - in quickplay you can get a team of 3 melee only characters which means you are going to die to the first occasion where there's more than 2 specials at the same time, especially if it's ranged specials. Now, i'm not saying it's impossible to complete a mission with 3 melee only classes, even on legend and above, but that requires coordination which random people playing quickplay don't have.

 - the netcode to this game sometimes feels more jank than Dead by Daylight's. Sometimes this game just... breaks. It's not your ping, not the hosts ping, not your PC failing or steam servers or anything else, it's just the game getting confused so that enemies skip animations, phase in and out of existence, slide around and teleport behind you with fully charged heavy attacks. sometimes enemies hit you right through your block or hit the spot you used to be in one second ago before you dodged, but hitting you.

Mkay that was my little rant after all this happening in a single game. I have vented enough now and am going back to playing.",1648234655,1702956291,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Weaves were a bust, nobody asked for leaderboards. 

- no deed rework
-no dedicated servers even though FS promised
-Cataclysm difficulty is not rewarding in the slightest
-Versus mode seems like it will come out when VT3 comes out
- changed the whole playstyle with WOM which is still annoying(even though i got used to it)


Update: game crashes galore and no incentives for veterans. Fatshark does not listen to the community but of a select few.

Where are the deeds reworks?

Why do Cataclysm mission challenges provide commendation chests but not emperor chests?

Why are we focused more on the ""balance"" of the game when content like maps and cosmetics are what we really only want.

Fatshark is drip feeding content for Vermintide, new players get double xp, veterans get a thank you and a fuck off.

Also then there is the ability to buy cosmetics.... well i hope you like to penny pinch because FS is not happy about giving you currency to buy cosmetics. If you think about how much a new hat that they release which is about roughly 1980 shillings. you get 3 daily quests that amount to 5 shillings per quest. Then on top of that you get 5 weekly challenges that give you 50 shillings each... you do the math.

There are absolutely no incentives for veterans, now there doesn't need to be to have fun per se, but I would like to see the fruits of my labor when accomplishing a hard challenge but in the end still get just a commendation chest so the incentive falls flat and becomes a very boring a menial task to complete these challenges.


TLDR: 

FS does not care for veterans but if your a new player then you will have fun.
And make sure to grab a friend to play with.


Now obviously I still play this game still but that is because of the friends I have found, and if not for them I would have dropped this game long ago.

edit: still bad

2nd : still bad


3rd edit: Chaos wastes are almost out... not holding my breath on anything good just yet.

10/1/22 - only play with friends... randos are absolutely trash.

12/28/22 - Somehow this game is better than Darktide, still sucks

7/18/23

Need more Chaos Waste variety, and another weave season so I can spend more hours hating this game.

Which difficulty you can play depends on how powerful you are, and your power is mostly dictated by an arbitrary number attached to gear, and how high that number can go depends on how high a level your character is
So rarity of weapons is dependant on the character, and which weapons you get is random from lootboxes, until you level up enough to get blueprints. At which point if you want to get a weapon you want, you need to scrap all the fucking junk of identical weapons you have to get the materials to craft it
Repeat each time you start playing a new character

And the easiset difficulty is just a braindead mashfest, both teaching you as a new player ""Yup, this is a fine way to play"", and making all the weapon stats completely superfluous.

So the weapons, then. Yet again, lootboxes, or grind to get blueprints to craft them (crafting sucks too, but we'll get there). Instead of having every weapon type available at the start, you first got to get it, and annoyingly enough, could be several games before you get something you like, and then it might not be the best in arbitrary numbers or other bonuses.
So as you progress, you're having to scrap all these other items that are almost identical, save for an arbitrary number and some other random bonuses, then craft and/or reroll the bonuses on the weapons you like. 

The bonuses, while they probably make a difference at higher difficulties, is hard to even notice, because it's stuff like ""+8% damage against Skaven"". Again, you're not gonna notice it on lower difficulties because it's not gonna make a difference, and even when it might start making a difference, you're really not gonna see it, unless maybe you go look up the health numbers on the enemies and do the math, or the bonuses become more significant later.

Then there's tons of other minor stuff that annoys me. Can't hear lots of enemies when they're right next to you, so constantly get hit from behind. Similarly can't hear teammates, so I don't know when they've fucked off unless of course they actively tell me, and they're really hard to see as soon as they're like 10 meters away from you, because they become tiny and blend into the environment (which happens often, because the levels are huge and open), it's actually easier to see them when they're behind a wall because then at least they get an outline (this is never a problem in L4D2, for example, because even if you're playing without outlines, the player characters stick out). Voicelines can get very repetative and annoying, when they're the kind that are long and not generic (the amount of times I heard ""It's nothing, just a bit of skill, reflexes!""), and when I'm attacking with Melee using Markus, all I can hear is ""Hua! Hu! Die! Die, would ya! Hua! Hu! Die! Die, would ya!"". It all piles up to make for a frustrating experience.",1702893307,1702904622,False,2,0,0.472138255834579468,0,True,False,False

And although I do play this game, it is a love-hate thing. when will game developers stop making cash grab games and start making masterpieces? you could theoretically make a fps game for every faction, whether it is in the warhammer fantasy or 40k world, and put it in one game for each universe.  a comprehensive game instead of a  narrowly interpreted and  ridiculously executed stop gap blunder.

Update- new careers should of been FREE. The Weave- wtf is that? Chaos Wastes- what a waste. Grudge marked bosses- give me a break. How about focusing on more 'regular' maps, with free updates to careers and equipment, and added races (both to play as and as enemies).

As far as the issues go there are a few glaring ones which just make the game stupid. First, dodging a Chaos Warrior who is attacking with two handed ax does not matter because he will slide to wherever you are even if it is like twenty feet away then swing downward hitting the ground, physically clearly missing, but will take you down. Second, the bunching up and clipping of an enemy elite mob who will all occupy the same physical space and hit you sequentially, rendering blocking ineffective in a couple of seconds. Third, the feeling you have no armor on whatsoever and the mega damage you take from weak mob members and their pointy wood sticks. Fourth, the weirdly unsettling character modeling especially some of the faces-yikes, uglier than the enemy. Fifth- the abundance of stupid cosmetics with only a few nice ones. I so wish this was a better game. Even Darktide with its issues is a way better game that also has a way to go but not as far as this one. It has run its course and has seen its sunset many moons ago. Third time is the charm as they say...

All comes down to the sl.interposer.dll, which calls the SetThreadDescription function from kernel32.dll. This function is missing on all Windows versions prior to Win 10 ver. 1607 (the same and still unsolved issue preventing the start of the game on older versions of Windows 10) and used solely for debugging purposes, so it is possible to just remove that function call from a binary without side effects... only to be stopped by Easy Anti-Cheat from launching the game because files became modified.

Judging by the 'balancing patches' that are being released every once in a while, It seems that the development team behind it does not play too frequently or on any of their higher difficulties.

The core game is an absolute blast and ~5 years or so of polish in the game has made a fairly satisfying in game experience.  If you enjoy hack and slash, L4D style games set in a grimdark fantasy world, this game is highly likely for you.

Unfortunately, and I don't do this lightly, Fatshark's propensity to make knee jerk changes w/o extensive testing (or what can only be described such considering their decisions), catering to a vocal minority on balance changes has worn me down to the point that I am fast losing my interest in this game.

This review is less about the current state of the game and new players who may just be signing on and haven't experienced the past several years of patching, fine tuning, tinkering, etc, but more for people who may want to get into this for the long haul.  Don't.  

If you need a cheap game on sale and haven't had to endure or don't plan to play this for the long haul, the game is fast, fun, try yard, sweaty goodness, but if you're looking for measured, reasonable changes this late into the game life where, more and more, the changes that are made are going to be or close to the final take on class and gear balance from devs who appear to cater to vocal minorities and ill conceived changes, you may find yourself frustrated at the direction FS takes with the game.

Like I said, I don't change my review lightly and I have seen so many changes in the ~4 years and over 8k hrs I've played this game so, while my decision is heavily influenced by the most recent changes, it's also the how and what they've done and the direction they've taken over the long haul and past several years, not just the most recent things that have completely turned me off.  

If you are new, you may not care or have any reference point so, in that case, this very may well be for you.",1638282255,1702542601,False,0,0,0.55337899923324585,0,True,False,False

Firstly, let's talk graphics. They're so good, they'll make your grandma's old CRT TV weep pixels of joy. The level of detail is so intense that I could see the existential dread in a Skaven's eyes as I lopped its head off. It's like the developers took the concept of HD and cranked it up to ""Is this real life or am I hallucinating?""

Gameplay? Imagine if your favorite carnival ride and a mosh pit had a baby, and that baby was on fire. That's Vermintide 2. You'll be swinging swords, dodging claws, and dropping witty one-liners like you were born in the Renaissance but raised in a meme factory.

The characters are so quirky, they make the cast of Friends look like cardboard cutouts. We've got a dwarf who's more beard than man, an elf who's 90% sass and 10% arrows, a soldier who's seen some stuff but mostly just sees red, and a wizard who's about as stable as your internet connection on a stormy day.

But wait, there's more! This game will take you on an emotional journey akin to watching a soap opera while riding a rollercoaster. One second you're cackling like a witch on Halloween, and the next you're sobbing into your keyboard because, darn it, these characters have grown on you like that mold in the back of your fridge.

In short, Warhammer Vermintide 2 is the digital equivalent of a fever dream you never want to wake up from. It's the kind of game that makes you question reality, your life choices, and why you can't seem to stop playing. If memes were a currency, this game would be the central bank. 11/10, would meme again.",1520596442,1702473006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

看了最新的开发者日志，我只有一句话想说：肥鲨我测你的码
你一个土埋到眉毛了的老登PVE游戏不想着怎么做更多内容留住玩家，天天就惦记你那B平衡是吧。玩家玩的爽了让你彪子妈的b里有蚂蚁爬是吧。
还有孝子说“啊肥鲨不还更新了好几张地图呢么”。我更nmlgb，你看看你那几张新地图做的是什么狗屎，又臭又长野队十次有九次翻车，更新法四以后又整出来各种乱七八糟的bug你不去修，网络连接一坨你不去修，tm赏金连爆这种纯技巧的东西你上赶着去修？你们的平衡团队是不是有什么大病。想平衡选取率你tm不会把其他职业加强吗？暗潮就做的一坨屎，天天平衡来平衡去，现在又来霍霍鼠疫了是吧。
上次更新混沌荒原以后还以为你们悟道了给改的好评，现在看来你们还是骨子里的剑冢，不挨骂不舒服。这个差评我要作为平衡性调整挂到这倒霉公司倒闭。

混沌荒原（×）

这游戏还真让肥鲨给更新明白了
爷很满意！



历史版本：
鬼鬼，这个2.0版本的更新真是绝了
现在经常是没有受到攻击的提示音，然后背后刷出一堆怪，等你回头的时候10刀一起砍下来，GG
那张新地图我就日了狗了，又臭又长
野队大概率最后的地方翻车
原因包括但不限于：
连插两旗
兽潮+牛头boss一起出场
罐头牛+弓手/长矛一起出场，开罐头就要被后面捅，不开罐头打不到后面

然后还有尼玛的复活点
之前版本复活点距离感觉蛮合理
为什么更新之后复活点nm离得那么远，是我的错觉吗
尤其是马格努斯塔，之前基本没翻过车，现在大概率被干翻，然后我才知道复活点是nm的塔下面？？？这是哪个脑残设计的

最后还要吐槽一下匹配到的一些菜逼八队友
35级了不会招架，贴脸不动和怪站撸，满血带药不给人，把把上来就倒
真是wdnmd

最后的最后，9102年了竟然还有主机断开全队重来的游戏，你很棒棒哦。日李良

更新：
我发现自从我写了这篇评测以后这游戏越来越垃圾了
经常是刚打开没一会就带着我的电脑完全卡死了
你说是我电脑有毛病，行吧，我忍了，I7 1080ti可能是过时了
我ping显示绿色60左右疯狂丢包延迟，击杀需要1秒左右才能看到反馈可能也是我100兆网不行
关键是为什么玩家质量也越来越扯
我之前95%游戏时间遇到的玩家都挺好的，可能有1、2个脑子有病，忽略不计
怎么这几天开始疯狂出现这种垃圾
统计一下我最近15局游戏发现：
5局他妈的到了终点了主机断开连接
2局傻逼主机自己作死怪队友不去救他退出游戏
3局牛头怪+铁皮兽人潮+3旗子wdnmd
只有三分之一的局平安无事度过
真的很棒棒！
还有尼玛神奇的bug，我在深坑最后通往鱼市的桥上脚下突然出现一个大洞直接摔死，你们的程序员都是育碧那边请过来的吗？
本来我玩到一款好玩的游戏以后必定会沉迷500-1000小时左右
现在感谢肥鲨，我有点不想玩这个游戏了
只能祝贵司财源广进，大展宏图了

          It's a mixed bag to be honest - I do love the game but it has some serious issues, and that's why I can't recommend it. As with most of my reviews, I choose to focus on the issues as those will stop you from enjoying the game. For exact same reason I won't be saying much in the 'Pros' section - As you should experience these gems on your own [i](They're worth it!)[/i].


[h1]Pro(s):[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Dope setting[/b] - It's Fantasy Warhammer... [i]yes[/i], [i]during End-Times[/i], but the writers cleverly avoid the bad parts [i](Meaning a lot of End-Times material...)[/i] to maximize the appeal of the setting without the shitty bits that GW had thrown in.
[*] [b]Entertaining characters[/b] - Surprisingly well written, deep and inter-woven story between these five. Even cringy characters like Kerillian or Sienna become more likeable the more you see of them. My only tip for these two specifically is to avoid them as Bots inside your own party. Both because they're not great bots, and because conversations between the two are pretty lame/add the least to each character's interest or intrigue.
[*] [b]Both straight-forward and deep gameplay[/b] - Gameplay is welcoming to new players and scaleable, meaning you've a nice learning curve throughout. There is a ton of enemies, and most have a unique way that they're best dealt with, leading to sometimes difficult but incredibly entertaining, rewarding and high-octane gameplay.
[*] [b]Zoom-Zoom[/b] - If you like speedrunning levels, it's not only an option but a requirement at high difficulties [i](You don't wanna overstay, as prolonged stay offers more chance for mistakes, HP doesn't usually regen, resources are finite, and mistakes at higher difficulties are super deadly!)[/i].
[/list]


[h1]Con(s):[/h1]
[list]
[*] [b]Buggy AF[/b] - While most important features aren't an issue, thankfully, there's still plenty of bugs in the game that are years old and in desperate need of squashing.
[*] [b]Meta[/b] - To the uninitiated, [i]'Meta'[/i] or [i]'Meta-Gaming'[/i] is a concept that describes the optimal way of playing the game. In games where choice/player expression exists through gameplay, this can be particularly egregious as some or most weapons [i](...despite looking cool, having cool move-sets, or what have you.)[/i] fall to the wayside. This issue is further enhanced when you take into account that this game is also ALL about movement. Dodging and weaving is integral as the game primarily focuses on Melee, and sprinting through the levels, while not a necessity, is the preferred modus-operandi for most high-level players. A single strike against an Elite or Special enemy can make all the difference in the world, and this is precisely why the Meta-Slavery is so egregious here. That being said, this is hardly the only issue you have to worry about. 
[*] [b]Game refuses to provide you with proper stats![/b] - Weapons, trinkets, power, bonus against enemies... All of those stats will mean absolutely nothing to you until you hit a wall and start looking up exactly how they work. The game won't tell you, and finding accurate and up-to-date info is like pulling teeth. 
[*] [b]But what is optimization, really?[/b] - Game is horribly unoptimized... From the massive file sizes that become readily available with larger updates [i](Or simply when you're intending to install the game.)[/i], to graphics settings not providing you nearly enough scaleable options between game looking good but performing well, to game looking like shit and performing somewhat better.
[*] [b]404 missing QoL[/b] - In addition to previous two, the game refuses to integrate readily-available QoL fixes into the base. [i]""Readily available?""[/i] I hear you ask -- Why yes, dear reader, just like Bethesda, Fatshark leaves it up to their userbase to fix their shit... But unlike Bethesda, it gets worse. There's plenty of mods to fix the game, sure, but to play the game with other players the mod has to be sanctioned... You know what happens after each update? All the mods are automatically un-sanctioned due to version mismatch. And Fatshark takes WEEKS to sanction them back again, mods that are considered to be [b]integral[/b] to the game because Fatshark [i]refuses to fix their shit[/i]!
[*] [b]Inconsistent but Insane Tracking/Turn Rate[/b] - Enemies will erratically turn even if you have no line-of-sight, making some headshot attempts feel unfair as the game will feel like input-reading you to turn the enemy EXACTLY the way it needs to in an instant, in order for you to miss a headshot. CKs will 180-overhead-shot you at random. Chaos Spawn will 180-grab you or slam you or turn mid slam-charge. None of these are fair, and there's no counter-play as the turns are almost near-instant. This has been in the game since launch, was stated by the devs that it isn't intentional behavior, and has not yet been fixed.
[*] [b]Some DLCs feel necessary[/b] - While weapons DLCs are cheap, some of them also feel important/necessary because they serve as balancing measure-stick for the developers, while quite a few base-game weapons are forgotten.
[*] [b]Bots...[/b] - ...and not in the same way that you might think. As this is a cooperative multiplayer game, you don't play against other players [i](...debatable if you have a Kerillian on your team, but I digress...)[/i]. So how is this an issue? When you don't have players at hand, you have bots. Bots are worthless at best, an will get you killed at worst. This is further compounded by the fact that there are some weapons that bots can't use properly [i](because they're so horridly coded)[/i], so you will rely on some DLC weapons for [i][b]optimal[/b][/i] bot functionality, which you will [i][b]need[/b][/i] on higher difficulties. And they're not getting fixed. [b]Example:[/b] Bardin bot will still taunt all specials and stand atop of your corpse refusing to res you -- And even if he were to res you, you'd get one-shot by overhead strikes from CKs or Stormvermin because the ingenious bot used [b]taunt[/b] right on top of you! Shit like this has been in-game from the start, and this is just Bardin! Each both has their own array of issues that are just as egregious.

Heres what a PR department replies to me why i get ban because i told a player in a lobby that hes a horrible person for griefing me in game.

Julia (Fatshark)

Hi Mythra, it appears your account has been banned for 7 days due to harassment. This ban will expire on November 26, 2021. Please be aware that repeated observation of harassment will result in a permanent ban.

Fatshark you are no different from a dictator and banning players with a threat of a perm ban from 1 salty match cause by a griefer. I recommend no one to ever buy a game from fatshark ever again and if you do just play private matches because apparently if someone doesnt like you they can report you and ban you.

Edit: Cringe dev you didnt even see what happen and i just posted my gameplay of people griefing me nice this proves how horrible you guys are. Death threats lol? you need to actually play your own game and experience it yourself. Instead of victimizing yourself why dont you actually fix your game and community which you guys dont care. All it took was 1 sentence in game and i show my friends and you sore losers do a ban. Pathetic... Make others feel yeah okay like the guy who troll me whole game and he gets away with it nice you twat...

One suggestion for both Verminetide and Darktide: it's something about motivation to play in the long run, but it's subjective, what will inspire me to play for years...
I would love to see in the game some long-term goals. Like, when you finish a certain amount of missions, something happens in the game. Like some sort of activity-based campaign (not a story campaign). I want to feel that I'm doing something in the world, against my enemies. When I complete a mission, I want to feel that I made some progress in the overall war (be it something like a seasonal war progression tracker or just some illusion of progress).

Easy to get into, but if you want to survive the higher difficulties, you need to master the surprisingly deep and EXCELLENT combat system. 

The 5 different characters all come with 3 base careers and a DLC career, and each makes for a unique playstyle. Fun!

Seriously: especially the melee combat in this game is topped by none. It's chef's kiss good, well thought out and balanced. Light attacks, heavy attacks, blocking, pushing, pushblock attacking, stamina, dodging. Not to mention that each weapon handles differently and has their own unique attack patterns. They all feel and play very differently.

On top of that, the character design and voice acting is excellent, and there is quite a bit of lore under the surface. And if you're bored of the many 'normal' campaign maps, you can always explore the free randomized game mode that is the Chaos Wastes.

I don't recommend this game to people with motion sickness as the hectic frenzy of combat can be quite discomforting for some.

There's a special type of high when you and our team manage to get through a clutch time event that few other games can give you. The game is quite unforgiving on higher difficulty levels and has a steep learning curve to handle for a new player. The game will reward you when you get better at it but you'll have to sink quite a bit of time in it to get to a certain level that fun to play. 

Each weapon has it's own combos that can synergies with the various abilities that each class offers. With each hero having 4 distinct classes, each with their own weapons and abilities, the combinations that are at your disposal are near endless. This keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging as each build has it's own qualities and drawbacks.

The voice acting and visuals are also quite well handled. It's fun do hear each hero interact differently depending of the class the player chose and the composition of the party that was constituted.  The attention to the artwork and visuals is also well rendered and really help you get the feel that you are fighting a rearguard guerrilla in the End Times of the Old World.

A massive amount of base game content is irrelevant at higher difficulties, and skill ceilings are more determined by how good your build is rather than how skilled you are.

This would be fine if the developers paid attention to the base game, but DLC characters receive priority treatment which causes a lot of weapons and classes to stagnate. As for cosmetic and map DLC, it's simply overpriced for what's offered.

As someone who knows next to nothing about Warhammer I still really enjoy this game and it's a brilliant entry point for anyone looking to get into it, or for some casual fun. 

There's 5 characters to choose from each with 4 careers (classes) you unlock 2 by levelling up and the final is a DLC. They all play differently, only slightly in the beginning but as you unlock new talents they become more diverse and interesting. There's plenty of enemy variety too, 3 factions: Vermin, Chaos and Beast  so your not whack-a-ratting the same enemy for hours.

The combat is surprisingly deep, on the lower difficulty you can spam attacks with little consequence, on the higher difficulties you have to learn to use space, dodge, parry, etc.

I've played with hundreds of random players and there's never been a toxic player among them, which is a rarity for an online game sadly.

3 enemy races (Skaven, Norsca/Chaos and Winds of Magic DLC addition, Beastmen) have enough diversity to make things fun, although I do hope for more Beastmen-specific specials. 
There's a decent amount of maps available so you won't get utterly bored of the core gameplay.
Most of the weapons are viable on highest official difficulties like Legend and Cataclysm, so you'll have options. 
2000 hours in, looking for supplies on Legend/Cata still makes me rediscover map nuances and combat approaches. 
In general, unless Fatshark screws something up again (that has happened. We do not talk about the Winds of Magic launch), this is a solid choice at a discount.

- Coop experience is superb, almost on par with Borderlands :P 
- Great price!
- Devs are continuously adding new content, either in form of DLCs or new modes for the game;
- Modded realm, for community made mods;
- Skaven, Chaos and Beastmen! Creating very dynamic challenges on the battlefield;
- Besides weekly modes and modded realm, you can challenge yourself with Deeds (added stipulations to existing maps), Twitch integration (great tool for streamers to include their chat, and was available on release); 
- New weapon types keep coming, and the latest ones are more unique than ever;
- 20 different 'classes' to choose from, and they all play differently;
- Skill trees that impact how you play the character quite a bit. 
- Great idle dialogues. Great lore of an already vast world, and immersive characters!


Downsides are common glitches or bugs that might ruin the immersion; replayability lies in grinding the missions over and over again, for epic loot and skins (and some skins are just glowing beginner skins). Mission maps are less linear than in Vermintide 1, but still a linear experience when it comes to level design and what to expect. Enemies and loot are what's very dynamic. 

Edit: With Chaos Wastes (rogue-lite) &  Weaves addon modes, and who knows what other content in the future, the game has much more replayability now.

- robust co-op system
- fun gameplay with a lot of variety
- weapon feedback is so good

Cons:
- the bot is very stupid, please just play with friends
- lootbox style weapon drop with abysmal rate
- sometimes the game just wants you dead for no reason
- no dedicated server, ping depends on host

Edit 7-12-2018:
TL;DR DON'T BUY THIS GAME

Probably one of the most, for lack of a better word, f****t devs I ever seeen.

1. Removal of the planned roadmap WITH NO feedback other than ""At the moment we are updating the roadmap and will get back to you [b]soon[/b] with more information. Please bear with us.""
Soon my a**
http://www.vermintide.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/v2_roadmap_comp.jpg
1.1. Still no news about dedicated servers
1.2. Lack of host migration - when the host leaves, the level will reset

2. Incompetent patching - the biggest patch, patch 1.1.0, REVERTED ""fixes/tweaks"" from previous patches and possibly introduced even more problems into the game.
2.1. Disabler spam seems a lot worst

3. Lack of a endgame
3.1. Drop rates for cosmetics items are very low, even for the highest tier of loot box
3.2. Duplicates of red weapons(the highest tier items) are absurd
3.3. Necklace/Charm/Trinket red item spam is ridiculous

4. Melee Combat in General
4.1. Hyperdensity and Cleave - 
   Multiple enemies stack on top of each other 
   +
   Melee weapons have a certain amount of cleave until the weapon is ""stopped""
   =
   Range combat reigns supreme in a MELEE focus game
https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/how-vermintide-2-is-specifically-designed-to-punish-melee-and-reward-ranged-combat/25001

5. Devs are Jackasses and VERY incompetent
5.1. They constantly lie, deceive, and blame the player base:
   - Modders found hats in the game files not released to the public, failshark recently announced they plan to have paid cosmetics
https://clips.twitch.tv/InterestingObedientOcelotFutureMan
   - MANY of the released cosmetics are just reskins/recolors and/or very lazy edits of the default ones
https://imgur.com/gallery/cIo37tz
^Two DIFFERENT cosmestics
   - The mod ""Hero Statistics"" was denied (but recently undenied) because it enabled features that the devs deemed incomplete and had not even been given to QA testers, posing the question of why was it in the public build of the game in the first place
   - Robin should be fired
   - Told the community that working on the xbox port would not affect the development of the PC version, but in actuality, has delayed any big patches to the game and further work improving the PC version, dedicated servers, and future content

Set in a grim and perilous world overrun by menacing rat-like creatures (Skaven) and Chaos forces, this game thrusts you into heart-pounding battles with relentless enemies.

The combat mechanics are a standout feature, delivering a visceral and satisfying experience. Swinging weapons feels impactful, and the variety of character classes offer unique abilities and playstyles. Experimenting with these classes and their distinct skills adds depth and excitement to the gameplay.

The level design is pretty good thought after going through all the maps over and over again it can feel uninteresting and just plain.

Progression in Vermintide 2 is pretty good until you finally get most things to the point harder difficulties just become your default selection

The developers have provided great updates and DLCs and continue to do so. Adding additional enjoyment to the players that have pretty much finished all of the game.

But of course the best feature and the games selling point for me is the co-op. The reason to come back and play the maps and everything else is being able to do it with your friends as a team with each player playing one of the heroes with their unique abilities trying to find you way through the maps.

TLDR: Awesome game til you finish. Though the developers have added great DLCs and updates to fix and keep the game entertaining. If you don't have friends/a team to carry the enjoyment of the game youll be pretty much done with the game afterwards.",1700677132,1700677132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like it's predecessor, Vermintide 2 came out of the gates with a stumble. The much anticipated follow-up is still plagued at times with optimization issues, and until the most recent Big Balance Beta that was patched into release 1.3, the game was certainly off to a rough start. Now the game is well positioned and most of the extreme rough edges have been rounded down. With two new maps already released and an upcoming DLC (Dec '18) that returns players to Ubersreik (the setting of Vermintide) with three maps taken and fashioned to work with the updated map scheme, the game is in a perfect place for those holding out to jump right in and start rat catching. There are those of us still witing for FatShark to release their dedicated server, and wider range of cosmetics, but that is just being picky.

         + Incredibly satisfying melee combat system 
         + Amazing coop game
         + High skill cap while still being easy to pick up
         + Great atmosphere / Warhammer setting

         - Crafting system and ingame progression are lacking and need refinement 
         


Long version: 

A coop melee game in which 4 players complete missions on a set number of maps. 
While some may argue that this quickly becomes repetitive, the main appeal of this game is the fact that no 2 rounds play out the same, as the game somewhat randomizes each encounter and the excellent gameplay keeps it entertaining, even after 1000+ hours. 

On the topic of gameplay, I can only stress how amazing the combat feels. 
While it is fairly easy to get into and can appear somewhat shallow at first glance, the combat offers an incredible amount of complexity and challenge, especially on higher difficulties.
It is on these higher difficulties where the mechanics really start to shine and the coop experience is best. 
The melee system is fluid and rewarding, with a high skill sceiling for hardcore players, yet also fun and intuitive for beginners. 

In terms of content, the game consists of 13 base maps, another 3 free dlc maps and several dlcs for more maps, weapons, new classes and cosmetics.
Mod support is also present, even on the Official Realm.
No dlc is truly mandatory, especially since you can play the dlc maps as long as someone in the group you're playing with owns the respective dlc pack.

Even if the game itself does not necessarily offer content to last for literal hundreds of hours, there are many ways to enjoy this game, from casual runs with random teammates, mutators like Twitch integration to truly hardcore (modded) difficulties. 

The main takeaway is that no other game comes close to how awesome the combat feels. Vermintide 2 is unique and amazing at what it does. 
Seriously, you'll never look at FPS melee mechanics the same way after having played Vermintide.

Furthermore, the game also perfectly captures the Warhammer atmosphere and feeling, bringing the grim fantasy world to life. 
Each of the 5 playable heroes is written as a unique and interesting character, giving them a distinct personality and leading to entertaining banter and a more 'immersive' experience.     

One of the few aspects which are currently lacking is the crafting system and the way progression works. 
Nearly everything is dependant on RNG as well as a bit of grind to unlock new classes and difficulties. 
The loot you obtain is mostly random, leading to frustrating moments when you cannot seem to obtain the desired item. 
Of course, this only really matters in the beginning, since even bad RNG can be overcome by just playing for quite some time. 
Nevertheless, the system in its current form is less than ideal.


Overall, Vermintide 2 builds on the excellent foundation of Vermintide 1. 
A deep combat system that keeps you hooked, paired with a rich setting and the promise of more content on the horizon make for a very enjoyable coop experience. 

If you consider youself a fan of either coop games, of Warhammer in general, or of melee action games - or all of the above - I can only recommend this game.",1555176177,1700659481,True,57,4,0.801320493221282959,0,True,False,False

It does, however, have a MYRIAD of flaws.

Graphics and presentation is not one of those flaws. This game is gorgeous and it's oozing with style, detail and if you've ever read a Warhammer novel or if you're a Warhammer fan, you'll instantly be taken in by the atmosphere. The lighting is gorgeous, the texturework detailed and the animations flow seamlessly. The sound design is tight and every enemy has a clear, unmistakable sound, the weapons sound and feel meaty and impactful, the music is top-notch. It is a fairly demanding game that taxes both the CPU and the GPU, but for me it runs about as well as I'd expect.

The core gameplay is also one of this game's strengths. Essentially, it's a four-player co-op horde hack and slash. There are five characters with 3 careers each plus two extra payable careers for two characters (we'll get to that later). Most classes have a melee weapon and a ranged weapon (some have 2 melee). There's no story, per se, just background lore and the game consists of linear missions with some scripted sequences and an AI director generating random horde spawns, boss spawns, special enemy spawns and so on. The roster is wide and varied - even the trash mobs have two tiers, then there are Elite enemies that hit hard and have armor/more health, special enemies that disable you or have crowd control, it's just good mechanics all around (except Blightstormers, they can buzz off). This means no two runs will be the same and it keeps the gameplay fresh and reactive instead of turning into rote memorization. As I've mentioned, the animations and feedback are tight and the game feels responsive. This is fantastic, because despite it's random nature, at its core, it's still a skill-based game... mostly. The maps are fun, varied and as I've said, beautiful and I haven't gotten tired of them even after 450 hours.

One last, really good thing - the characters are A+. The banter is awesome, the voice acting superb, they have great chemistry and they're just fun to be around. They're a talkative bunch and I love it because it gives the game so much charm you could measure it in bucketloads.

There are, sadly some glaring faults and annoyances. First and foremost... to me, the game didn't really start until the fourth difficulty, Legend, around 100 hours in. Up to that, the game might seem totally boring or too easy to newcomers and the fact that all difficulties grant the same amount of leveling XP might mean someone will infer that the game is just a boring grind. I mean, it IS a grindy game, but to me, the appeal is that it keeps getting harder and harder and it's fun to master a difficulty and move on to the next one until you can hold a Cata horde on your own. Unfortunately, it's hard for beginners to experience how fun this game is at higher difficulties because the game is just too watered down on the easier ones. Let me give you an example: during a Recruit run, you might run into ONE horde and maybe 10 specials throughout the entire map. Traversal is risk-free and dull. During a Legend run, you will get upwards of 1000 trash enemies and specials in the 50s or 60s. Hordes will spawn very, very often and specials and elites will populate even mundane roads and paths making traversal actually dangerous and thrilling.

Another thing that might turn new players off is the loot system. You basically collect Tomes that replace your healing item and Grimoires that replace your potion buff in order to level up a loot box that you get upon completing the mission. Higher difficulties give better chests, and your loot level slowly rises. The drops are still random, so the road to max damage/stat gear is long and tedious and the Winds of Magic DLC (for all its other problems) had a MUCH better upgrade system that I wish they would just transfer to the main game.

That said, some maps are just unfairly hard and even though I said the game is mostly skill-based, sometimes the game just forces you to lose because it throws so much crap at you even four skilled players don't stand a chance. There are also some issues with hit detection and/or lag, so be prepared for quite a few ""that was total bull"" moments. It's just the nature of peer-to-peer and randomly generated encounters - sometimes you'll get dealt a bad hand, sometimes you'll lag, and sometimes, both will happen and you die through very little or no fault of your own.

Lastly, the elephant in the room... the support and development. This game has had SO many issues, so many crashes and things breaking, and the fact that there's no dedicated server means networking issues are common and totally ruin the fun. The devs seem to break more things than they fix sometimes and I dread what will happen everytime the game gets patched. Things do get resolved eventually but the game is just plain broken every so often. The other thing is the content or lack thereof. The devs have promised a PvP mode years ago. They drip-feed payable careers. They released a DLC that split the playerbase even further and locked the game's highest difficulty behind a paywall. Just... iffy decisions across the board and it really detracts from what is otherwise a stellar game. EDIT: now that Darktide is out and given what an absolute slow-burning disaster that is, Vermintide II is actually in a pretty good place. All the payable careers are out and I have to say they're all fun and worth the few bob.

All in all, in spite of the bad netcode, the random nature sometimes ruining the fun, the devs making questionable decisions about the game's future, this game remains my firm favourite.

Game runs well on my system with highest settings, mainly stay at 60 FPS sometimes dips to 50 FPS or so.
Game looks good.
I wouldn't mind another AA setting though. TAA is very blurry and with FXAA on it seems like SSAO is partially disabled or something.
Not that big a deal.

Combat is very fun and the co-op aspect is awesome.
I have not been playing multiplayer games very much the last few years, but this really hits the sweet spot for me.
Brings back those good L4D/L4D2 days!

Game is better than it has ever been. Looking forward to more content hopefully now that they're getting the careers, weapons, enemies etc... more balanced they can start pumping out that sweet sweet content!

Set yourself a challenge to complete all maps on Ledge, and then after that, all maps on Cata.

Never had a game do this before in all my years of gaming and its very disappointing they couldn't help.
they asked me to contact the anti cheat company as thats where they think the problem is, they didnt respond at which point fatshark customer service offered me a refund, basically i cant play this game ever again and have had to have it refunded again despite buying a new copy. After trying three times the anti cheat people helped me, we went through options but nothing worked. Eventually they said this shouldn't be possible and gave up. 

one of my favourite games ruined due to some tech issue they couldnt resolve

i cant tell you how unhappy and angry this made me and after 2 years or more of not being able to play suddenly tonight after a random attempt it's working again. 

So the issue was entirely on their end with an update breaking my game and an update finally fixing it. 

The game itself is good, easily one of my favourites and coming back to it after so long with all the DLC and updates makes it almost a new game, one I'm looking forward to getting back into.

Massive thanks to [b]Games Workshop[/b] and [b]Fatshark[/b] team for this game! In fact this is one of the best Warhammer game ever. The most exciting and addictive for me personally.

Naturally, I don't have many good words about [i]""fantasy battles""[/i] and I like multiplayer games even less. However, as it turned out, not so much problem to play this game solo only, but it takes time, patience, attentiveness, skill and ingenuity. By this way I can save a lot more nerves than when communicating with the [i]""community""[/i]... 

The most important thing for me, what I'm playing for is that it's the [b]End Times[/b] adventure, the final step to my lovely [b]Warhammer Age of Sigmar[/b]. [i]The memory of this makes me brave and strong. I remember what I fight for and every blow I strike is not against skaven or northlanders, but against toxicity and hatred itself[/i].

Another my favorite point of [b]Vermintide 2[/b] is the ability to decorate my own Keep (!) with paintings (!!) - neither more nor less than baroque and bizarre artworks of [b]John Blanche[/b] himself!!! 

Also I just can't help but take advantage of this opportunity — I'm sure my gaming experience and dedication allows me to give some advice to developers:

1. [b]Pay more attention, love and respect to solo gamers[/b]. Multiplayer is not a guarantee of the game's long life. Remember sad fate of [b]Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning[/b]. So improving solo play, especially bot fixing and give control tools for bots should be in priority.

2. [b]Collecting and customization[/b]. There are two axioms: firstly, «[b]Warhammer is about collecting above all[/b]» (read: [i]hoarding of treasures[/i]), and secondly, «[b]every good Warhammer game must have an Army Painter[/b]»!
There is literally a dire need for more collectibles in the game (hats, skins, illusions), as well as an improvement in the method of storing it. My inventory is almost constantly overweight! Cosmetic items should not take up space in inventory.
+ Ideally, it should be possible to manually recolor cosmetics items altogether, how was it in Warhammer Online. In addition, [b]the benefit for Games Workshop is obvious, in this way they will acquaint more people with the names of their paints[/b] again.
And most importantly, I need more places to paintings. Remember strongest point. [b]Let's turn Taal's Horn Keep into Warhammer art gallery![/b]

3. [i]Dialogues[/i]. Many people think that the voicelines of this game are brilliant itself. I must say - only at first time. After thousands of hours, I don't perceive it as information, just annoyance.
Give option to change the voice volume, even to zero.

4. General stability and performance improvements; bug fixes. [b]Just do it[/b]!

[b][u]RESUME[/u][/b]

[b]Pros:[/b]

— it's all Warhammer!
— an End Times adventure. [i]Soon this farce called ""fantasy battles"" will end. I want to believe that this is forever;[/i]
— arts of John Blanche;
— collecting;
— excitingly;
— rapture of bloodshed!

[b]Cons:[/b]

— still smells like [i]""fantasy battles""[/i];
— [i]""community""[/i] and forced socialization;
— talented but lazy developers (rarely updated and not a lot of new content);
— sometimes resembles torture, especially the incessant chatter of the characters. Not exist nerves that can withstand their endless [i]blah blah blah[/i]...
— bugs, crashes and disconnects. 30% of my game time is completely lost because of this and no reward.

P.S: [i]Nevertheless, I have invested too much power of my heart and soul and no less than time and money. Unfortunately, I never received any reciprocal respect from the developers, but I continue to voted for this game in «Labor of Love» Steam Award nomination. I do this for Vermintide every year. I still believe in Fatshark — I hope in one day they make Vermintide 3 (or 4, 5 etc) game in [b]Warhammer Age of Sigmar[/b].[/i]

P.P.S: [i]I still love this game.[/i]

Oh right this is for real life not the universe of Vermintide 2. You should get this game, and if you like a character enough, the premium classes are worth buying. The ancient relics pack is also pretty cool but you can't mix the premium classes with some of the weapons so be weary. The chaos wastes alone give this game near infinite replay ability and I haven't even ventured to champion difficulty yet. I hope they reveal the ultimate fate of each character before (spoilers friends) they all die to the end times. If they manage to escape/survive I'll be thrilled. I know some meat who would love that also but alas not every mayfly deserves to make it out. I know the careers and the wastes are the canon ending for this moment but I would love to see how these heroes make out.

This game is full of fun characters and banter, each with their own subcharacters that can completely change the way you typically play. The maps are challenging and rewarding. And finding all the secrets is so much fun. Even now, I show veterans cool new secrets they had no idea about. You can't solo missions very easily since there are a lot of hard-to-dodge hooks/assasins/leaches that instantly grab you if they catch you, but the community is super awesome and everyone usually understands that this is a team game and stick together. Get used to swinging a sword because ranged weapons are low on ammo and reserved for tougher enemies. You get used to the hack-and-slashing pretty quick though, eventually mastering it and saving yourself precious ammunition for northmen, black rats, gun rats, etc... that normally are tougher to melee against. Hordes are common and stealth is not really an option for most of the static enemies, but you can walk around patrols so there is some element of stealth I guess, but that's not really the strongpoint of this game.

You speed run through a level to get to the end, fighting bosses and completing various objectives along the way. Objectives ranging from hold your ground and survive, fix the thing, or escort.
  Teamwork is the core gameplay. Cooperate together, or die alone. On occasion die together. Depends.

Music:
  The overall musical score for this game is...bland. very, very, bland. a meal consisting of plain ""bleached"" white rice, with tap water to wash it down. 
  It consists of done to death heard it 7.8 zillion times, HOO DUN DUN DUN, HA.....HA! Or a high pitched chorus, UUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHH!    dun dun dun dun UUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
  
  I count myself lucky when the migraine inducing sound track of what can only be a recording of many two-year olds clanging kitchen utensils on pots and pans, when a weird synthesizer comes on. Atleast its fresh? 

Atmosphere:
  The overal tone of the game, the environments, and the incredible attention to detail were clearly put together by geniuses. 
  Its dark, gritty, doesn't rely on a whole lot of flashy, cringy, purple light effects. Instead they chose green. While there is still entirely too much magical color bullshit, atleast they didnt copy paste purple, so that automatically makes it forgivable.
 The towns and fortresses are incredibly detailed, to the point that they seem very lifelike, atleast to a point. 

Enemy Characters/Character design:
  The enemies, while lacking in variety, are very detailed, each type filling a specific combat role. To that end, they force teamwork and cooperation. Assassin rats, strangler rats, fat fucks with magic, and fat fucks with magic 2.0 can all single handedly make short work of someone who strays from comrades.
  Straying from the band looting, or rushing ahead of the group like a micro coc dickhead, often results in instant incapacitation; From which the group may decide that you're a liability and ignore you. 

  Player Characters:
      This is another weakpoint Vermintide 2 has. 

  While the so called 'heroes' have frequent wholesome banter back and forth ( a feature sorely lacking in the industry)
   There is nothing really distinctive about them. Nothing really sets them apart. They are boring.
      The crew consists of 3 humans, one elf, and one dwarf. Of all the bland, and boring creatures to play as. 
 3 humans and two fantasy races that are still human. Ones tall, ones short. whoop-de-doo.  
  
 The most exotic one is Bardin the Dwarf. Atleast he kind of stands apart.
     Instead of say a lizardman, or a manfish, or beastman, or even a skaven, you get to choose from the most boring and generic races of the high fantasy world Warhammer. Of which Three characters are the same damn thing. 

  Each character has a variety of combat roles to specialize in, allowing you to find your favorite playstyle with your favorite character, which can be freely switched between missions.
  You get 3 for free, the 4th is dlc.

       Cosmetics:
         Most of the cosmetics are rubbish. I understand thats because they are 'lore accurate', so kudos for that, but in no way does this make them less rubbish.  
  Go to the nearest railroad, find two railway tie plates, (google an image if you dont know what those are), and strap them to your shoulders. Next, go walk for one mile. Just a mile. Not running, not swinging a sledge hammer that is 1\20th the weight of one of the ingame hammers. Not even jumping. Just walk. 
    One look at most of these ""armors"" is to a degree game ruining. There is simply no incentive to obtain stupid cosmetics. 
             The default armors are by far the best.

         Conclusion:

     In short, Vermintide 2 offers an excellent combat experience, along with a brilliant set of levels that were expertly put together, but suffers from lack of interesting characters with interesting motivations, a terrible 'musical' score, and a complete lack of incentive to play longterm. 
    Vermintide 2 will appeal most to fans of the warhammer franchise who will spend money on anything solely because its titled 'warhammer'.
     While the combat and environment alone are reasons enough to play, I'd never recommend anything at or around 50$ for this, and deeply regret spending that. However, for a steep discount, I can whole heartedly recommend.

The best way I can describe this game is ""Left 4 Dead: Warhammer Edition""

Imma be honest, I know practically nothing about Warhammer. I only got into this game because I used to be really into Left 4 Dead when I was younger, and Vermintide looked like it would scratch that itch for me.

I'm over 2.5k hours in now and the game is still as much fun for me as it was in the beginning. The melee combat is amazing! Attacking feels both smooth and weighty. The levels are stunning. The banter is just as entertaining as their L4D counterparts. There is a lot of flexibility with builds and play styles among the 20 different careers (think of careers like classes in RPGs). This game is incredibly easy to pick up  and play but very rewarding to master.

I do have a a few complaints though. 

I've introduced quite a lot people to Vermintide. One common issue I have among most of my friends is that playing from Recruit and Veteran (the first 2 difficulties) are *too* easy. All of my friends thought the game wasn't challenging and were losing interest because of how easy it was. The game really picks up and starts punishing you once you're able to play in Champion (3rd difficulty) but it takes a bit to get there if you're completely new to the game with no one to guide you. 

Personally, I don't feel like you're truly experiencing the full game until you've hit Legend and played that for a decent amount. Once you start reaching your level caps and getting 300PL items, you can *finally* start tinkering with builds. This is when the game starts getting *really* good. 

If you're new to the game and you feel like it's too easy or too boring, my advice to you is to stick with it a bit. Vermintide is like a fine wine; it gets better over time.",1565734470,1700329906,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The sun, once warm, became a distant witness to our parting. As the door closed, the room echoed with finality, the scent of her perfume replaced by faded dreams.

In the following days, I mourned her absence and the lost laughter that once filled our home. Solitude became routine, shielding me from the unpredictable ache of heartbreak. Colors of life faded to muted tones, mirroring my emotions in grayscale.

In the years that followed, I reluctantly curated our shared history through photographs and somber anniversaries. Amid wistful longing, a transformation occurred. Pain turned to acceptance, routine became a bridge to a new future. Days turned to years, mourning to resilience. The echoes of her laughter, once haunting, became a gentle reminder of a love that had flourished—a testament to the enduring spirit rising from the ruins of a broken heart.

Vermintide 2 is a great game and I like it because it is great and fun and I would play it a lot more if it didn't remind me of my b*tch dead wife. The elf is cool",1700114705,1700114705,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1.7 hours Update: Screw this game - Id rather have the disk space back. UNINSTALLED.

Some good bits, and I really enjoyed the first map's first act, and thought the comparison to L4D2 was very apt. I didnt realise it defaulted to online, so I took it offline for the second ""round"" of the game...

AND, act 2 of the first map IS FUCKING BROKEN! The annoying bastard dwarf keeps saying ""this way"" but that just takes me to some stupid head height wall by some water that the dumb characters cannot even climb out of. I wandered around the map for another 5 minutes and felt the following: FUCK YOU CUNTS YOU FUCKING USELESS FUCKS BEFORE RAGE QUITTING (The most enjoyable part of the game so far). 
I see that they worked hard to get the abysmal map layouts of L4D2 maps as well, leaving you running around in circles with pathetic ai characters that are WORSE than useless, they are misleading. I cannot find some special ""Climb"" option and dont remember the tutorial having anything like that, so Im fucked if I know what to do. 
And trying to find help on this sort of bullshit is next to impossible, vague, and generally useless, and I AM NOT FUCKING WATCHING YT TO WORK THIS SHIT OUT. ITS 20FUCKING23 YOU FUCKING USELESS PRICKS. 
None of the tried and tested and even BS basic guides for where to go in a level is completely non existent in this game (lights, broken paths, buildings and decorations, direction enemies come from, fucking fluro yellow paint even FFS). I was wandering around a forest with a wall around it, and the FUCKING SHIT GAME has not even a damn compass to help work out where you may want to search next, forget about a map. ""Make your way through the forest"" is the most useless instruction I think I have EVER seen in a game. Did they think we would settle down and live there?!
Im just glad I only paid $7 for this fucking shit piece of rubbish useless fucking game god damn Im sick of this half arsed bullshit in games, when all their time and effort goes into selling shit cosmetics and other useless crap for real money.
Ill probably keep playing again, but fuck me this is yet another POS game that manages to shit the bed at the very start of the fucking game.

Fatshark... You get more with honey than vinegar.

Meaning, don't be so predatory with your cosmetics and weapons. 

Have faith by giving the players what they really want it will only make them convince their friends to play and the hours will rack up on steam being the proof in the pudding. You have a really special game here in the combat, aesthetics, sounds, character development, genuinely this is perhaps the best game I've ever played.

By breaking apart the game into so many parts and pieces for the person to consume it feels disjointed and can be quite discouraging to pay $10 or $20 for a DLC simply for 1 weapon for a specific class someone is interested.

If you enjoy hack and slash games with some light RPG elements and are entrenched in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, this will probably hit for you. 

The reason for my rating is the lack of game and UI design.. Examples are that an enemy mage can spawn and begin casting a spell that kills you but if you don't hear a random player dialog line over the chaos indicating a mage is present, you die. There are no real indicators on the screen to tell you if a plume is enemy or friendly, where attacks are coming from, or where to go. 

The design decision is likely that they don't want to clutter your screen up with visual noise, but its really of-putting for those trying to immerse themselves. The game provides  no feedback to what you're doing wrong when you go down, you're just simply dead. 

These things unfortunately won't be fixed as the game has been put on maintenance mode at this point with no further content being developed.

Sadly each bot present makes the game significantly worse to the point that solo play is downright miserable.  Incompetent AI teammates is seemingly a requirement for these kinds of games but I haven't played one where even the basic pathfinding is utterly broken.

They love to stand and stare at a wall for 5 minutes trying to comprehend the last order you issued to them, after which they may actually do it, but probably not.  

Does your route include a ladder?  They will gladly jump on and show you their dance ""la incompetencia"" as they fidget up and down repeatedly until you just turn away in disgust and carry on without them.

Flamethrower or Minigun enemy attacking the team?  Sit back and enjoy the show as they join hands and plunge headlong into the stream of fire, gaining 1 inch at best as their health drains to zero. 

Another special enemy running away?  Enjoy being abandoned as they chase it halfway across the map leaving you to fight everything else, alone.  

Got a clear shot at an enemy?  Go ahead, try that ranged weapon, just try it!  Sure enough they will throw themselves into the line of fire to save their dearest Skaven and Chaos friends, and then proceed to repeat the most oft heard dialogue lines in the entire game as they chastise you for making the mistake of trying to use a ranged weapon with a bot present.

Got downed in a game with only bots?  Well, if they aren't chasing a Gas Rat to the hills, stuck on a ladder, sitting in a corner with their dunce cap on or bathing in enemy fire for funsies, they MAY actually come over to where you are.  Will they revive you though? No...

Someone actually got paid to program this games bots...let that sink in.  Not Monopoly money...real world currency!

Oh, incomplete maps are also pretty shameful.  Nothing like spending an hour on a Chaos Wastes run only to have to quit to main menu because the stairs to the exit on the last map just....don't load in....every single time I get that map.  I checked the community bug reports and it's been a known and acknowledged issue for over a year.  In the time since then, the developer has managed to release new cosmetic micro transactions and patch in nerfs to paid DLC careers and gear...but they can't find the time to eliminate a glaring, reported and reproducible bug that results in significant lost time and rewards.

I want to give this game a thumbs up, it's a lot of fun (when it works) and the content is great (when it loads in) but where the devs failed, they failed hard.",1685326230,1699585095,False,2,0,0.484025567770004272,0,True,False,False

But solo with bots works and works pretty well. Bots are competent-ish now, they will actually try to help you if you fall off a ledge. (Though I did have one weird bug where each bot came to help me and they all fell off the ledge one at a time) 

That said, there is so much value here for such little price (when it's on sale) it's impossible to not recommend. 5 characters each with several different classes makes for a wide variety of game play. Loot is hit or miss and the crafting stuff is simplistic and pretty dated. But the thing is, the game is fun.

This is not a game, but a torn rag.
The more they fix, the worse it gets.
There is no button for pause or for running, it's probably too complicated for them to find it.
Full of bugs and very bad balancing. Bots are useful and so dumb.
Levels, it is not certain whether you will pass it even at the lowest level because of the many problems. Even if you have time to browse.
Almost everything is the same big attacks after big attacks.
The game puts an awful lot of emphasis on grinding because the store only has junk that are skins.

☐ You forget what reality is
☑ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

This is a big game (more than 100 gb), but the game genuinely looks gorgeous. More than 100 hours in and I can still be amazed by all the scenery.

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

If you like hack-and-slash games, pick up this title. It's the ultimate one in that genre.

---{ Audio }---
☑ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf

Very gripping soundtrack that's also supports the gameplay. There's surround sound, to hear which direction enemies are coming from. There's very distinctive bits of music that tell you which special enemies are arriving, or if a mini-boss is on its way, and the general soundtrack throughout the game is present in perilous moments to build up the tension constantly. The sound design is really top notch in this title. 

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma

Too violent for your kids and grandma, expect a lot of gore. Like a lot, a lot. Killing in this game is awesome, gross and horrifying, and it's all you do. Plus the maps are usually filled with gore too. It's not a scary game, but it can be a gross game. 

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☑ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

As mentioned earlier, this is a big game, you'll need a decent pc. 

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

The basics are very simple: Click and slash, block, dodge, heal, use buffs and bombs and just click away until nothing is left standing. Once you up the difficulty, it's much more important to understand the small, hidden mechanics in the game and your class role. The map design can sometimes be confusing in figuring out where to go next. Organically they're quite easy to browse through, but if you want to find all hidden items in a run to get the maximum reward, expect to have to look up walkthroughs and guides. 

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding

There are no online rankings as far as I'm aware, and getting the strongest weapons and items in the game is actually fairly easy to achieve. Your characters also level pretty quickly, up to a max of 35, which you'll achieve very fast if you play as one character consistently. However, if you're a completionist, expect to have to start a second job with this game. After reaching max level, all you will really be doing is grinding for cosmetics. Some cosmetics can only be paid for through the in-game shop, others can be earned by grinding, which essentially makes this game a rogue-like. 'You completed all the levels? Cool, now do that 5 more times and you get a hat.'

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life

After more than 100 hours, I still do not really understand the lore beyond 'there's an apocalyps, baddies run rampant, go kill baddies.' but the story is actually quite irrelevant. Your party's characters will usually commit to banter amongst themselves which is entertaining enough to breeze through the story without having to really pay attention to it. 

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

Playing through a level usually takes 15-20 minutes which I think is quite long and finding all secrets will usually have you between 20-30 minutes. Given this game takes a rogue-like approach, I usually find I'm done playing after 4 or 5 maps, which is usually 60-90 minutes before it starts getting repetitive. And as mentioned before, if you wish to complete all challenges, expect to put in many, many hours.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

The base game is definitely worth the original price, but I'd only buy dlc when it's on sale. I recently bought all the extra roles you can play per character on discount, and although they're fun, I also still often find myself going back to content only the base game offers. Some dlc are things that should really be in the game for free (e.g. the hardest difficulty is locked behind a pay-wall), but I never feel like missing out. The dlc is good, but the base game is always still better. 

---{ Bugs }---
☐ Never heard of
☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

This is a very polished game and I've never really experienced bugs that ruin the gameplay. Entire game feels smooth af. Playing online can sometimes crash your game though. In the time I've played, I've experienced this 4 or 5 times. Not exactly mind boggling, but if you're playing a couple of games with a solid (random) team, it can be annoying when you're progressing quite well.

---{ ? / 10 }---
☐ 1
☐ 2
☐ 3
☐ 4
☐ 5
☐ 6
☐ 7
☑ 8
☐ 9
☐ 10

In the end, this is the perfect co-op roguelike fps game, combining sword- and gunplay into a very fun experience. This game can definitely get repetitive at turns, but eventually I always find myself going back to this title if I'm looking for a quick fix of intense gameplay. The soundtrack and especially sound design is amazing, the game looks gorgeous and runs like butter. If you liked titles like left4dead, this game is the best one I've ever encountered. Don't buy Darktide (yet), buy this game. Getting into random matches is very, very easy as there's still a very active player base. That's quite an achievement for a game released 5 years ago. You like gory, rogue-like hack and slash games? This title is for you.

I'd like to make it short but'... context...
The game start is awfully slow and grindy , if you want to make good builds you'll have to play a minimum of 300-500 hours to luckily have any weapon in the game in a good state. The recruit to champion gameplay is low risk. If you're okay at video games you'll face no challenge thus you'll left click spam to win and not have to search for optimising your gameplay and mechanics.
I almost forgot this game was in my library due to it... But covid came around and I was bored so I gave it another go.
I went to legend and cataclysm and there the game unveiled itself , finally !
I can't even explain how complex the game depth can become once you start having mods from the community to spice up your missions. I've got 4300 hours and I'm somehow learning stuff and perfecting my vermintide theory on a regular basis. 

So if you're interested in trying a pve game that can challenge you without a paper-scissors gamecycle (games that have unbeatable things without a specific item or build) or hpsponges that oneshot you , vermintide 2 will surprise you.

The game can be extraordinary fun with a group of 4 friends. 

Sadly, the game becomes exponentially more frustrating as the human aspect disappears, for the bots are simply no help on the higher difficulties. In order to succeed in any mission above Veteran, you have to know your hero and class perfectly, and carry every single mission with little to no mistake. You cannot rely on them, as they will fail you at every turn, without exception.

You'd think matchmaking would be a simple fix? But no, I can tell you what 90% of your matches will consist of making a break-neck rush to the end of the level for that sweet sweet chance at a red item. If you do not know the map like the back of your hand, you will be abandoned, kicked, or become a burden as your team patiently waits for you to find your way through an empty map.

*little interactions between team: people ignore marking enemies and usually ignore chat (due to heavy spawn of enemies), which more than not ends up in players not sharing resources or oposite- wasting them ""to help"" and basically zero actions to execute as team other than ""survive"" (like Athel Yenlui has task of channeling circles, Empire in Flames has barrels; more of those...

The community is better than average and does a pretty good job at sharing resources and avoiding protagonist syndrome, which is cleverly helped along by the games mechanics and enemy types. When you do have a bad teammate or session, there's very little time before you're in an entirely new lobby with nothing lost, and failure never feels crushing.

Finally, the atmosphere, lore, and overall feel of the game is incredible. The 20 classes are spread across five characters with tons of heart, snark, and banter to keep you entertained, despite eventually hearing repetitions.

Unfortunately, with this, the end of WIN7, 8, 8.1 came and those still lingering on those platforms might encounter issues trying to play the game. On top of that, due to DX12, players now require to build the shader cache, leading to hiccups in performance, until they've built shaders for most graphical assets, mostly effects.

The game remains a good one, although I don't quite like the introduction of micro-transactions some time ago (a year, a year and a half ago? Two years??). Either way, despite the flaws that I described, the game is completely playable and an excellent L4D-like to experience with friends / other players.

Y'know, this game would be much more alive if you guys gave it the same treament that GSG gives to DRG. Free earnable cosmetics are what keep people playing, its the carrot on the stick, people often prefer to wear the cosmetics they earned as opposed to the ones that they buy because it gives them a sense of achievement.

There are so few earnable cosmetics in the game, why do you think the player count is dropping? Because there's nothing to play for, give us more free cosmetics and you would definitely sell more premium cosmetics purely due to good will. I wouldn't expect FS to ever come to this realization though.

I've only ever bought one cosmetic DLC in my life, and it was for DRG, and it was because they showered us in so much free content that I wanted to support the devs. Although i'm sure there's some analyst at FS that would insist that price gouging dumb whales is still more profitable.

In total, players have 5 characters with 4 quite different careers to choose from. Melee, ranged and magic. They all have their strong and weak sides. On lower difficulties choice don't matter much but on cataclysm it does. Different characters have roles to play, provide buffs to the party or apply debuffs to the enemies. There are gear to be found and improved, some items stats to balance and determine what works and what is needed. Game story is quite short and uninteresting but it is not a focus of the game. There are 3 main game modes: Story Mode (around 25 minutes game match with certain objective - mostly get to the end and kill stuff), Chaos Wastes (long game sessions where players progress through areas and improve/switch around their gear) and Weaves (rated system with levels. Players act in modified areas from story mode and have different objectives, mostly speedrunning. Also, much harder content than anything). After completing the story mode players can replay same areas, set the difficulty higher, select deeds to apply modifiers like more disabling enemies, more stronger enemy types, no revives, no pickups etc., connect to Twitch which based on automated voting system with a time limit can spawn multiple bosses, certain enemy groups or provide buffs to the party/single player. The same for many players as me - reason to keep playing the game is to keep making your game more difficult and fun in the progress. Learn and improve. There are players that play on modded difficulty - harder than what is possible in the standard game. Soloing where are no melee players complaining after getting jumped by every disabler.
Some bullet points:      
1. Character design and main general style of the game is great.
2. Sounds and music - ok.
3. Fun and engaging gameplay. First person weapon animations are the examples for other games to be inspired.
4. Some careers are way weaker than others when playing on high difficulties and it takes a very experienced player to complete missions if there are no party member to rely on.
5. What's up with Pyromancer's special ability?. To kill a single elite enemy is NOT a special ability.
5. Even though friendly Bot AI is not very good I would argue that they don't need it because the game would be playing itself oppose to the players.
6. Debuffs aren't visually displayed on the enemies but can be seen on character sheets that if enabled in options can be seen by the party.
7. There are some areas that people don't want to play but get them when Quick Play is launched. There are no mission reset button so best option is to suicide which is quite a nonsense.
8. Microtransactions exist. There are skins to buy/ways to support the devs. Not a pay to win.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Pros:

Because who needs friends when you've got hordes of rat-men to smash, right?
Combat that feels like a satisfying thwack, a crunch, and a ""take that!"" all rolled into one.
Class variety that lets you go from Gandalf-wannabe to medieval Rambo in the span of a single loadout.
The atmosphere is so grimdark, you'll start to think that wearing spiked armor to work is a good idea.
Cons:

Say goodbye to your social life. It was nice knowing you.
The dialogue is so snappy and lore-heavy that you'll wish your actual friends were half as interesting.
Gameplay:

The gameplay here is like a hack 'n slash buffet. Every enemy type is just a different flavor of Skaven or Chaos to sink your teeth into. And let's talk objectives—whether you're escorting gunpowder barrels or rescuing prisoners, you'll find yourself engrossed in team-based tasks that range from mildly stressful to ""WHY ARE THERE SO MANY RATS?!""

Graphics & Audio:

Imagine if Tolkien and H.P. Lovecraft had a baby, and that baby decided to paint an apocalyptic hellscape. That's Vermintide 2. The audio is just as immersive, from the guttural roars of the Chaos Warriors to the chilling war cries of the Skaven.

Community:

You've got all sorts here: lore nerds, battle-hardened veterans, and newbies who think a Rat Ogre is just a ""big mouse."" The community is generally supportive, though they won't hesitate to scold you if you're wasting healing draughts like they're cans of energy drinks.

In Conclusion:

Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is a chaotic, brutal, and incredibly satisfying co-op experience. If you're looking to indulge in some mindless violence interspersed with deeply tactical gameplay and dark fantasy aesthetics, look no further. This game scratches that itch and then some. It's not just about surviving the horde; it's about reveling in the mayhem it brings.",1697734943,1697734943,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The character classes are not just fun; they're addictive. Whether I'm burning enemies as the Bright Wizard, sniping with the Waystalker, or tanking as the Ironbreaker, the variety keeps me coming back for more.

The map design is a work of art. From Helmgart's streets to Athel Yenlui's forests, the detail is mesmerizing. Even after many hours, I'm still captivated by these locations, thanks to dynamic events that add to the excitement.

The weapons? Phenomenal. The satisfaction of each swing or spell is unbeatable. Whether I'm cleaving through Skaven or taking shots from afar, the weapon choices and customization options are a game-changer.

Talent trees add depth and let me fine-tune my hero. It's a dynamic way to adapt to new challenges and tailor my experience.

But what truly seals the deal is the exceptional voice acting and chemistry of the Ubersreik 5. Their banter and camaraderie make me feel like I'm part of the adventure, not just a player. Whether it's Bardin and Kruber's humor, Kerillian's snark, Sienna's energy, or Saltzpyre's stoicism, these characters are friends, not just allies in the fight against Skaven and Chaos.

In short, Vermintide 2 isn't just a game; it's an experience. If you love co-op action with heart, look no further. Vermintide 2 is the game you've been searching for. (Also super hyped for Sienna's new class that is dropping tomorrow as per writing this review!)",1593440519,1697665835,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Update for 10/2023 - This is regarding my thoughts on Fatshark's follow up game to VT2, Warhammer: Darktide.  It looks like a year after Darktide came out with an overall score of 59%, they look to be turning it around with their Class Overhaul with a recent review score of 78% from about 2700 reviews.  Looking at some gameplay footage, the game looks appealing to me, and I would like to look at purchasing it, but the negative changes from VT2 still loom in my mind.

A great game to play cooperatively with your friends. As of today, it's worth noting that visually, it may seem a bit dated, but that doesn't take away from the countless hours of fun that await you as you massacre rats and other chaos-spawned creatures. The gameplay is simple yet entertaining, with quick matches and a variety of character classes that allow for a change in style. On the downside, after finishing the main campaign, it can become quite repetitive, although it offers some game modes that add a bit more life to the experience. It's important to keep this factor in mind.

In conclusion, if you enjoy medieval mayhem and saving the world through a good beating with your friends, THIS IS YOUR GAME 100%!!!

--------------------------------------------------------------

Un gran juego para jugar en cooperativo con tus amigos, a fecha de hoy cabe decir que visualmente ya se hace algo tosco pero eso no quita la cantidad de horas de diversión que te esperan masacrando ratas y otros engendros del caos. Una jugabilidad simple pero entretenida, partidas rápidas, variedad de clases entre sus personajes cosa que permite ir cambiando de estilo. Un punto en contra es que tras acabar la campaña principal puede llegar a ser muy repetitivo, aunque tiene algunos modos de juego que le dan algo mas vida al juego es importante tener presente este factor.

En conclusión si te gusta la jarana medieval y arreglar el mundo a base de golpes con tus amigos ESTE ES TU JUEGO 100%!!!",1697400501,1697400501,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

They took everything that was great about L4D2 and put it into a Warhammer fantasy game. That alone is the one thing that I think might turn people away- the fact that it's Warhammer. I wasn't a huge Warhammer fan before starting this game (I'm still not crazy about it), but it made me appreciate the universe as the cast of characters are charming and charismatic (unless you're a disgusting knife ear). The weaponry in this game is somehow completely over the top yet still feels realistic to use. No two weapons in Vermintide are the same and each one has their own unique and satisfying gameplan. While some weapons are objectively better than others, certain weapons have their own shine that can't be glossed over by some weapons. For example, my favourite weapon, the warpick, isn't very high up on the tier list. The swings are slow and it tends to clash with armoured enemies, stopping your cleave. But the charge attack. Oh man the charge attack. It feels amazing. You can one shot so many enemies by charing a heavy attack and bonking them in the face with the force of a thousand rock splitting dwarves. That's where the game shines- in you feeling like a real master of combat but not a god. On higher difficulties enemies can sneeze on you a few times and you drop dead- making combat a deadly dance of funneling enemies through shoves, abilities, and weapon swings. I didn't even get into the ranged weapons. The gunpowder weapons feel so damn good to use. Bows and crossbows are fun but nothing beats seeing that BANG followed by a rat dropping dead in the distance. Whenever you land a blow with a blunt weapon there's a satisfying crack followed by a body flying. Using a sharp slashing weapon? Fun slices as limbs go flying. My personal favourite are piercing attacks- they have this satisfying stab and pierce to them, throwing enemies back or slamming them to the ground. After my teammates kill an enemy, I often find myself giving them additional whack to finish them off even though they're already dead. It's just so much fun.

The few gripes I have with the game are the missions. They're fun, but they're not too memorable. A lot of them bleed into the next. With certain builds, a lot of the bosses become a joke. The difficulty is interesting to say the least. The easiest difficulty is a joke. You find healing items literally everywhere. Don't play the easiest difficulty. I started out on it and it made me bored. Play on veteran or higher. Scarcity of healing supplies, bombs, potions, etc. make this game a lot more fun in the long run. You find yourself fighting for every bit of hp because you don't know when the next healing supplies will show up. There's also a huge leap from challenging to very hard and from very hard to ""sorry. Looks like a rat breathed on you. You die now"". It takes getting used to but the harder difficulties will make sure you learn how to block and manage waves of enemies or you will get folded like an omlette. The gear system is something I'm also not too keen on. I'm not certain I still completely understand it, but farming chests is not the most fun thing in the world. Aside from that, the game is stellar. Very polished and well executed. Definitely worth a buy.

TLDR: Beating rats to death is fun. Do not ever revive your elf. 9.5/10. Get this game.",1697205897,1697205897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For now, it has much more content, which is cheaper(but wait for sales, as the game gets on incredible discounts, being pretty much a steal), the game is much more optimised and works good, unlike Darktide which can stutter on monster rigs, having troubles to run 60FPS(if at all), and definitely is much more rewarding, having actual cosmetics you can farm in-game currency and through in-game achievements instead of having a premium shop for real cash. Overall a big, big thumbs up for Vermintide 2, as not even comparing it to Darktide, it's a really good game, and definitely worth those... 20-30 euros for which you'll get everything, including DLC minicampaigns, new weapons, new classes etc if you get everything on sale, one of which(Winter 2022) is taking place right now.

Edit: Finished the campaigns on Cataclysm(Highest possible difficulty in game) with all the characters and all the DLCs I can say, it's one of the best games I've played.

The melee combat is much more refined, providing cleaner mechanics compared to Left 4 Dead 2. Weapon variety is huge, with options that allow for both breadth and depth in combat—long swords for wide-area damage, spears or axes for more concentrated attacks etc. Each character's unique abilities also add to the combat variety.

The additional elements—voicelines, level design, hidden items, and dynamic difficulty adds a lot of replayability.  Certain careers and maps are restricted to DLC, but there are frequent discounts. Also, these locked maps are accessible if the host of the game possesses the respective DLC.

As for the loot system, it primarily revolves around a 'power level' metric designed to scale with higher difficulties. While the impact of this system on gameplay could be debated, weapon styles and high-level gear do offer traits that modify their utility—traits such as ammo regeneration on headshots or the shared benefits of potions among team members.

In summary, the game presents a great co-op experience, excelling in particular areas like melee combat and character abilities, while leaving some room for improvement in aspects like loot mechanics.",1535916962,1696777223,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

That being said there are way too many bugs to ever justify anything above $20.  Dedicated servers still dont exist. Items still fall through floors, walls, gates, etc and it WILL BREAK YOUR GAME and you will have to restart.

Well worth it on sale.  Avoid like the plague at full price.  Fatshark should be ashamed of themselves for letting so many things which were wrong with the first one still make it through to this game. Latest bug involved seeing the random system messages with a healing effect going off every 10 seconds in Taals Keep.  WTF Fatshark?

UPDATE: I can no longer recommend this game for a few reasons.  The lack of dedicated servers and lag have become huge issues for me as of NOV2020.  Also the game now launches in some hybrid windowed fullscreen mode with the windows taskbar visible.  I have to reset it EVERY time I launch.

UPDATE PART TWO: Although the Triple XP has been great there has been a marked decrease in player ability at Champion and above difficulty.  I do not want to seem like a gatekeeper, but people are reaching this difficulty now 3x faster and do not have the appropriate skills to survive in a TEAM based game.  I do not have a good solution to this other than maybe if you take X dmg in a given difficulty to have to play Y number of matches at a lower difficulty.  Had a Kruber die 3 times at the gate in FT Brachs on Champ.

UPDATE PART THREE: It has been years and there are still massive issues with this game.  bugs will have you get hit and fly across the map to you death. It is amazing how little seems like it has been fixed in 4 years.  I would not buy Vermintide 3 unless it was massively discounted. 

2023 still no dedicated servers.  DLC maps are truly terrible and exist for misery.  I hope fatshark finally learns by VT3.  I know i did and I am glad I did not get Darktide. I am amazed after launch there are still so many players that do not listen/throw games/are genuinely bad.

There are many classes to choose from that have different styles of play. There is so much weaponry to choose from depending on the class you choose. I still don't know which class or character is my favorite. I pretty much like them all, some better than others though. You can play this game solo, but what is the fun in that? Unless I'm doing something specific like achievements or learning where all the tomes/grimoires are in the levels, I usually just play with others. Most of the time I host my own lobbies but there are sometimes where I just jump into an already established game or lobby. Doing that is some random chaotic fun!

The cosmetics in this game are many, but you don't have to have them to enjoy the game. Some of them cost actual money, but I am a poor penniless soul and can't see blowing my wad on such things, but if that's your jam go for it! Sometimes fashion is important in games.  

The game play is fast-paced but rewarding at the same time. This is truly a great underrated game in my opinion. The banter between the characters is sometimes humorous and adds a lot of flavor to the game. Decorating your Keep with trophies and paintings you earn throughout the game is also rewarding, but it's also just cosmetic.

This ""game"" is actually an ugly little redundant lobby because you can just push the inventory button and the entire lobby becomes useless. No world, no immersion,  only 4-7 maps with different zones that make you get bored after like the 3rd run & that's it! repeat till infinity...
The fact that many people think this is one of the best co-ops out is a testament to generations content with half ass garbage with no goals & no substance, while camping in your moms basement lobby. This is like 1/4th of an actual game...But hey if your entire world is a fucking cave i guess it doesnt even phase you anymore...does it?

Look...Warhammer has had a very long history of making janky ass, low quality knock off RTS games. Some of which are so bad they have become memes.

Vermintide is nothing more than a redundant lobby/queue with very little content and its like 5 years old.
Its by far the best that the series has ever done up to this point, but its a half finished game... 

You have like a dozen maps and a handful of characters, The story is just average crap about rat people..whew. Half the game is paywalled, There is literally no immersion factor and of course it will be heralded as a genre defining blockbuster by people who have not ventured outdoors or shaved their backs in 20 years and have been paying for all of the other WH trash. Afterall the only 3d representation of this dirty little neo british post-apoc universe thats not in overhead view and looks like its from the 80s lmao.... i get that, but its still irrelevant trash, like every other WH game.

I see the same thing with this title hands down with Darktide, A bunch of  sweaty, fanatical, hamburger helper stuffed Warhammer veterans defending half ass, boring & unfinished games because they have wasted 20 years of their lives playing cheap shitty knock offs & convincing themselves that they enjoy the generic macaroni & cheese better.. i get it...

This POS company just flat out lies & delivers nothing.
That is why this series always has been & always will be irrelevant.

The gameplay is fun, has great replayability in the form of higher difficulties, enjoyable characters that banter and piss eachother off, and a huge focus on teamwork.
Pick it up, preferably with a friend or two, and watch an elf one-shot a heavy-armor chaos warrior as it fails to even deal damage to a dwarf that is half it's size.

Vermintide 2 is some of the best Warhammer content I've experienced. Having a wealth of lore and worldbuilding to lean on, it takes different factors from Warhammer history and meshes them together in a way that can satisfy fans of the series and might even interest people who have only picked up this game.
Despite being a 4-man co-op that takes much of it's core from Left 4 Dead, Vermintide intensely mixes up the formula by relying on in-depth melee combat and hero builds, allowing players to dominate with effective skill and shine even in scenarios that require teamwork. It very much still is ""work together or die alone"" (as one of the loading screen tips would tell you), but players often get many more chances to take advantage of their builds, gear, and personal skill. Against the hordes of ratmen, beastmen ,rotbloods, and the game's own collection of special enemies and tank-equivalent monsters, combat still manages to feel grounded, weighty, and incredibly satisfying. Even the RNG-based gear system is unlikely to stop you from succeeding with good teamwork and effective combat tactics.
All of this culminates into campaigns broken up into missions that span the duration of about 2-3 chapters of a L4D campaign, and the game manages some fairly bombastic scenarios that avoid getting stale just as they avoid straying too far from the core gameplay. Some of the DLC campaigns miss, but the game itself is enjoyable without even one of them.

At this point in the lifecycle of both games I think that Vermintide 2 (especially for its price point) is absolutely worth your time, money, and energy even when compared to its newer cousin Darktide. 

The strengths of this game still shine through:

- Great and memorable character banter and gameplay storytelling
- Huge variety of classes and weapons
- Private Lobbies and fairly competent bots (only the host needs DLC!)
- A very reasonable loot system that balances reward for skilled play, RNG, and controlling RNG with earned resources
- Deep and fun combat system that scales well to difficulty - easy modes are easy, hard modes are hard, and your skill really makes a difference as to the outcomes of fights
- Multiple gameplay modes beyond the normal mission structure that offer pseudo-roguelite or ""Run-based"" experiences.

Overall highly recommend this game, one of the best multiplayer L4D-likes ever created and second only to L4D2 in my opinion.",1695663848,1695663848,True,0,0,0.499385595321655273,0,True,False,False

Edit: Very good

Edit 2:
It seems to me the devs are completely out of touch with its player base and has no clue of what game they have made. They tried to run these free weeks or whatever they are called but for long time players there is absolutely no reason to be excited over the game other than self found satisfaction from the existing content. The Halloween events are really fun but instead of releasing more themed events they just slap on a free week and tweet about it. Most people install the game over the free weeks just delete the game after a few games. Instead they could produce meaningful content and I am sure people will pay for it. 

Things such as free DLCs are just one additional map and its free because they know they can't sell for peanuts. This brings on to DLCs such as Sienna. It took almost two years for it to come out compared to half a year for other career DLCs. There has also been no communication from fatshark in its usual style and coupled with no meaningful content releases are the reasons that many of the players have quit as they moved on to Darktide and realised its even worse than the state of Vermintide 2. The devs tried to balance out the release of Darktide and Sienna DLC ultimately didn't work out and we are now left with a half baked game that no one really plays and killing off their most popular game at the same time.

Hate to say that the game seems like it won't have any growth potential anymore after Sienna DLC as we can tell from fatshark's emails that they are constantly working on Darktide to revive it somehow xd. I'm glad for the people that has quit so they don't have to see the immensely skill inflated coru staff Sienna players now spawning in dead skeletons to fight as if they're playing BTD5 then telling everyone they have the highest damage in the official discord server. Not to even mention that it took fatshark months to address the flame walk bug that kills patrol in seconds. The game is fun but the devs simply does not know how to maintain their playerbase.",1626370029,1694808181,False,0,0,0.512602329254150391,0,True,False,False

This game offers one of the best co-op combat experiences out there. The Warhammer aesthetic and the heroes didn't appeal to me at first - I only liked the wood elf because she evoked Lord of the Rings, so that was my gateway to trying this game out - but the devs did create a convincing world that's faithful to a beloved tabletop and multimedia fiction universe. 

You come to Vermintide for the combat, and the combat is good. That's really what you need to know. The skill floor is very low. Recruit and veteran difficulty are very approachable for casual players. The skill ceiling is VERY HIGH. You are almost playing a different game each time you step up in difficulty. Suddenly you have to pay attention to your dodge, your positioning, audio cues for spawns, timed blocks and parries, pushes and stagger, and sticking with your team.

A tide of individually un-threatening enemies and a steady drip of disablers, elites, and bosses keeps you on your toes and makes for a really rewarding co-op experience. 
The depth of combat/movement mechanics allows for a ton of skill progression if you care for the more challenging modes. 

Bonus points: There are a ton of different weapons, and they actually FEEL different. Even between several types of swords, they each have different strike patterns for heavy and light attacks and different strengths and weaknesses. Combined with the trait tree changing your ""career skill"" or ults and the different passives on each hero, you have a lot of variety in playstyle. Ranged, melee, and spellcasting alike.

Now for the negatives. Vermintide 2 is generally stable, but does have issues with crashing that seem unrelated to hardware specs (players who can run the latest and greatest without issue may face crashes here). I eventually figured out updating my BIOS and tweaking graphics settings could keep it stable. It's really demanding on your CPU.
The online co-op uses peer-to-peer (P2P) networking (not sure w/ or w/o relay servers). So this game works better if you have a reliable internet connection. Every once in a while, a host will simply close their game, leaving you in the lurch. Overall, I get good technical performance with occasional really annoying hiccups. Compared to other P2P games, this one's actually on the stronger, more reliable side, for what it's worth.",1686234911,1694401799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Everyone should play this game. Unless you intend to use Saltzpyre. Then i say, there's not enough room in the End Times for the two of us.

But in all seriousness. Its a very good game, with a wonderfully deep combat system, thanks to all the animation interrupts and movement tech mixed sneakily in the game. While likely unnecessary if youre good enough, they most definitely help amp up the ratcorpses per second. And faster feeling game = more dopamine. 
The Ai Director and all the mobs have 2 modes. Normal and Rude. Rats finding interdimensional ways to get behind you this round? Rude. Hookrat outfootsied you? Rude. Assassin methodically made his way behind a Monster and pounced you through him? Rude. Leech grabbed you while on the blight merry-go-round? Rude. First thing a Black Rat did was push you off a high place to your death? Rude. Two Blight Stormers? Rude. Enemies on Ice the Disney Musical? Rude. Patrol spawned right in your face? Rude. 400 Beastman Archers? Rude. Chaos Wastes Monster immune to Ranged Damage AGAIN? Rude. What you thought was a chaos jobber suddenly has two axes? Rude. You didnt stagger that guy cus he was still on the tail end of his climbing/dropping animation and got whacked? Well that one's on you. Assassin is stalking about and you have a heart attack only to realize that was actually a dwarf highlighted in a green outline and you just accidentally broke his jaw with your bullets? Im sorry.

But the moral of the story is to git gud, ain't it? That's why you get all this secret combat tech. To be rude back. All in all, the game is fun, and even more fun when you start dishing out as much as the game throws at you. Ive played too long to conjure up an actually coherent reason to play the game, so just know that there's alot and you should go do it. I leave you with this.

Gameplay is like I'm used to from the first part: hack, slash, block, push, dodge, nothing too fancy, but fun. Levels are okay, they look nice, but you can't really explore or check everything out, since there will be hordes so you can't really admire stuff. 
Combat is fun in general, sometimes the hit detection seems a bit off, but i can't say for sure without seeing hitboxes and taking a closer look.
Some of the better weapons are locked behind dlc, which is something I strongly dislike, and the armors you get on legend difficulty look like the base armors, only a different colour or with more gold applications, which is sad. Also many outfits don't match the helmets, colour-wise. The system is okay-ish, but i've seen better in other games.
As for equipment and progression, it is a bit slow at the start, but gets better later (although still sluggish), until you reach max power, still not as satisfying as I'd like, but still okay, I could work with that.

What personally bugged me the most is the tooltips. Sometimes it takes a google search to find out what a weapon or skill can do, since the tooltip won't explain anything, and sometimes the tooltips are just incorrect. This game ain't exactly brand new, and it still seems to be a problem. 

If you can get it on a sale, you might consider it, if you got one or two friends to play with.
Droprates for red items (rarest stuff) are decent enough, not too rare, not too common. 
But the game has a definitve endpoint when you got most of the stuff you want/need so the playtime (at least for me) is limited. 
The bots act as stupid as in the first Vermintide. I know this is an ""online game"" and meant to be played with friends, but you need a mod to make the bots play even half decent. And as for random online play, maybe i was just unlucky but in an average of 6/10 games in quickplay you get either (depending on difficulty) 
a) players that don't know how to block, dodge, or both 
b) players that flame you for not having all red items and at the same time say it's all about skill. or 
c) players that gulp down healing items while either having more than 50% hp or the natural bond effect so that its effectively wasted. 

[u] Tl,dr: Fun game for a limited amount of time, get at sale but avoid some of the dlcs. I'm glad i bought and tried it, but ultimately, I wouldn't recommend it. Last game I'll buy from this developer - no hard feelings, other people may like their work, but me and my friends felt a bit disappointed.

You even get to use a gatling gun with the engineer.

It's easy to learn, hard to master. Looks damn great, plays damn great. Has good amount of content and it's addictive. The character's personality are good and funny at times (like every time the Slayer screams when using his active ability).

My only wish that i'm sadly sure will never happen is to make all premium careers free to unlock in-game, just like the rest of them. Would be great to unlock them at level 35 to give more incentive to go 5 more levels after unlocking the last talent at level 30.

[b]TL;DR[/b]

[b]Very repetitive:[/b] run from point A to point B, killing the same waves of enemies over and over again.

[list]
[*][b]Bad movement:[/b] You move slowly, there is no sprint, and you can jump only over small obstacles.

[*][b]Bad melee combat:[/b] It is unsatisfying, much worse, and more primitive than in Dishonored or Killing Floor's 2 Berserker perk.

[*][b]Bad shooting combat:[/b] Guns are primitive in handling, like in mobile games; they don't require skills like recoil control, etc. You can't even aim with most guns.

[*][b]Repetitive combat:[/b] Spamming the left mouse button until you out-melee hordes of enemies.

[*][b]Bad classes:[/b] Instead of like in KF2 or PD2, where every perk is unique, here all classes have the same weapons: one melee weapon (often sword-like) and one firearm (often shotgun-like). The classes feel too similar and are boring to play with after a few rounds.

[*][b]Bad enemies:[/b] Instead of, like in KF2, L4D2 or PD2 where you had different enemy classes that required different approaches to kill them, here you even kill elite enemies the same repetitive way: Just spam the left mouse button. 

[*][b]Very grind heavy:[/b] The whole point of finishing missions and 'vacuum cleaning' the levels is about getting lootboxes with a higher chance of good-quality gear and weapons, that turn out to give you 1% more damage or accuracy.

[*][b]Bad stimulus of playing the game:[/b] In KF2 or PD2, you replay the same level dozens of times  as the combat is wonderful, and you enjoy the different gameplay tactics. Here, the gameplay feels like an unsatisfying but necessary side job barrier for the sake of the main part: grinding the player's progression and collecting loot boxes.

[*][b]Microtransactions:[/b] After 5 years, I returned to the game, and the only thing I noticed in the game were [strike]gameplay improvements[/strike] tons of paid DLCs, microtransactions, and in-game shops the developers added.

It's a fantasy horde FPS melee/shooter.  You get to kill hordes and hordes of Skaven (rats) and Norsca (basically Vikings) savages.  There are five characters with three base classes (careers) and one extra paid DLC class for each character.  The fifteen base classes are more than enough to have fun with though.  Each is very distinct with different weapons, tools/abilities, and play styles.

Once you've found a class, weapons, and a talent spec that you enjoy, there's a crazy amount of variety in the game with the maps available (with some good art design and lots of Warhammer Fantasy stuff to look at), and the number and composition of enemy forces you'll fight along the way.  

Add in a few friends for the four player co-op, and, as far as horde shooters go, it's a hell of a lot of fun.

Now the bad.

The loot system in the game is abusive and actively makes the game and the community worse.  When you beat a map, you get a loot chest generated based on your performance during the map.  If you die, you essentially get nothing (beyond some XP which will, eventually, get you a ""commendation"" chest which basically just gets you junk you can shard for crafting materials).  You can get higher quality chests by gathering items on the map that will make it even harder for you to complete the map successfully (by taking up healing item slots and by lowering your health).

When you do complete maps successfully, and go to open your loot chests, the game rolls to find out what kind of loot you'll get.  The most important stat on your items is the power level.  This stat ranges from 5 to 300.  When the roll is done, the game picks a power level that is in the range of -10 to +5 of the highest power level item you've received previously (whether that item is equipped or not, or whether it has been sharded for crafting materials or not).  If you want to play this game at high levels, you want to get all of your items up to 300 as soon as possible, but this system is designed to draw out that grind as long as possible.  It will be dozens of hours of play before you're getting level 300 items out of chests.  Items also have a rarity system (the color of the item, white, green, blue, orange, red) that determines the secondary stats that appear on items beyond the power level.  Red (veteran) items are always level 300 and have secondary stats guaranteed to be at their max values (e.g., some items can have +crit chance from +3-5%.  A red will always be +5% whereas items at lower quality levels will have that value in the range of 3-5%.  You could have an orange that's just the base +3%).

If you are playing this game at high levels, Legendary or Cataclysm, there is IMMENSE pressure to make sure that you are playing your class with certain talents, with gear that is all at power 300, and with stats that are max, or close to max, and are min/max'ed the right way.  As it is a team game, you are also at the mercy of your teammates and how they choose to play the game.  If they choose not to stick together, or go for the same objectives you are (for instance, getting the books that give you better loot chests at the end), you can have a bad experience.

Because this game is such high difficulty and so ruthless on gear and how you play the game, the player community has an astounding level of toxicity.  In just this weekend, I've encountered multiple TK'ers, people shouting racist slurs into voice chat, and multiple lobby leaders rage quitting and causing all progress to be lost on the map.  Do you enjoy playing through 30 minutes of a map at high difficulty for a chance at getting loot only to have the lobby leader (it's a P2P game and there are no dedicated servers) rage quit at the last minute and end the map?  I know I do!

Oh, speaking of which, let's say you've finally managed to find a good talent spec, decent items, and a decent team, and you've managed to beat some maps on Legend difficulty with a full book run so you can get the best possible chest with the best chance of getting red items!  Congratulations!  Even if you've done a ""full book"" run, you *still* need a large amount of luck to go from a ""Generals"" vault to an ""Emperors"" vault.  The General has a less than 10% chance of giving you a red.  The Emperor has a less than 20% chance of giving you a red.  Even if you've made the map as difficult as possible with the ""full books"", you still need luck to go from a General to an Emperor.  And then you still have more RNG to hope to get a red item.  In practice, I feel like my red drop rate is probably half of what I've seen online.

Oh, and when the game is actually running through its RNG to determine what quality of loot chest it's going to give you and what loot it generates when you open that chest, it forces you to watch gambling machine style flashing lights and animations straight out of casino gambling machines.

If you can play this game at lower levels (stay on Veteran or Champion difficulty) and not get caught up in the loot grind, you can probably have more fun with it than I do.

If you are the type to get stuck chasing loot and want to min/max your characters and their items and specs, you are in for a world of pain with very difficult / high skill ceiling game play, and one of the most elitist and toxic game communities I've ever played with.

And the devs are totally ok with all of this.  This is their vision.  Poopy loot grind, toxic players, and everything.

Oh, and that player community?  It's a mostly dead game.  Take a look at the player stats.  Most days have a peak of under 5K players.  https://steamdb.info/app/552500/charts/

I've still poured over 500 hours into this game.  I wish I hadn't.  Unfortunately, I *am* the type to get sucked into the loot grind and min/maxing my characters.  And I *do* enjoy the core game play of horde shooters and killing hundreds of enemies.  I just wish this game didn't have the super toxic player base and the awful loot grind.

Honestly, buy Deep Rock Galactic instead.  You can have the same 4 player co-op PvE experience, with a player base that is so much more positive, and the game doesn't have the abusive loot box system and incentive to min/max everything.  Easily 3-5x the player count at any time.  Even more variety on missions.  And a player base that is incredibly positive and helpful.  I've encountered more toxic teammates on Vermintide 2 *this weekend* than I have in the last four years of playing Deep Rock.

Of course it's not the ONLY genre I can appreciate but outside of Minecraft there is no other genre or game I have invested so much time and love into than Warhammer: Vermintide 2, taking the blueprint from other legendary titles and enhancing it and sticking with it through these five unforgettable years.

The characters are all slam-dunks with personalities and insights that do an incredible job of immersing you in their universe, while also not shoving it aggressively down your throat like they did in other games (Darktide). I for one find it really easy to connect with Markus Kruber who is by far my favorite character in the entire Warhammer universe.

The combat, while not perfect, for all intents and purposes is satisfying, skillful and rewarding, I for one lean towards melee combat but neither range or melee is below average on impact.

The evolution and progression of you as a player is paced pretty well. It took me over 1000hrs to get semi-comfortable with LEGEND difficulty. Another 2000 to get comfortable at CATACLYSM. And if that's not gonna keep you occupied for long, you still have 19 other play-styles you can learn and master to extend the lifespan of your experience for much, much longer. Oh yeah and there's like a bunch of different game-modes you can also mess around with- SPEAKING OF.

While not all updates are created equal, the massive Chaos Wastes update was a perfectly immersed secondary game-mode that provides a fresh and unique journey towards a climactic and triumphant finale. But it still keeps the traditional elements of game-play to keep you hooked!

The enemies are pretty balanced, the maps are breathtaking and fun, the crafting system... exists... which I would say is not really something you'd expect to just be delayed a bunch. Like come on Darktide get it together, you're supposed to be BETTER than V2 right?

There was a time when things looked bleak. Back when I had around 1300hrs, this game went through what I can only ironically call the Dark age of Vermintide's existence. No updates, bugs, crashes, lag, it got bad for a while. But to Fatshark's undying credit, they have stuck with this game and poured their heart and soul into this game even recently so. New maps, new careers, new items. I don't know what comes next for Vermintide, but you can sure as hell count me in for when it arrives.

Five thousand hours is just around the corner. It's hard to even think about that number. But it's coming. And I'll admit, as far as ""lifespans"" go, I might be closer to the end than the beginning. It's not a thought that I relish. But I will continue to play this game and love this game. I love Vermintide 2. And clearly a lot of other people do too. So thank you Fatshark for such an amazing game.",1566134898,1693193193,True,2,0,0.531024515628814697,0,True,False,False

You are always in four-person teams rushing headlong into swarms of opponents on 15 minute long missions. Teammates can sometimes start as bots but usually humans take over. (You can also choose to play with all bots ... which was tempting!).

The combat mechanisms are great and I love how the different melee actions and weapon choices/upgrades work.

The BIG problem for me is that you'll often have someone toxic in your team. They can literally bump you out of the mission and back to the start screen, shoot you to death, or simply abandon you so that you spend a lot of the game being beaten-up and left captive (unable to do anything until rescued). They are the people who call new players ""ret**d idiots"" etc.

Also, a player doesn't have to be that toxic to spoil your fun a bit. Players who want to always get all the best items are incentivised by the game's mechanism to rush off and leave you, searching for hidden grimoires etc. Sure, you can try and keep up with them. But do you really want to spend each game sprinting 200 yards behind a powergamer working hard to keep up? To them, that's the game and you are stupid noob if you don't get that! To me, I just wanted a cool dungeon-crawler with teamwork.

The Vermin's, Northlanders and Beastmen are plentiful and dangerous. The mechanics are easy to learn but hard to master, which make for a fine recepe for the ambitious exterminator and Sigmar worshipper.

Despite being a mostly melee game, there are a lot of playstyles which enable you to experiment with different builds and abilities.

The characters and their interactions enrich the game world and the playing experience by setting the mood of a bickering group of eccentrics that fight through the impossibilities of the End Times.

You have Markus Kruber a mercenary who's your average Joe for a Warhammer character, Victor Saltzpyre a stirn and abrasive witch hunter, Bardin Goreksson with the personality of Gimli from LOTR, Kerillian a Wood Elf with a heart of lead and Sienna Fuegonasus who is on fire, literally.

Each character has multiple careers or subclasses to choose from. Each career has its own mostly unique skills and a unique ultimate ability which synergizes well with different weapons and traits. You can turn Bardin in to a stun-monster, a tank, a Slayer who jumps half naked into every patrol they can reach or give him a mini-gun which regenerates ammo by giving it the old crank.

There are a lot of different missions which mostly last 15-30 minutes depending on the difficulty level and with the free edition of the chaos wastes even a completely new game mode.

While on a mission your primary concern next to the main objective in form of a ""go there and do something"" mission type, is to not die by dodging, blocking and preemtively killing enemies. After you inevitably take some damage, you can heal yourself with very limited healing potions or bandages or generate temporary health by stunning, cleaving, critting or simply by killing more enemies which lets you seek out the danger, which is good, because there can be a lot of it. When a horde, a patrol, special ememies, a boss or a combination of these comes for your team, you should pick a place to hold. Thus begins the fight for your wiggle room, because the only situation where your death is assured, is when your guard gets broken, you can't dodge anymore, and your ultimate is on cooldown. This makes for an exquisite challenge because you and your team are powerful but you can also lose if you allow the enemies to corner you.

There is a unique thrill in being the last man standing and being able to clutch.

Sadly, the community is pretty small, sometimes it's hard to get a party of 4 before you start the mission (disclaimer: you can wait for a full party, 4 players, but sometimes people gets eager to start and bots are not the smartest).",1691604747,1691604747,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I dont know if you like this kinda games its good i guess, but left 4 dead was way better than this.

Well when im drunk or dont want to realy think just smash some face i play this with a ps controller. With mouse i dont like it but with controller it feels natural. Otherwise it has some depth of gameplay and its fun to play the different classes of the old world but deep down this game aint that special im afraid. I do enjoy it so now i can recommendit.

Overall fighting mechanics in this game is good and bad at once, you can dodge out of the way but if you don't do it well you'll not avoid damage because enemy cheating and has perfect accuracy halfway through their attack animation.

Whole movement system isn't great, there's no sprint or reason to crouch, but can dodge in full plate armor, stamina isn't stamina but just defence meter.

So many things are off about this game but so many things are state of the art (imho)

A fun hack and slash game purging heretics. Game play is repetitive, however it is a very fun base model that takes quite awhile to get tired of. A number of different classes/subclasses that add a good bit to variety in play. If you can get a full group of friends to play with you, game goes to a whole other level as you force your way through waves upon waves of enemies.

wow.
look, i've liked this game so much that i have no words to say about it, but i will do my best.
it's absolutely great for you and your friends to game in coop (yell at each other), but if one plays it alone/with bots/with random people, then it's nice to relax and use your spine memory to slay skavens and chaos warriors (though i like both skavens and daemons hmmm....i hope they won't beat my ass next time or i will feel myself pretty miserable). so. one of the best hack and slash game i had in my life. also i like the storyline and i like the way characters communicate (i will play futher and upgrade other characters than kerillian, 'cause i am curious about plot and their relationships. i am quite serious about it - just listen to them while slaying some rats!)

Dont go in expecting a single player campaign with story with a plot.
The plot is entirely missing as you fight simply to survive in the end times rather than to save humanity. You wont be getting any kind of closure with the campaign except for fighting bosses. However, the voice acting is amazing and the character interactions are very well-written.

[h1][b][u]Gameplay Summary[/u][/b][/h1]

[list]
[*] Plays like Left for Dead and Darksouls combined. Slash, block, dodge and push your way through hordes of enemies. Clench your butthole when a boss spawns with specials during a horde.
[*] Dodges dont make you invincible, you have to physically move out of an attacks way.
[*] Play as 1 of 5 characters with a choice of 3 Careers (Talent trees) for each character.
[*] Choose from a variety of weapons. Each weapon has different Stamina points and properties (armour penetration, stagger strength).
[*] Its a common misconception that you will be spamming attacks to clear hordes, which is only true for a few weapons. Each weapon has a moveset of its own. You'll have to alternate between Light and heavy attacks to create your own moveset. Movesets and combos differ between weapons. For example: Using a heavy attack after using push attack will result in Heavy 2, not Heavy 1. This ensures that you dont resort to button mashing.

[/tr]
[tr]
[td]	1. Large variety of weapons and careers to choose from

	2. Weapons combos differ from weapon to weapon, ensuring that players dont resort to mere button mashing 

	3. Characters interactions are pure gold and are the primary way of narrating the lore of the game. Characters races and backgrounds are well picked, It's fun watching the Witch hunter berate the Witch or to see the Elf doing the same to everyone else.

	4. For those with a penchant for roguelike elements, Chaos wastes is an excellant game mode where you have to make do with whichever weapons and boons you happen to come across.

	5. Fun with friends

	6. Mods are fully supported

	7. DLC maps are playable for everyone if the Host owns the DLC.

	8. Devs listen to the community. It should be noted that the [b]Devs added an exploit back to the game simply to reduce the grind for Red items[/b][/td]

[td]1. Save files are server tied despite the game using P2P connections. Game cannot be played online and will become unplayable when the servers are inevitably shut down.

2. May be too hard for your taste and boring when you play on easier difficulties

3. Lack of story may be offputting for some players although the dialogue more than makes up for it. 

4. Bot levels are based on the levels of your characters. This may be a problem if you only play a single character and start playing on higher difficulties with Level 1 bots.

5. Cataclysm difficulty is locked behind a paywall (Winds of Magic DLC). In my opinion, its bad practice to lock non-content based gameplay behind paywalls. Winds of Magic DLC deservedly has a low rating on the marketplace. I bought it anyway since I enjoy the base game a lot and need to play it on the highest difficulty.

6. Game does a bad job at explaining its mechanics and providing important info in general. Each type of attack of any weapon has modifiers. For Example, L3(Light Attack 3) of Sword and Dagger has amazing Armour penetration but the game does not tell you so. [b]Luckily, you can add a mod to gain access to such info within the game itself.

[h1][b][u]Characters Summary[/u][/b][/h1]

[b]3. Dwarf (Bardin) [/b]- Access to both Light and Heavy weapons depending on career. Choice between Ranged/Super Tank/Berzerker in Careers
[b]4. Witch (Sienna) [/b]- Glass cannon with mostly light weapons and amazing horde clearing capabilities. All of her careers are damage focused and only change her playstyle.
[b]5. Witch Hunter (Saltzpyre) [/b]- Access to both Light and Heavy weapons depending on career. Choice between Support/Boss killing/Support + Damage in Careers",1677670100,1690720587,True,49,2,0.835726737976074219,0,True,False,False

It is very obviously a melee/fantasy oriented take on the Left 4 Dead model, with more than just a thin veneer of Warhammer Fantasy splashed on top. Each of the four characters and their class options feels fully fleshed out and imminently playable. None of them are necessarily better than the others, they all lean into a playstyle of some sort. All are meant to support and be supported by a team. Going ""lone wolf"" is just a recipe to die alone. Depending on the difficulty and your skill level you might do ok running solo through a mission, but it's entirely possible your team will struggle and or fail without that fourth member there to keep them going. The game leans heavily into encouraging the group to work together, especially as you advance the difficulties.

The DLC's are great to have but the base classes available to each character are all great in their own right, the DLC classes are not overpowered ""must haves"" - if you can catch em on sale as I did, then I highly recommend them.

The cosmetics are generally not great, and always not worth the cash. But there are cosmetics you can buy with the in game silver coins you earn. Many of those are just fine for making the character you prefer to play stand out a bit etc. Ignore the actually cash shop cosmetics unless you just really don't mind throwing money around on games like this, in which case if you're enjoying the game and think those look cool, go for it. Some of them are pretty cool looking.

The game is ok if looking to meet up with random folks and crush some Skaven and Chaos stuff, but the game really shines when you have a group of 3-4 people who can play together as a group. Randoms can be great fun, but it's a roll of the dice. You might also get someone who's oblivious to what's going on and leaves you fighting a horde + a boss to run off into the deeper part of the level to rescue another player who got downed earlier. It happens, that's the internet, not the games fault. That said, it's not always easy to find folks to play with.

The atmosphere is still top-notch, immersing you in the chaos and terror of the Warhammer universe. The environments are even more detailed, and the enemies are more grotesque and challenging than ever.

The combat Itself is even better this time around. The characters have new weapons and abilities, making the gameplay even more diverse and engaging. Slicing through the Skaven and Chaos hordes has never been more satisfying. They really upped the ante with the action, and you'll feel like a total badass!

Of course, the cooperative play is still a major highlight. Team up with your friends or join forces with other players online. Communication and teamwork are as crucial as ever, and the sense of camaraderie when you conquer tough missions together is unbeatable.

Vermintide 2 also adds new enemy types and special events, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. You'll face even greater challenges, and the game constantly throws surprises your way.

But, as with any game, there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Some players might find the difficulty level to be quite challenging, especially in higher difficulties. It can be a tough nut to crack, but that's also part of the appeal for many players.

The sequel has addressed some of the AI issues from the first game, but you might still encounter a few odd moments. Nothing game-breaking, though.

Overall, Vermintide 2 is like a solid game for me. It takes everything that made the original great and polishes it to perfection. If you loved the first game or are a fan of co-op action with a dark and thrilling atmosphere, this sequel is an absolute must-play.

Prepare to be hooked, my friend!

Vermintide is a 4 player first person, class-based, melee focused game. Ranged weapons play into it and are a vital part of survival, but your main toolset for handling the hordes of skaven/chaos/beastmen are the melee weapons. As you move through the different maps completing your objectives hordes with simple grunts and fodder will be assisted by various stronger elite enemies as well as specials. The specials are similar to the special zombies from Left4Dead, and can either pin you down with warp fire or bullets, or disable you completely to the point of needing aid from your friends (e.g. hunter from left4dead). 

Added to this mini-bosses can spawn as well (called monsters in this), and chaos can ensue as a horde with specials spawn at the same time.  

This means that your party needs to consider different roles if you aim to survive on higher difficulties. You need a balance of monster killers, horde clear and special/elite snipers. The gameplay and feeling of bashing rats is great and the sheer chaos that can develop during a run is a lot of fun. This is why I definitiely recommend it. 

That is not to say there aren't issues. The weapon attribute system feels lackluster and is mainly an annoyance. The coveted ""red items"" aren't really worth the effort since all they do is give you the max stats on the attributes, something you can get close to by re-rolling later on. This means that there isn't that much motivation to grind later on, something I don't mind as the gameplay is still fun and the challenge of getting through the highest difficulty is my main motivator. 

The issue with the DLC Winds of Magic is also there. Beastmen simply aren't as fun as I hoped, they are only an annoyance for me. They had issues with being able to distinguish the different types early on, something I still feel is a problem. They also introduced a different game mode with the weaves, which has a separate attribute leveling system for the weapons you use in the weaves. I never played this apart from a couple of weaves as I don't see the point of grinding up my weapons AGAIN, and the modifiers to the weaves aren't all that special to attract my attention. If the system for weapon attributes allowed you to do things you couldn't in ordinary gameplay I might play weaves to experiment with it, but they are simply the same systems but in weaves you outright pick the attribute you want instead of rolling.

All in all VT2 has a split personality, somewhat weak endgame, but it is a solid co-op experience with the potential for a lot of fun. It stays faithful to a lot of the lore, and has interesting characters and group dynamic. In a world which needs more good co-op games this is one of them.

Edit: 
Might as well write a line or two about the last addition to the gameplay loop of VT2. Chaos Wastes is all I play these days in. It is a ""rogue-like"" type of mode where you head out into the wastes and play a number of maps with various modifiers on them, eventually reaching the Citadel of Eternity. The maps feature a ""standard setting"" (e.g. Slaughter bay or Holseher's Tower), but other parts/tiles of the map can be randomly fitted together. This introduces some replayability as other times you may be entering a particular place from the opposite direction. Or other times a certain map tile is not there. 

The maps may have modifiers adapting the spawn rate of different enemy types (e.g. specials or elites). Then there is the possibility that a Chaos God has ""cursed"" the map (khorne making blood whirlwinds or slaanesh draining your hp steadily). You will, however, be able to buy ""boons"" that are essentially new traits over the course of the run. These can vary from removing the consecutive dash penalty to being able to duplicate an item you have on you when you use your special ability. This is what makes Chaos Wastes fun. 

The different Chaos Gods' effects brings, well, chaos to the run. You are never quite certain when all hell will break loose, but when it does it is typically just stupid fun. Then that high of suddenly getting all those boons that synergize and turn you into a nuclear warhead just clearing the map one Morgrim bomb at a time. 

My friends and I play at Cataclysm difficulty, and we often fail our runs (mainly for running non-meta builds, because who wants stale gameplay), but we always return for some more chaos and suffering. That in itself is a good indicator of how much fun this is. Why Fatshark missed the opportunity of bringing some of these mechanics into Darktide is beyond me, but hey, that is what they do best.

As I am not that well versed in Warhammer I cannot really speak to the accuracy or lack-there-of in translating a PnP game to a Interactive Real Time Brawler/Slasher/Shooter.

I can, however, type for hours on the genius designs of L4D and BL then delving deep into how their sequels diverged from the strengths of their progenitors.  I can also quite distinctly type on the conversion of a campaign based play system into a session based play system having sunk a few years into Planetside. Taking an experience that is, in some ways, meant to be drawn out over a long period of time and trying to cram that experience into Arena-Driven Brawl/Slash/Shoot very rarely ends well. 

Vermintide II starts out fairly strong with an emphasis on a campaign experience to familiarize the player with the control scheme and intended battle flow. Scant seconds after finishing the tutorial that practice round is collectively heaved off the side of a cliff, and instead of a consistent story based progression in-vein of other Brawler/Slasher/Shooter's turned Role Play Game (Metroid, Elder Scrolls, Fallout) the player is immediately thrust into online matchmaking focused on session-based quick plays. 

Well, how do I put this. 

When I pick up a game with ""Warhammer"" in the title, I don't expect Quake-Like. I don't Expect Doom-Zero. I don't expect ""Call of Battlefield Xbox 360 Edition with no Single player Campaign."" Yes, that is as insulting as I mean it to sound. 

I expect a campaign driven world following the exploits (or lack there-of) of the character(s) I am introduced to in starting the game. 

So, right off the bat, not getting what the game's advertising, store page, and other official information lead to believe i would be receiving makes Vermintide 2 a rather hard sell to other potential players. If I want a squad-based + session-based quick round with friends... well... what, exactly, is wrong with BL or L4D? Absolutely nothing. 

Now, I'm not saying that Vermintide II is a bad game mind you. For what it is it probably is a pretty good game. There are massive differences though between a game you enjoy, a game that you would recommend others play, and a game that you would like other players to play WITH you. 

Quite frankly Vermintide II needed to spend a lot more time in the UI development, character pathing, and the design of a cohesive experience, time the game clearly didn't get, and time it will NOT be getting ""now."" 

Overhauling the front-end of a game and re-configuring the entirety of progression for a game because it's present release state is somewhere on the other side of ****ED UP after release just doesn't happen. Again, that makes Vermintide II an extremely hard-sell to new players. 

It also makes an subsequent release in a series an equally hard-sell. Grab bags of different genres and styles just don't make for a compelling experience.  

Now, personally, if I had the ears of the dev team I'd grab those ears, drag them into the conference room, and make it clear that single player campaign comes first in development. Interactive Games operate on a long-Tailed Economic Model. Long after the multiplayer base has dried up and everyone else has moved onto a new game or gone back to the games they like, a game can still be sold as an experience. Not having that factor in mind during development screws any number of games over harder than a Democrat in an elected office screws over voters. 

Also ignoring the single-player experience exposes how vulnerable online games are to latency and lag. All it takes is a really bad connection, and an enjoyable night's play becomes naught more than utter frustration. To put this in perspective, Microsoft, routinely the villain, found out that a vast number of Xbox/Windows users with Games Pass subscriptions on Cable or 5G internet connections preferred to use the Xbox Cloud Gaming to try out new games, and then just download the game to actually play. Just because someone has a great connection to the internet does NOT mean they have a great connection to your service. It also means you should probably consider methods of making the game playable when your service is NOT available. 

Read into that last section what you will about my own online experience with Vermintide II. Jumping through hoops to launch a private server with relatively offline(ish) play is possible, but that should have been the default experience. Not the hoop jump option. 

Again though, it's probably too late for any of the desperately needed overhauls and focus changes Vermintide II requires to go from a forgettable title into something worthy of telling other players about to actually occur.

TLDR: This game follows, almost to the letter, what Left 4 Dead did right.

The core mechanics of the game are solid. Combat is fast and visceral, cooperation is vital against the special enemies; hook rats, lich... liches? and such (don't wanna spoil much), basically this game version of L4D tanks, boomers, smokers, spitters, etc). The game has some interesting objectives and level variations to keep things from getting dull. Randomised item placement, such as health pick ups, bombs and such also makes you check more places when you're in a pinch, keeping things a bit more interesting. Huge crowds of mobs, patrols and random bosses are also things that will be thrown at you completely at random. It's all in all great. I mean it can be, at times, overly stupid, like climbing a tree and having an ogre spawn in the branches, that ain't great. But most of the time it keeps the team close together, pinging any pick ups, and helping each other whenever possible.

The game allows switching between 5 heroes with 3 base classes, 4 if you get the DLC (which each play very differently w/o mentioning that each weapon works very differently, ex: 2 handed hammer vs sword and shield) makes the game have extra depth.

Audio is nice, the clashing of weapons isn't overwhelming, even if it is constant. The characters talk A LOT, but they're actually kinda funny to listen to.

Graphics are ok for the game's age, it ain't Witcher 3, though.

Controls are simple, 1 through 5 for items and weapons, left click and right click will depend on your character and weapons, some ''builds'' have weight behind their movements and some are slick and quick.

- It's an awesome co-op game with a good amount of maps that all feel different
- DLC Map sharing ( if someone in your party owns the DLC maps, they're available for everyone to play regardless if everyone owns it or not )
- The enemies are super cool looking and combat is very satisfying
- Characters and their classes have nice diversity and designs between them

BUT

- They have a micro-transaction cosmetic shop that uses real money or in-game currency that you can earn slowly from logging in daily and doing challenges or you can buy more with real money
- Some of the best weapons, classes, and cosmetics cost are micro-transactions
( I think this is greedy and lame, since I already paid for the game and there are no meaningful updates that come that don't cost money )
- There are plenty of bugs, server/connection issues, and performance issues ( from what I've experienced )
- Some DLC maps are lackluster and boring

Crust:
8 whole graham crackers, broken into 1-inch pieces
6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted and cooled. Plus 1 extra tablespoon butter for brushing on pan
3 tablespoons sugar
Filling:
2 1/2 pounds cream cheese, cut into chunks and softened
1 1/2 cups sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup sour cream
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
2 large egg yolks
6 large eggs

For the crust: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 325°. Process the graham cracker pieces in a food processor to fine, even crumbs, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle the melted butter and sugar over the crumbs and pulse to incorporate. Sprinkle the mixture into a 9-inch springform pan. Press the crumbs firmly into an even layer using the bottom of a measuring cup. Bake the crust until fragrant and beginning to brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let the crust cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.

For the filling: Meanwhile, increase the oven temperature to 500°. Beat the cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until smooth, 1-3 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and beaters as necessary.

Beat in half the sugar and salt until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the remaining sugar until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the sour cream, lemon juice and vanilla until incorporated, 1-3 minutes. Beat in the egg yolks and eggs, two at a time until combined, 1-3 minutes.

Being careful not to disturb the baked crust, brush the inside of the prepared springform pan with 1 tablespoon of melted butter. Set the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Carefully pour the filling into the pan. Bake the cheesecake for 10 minutes.

Without opening the door, reduce the oven temperature to 200° and continue to bake the cheesecake until the center of the cake registers 150° (about 1 1/2 hours).

Transfer the cake to a wire rack and run a knife around the edge of the cake. Let the cheesecake stand until just barely warm, 2 1/2 – 3 hours. Chill until ready to eat. Serve as is or with Strawberry Topping.",1689486880,1689486880,False,3,2,0.445402443408966064,0,True,False,False

In the past few years there are several new careers, a boatload of new maps, a plethora of new weapons, and several different game modes to choose from.

I gotta say, this is probably my favorite game again, now.  It's so unbelievably well done - every aspect of it.  The 'new' content (I have no idea when all this was released, but it's all new to me) is amazingly fun, and fresh, and interesting.  I really can't score VT2 high enough, honestly.

Playing DarkTide for ~800 hours, it always completely baffled me how it could have mixed or negative reviews.  After playing VT2 again for approx. 2 weeks in full, I can now fully understand the hatred toward DT.  Granted, I still have to take it will a grain of salt because they *are* different games.

- This and vermintide one are great games. 

- Hack n slash madness, lots of gore, lots of fun.

- co-operative gameplay is reminiscent of left for dead, in the best way possible

- Warhammer lore is awesome 😎

Jokes aside, honeslty one of the best coop experience I've ever come across.
A (most of the time) wholesome and helping community, I've met some new friends there, with which I also play other games or just talk in general.
Well crafted combat-system with a high skill-ceiling going to higher difficulties.
Good variety of melee and ranged weapons, as well as build variety on every character-class (5 characters with 3 classes each), though some builds just being stronger though than others.(if you care about meta stuff that is)
Lots of story-missions, Chaos Wastes a fun Rogue-like game-mode and a few DLC missions (some paid, some as free updates) which hold some secrets for you to find. (and one, where you play drunk and need to keep drinking, honestly one of the most fun missions ever made)

Negatives are:
Highest difficulty Cataclysm (was added later after release) is behind paywall together with another game-mode, the Weaves.
Paid DLC for some of the best weapons in the game, not to say the base-game weapons are bad, those DLC ones are just better in many situations.
And a 4th class for every character (also added later after release), which is behind a paywall, some being a bit overpowered in comparison to the base-game ones.

As a finishing note I'd like to mention one of the strongest argument for this game, the Characters. The dialog of the characters and their interactions in hub-area or on missions between each other (even different depending on your class) is probably the greatest aspect of this game. So much passion and talent was put in to this, delivering most memorable voices to those characters. They will very likely grow on you over time, developing favorites and saying their voice-lines along side them.

To make it less repeptitive, the devs used a random generator in the game. So now instead of a rat ogre appearing at the same moment in a level, it js just a random tank: pgre, spawn, ...  Sounds like a great thing? No, because it is broken. Some playthroughs there is an ogre, and the next time one plays the same level there are THREE SPAWNS. Oh, and did I mention that it became pratically impossible to beat a tank unless one's level is probably above 15? I finished the first game with level 7. And it was fully playable and fun. 
Unless there's a major level balance update, I won't start this game again. 
I would give the first Vermintide 11/10 if I could.
I give Vermintide2  3/10 and that's being generous.

It manages to capture L4D's formula just right, and it also introduces new mechanics that plays well with said formula. Gameplay wise it ain't so different, the controls are simple, you go from point A to point B, fighting hordes of rats/rotbloods etc etc. However every time you finish a map you return to the Keep (your base) to choose the next one. Every character has 3 careers (4 with the DLCs) each one of them has different skill trees, that adds to the variety and replay value of the game.

Pros:
-The best melee focused combat of all time
-Simple gameplay, with high skill ceiling
-Incredible enemy design
-Great special enemy design
-A good variety of bosses
-A lot of content
-Really good level of detail
-Fantastic map design
-Top notch voice acting (honestly just watch Warrior Priest's trailer)
-Incredible character design 
-Good gore
-Good audio and sound design
-Good graphics

Even though the game is incredibly good, it suffers from a lot of Balance/Bugs/QoL/Progression system/Reward system and some enemy design problems that hold it back from its 100% potential.
Cons:
-Probably the worst BOTs I have ever seen
-Hilariously bad rewards for in-game challenges
-80% of enemy spawns and hordes are scripted (could be 100% if you don't sit and wait for 5 whole minutes in the same spot like an idiot)
-Progression system is also terrible, why am I getting the same amount of XP for a mission I completed on recruit as the one I completed on Cataclysm?
-RNG loot system (it's always bad)
-Why Strangler has pushback resistance and that much HP?
-Why gas rat doesn't die in one shot yet it is able to burst you from afar?
-Some of the worst enemy design in gaming history: Blightstormer, Stormvermin with shield, Banner Bearer (DLC enemy, luckily). So for the first 2, there isn't any actual counter play and they are very tedious to play against. Blightstormer will summon incredibly huge hurricanes even through walls, that will probably cover 50% of your space, and they will hunt you down for an incredible amount of time, wait what's that? You can't even see the dude because he is behind walls or 15km behind you? What? You have a melee only class? Well too bad for you, we are too lazy to redesign the guy, good luck dealing with this BS on Legend/Cata while fighting hordes. You know, actually we will make this guy even more tedious, it will shred your HP if he catches you, and while you are helpless in his hurricane which takes really long to release you, other enemies can also hit you LMAO, you got smoked mate, and you could do nothing about it. Hey how about we spawn 2-3 of them at the same time? Yeeee our wives hate us.
Stormvermin, not much to say, just tedious to fight there is not a way to break their shield, you just hit them untill you stagger them. They break the pace of the game.
-Live service (so you basically cannot play without internet) and that leads to other problems as well, if you are mid-map and your internet goes down for whatever reason, the game kicks you. (even if you play solo private)
-You have to complete the map to actually earn the rewards for a challenge. How retarded does that sound? So out of idk 900 in-game challenges this game has, 500 of them are based on luck and require a really good premade team. So if you actually are lucky some day and have that Rat Ogre jump and kill it (I got this challenge on my 600 hour hit mark by accident, not because it's hard, but because rat ogre will barely jump) you still have to complete the map for the challenge to count.. What's that your internet went down or the game decided to fuck you up? Well jokes on you, grind another 500 hours only to reward you with commendation chest who is already obtainable by simply leveling up lol

They're vile people most the time that want to blow through the content and have no time for you to explore for things needed for unlocks. The game is setup to punish those that are behind in the push. I.e hook rats/Sorcs being able to single out party members left behind. All gear collected is dropped if you die away from the party and have to be revived. Its a fun game but what you see as fun. The community sees as burnout and has no time for. Ive yet to have a match so fun it outweighs the other 6 matches ive played where im being cussed at for not going fast enough. I would like to point out. This is the industry's fault. They're trying to farm old games that've already made money and farm them some more with new gambling addiction this time! Instead of making new games that people can enjoy. They're leveraging money spent to keep people involved and they're all burnt out. Leaving these games all in the same spot. New people coming into endgame heavy crowds and we've all met those guys.

Additionally, as the Steam Deck user, you must be the host, which  means that you literally can't play with other Steam Deck users.

Edit - Not to be misleading, I should clarify that your (non Steam Deck) friends are able to opt into playing in the same unapproved section with you, but it resets their progress to 0 for the duration.

Also, to top it off, it's a nightmare to uninstall from the Deck for some frickin' reason.

In all seriousness though I can't not recommend this game to a majority of people.  While there are some drawbacks like Fatshark not actually delivering on promises they've made (Big and very disappointing), the relatively bad online play (Really depends but it's not the best), and how you obtain loot in a slow loot-box style fashion (Although it feels better than Vermintide 1 praying for the dice to land).  What makes me stay is the gameplay loop they have and just the variety of abilities and weapons you have at your disposal.  Also, I'm a masochist and want to get all possible Okri's Challenges done at some point.

The good of the game has been done to death so instead I'll be talking about the negative in this review so that they can be looked on for room for improvement. Some nitpicky, some more than that:

Winds of magic - DLC for the most part is great, except for winds of magic which on its own is a terrible DLC because the selling point is the dogshite gamemode that next to no one plays. Buts its also way too overpriced for what your getting, dog gamemode, 5 new weapons all of which are good, a singular map, (a good map IMO but some disagree) but the most INSULTING part of this DLC is 'Cataclysm' an entire difficulty locked behind a paywall. That is just asinine and i don't think i need to go further than that. So if you don't care about the gamemode (you shouldn't) you're ultimately overpaying for a map, 5 weapons and a difficulty...very silly John Fatshark. 

Crashes - As of right now there are an occasional amount of crashes which can range from inconvenient to soul-destroying. For example, crashing while loading into a match, inconvenient. Then there's crashing at the end of a chaos wastes...pain. 

PTSD - *packrat noises*

Gear Progression - Nitpicky and probably comes from me going from PS to PC. the way gear works is a linear growth from whatever gear number your item is and when you open a chest you have a chance to get another piece of gear higher than what you have until you get to 300 (cap). I just wish there was a faster way to get 300 than opening a million chests or cheesing with crafting.

Players - Some people are dumb and/or rude. It's an online game, to be expected but still fuck off

Grudge challenges for the white outfits in chaos wastes - Chance whether or not you get the monster you need, annoying when you consider the length of the matches

And that's it or what i could think of right now, there may be something I'm missing but regardless you should get this game the other million positive things that everyone else has said would warrant that.

Happy hunting :)

- Beautiful, well designed maps which can be played repeatedly

- A large variety of weapons to choose between, for each hero
- A feature rich match-making system which makes it easy to find other players to play with

CONS: (There aren't many!)
- Veteran players would welcome a few more maps now that the game is 3 years old
EDIT (June 2023): In 2021, 16 more maps were added as part off the ""Chaos Wastes"" expansion and more ""normal"" maps which can be played ""stand-alone"" are being added in 2023, so this is less of an issue now

- The cosmetics available in the in-game ""shop"" lack variety, with some being so similar as to be indistinguishable from each other
EDIT (June 2023): This remains a problem in 2023, 5 years after the game's release. There are more varied cosmetics available now, but these must be purchased using real money and are expensive to buy individually, forcing you to wait until they're on sale.

Surviving your third wave in a row of enemies will leave your heart pounding and your palms sweaty; only for the reprieve to be interrupted by the roar of a Rat Ogre as your party scrambles into position in a desperate attempt to survive the next three minutes of what the game throws at you.

I have around 450 hours invested at the time of revisiting my review. Fat Shark has just released a massive balance patch that has fixed a lot of weapon and general combat issues and has reiterated that they plan to continue to balance the game moving forward. This patch specifically has re-tuned some of the more overpowered weapons and brought some of the weaker load out options in line with the more popular choices. This comes after a prolonged drought of much needed updates. Fat Shark gets a lot of shit I feel maybe even unfairly for the development cycle of this game on PC but I think they have done an excellent job with this franchise as a whole and I cannot way to see what content is around the corner.

It feels like it lacks progression, It feels a little ""Too"" Hack and Slash, I know that is the point of the game but It feels like you need no tactics and just have to ""exploit"" techniques over and over to achieve the same result.

I loved Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance  1 and 2 on the PS2 and that was a RPG PvE first person that had Co-op but you had inventory management and you could sell and sort stuff, This reminds me of it but as a First-Person game but it lacks the selling and inventory management.

I feel Vermintide 2 could be so much funner if it wasn't about crappy cosmetics and wasn't about trading in skins to get dust and bars to make stuff in crafting, It feels like there's only 2 or 3 weapons per character and the rest are cosmetic reskins.

It feels like there hasn't been a game has really stood out and wowed me that was released after about 2013.

Also I don't quite understand the campaign is it just ... 8 worlds which are the same level which you don't play in any order but there is quests which you can do for each ? Maybe becuase I haven't played the original Vermintide I'm a bit lost.

Although Age of Signus era feels more interesting than 40,000 because of how popular 40,000 is.

I'm not sure how the game is almost 100GB's because it really doesn't feel or look like a game that should be more than 40GB's including DLC.

[h1] Gameplay: [/h1]

Overall, great game but with some downsides and the gameplay emphasized the Hack and Slash aspect of the game

Diverse enemies with various sizes and abilities 

Character banters are fun and fit their unique personality which makes the game more entertaining

[b] Weapons: [/b]The game contains a lot of weapons (melee & range), they can either be crafted before a match or Looted from reward boxes after each match. 
There are 5 total Unique weapons that require you to own the Forgotten Relics DLC in order to have them. They can be a little bit OP at some time which can make other classes feel weaker.

[h1] Graphic: [/h1]

The characters are detailed and distinct in term of both Armor and Designs, through combination such as the vibrant colors, engravings, ornament that matches each character and the Warhammer setting

[h1] Sound Design: [/h1]

The unyielding tide of enemies, like an unholy manifestation of sin itself, relentlessly tests the mettle of any brave soul who dares to stand against them.

The variety of heroes at your disposal, each embodying a different aspect of war, is commendable. Whether I wielded the might of the Empire's hammer, the grace of the Wood Elves' bow, or the explosive fury of the Dwarf's gun, I felt a profound connection to the rich lore of Warhammer. The progression system, allowing me to unlock devastating abilities and upgrade my arsenal, further fueled the flames of my righteous crusade.

The gameplay itself is a symphony of carnage and tactical prowess. The co-op aspect, reminiscent of a righteous crusade with fellow warriors, is a shining beacon of camaraderie. The need for strategic positioning and teamwork in the face of overwhelming odds is reminiscent of the glorious battles fought in the name of the Emperor himself.

Visually, Vermintide 2 does justice to the grimdark aesthetic of the Warhammer universe. The meticulously crafted environments, ranging from desolate cities to corrupted forests, are a testament to the attention to detail paid by the developers. The blood-soaked battlegrounds and nightmarish enemy designs are a sight to behold, igniting a righteous fury within my soul.

Alas, even in the face of such greatness, I must express a minor grievance. The occasional glitch and lack of polish in certain areas tarnish an otherwise exemplary experience. While these missteps do not diminish the grandeur of the overall game, they do serve as a blemish on the armor of this valiant endeavor.",1685497408,1687158096,True,1,0,0.526066362857818604,0,True,False,False

Honestly, I love this game. I always find myself coming back to it. I started playing on PS4 and eventually picked it up on PC. The maps are fast and interesting enough to keep me going and the classes are all unique. The core game is very well polished and the combat is unparalleled. I've yet to play a game that feels as good as this to play.

But I am become more disappointed with the developers. Stringing out the release of the final class, perhaps knowing it will mark the end of this beloved project. Instead, they're releasing maps which just bog down the quick play queue. When one of the new maps pops up, I just lose motivation to play. Trail of Treachery has been one of the biggest disappointments, the map where parties of random players often discuss the option of just jumping off the mountain to skip it. To make it worse, the map pops up more often than others. 

Then the newest maps have just felt empty. I'm sure effort has gone into them but they're a long way off the same quality of the original and DLC maps. It feels like they're making maps just to pretend the game is still being supported. After the release of Darktide, maybe they have switched back to supporting Vermintide and they're rushing to make up for lost time. 

Unfortunately the poor quality of these free maps and inability to remove them from our quickplay queues means I just don't see myself putting much more time into this game. 

To top that off, the empty promises of Sienna's final class being released with the next map, no actually the NEXT map, no actually the NEXT map. That's just not right. If they're having problems could just say that, instead they choose to mislead us and attempt to keep our attention. 

TL;DR
If you're reading the reviews, you'll probably enjoy the game. It's honestly a great game. Just be aware that the golden age is gone and the new releases are not adding value but rather diminishing it. The developers are not working on improving the game, only extending it's life-span enough to rinse more money with their cosmetics shop.

The aesthetics, lore, general settings, gameplay are all fine at its core. Sub classes are a good way to differentiate in play style and games.

As of 6/16/2023 Steamcharts says that there are more daily players on Vermintide 2 than in Darktide, but it doesn't feel like it. It's difficult to find players for matches and most games will be played with bots. This makes playing on higher difficulties unfun as bots are mostly useless. A problem with matches is unlike Darktide, Vermintide 2 only allows 1 class per person. If you attempt to quick play and the class you want is already chosen, too bad, pick something else. Can be frustrating when you spent 10-20~ minutes searching for a game because you want to play a certain character.

If you happen to find players for your game, it's a roulette wheel for toxicity and skill. There's an abundance of people who will purposely troll and throw games or insult and instigate fights for seemingly no reason, Beyond the issue of toxicity, this problem extends to the matchmaking. Unlike Darktide, Vermintide is peer-to-peer. If a host decides they no longer wish to play and leave, it kicks everyone from the match, gives no experience, and returns people to the hub. It is extremely unfun to wait 15 minutes for a match, play for 15 minutes and the host decide to leave because someone decided to be mean and have everyone kicked.

Despite years of updates there are still bugs. Nothing game breaking, but having grims drop and fall through floors, elite specials attack through walls, phantom hits on people.

If you can find a group of competent, kind people to play with it's an enjoyable game. Otherwise it can be very frustrating and not fun.",1686902281,1686903693,False,1,1,0.444444417953491211,0,True,False,False

but im sick of shield vermin recovering immediately from a shove or heavy attack with unbreakable shields that also dont tire after multiple hits. can block attacks and swing wile guarding to punish the player. hell you know what this game does that darktide does not do to you? let enemys drop your full hp bar to zero with one stupid attack. these storm vermin are just overbuffed garbage enemys. and the scripting for the games armor pen and damage values are trash too. if you wanna play warhammer fantasy. play skyrim. yea its not good but god this game is bad.

Saatlerce sıkılmadan oynayabileceğiniz bir oyun. Oyun bağımlılığı legend+ seviyeden sonra geliyor. Cata levelde nefes almadan, gözünüzü kırpmadan oynayacaksınız.

Bardin bombayı saçma sapan yere atınca. Saltz haklı serzenişte.
Saltz: You missed ALL of them, dwarf. That takes a special talent. Hepsini ıskaladın, bu özel bir yetenek ister, diyor.

Sienna aynı hareketi yapınca
Kerillian: Hah! Even One-Eye throws better!	Haha, Tek-Göz (Saltz'ı kastediyor tek gözüne atıfla) bile daha iyi atardı.

Bardin'in her merdiven gördüğünde ""Bu merdivenler yukarı çıkıyor"" demesi gülümsetiyor insanı.

Ayrıca düşündüren cümlelerde mevcut. Sienna Saltz'a ""Bana güvenmen için ne gerekiyor."" diye sorunca Saltz ""Güven pahalı bir şeydir"" diye cevap veriyor.

Bunun gibi yüzlercesi mevcut.

Ayrıca Kerillan'ın tepeden bakan kibirli karakteri, Sienna'nın kibarlığı ve ateş tutkusu, Saltz'ın holiganlığı, Markus'un sakinliği, Bardin'in cesareti ve Troll tutkusu çok iyi işleniyor oyunda. karakterler hayat bulmuş gibi. Ayrıca seslendirmeler mükemmel.

Oyun kısaca benim için sanat eseri. tavsiye ederim.


Oyunda öğrenilecek başlangıçta iki kritik konu var
-Dodge
-Block-Push

İleri aşamalarda hero'nun build özelliklerini iyi bilmeniz ve bunları uygulamanız gerekiyor. 

Sonrasında Fortunes of War Cata'da bitmişse olmuşsunuz demektir.

I do not recommend the game for its current price, although picking it up on sale would certainty be worth it. Vermintide 2 is a game that I should probably hate. Graphically, it ranges from bland to bland and ugly. The art direction is not very good (with some glaring exceptions) and it has microtransactions and horrible menus. However, the combat is solid and it can be really fun at times though it gets old quickly. The enemy designs, from what I have experienced are bland and uninteresting, though the elites are an exception (haha flamethrower rats go brrr). The premise alone is great and if you want a fairly mindless game about killing rats, go for it. Vermintide does not, however, hold up to other horde combat games such as Risk Of Rain 2 or other multiplayer games like Monster Hunter.

That's why I play as the dwarf in this game. Because I really like deep rock galactic. So the objective of deep rock galactic is to mine materials and complete various different objectives like collecting morkite, collecting alien eggs, collecting aquarq, mining liquid morkite, leading a drill to an omoran heart stone, killing boss glyphids, and figting a rival faction. These are all really cool objectives. Along with this, each level is procedurally generated which means no same mission. I am very wet right now. What makes this game so much fun fun fun for me though is a great progression system. I like to level up my dwarves so I can kill more glyphids and show my characters to my cousin so he'll have sex with me. We have really hot sex. Overall, I would definitlely like this game if I were you. I even showed my mom deep rock galactic and she hung herself! I livestreamed it and showed it to the guys who made deep rock galactic!

The game is actually fixed now and I haven't experienced any issues when playing recently! Now nothing stands between me and vermin extermination!

OLD REVIEW:

It's a beautiful game and quite fun with friends but there's a lot of bugs that can ruin your experience, particularly in higher difficulty levels. Collision detection is absolutely terrible in this game and sometimes enemies pass through me and hit my teammates behind me or stand inside me and hit me but I can't hit them. If you can look past a few frustrating bugs like that, then you'll have a blast with this game. It's a lot more fun than L4D2 and has high replayability.

EDIT:
Stopped playing for 2 months and started again recently hoping that some of the bugs would have been fixed. I found out that instead there were EVEN MORE bugs now. This game is stupidly buggy and can make the game really frustrating and annoying to play. Spawn of Chaos is now really buggy. One time the Spawn of Chaos just got stuck trying to hit wtihout actually hitting, allowing us to just keep hitting it and killing it without it doing any damage. It was actually a nice bug. The 2nd bug was not so nice. The Spawn of chaos got stuck when eating one of our teammates . My teammate didn't lose any health and the spawn of chaos didn't gain any health but just kept doing the eating animation. Unfortunately the rest of us were down so there was nothing to do and we had to quit the game or we would have had to wait forever for it to end. The MOST annoying bug is when enemies just pass through you sometimes or stand inside you and keep hitting you without you being able to move or hit them. The game is still fun to play but as long as these bugs are there, I can't recommend buying and playing this game until the devs fix this broken game.

List of annoying bugs:
*Collision detection is shit. Enemies including specials like gas rats just pass through you.
*Pack rats(stranglers) sometimes ignore collision and drag you down through the floor to hell or drag you up through the ceiling to heaven sometimes.
*Bots are dumb.

Great characters, clever writing and beautiful carnage, all set with the backdrop of the deep Warhammer Fantasy universe.

The reason for this, was that I'm not a big fan of marathon games, like L4D2. I have played many Warhammer games over the years, and learned about the lore. Returned last month, to give this game another chance. Now that we have a lot of more content and patches, it's more enjoyable to play. Also, this is the type of game that you can play without worrying too much about the story, world etc. Just pick a character and reach the end of the map, while killing some enemies. It has advantages over L4D, but it also has many things that I don't like, including the balance.

[h1]Technical side of the game[/h1]

+ AMD FSR. I don't need, but it's nice to have it. Old version 1.0.
+ Anti-cheat.

+/- Always-online requirement, even when you play with bots. Not a big deal for me, and it makes sense here, but I prefer when solo modes remain offline.

- Poorly optimized performance. I play at max settings, on a good PC, 60fps/1080p. Fps drops very often. Not a critical problem for me, but I can't get stable 60 fps on max settings. Performance was a huge problem in Darktide Beta too. It seems that Fatshark needs more experienced programmers, or they should work with a third-party company, on game optimization.
- As a host in online matches, you can't add requirements for your lobby, such as level requirement. Players experienced a negative situation, when newbies/noobs joined difficulties above their ""skill"", and ruined the whole match. Of course, if you are a VT2 frequenter, and don't care that you will need to carry your teammates, then this is not a big deal for you. For others, it's a negative experience. The tutorial doesn't tell you much. Newbies and retarded players pick characters, level them up just a bit (or don't), don't learn basic things and go straight to high difficulty lobbies. I'm not saying that I'm a great player, but at least I'm not too selfish.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

+ Better combat and enemies, than in other games of this genre. There are armored enemies and armor-piercing weapons. Some enemies have shields. There is a dodge mechanic and blocks. All of this makes the combat more advanced and worth of your time. At least in my case. In L4D4, it's just a boring trash mob shooter. In VT2, you need to dodge, block etc.
I wish it had more tactical/counter elements, rather than being a trash mob cleaner game. 
+ Five playable characters, with different funny conversations. You only need four characters for matchmaking. Also, there are no clones in matches. One Kruber, one Bardin etc.
+ Bosses.
+ Loot system, without tons of drops, unlike many isometric Hack&Slash games, or games like Borderlands.

[h1]Characters & Careers[/h1]

+/- Each character has 3 base game + 1 Premium careers (class). Some of them change the play style of your character. Ex: Kruber can be a balanced character, ranged squashy guy, or full melee-oriented class.
1. Not all careers are interesting, or unique. Mercenary isn't very different from Ranger Veteran. Both are balanced roles. Witch Hunter Captain is also a balanced type, but actually a bit different. Foot Knight is a strange choice for me, at this point, when I can pick a full melee Grail Knight, with high damage career ability, or a balanced Mercenary. 
2. At least twice, you will get the same talents to choose from, for each class. Heal 20% of ally HP, while healing yourself. Stagger related talent etc. It could have been career related talents, but no.
3. Most weapons, for most classes, aren't locked. Ironbreaker (melee tank) can get good ranged weapons, while ranged Bounty Hunter can get all of Saltzpyre melee weapons. There are other examples. 
4. Weapons are poorly balanced and explained. You'll look at weapons, see the same ""Crowd Control, Wide Sweeps, High Damage"", and wonder what's the difference. Game UI doesn't tell you this. Also, some weapons are much worse than others. Some are too similar. 
5. Some career abilities are almost identical. Big circle around your character, enemies are pushed away, you get a buff.

[h1]Story[/h1]

- While there are funny conversations and simple objectives, the game lacks the actual story. No animated intros and endings. No mid-game scenes/dialogues or interesting objectives/missions. 

[h1]Cosmetics[/h1]

+ You can change hat/mask and outfit. 
- VT1 outfits aren't compatible with hats.
- Most outfits are simple recolors.
- A lot of junk/funny cosmetics. Fish on the head, hat with candles etc.
- Lack of good cosmetics. Especially for some classes.
- No store cosmetics for Premium careers.

[h1]Interface[/h1]

+ UI was updated with patches. Some useful functions added, such as friendly-fire indicator and numerical HP value.
- You can't resize or move UI elements. I would prefer smaller teammate portraits, without names (except in TAB menu), on the left corner of the screen. Also, an option to disable your own character portrait.

[h1]DLC[/h1]

I don't want to write a review for each DLC, so I will mention some things here.

+ Premium careers are good.
+ Back to Ubersreik adds weapons, portraits and few other things.
+ FRP adds some decent weapons.

- DLC for DLC. I'm talking about Premium career skins. Also, many skins are locked behind challenges. You pay to buy DLC for your DLC, then you have to unlock the DLC content. Amazing business practice! 
- Ubersreik DLC should have a discount, for owners of the first game. It uses maps from VT1.
- Winds of Magic adds new faction - Beastmen. Many users criticized this faction, and you can't disable it. New game mode isn't popular. The highest difficulty is locked, if you don't own this DLC (in case if you care).
- DLC weapons don't drop as loot. You have to craft and upgrade them.

[h1]Elf[/h1]

She deserves a separate category of this review.

- Has a weapon for any task. AP, crowd, DoT. I don't know any other career with the same arsenal.
- Has two DLC weapons with infinite ammo. One isn't much worse than a Longbow, another is better.
- Fast character. Combine this with her weapon arsenal, and you'll get a character who is good in both, melee and ranged. I tested all available careers. Kerillian is better than all the ""balanced"" careers.
- Waystalker is what I mentioned above + much more ammo, and a career ability that can kill few enemies at once.
- 90% of her arsenal is available for all of her careers. You basically swap between different talent sets. Slayer can't use ranged weapons. Huntsman (ranged) is very squashy, and requires good aiming to use his full potential. Warrior Priest can't use ranged weapons, and most of Saltzpyre melee weapons. 
- I'm not saying that all Elf players are pure evil, but many Elf players are hated for one reason or another. Not even counting what I said above. They often rush, die and DC/blame other players. They are the main source of friendly fire. Not only that, but they f-up more often than others, most likely because Elf allows more mistakes, than other characters. To say it politely, they are not what you would find, if you search for a definition of a ""team player"". 
- Her premium career, Sister of Thorns, a (?) support role, has SoT-only weapon - Staff. It would have made sense if it was her only type of ranged weapons, but no. She can use bows, javelin etc. 
- Kerillian players are sometimes (often?) toxic, dumb and think that they are super skilled dudes.
- She often speaks like a spoiled Western teen girl. Plus this ""mayfly"" joke, which I heard 1000 times by now.

I don't know if it is a poor design choice only, or a strong bias. Elf can do it all. She is a better ranged character, than other characters. She is a better well-rounded character, than other characters. Her support and melee careers have more weapon choices, than other characters. Too many reasons to hate the Elf.

What is good:
-Melee Combat extremely flushed out, extremely satisfying
-Objectives never really overbearing, just gets you moving
-Chaos Wastes is a genius addition to the game and clearly helped retention
-Quickplay = Finding teammates within seconds, even at 3:00 am. Game is bussin.
-Weapon options
-Weapon optimization and balancing 
-Build Freedom

What could be better:
-I think this game is unbelievably refined, and this explains why public feedback has always been so positive and why its left Darktide in its shadow for so long. That said, there are still some changes I would make.
- If red weapons are going to be so difficult to find, then I think there should be some mechanism that distinguishes them besides the stat rolls. I've rolled perfect stats on gold weapons over and over again, making me realize that having red weapons actually does not serve much purpose... Solution: another property? a new (balanced) trait determined by dev team? idk, but reds need a change. 
- Shop very obviously dictates, ""good skins, real money. low effort skins, shillings"". In all reality, shillings are pretty wack, only to be used for skins that you need dlc for (Bogenhafen, obviously)

Mobs can and frequently will spawn in your immediate vicinity, giving you little to no time to counter them.

They'll occasionally hit you through blocks or dodges due to latency, as there are no dedicated servers.

The devs tried to fix an issue with their being too many specials, but instead actually somehow increased both the spawn rate of specials and hordes, including during boss fights. This has led to multiples of each special spawning at once, and hordes chain spawning with specials with no breaks between swarms as intended.

The caster specials (leeches and blightstormers) are able to spawn outside the players view distance, outside of areas where players can reach, and cast their abilities through impassible terrain making it nigh impossible to kill them for excessively long periods of time, all while they continue to attack players.

Overall, these bugs have lead to the game being an RNG fest of whether or not you'll be able to complete a level. It's inconsistent and more frequently frustrating more than it's ever fun, and the devs have shown no interest in fixing any of these issues.

After a friend told me about a first person game set in the world of Warhammer I decided to give it a shot. It was a great decision because Warhammer Vermintide 2 is an amazing game for both fans of Warhammer and people that have no idea or don't care about the setting and lore. The game is similar to Left for Dead, 4 characters go from point A to B while fighting enemies and completing objectives. At the end of some chapters and levels you will fight a boss and or a large horde of enemies.
 The game focuses on melee combat and some gunplay (depending on which character you play as) and one character uses magic. For me I prefer guns and ranged fighting in most games however the melee combat is so good that I have a blast getting up close and personal with great swords, spears and ax's. Aside from the games good range of melee and ranged weapons, you also have a range of powers, hand bombs and power-ups to help you during missions. The game has a large number of missions, bonus content and challenges even if you do not buy any of the DLC's that can be brought fro the store. As of right now, the game is still getting support and content at a slow but steady pace.
 I enjoy the game for a number of reasons. I love the combat, the wide range of weapons, the great visuals and of course the setting. I think that is one of the bigger reasons why I like Vermintide. I fell in love with the Warhammer world thanks to Total War Warhammer and to have a game that takes you right into the World of Warhammer is great. Bouncing back and forth from this game and Total War Warhammer 3 provides endless fun for me.
 I love the five playable characters and the Tavern owner who gives you missions. The banter from the characters is great, although it does help if you know some Warhammer lore beforehand. I am a huge fan of the game, however I do have some issues with this game that will probably never be addressed. The first is the fact that the game is only 4 player Co-Op, not five despite the fact that there are five characters and the game makes it seem like all 5 go out to complete missions together. While 4 player Co-Op is great and it could have been worse (Destiny with 3 player Co-Op outside of cancerous raids comes to mind) it still would make the game even better gameplay and lore wise.
 There is even a character who makes a joke about the lack of 5 player Co-Op multiple times during missions. Another issue I have is lack enemy faction variety. The game does have a wide variety of enemies thanks to the fact that you fight 3 enemy factions. However the game has not added any new enemy factions since the Beastmen came out and new enemies are for the most part never added. At first this is not a big deal, but when you fight Skaven for the 1000th time and when you learn about the massive variety of hostile factions you could and should be fighting (Vampire Counts, other Chaos Gods) you will end up wishing for new factions and enemies to fight.
 Aside from these issues and a few bugs that are not too bothersome, I really enjoy Vermintide and recommend it for Warhammer fans and fans of games like Left for Dead and Payday. May SIGMAR grant this game a long life, and hopefully more Warhammer games.

[u] Combat and Feel [/u]
The animations, sound design, and general feel of the combat is incredibly satisfying. Every impact and cleave is sold perfectly, and carving through hordes of foes is extremely fun. Even the ranged combat is good, solid hit registration and aiming. Each character and career gives a different style of play that can then differ further based on weapon preference, all of which are viable and most feel just as great to use, as far as I've seen.

[u] Difficulty and Co-op [/u]
There are multiple difficulties, and the higher ones are significantly challenging. I HIGHLY recommend playing with friends, but even just playing with bots can be fun, especially since the AI characters use the gear and skills that you have equipped on them. I've found it's much more preferable to play with friends or with AI than random players, at least queuing solo.

[u] Progression and Gear [/u]
The progression is solid, earning a pick of 3 talents every five levels on a character. You can change these talents anytime between missions. You earn stronger gear the more you collect loot from said missions, and there's a crafting system that lets you scrap unwanted gear and forge the kind of gear you want.

[u] Different Gamemodes [/u]
Chaos Wastes creates an entire new way to play beyond the campaign and DLCs (all of which are worth it if you love the core game imo). It creates a longer, roguelike journey that adds some unique progression. A ton of fun, and adds even more replayability.

[u] Characters and Writing [/u]
The characters themselves are great, too. The dialogue writing is superb, probably some of the best I've seen, and the characters are deceptively well-developed. They have so many interactions that I'm still occasionally hearing new ones even after hundreds of hours.

[u] Performance [/u]
The game looks incredible and runs well, even on my older PC. No major issues.

Can't recommend this game enough if you like some brutal melee combat, or just want an intense co-op action experience. Go kill some filthy rat-men!",1684941208,1684941208,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game looks extremely hack and slashy, so I put off checking it out for a long time. That was a mistake. It's surprisingly in-depth with both build variety and combat mechanics. If you want a hack and slash game, the lower difficulties are fine for that, but if you're like me and want something that's going to challenge you and force you to optimize your builds, there's content for that as well.

My only complaint is that some of the DLC weaponry is clearly stronger than the vanilla weaponry, but as far as the vanilla content in the game goes, the vanilla weaponry can handle the content in the hands of a good player anyway.

Despite Darktide being in the works, the game has been receiving updates, bugfixes, new content etc. However, due to a history of developer misinformation and a lot of hiccups regarding previous content updates, the DLCs get their well deserved negative receptions. Stuff like Weaves and the Versus Mode trailer are thorns in their side that often get mentioned in the community. Devs adjusted their approach and remain silent until they're 100% sure the content can and will be delivered.

The game is in my eyes still worth buying. It's one of the best co-op games out there with an enjoyable skill curve and difficulty settings that reward actual practice and skill.

Having played more since then, however, I do enjoy the game a lot more, as it turns out there is more strategy to it than just left-clicking :D

In general, but especially if you play this game with a dedicated group of friends, you may also want to consider rotating heroes. This will, of course, ultimately slow your progress as far as maximizing any single hero's level is concerned, but I think it will make the game more fun regardless.
At least, I personally started to enjoy the game more when I started played differing heroes in single player, instead of just one single hero all the time when playing with friends (all or most of which have, I think, lost interest in the game by now, considering there's little enthusiasm when W:V2 is suggested. Perhaps that's at least partly due to the lack of variation in heroes).",1684607818,1684607818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't worry, this isn't Darktide, with its mass of bugs and general lack of polish. This is what Darktide was intending to be, and the reason why there is so much hype surrounding Darktide in general.
The reason why is because Vermintide 2 is good. The difficulty is well tuned, the ratman hordes are without number and you're forced to fight them in good old fashioned melee combat. Ammo is hard to come by in higher difficulties and the infinite ammo class has to carefully manage their magic or they'll detonate with the force of a 22 kiloton bomb. Enemy variety keeps you on your toes, and yes, there are specials that can pin you. You can dodge these attacks with a well timed sidestep or backstep, but work together or die alone. Bosses are roaming, challenging and plentiful in a similar way to the way Back 4 Blood does it, only there's a big boss at the end of each act.

There is a lot of content to partake in. Many different ways to play said game with a seemingly endless number of combinations to chose from. This is one of my favorites games of all time. 

The game WILL teach you and your friends team work. It's basically a requirement to not die past champion difficulty. You and your party will have to pick Heroes, gear, and talents that complement each other to truly advance. This is however one of the downsides of the game. Matchmaking though a thing is very meh as you are well stuck with others that lets just say are stuck in there ways at times. If you get this game I would say have at least one other preferably 3 others you can reliable play with.

Now down to the ugly side. The bots on your team when you have to use them can be dumb as bricks at times... One such occasion is you are only player, you get attacked by a sole sucker, the bots that are literally 5 paces away are so distracted by a gas rat on the other side of the map that they leave you to die seeking out the gas rat and thus ending the game... The bots can be a total drag at times... But the same can also be said of actual players as well that will gallivant on there own little adventures and then die or leave you to die...

And now for the bad... Basically ALL the interesting skins for characters are only gettable by buying them with actually money.... There is also a lot of the fun parts of the game such as weapons, Heros, and even a difficulty level that are basically locked behind DLC paywalls. I'm OK with there being the option of buy skins, but ONLY if you can also unlock them via some means, or to have skins that are ONLY unlockable of equal caliber. If you get this game get it will all the DLC as well, or at least the host should. but those without the DLS will be missing out on some heros and weapons even if they can play the maps as the host has them.",1684267782,1684267782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is the sequel to the critically acclaimed Warhammer: End Times - Vermintide, and it builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor. Set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, Vermintide 2 is a cooperative game that pits you and up to three other players against hordes of Skaven and Chaos warriors.

One of the things that immediately stands out about Vermintide 2 is its impressive graphics and art style. The attention to detail is incredible, and the environments are richly detailed and immersive. The sound design is also top-notch, with every strike of your weapon and every screech of a rat-man sounding appropriately visceral and impactful.

But where Vermintide 2 really shines is in its gameplay. The melee combat system is deep and satisfying, with a variety of weapons and playstyles to choose from. Whether you prefer to smash through enemies with a hammer or slash them apart with a sword, Vermintide 2 has you covered. The game also introduces new hero classes, each with its unique set of abilities and weapons, providing even more gameplay variety.

The enemy AI in Vermintide 2 is also worth mentioning. The Skaven and Chaos warriors are relentless and unpredictable, forcing you to stay on your toes and adapt to the situation on the fly. The game is challenging but not unfair, and with proper coordination and teamwork, you and your allies can emerge victorious from even the toughest battles.

Vermintide 2 also features a loot system, rewarding you with new weapons, trinkets, and other items as you progress through the game. These items can be upgraded and customized to suit your playstyle, providing an additional layer of depth and replayability.

The game's campaign mode takes you through a variety of different environments, each with its unique challenges and set-pieces. The story itself is serviceable but not particularly memorable, but it's not really the main draw of the game. The real fun comes from the gameplay itself, and Vermintide 2 delivers that in spades.

One thing to note is that Vermintide 2 is primarily designed as a cooperative game, and while it is possible to play solo with AI companions, the game is best experienced with other players. Thankfully, the game has a robust matchmaking system that makes it easy to find other players to team up with.

Overall, Warhammer: Vermintide 2 is an excellent game that improves upon its predecessor in almost every way. With its deep and satisfying melee combat, challenging enemy AI, and immersive environments, it's a must-play for fans of cooperative action games.

the weapon and classes variety is great, yet properties and traits are limited which gives it a good standard setting and you can focus on improving your experience more. good balance. Atmosphere and enemy variety is just right, not over done or watered down.

So many missions to choose from and the difficulties are set just right so you don't get the new-gen gamers that rate glorious games such as darksouls and elden ring down, because they think its difficult. No you can choose how easy and hard you'd like it to be.

Great solo, better co-op, DLCs are fantastic, fun community, huge build variety. An incredible game that's well worth your money and your time if you enjoy intense melee action. I'm 185 hours in and looking forward to spending another 200 hours getting better.

The only real downside is the lack of in-game information about core stats and mechanics. Everything from the duration of abilities and consumables to the crit chance on your weapons and the categories of enemies you'll fight need to be learned out-of-game. And good luck finding pickups without looking them up lol 

The environments are amazing. The base game with free updates is 18 campaign maps + the roguelite Chaos Wastes mode, and the three content DLCs (Winds, Bogenhafen, Ubersreik) add an additional 6 campaign maps. Campaign levels are almost universally fantastic from both visual and game design perspectives. Enemies are varied and interesting. 

Progression is a little weird. There IS an item level mechanic but it's only relevant as you level up; after your initial time with the game you'll ignore it. Then there's a grind for top-rarity (red) weapons, and you'll want to get all five characters to level 30 so you have build options. 

But honestly, the real progression curve is your personal skill, far more than in comparable games. An expert player with their level 5 perk and base rarity items can carry a team on legendary, while a new player is mostly useless even with a perfect level 35 build and perfect 300-power red gear in every slot. Gameplay is about map knowledge, understanding the team dynamics, knowing enemy attack patterns, mastering stamina and dodge management, and mastering the physics of your weapons. The heavy attack on Warpriest's greathammer arcs up at the end, whereas Footknight's stays flat, and accounting for that makes the difference between lifesaving headshot damage and getting killed by a Stormvermin.

Anyway. Play Vermintide. It slaps.",1682535657,1682535657,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I can't grasp how people develop an interest in this garbage, especially the story and world. Every map just drags on for too long and encourages me to leave my team behind just so I can rush all the objectives and run to the end on my own to escape this boring nightmare. The players who play on the easier difficulties are also majorly braindead. I usually exaggerate for the sake of comedy but this time I'm actually serious. They take too long to move forward and stretch the long maps even more. By the time I've reached the end, they haven't even made it halfway through most of the time. And if a special infected... oh excuse me, I mean an elite incapacitates me, these low IQ players have the audacity to blame me for running off on my own. Pardon me for not wanting to spend half an hour on every goddamn map. Move your asses and I won't have run off alone. Once more I'm confronted with the sad reality that Europeans are indeed idiots. I was fortunate enough to find an Asian lobby, unsurprisingly they managed to play like athletes. Thankfully it's possible to finish maps by just having one player reach the end so I didn't have to rely on intelligent players too much.

Let's get to the core problem now. Once again I'm tormented with grindy achievements. Being forced to level up each character shouldn't be as tedious as it is. No matter which map or difficulty you choose, you will always get the standard amount of experience. You can get collectibles to boost that but getting them will often take up more time than it's actually worth. There is also the issue of the bots being nearly as braindead as the average player base and simply refusing to pick up items. So what does this mean? It means I had to grind the shortest map a hundred times. I checked out some speedruns to assist in this endeavor and can confidently say that I could cut the top 5 if I submitted a run of my own. Fortunately the map I picked could be soloed easily which is a luxury not many of them have. Most of the time you need to accumulate all players in a spot to be able to proceed unless you're playing with bots. The only reason I occasionally decided to play with other people was so I could join a game in progress and hopefully get some quick experience, without much effort. It worked a dozen of times and was certainly more fun than grinding the same map on repeat. That's where I noticed another problem, however. Which is that a lot of these maps are indistinguishable. I had segments memorized but couldn't tell for the life of me on which map they occurred. Sometimes my brain would stitch together several maps into one because they're essentially all the same.

At least L4D doesn't rely on gimmicks that are introduced in this game and has a lot of memorability. Even after multiple years of not playing it, I could launch it and still remember what segments follow on every map. And the fact that the higher difficulties in this game demand you to grind loot chest for better equipment or fiddle around with the crafting system is just absurd. The skill tree is also hit or miss. Some perks are genuinely useful while others barely affect your gameplay. Any item stat or character perk that boosted my movement speed was always welcome because the characters in this game are just strolling through every map at snail's pace. What quickly infuriated me is how the momentum of your movement speed isn't carried over into your jumps. You can run at the speed of sound but if you jump you turn into a snail until you touch the ground again. And I'm almost certain that the developers did this intentionally since a lot of these features that cripple you can be disabled via the skill tree. There is a perk that prevents enemies from slowing you down when being hit. Thank you very much for this perk, too bad you decided to give it to me when I'm just 5 level-ups away from being done with this character. Either way, I'm finally done with this shit. Took me 50 hours of my precious life but I'm finally out of this hellhole. I wish the rest of the community a pleasant time in this hellscape that you declare a game.

After years of play, this game has cemented itself as my favorite of the modern era. It is filled with content, charm, a world with so much lore it'll make your head explode, and some characters that are full of quips and history, spanning eons.

It's strong points:
- 5 characters, each with 4 variation classes each (last one is still coming for Sienna)
- Each character has a wide selection of weapons, both ranged and melee. The sheer quantity of weapons creates diverse experiences for each playthrough, which allowed me to stretch my gametime to around 300 hours. A very good return for the price.
- Graphics are beautiful. Allows for a unique tension and atmosphere that few other games can come close to. It all feels very grim and off, like you are in a magical beautiful place thats being contaminated by evil forces, which you must defeat endlessly.
- The dialogue between characters brings some levity and humor to an otherwise bleak game. The relationships between the characters really make you feel like theyve known each other for a long time, and that they are used to facing absolutely mind breaking horrors. This could've easily been a Lord of the Rings game (still hoping for a mod someday, or that Fat Shark gets the rights to LOTR...)
- Replayability up the wahoo. The Chaos Wastes added a great RPG rogue-like system that makes you actually feel the difference between weapons and abilities, instead of just slightly more damage or more stamina (chain lightning ftw)


Weak points:
- Game becomes a little repetitive (300 hours will do that), and while you can keep grinding forever to obtain red weapons for all characters, I don't really feel any incentive to because the difference between a gold weapon and a red weapon is really quite minor once they are at 300 power (max). It's like they created a system that is designed to make people come back for grinding, but the actual pay off is quite limited... Luckily, the actual gameplay is of such quality that the grind isnt a bother.. but the gameplay itself is more rewarding than the loot and weapon maximization.

- This game feels like it was made with love, but that it's still not everything it could be. The 4 player structure, while it does create for compelling teamwork and makes you feel like you are part of an actual team, forces the game structure into the ""go from point A to point B and pull the lever"" sort of gameplay that Left4Dead was designed for. It does manage to pull this off quite well, so I can't fault it for that, but I feel like this game could be cracked wide open and more potential could be manifested. The chaos wastes kind of prove it. I could see this game be a Diablo-esque, or perhaps moreso like a Borderlands looting adventure game.

I've been playing Warhammer Inquistor lately, and my early attempts at playing it left me a little wanting. But having played Dark Tide and Vermintide, I now see the greater diversity of the game, the lore, the enemy types, and Dark Tide now makes me fee like I'm playing a FPS Inquisitor.. and it just made me want more out of Dark Tide and Vermintide. Both have their Diablo-esque equivalent, Chaosbane and Inquisitor, but both Dark Tide and Vermintide seem a little show about introducing diversity of enemies that exist in their universes. The minotaurs were a welcome DLC enemy, but there could be so much more that could really push these games to the next level.

I've gotten much more interested in the higher difficulties along with learning the mechanics in more depth than I ever had before. Chaos wastes keeps the game fresh with its rogue-like features and the AI Director keeps every playthrough from feeling the same.

Game exists for 3 (upd: 5) years and it still has the quality of alpha version of indie project made by fucking department of divercity. This game was made by every minority, including monkeys themselves (real animals I mean), but not the developers with brain and hands. 3 (upd: 5) years of existance? You still get hitboxes worth saying ds2 devs did a great job of making such great hitboxes in comparison to this piece of dung. Getting hit from a mile away literally is normal there. It's not some visual bug or anything, I looked at it from side perspective AND YOU AND YOUR ENEMIES LITERALLY ARE HAVING FUCKING INVISIBLE DAMAGING HITBOX ON THE END OF WEAPON. This is not some fancy bug, it's straight up concentrated piss in your face. Game gives you a mechanic of an alert telling you about incoming attack? Welp, no matter how good you are, if you aren't spinning like bayblade - you'll be damaged by someone behind sometimes, just cuz those fucking gorillaz didn't want to add ALWAYS WORKING ALERT. (upd: it literally started to work worse) It's straight up not giving you a whispering sound sometimes! Getting hit throught the wall? That's a common situation when you are fighting boss. Why making same collision with objects for every mob? Let's just add that for players, bitch suffer. Wanna play moddable version? Well, get fucked, progress won't save. Either forget about exiting the game, or don't play it. Why? Someone may cheat in this game? CHEAT IN COOP FUCKING PVE GAME? God damn they are crazy. They put anticheat for a damn PVE game! For you to not have fun or if you are tired of endless stupid grinding in this piece of crap to not be able to have every item cheated. IN THE FUCKING PVE GAME! Bitch, it even has donate skins, what a fucking garbage. Buying skins in PVE game to just say your friend ""look, I wasted money on some random helm skin, please tell me I'm braindead moron"". You know why people liked left 4 dead? Cuz they never tried to fucking turn mindless hack-n-slash (in case of l4d it's zombie shooter, but nvm) into a fucking MMO RPG with ton of grinding. You were (and still are) able to go everywhere with every mod you want in l4d. This game? Well, you can't go higher difficulty without grinding some items of higher strength. And if you do - you'll feel the very power of the devs throwing shit in your face. Cuz every time you were hit without sound or hit through the wall on champion, you'll get a oneshot on legend or cataclysm. And don't forget such minor thing as falling through the textures in random places in chaos wastes. And yeah, to be able to have fun in this game you really have to have 3 friends without a brain that spent billions of hours in this god forbidden place, have no brain yourself (or just be kid without a taste and dignity to tolerate every kind of shit that wasn't fixed for all these years) and waste 1000 hours on guides and videos how everything works there, uuuhm and waste 500 hours minimum in this game.
Upd: and you as a host can't even be a master of your own lobby. You can't freely kick random moron. And if stars converged together and votekick worked once and you kicked a guy, you won't be able to start votekick again if you got one more moron on the place of old one. GREAT! 
Upd of 2021: So much for QoL update. Nothing good happened, just added some random shit nobody asked for. Forgot to add ""Worse"" in front of ""quality of life update"". Game is still junky piece of crap, but now you can't use UI mods, untill they are upproved again. About the shit they added: ""Oh guys, it seems like you are having an easy time completeing those billion stupid challenges... take two more billions!"" We buffed bosses in chaos wastes? How about giving something buffing to players? Go f yourself, player. Where is my real quality of life in this game? Where are my normal attack warnings? Where is my normal audio system so I can hear that there are rats behind me?... WHERE ARE MY NORMAL SPAWNING SYSTEM so I won't get rats spawned behind me literally the second I turn away??!?!?!? Where is good reviwe system so my teammate won't die RIGHT after picking him up cuz there is no such thing as invulnerability frames? Why didn't they add the thing if you passed your teammates that have to be woken up after death and you can't get back to them... just move their bodies further!!!!! It was in damn left 4 dead billions of years ago! And after all, where is my good hitboxes so I won't get hit by charged attack from 9 miles away or get hit late long after spear hit animation? This game is complete garbage, if you never started it, don't buy it.
Upd after 1000 hours in this game: Heh, I still think this game is a complete piece of garbage, but considering there's nothing better in the market... and I learnt to enjoy this game at 700 hours... you may actually consider buying it. I mean, if you are up for some billion hours grinding and sucking all the nuts in order to learn to enjoy this game....

- Enemies spawning on top of players or in the open, as in everything from single enemies to even entire horde waves just appear from thin air 2 meters in front of you instead of spawning hidden behind walls or buildings or corners.
- A lot of enemies seem to spawn behind you now (and again, not behind you and a bit further away hidden behind a fence or corner as they usually would, no, they spawn in the open right behind you and ready to attack) leading to you taking hits from behind even though you just checked to see if there's any enemies a mere second ago.
- Enemies don't attack players properly anymore, as in they will go past one player that is close to them and currently not fighting anything (so their slots should not be filled) in order to attack another player that is further away.
- One of the most extreme examples of this that I've had was some enemies that spawned close to the party but instead of attacking any of us, they pathed AHEAD to the center of the next room (they literally walked through me to get there) and after they reached the center of the next room, that's when our location seemed to ""click"" for them so they started pathing properly back towards us.

Specials behave weirdly as well:

- Globadiers will now almost always throw globes from behind cover (behind walls or buildings, usually outside of where players can walk) without requiring any line of sight to the players so they're impossible to prevent.
- Assassins will get stuck a lot more often doing that thing where they pick a 1-2 metre path and they just go back and forth really quickly before eventually teleporting away.
- Blightstormers seem to spawn way further from the players now and they also seem to spend more time far away after they have spawned and I've even seen them cast storms on random areas where there's no players. For example on a Garden of Morr run, we (the party) were getting close to the guaranteed ammo box that spawns on top of a coffin a bit after the first tome and there was a blightstormer spawned somewhere around the little maze where the first grimoire is (judging by the sound) and after a few moments he cast a storm in the large open space that is AFTER the ammo box, even though there was nobody there as none of us were even at the ammo box yet.

Bots are also similarly way dumber than before the patch (all of these bugs would happen before as well but you used to see it once every few games whereas now it seems to happen multiple times in a single map):

- They get stuck very frequently in multiple spots and refuse to move, it happens frequently in ""checkpoint"" style areas of the map where you can't backtrack but it's not exclusive to those areas, I've even seen them get stuck on incredibly small geometry elements such as rocks or pavement corners in otherwise completely open stretches of the map.
- They can't pick up some books properly anymore. There's always some books that are hard to reach for them so they usually just ""try"" for a few seconds and then pick them up from a distance, however, this patch (ironically) seems to have made those books even faster (they pick them up instantly) while also making the easy books impossible. Now when you tell a bot to pick up a simple book (one where you can easily walk next to and pick up), they just become rooted to the ground in the spot they were when you gave the order and they don't get unstuck until you cancel the order somehow (order another bot or pick it up yourself).
- Revives also seem incredibly difficult for them, previously they would sort of ""judge"" the situation and revive if it was deemed safe enough. Now, when someone dies close to a bot, the bot will immediately attempt a revive no matter the situation, however, not only that but they will also cancel the revive as soon as they start it. And as a bonus, it seems that if they managed to do this weird attempted revive, they will no longer revive that hero even if there's no more enemies present (I have seen it happen with both players or bots being downed).
- The bug where they pull out a ranged weapon and then get stuck like that and never switch back until they die seems to happen way more often than before as well (most frequently on Kerillian bot).

All of these bugs have occurred as both client and host, in both solo games as well as partially or completely full games so it's not an issue with the connection or syncing between players. I understand that every patch comes with some bugs (as is the case with every game), however, there seems to be something fundamentally broken that affects multiple things and with a big impact too. If I were to guess there's a problem with pathfinding in general or maybe the way AI (enemies and bots) determine the position of certain entities (such as players).

As it stands I would unfortunately recommend avoiding the game for now.",1680731416,1680731416,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As I said previously, this game is overall a masterpiece. Playing Left4Dead in one of the best rendition of the Warhammer fantasy universe at the time, with amazing gameplay to go with it and countless other qualities, it's just great fun. 

But I won't change the review to a recommend.

Originally, I thumbed it down because the connection stability was awful and never being able to progress due to this almost made me go crazy. It's pretty much fixed now. But a whole other issue replaced it altogether : the game is now a grindfest. You'll go through the entire content unlocking heaps of useless bits and bobs to process through annoying menus and systems in the hopes of getting something decent to upgrade your characters, eventually repeating levels over and over again until you hate it in order get the good stuff. You can't even be mindless about it, the game is hard, the levels are long, losing a map feels like you've wasted so much time, yet winning and getting crumbs feels like a slap in the  face. 

It is all, of course, avoidable through microtransactions, which is very much the point. And no, this being the current industry standard is no excuse.

The game's combat system is smooth and responsive, making it easy to switch between weapons and abilities to suit different situations. The game also offers a range of difficulty levels, which makes it accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers. The harder difficulties provide a satisfying challenge, but the game never feels unfair or unbalanced.

Igual sin lugar a dudas lo sigo recomendando pero supongo que el mood sci fi me va mas ahora. Asi que cierro una etapa definiendolo como un juegazo en primera persona de modo horda, pero que se quedo corto a la hora de innovar y la verdad que hay un limite a las skins que uno quiere comprar para los mismos personajes que ni siquiera ves en el juego. Tal vez si fuera tercera persona podria ser mas interesante, pero por ahora lo juego un rato mas y lo desinstalo probablemente por un largo tiempo.

No puedo evitar decir que la curva de aprendizaje de cada personaje es larga y hay un periodo intermedio en el que parece que no das pie con bola, pero una vez superado llegas al final de los escenarios legendarios sin mucho problema a menos que seas un loco arriesgado o que no juegues en equipo. No lo recomiendo porque expulsar a un miembro que no juega en equipo sigue siendo parte del sistema. Asi que como la practica hace al maestro no puedo dejar de recomendar probar todos los personajes pero especializarte en uno hasta que te aburra antes de pasar al siguiente.

Tweak some setting and go back in only to crash again.  Finally got to the point where im like fuck it this is getting a negative review from me.

Heard nothing but amazing things about this game and what actual gameplay ive been able to experience is also amazing, but two hours is never enough to give a game a fair shake, and imagine getting into a game for 70$ you have no idea about, see that its trash, and woopsie, you're past your refund time faggot have a good one.

I would be keeping this game regardless of cost anyway, hopefully the coming updates can get me out of this.  Enter game, six minutes of gameplay if im lucky, crash.  Tweak, repeat. Gameplay loop.

Currently its a hard no, if I can actually play the game for more than an average of four minutes, it would be everything people have told me it is.

So another six hours, more troubleshooting, and not much else fun to be had.  If you enjoy minmaxing your rig to only play one game at a time, this is the game for you.

Then this might be your jam~

Its based off of Warhammer lore which is something you don't need to understand before diving into this one, its pricey right now at $29.99 though it is 110% worth to grab on a sale like I did but its sad to see the deal I have gotten is no longer there. 

I bought this game with all the DLC included, now its all included with skins - making the 'Content Bundle' more expensive because of the added content. 

You can equip items of varying rarity which you can't pay to win which is odd in a modern game but very welcoming. 

Expect new players that don't know what they are doing, though if you are going to be one of them yourself just ask your teammates. Friendly bunch that you party up with usually. Has a surprisingly quick, active online que times. 

Though I can hear others say, is it as fun as when Left 4 Dead was in its hay-day? 

This game is super underrated and recommend it to anyone that enjoys that type of gameplay, check out gameplay just in case if you're on the fence about this one.

UPDATE: NEW EVENT MADE MY HEART LOVE CHEERS TO THE DEVS AND VOICE ACTORS AND THE ENTIRE TEAM

Update 30.03.2023:

This game still rocks, bashing Heretics and Rat scum all the way along with the beastmen. What this game lack is a lot since Darktide came out I mean the skeleton game of a proper game that should have been Vermintide became a haven and well sometimes to boring to play because of the lack of content here is my opinion so far:
         Positives: 
- Chaos Wastes fun until your head hurts
- A very well done and polished campaign
- The characters get to your heart SPecially Markus and Bardin.
- Different Classes to choose and play as.
- Fun with friends bashing skulls
- A lively community
- Purging stuff in the name of Sigmar

Negatives:
- The game lacks in level assets in Chaos Wastes.
- Belakor update was just to little to gain from (I expected an unique style of enemies not just re-used assets or mobs)
- No diversity in enemies we face just Nurgle, Beastmen, Rats sadge ( Why no Khorne or Slanesh stuff?)
- Lack of more content rather than spamming Chaos Wastes which is fun but gets boring overtime and normal missions.
- The maps look the same like yeah they look the same making my mood go down even if I enjoy them at a good degree it gets tiresome.
- The missions are mostly the same I wish they made a more diverse system like why not expand over what we have and just make a general campaign to aid the empire elves etc against the rats ogrees and all.",1562426759,1680153764,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

That's right, it's me, your favorite game influencer, and I'm here to talk about Vermintide 2. Now, I know what you're thinking, ""But Kraut, you're not even a real gamer!"" And you're absolutely right, I'm not. I just play games to write reviews that get likes. It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it.

So, let's talk about Vermintide 2. I played this game with my friends Julian and Dennis, and let me tell you, it was an experience. Dennis is a pro gamer, and he's very ambitious. He's the kind of guy who takes gaming so seriously that he eats, sleeps, and breathes it. Meanwhile, Julian is a hacker who's fascinated with the game's technology and how to hack it. I'm pretty sure he spends more time trying to break the game than actually playing it.

But despite all of that, we had a great time playing Vermintide 2. The game is intense, challenging, and a lot of fun. We spent hours fighting off hordes of rat-like creatures and exploring the game's intricate world. And let me tell you, it's a good thing I had Dennis on my team because I'm pretty sure he carried us through most of the game.

Julian, on the other hand, spent most of his time trying to find ways to hack the game. I'm pretty sure he's already working on a way to teleport through walls and take down bosses with a single hit. But hey, that's just Julian being Julian.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Vermintide 2 to anyone who loves action-packed, cooperative games. It's a blast to play with friends, and the game's technology is so fascinating that even Julian can't resist trying to break it. And as for me, well, I'm just here for the likes.

Before I start my review, some background stats. I own every DLC, I've put in around 500 hours into this game, completing every single level on at least legendary difficulty, and with every character, and gaining every single achievement. Also, TLDR at the bottom.

[b]Story[/b]:
You play as one of the Ubersreik's five (or four, it doesn't matter), the protagonists from the last game. This game picks up after the end of the first game, and the main antagonists (the skaven) have made some new alliances via the Norsemen. These brutal vikings and ratmen have teamed up and caused mayham throughout the land, and it is up you and your friends to make sure they don't succeed.

[b]Gameplay[/b]:
This game a co-op oriented PVE hack 'n slash, where the goal is to reach the end of the level by with certain challenges and objectives. You can play as one of 5 characters and, at the time of writing this review, a total of 19 subclasses. They differ greatly, from a mage blasting enemies with fire from afar, to the mighty slayer that has foregone (almost) all ranged weaponry in favor of more melee weapons.
Enemy- and item placements are randomized every game, making every run distinct from the last. The enemies consist of the aforementioned skaven, norscans and the later added beastmen. Very much akin to left4dead, they include specialised enemies that can disable a player, or big bosses the size of small houses. You will need to work together to increase your chances of survival.
Besides the 13 vanilla missions, a plethora of new missions have been added (almost all of them for free). These include old missions brought back from vermintide 1, trips to a castle from a former necromancer, and more. Alternative gamemodes like weaves (regular missions, shuffled, on steroids) or chaos waste expeditions (a rogue-light gamemode that gives you boons ranging from explosive bullets to literally thor's lightning) greatly expand the variety of missions this game has to offer.

[b]Atmosphere[/b]:
Fatshark has outdone themselves with the atmosphere in this game. The imperials cities, burning hamlets, pristine elven forrests, Nurgle infested sewers or gothic castles all add flavor to the game. Combine this with the witty banter between the characters and a beautiful musical score (especially the newer missions!) and I have yet to play a game that rivals the immersion this game has to offer into the Warhammer Fantasy world. 

[b]Community and teamplay[/b]:
Why dedicate a whole segment to the community? Because you need to co-operate with your teammates. Luckily, the community is as great as they get. Matchmaking is quick, and it often takes mere seconds to find a game. Furthermore, crashes are infrequent if not non-existent. You don't need to have a group of friends to play this game with others. Matches will fill in quick. And if you don't want to play with strangers, you can always host your own private game, where the very capable AI takes control of the other 3 characters that will stick close to you.

[b]Conclusion[/b]: 
Pros:
+ Fun, fast paced combat
+ Beautifully crafted levels
+ Fun characters with witty banter
+ Stable matchmaking
+ Free levels

Cons:
- frequency of content drops
- Can't think of any more

TLDR
If you want a fun, fast-paced game, with mages and knights, that you can play with friends, this is the game for you. Free levels, funny banter and bloodshed aplenty!",1680044301,1680044301,True,9,2,0.567368030548095703,0,True,False,False

Firstly maps: 13 regular campaign maps with 4 free dlc maps (3 Return to Drachenfels maps and 1 (so far) Trail of Treachery map) and 7 paid dlc maps. Each map can take between 10-20 minutes to beat depending on the difficulty. Every map also contains collectibles that make levels harder but give better rewards at the end. No 2 runs will ever be the same: monsters, specials, and elites can spawn in different combinations and numbers.

Heroes and Careers:
Each hero and their careers bring many benefits to a team. Any hero can fill any role at any time but some do things better than others. With 15 default classes (3 classes per hero) to choose, you have plenty of options. The default classes fit how each character progress through the story in Helmgart. There are currently 4 available dlc careers available that progress the characters even further and I would 100% recommend them. (p.s. the dlc careers go on sale frequently on Steam). Pick a hero and career you like and get slaying.

Weapons:
The melee weapons in Vermintide 2 all feel really good. Like the heroes that use them, every weapon can do everything, it's just that some are better than others at certain things (exp: a Great Hammer destroys small enemies with ease while a Spear does lots of damage to a monster). Vermintide 2 also features a variety of ranged weapons like: javelins, bows, rifles, shotguns, pistols, and flamethrowers. Every weapon has traits and skins to suit your playstyle. Get some weapons that you like, learn how to use them, get slaying, simple as that.
(p.s. if you buy this game, don't listen to those that give you crap about your weapons or other gear, everyone plays the game differently and you are no exception ;)

DLC:
Back to Ubersriek:
Back to Ubersriek has 3 main missions from Vermintide 1 and a new secret mission and gives each hero a new weapon. 
9/10

Shadows over Bogenhafen:
Shadows over Bogenhafen has 2 main missions and adds new weapons skins for all the heroes' weapons.
8/10

Winds of Magic:
Winds of Magic has 1 new main mission and gives each hero a new weapon and skins. It also adds the Beastmen as new enemies, a harder difficulty called Cataclysm, and Weave missions. Imo the Weave missions aren't that great but the Beastmen enemies are a great addition.
7/10

The Curse of Drachenfels:
This free dlc takes players to Castle Drachenfels from Vermintide 1 with 3 new missions and 1 new boss. Fight your way through the ""abandoned"" halls and stop the evil from within.
9/10

The Chaos Wastes:
This free dlc allows players to go to the Chaos Wastes. There you must complete expeditions to find The Citadel of Eternity while levels are warped by the 4 Chaos gods. This mode acts like a rouge-like version of the main game. Beating a level makes you stronger, losing means you have to restart your expedition. This mode will challenge you like nothing in the main game. Only the bravest can travel the Chaos Wastes. Happy hunting.
10/10

Final Note:
Like most co-op games, it's better with friends but public lobbies are good to. The folks at Fatshark usually have this game and its dlc's on sale but tbh it is worth getting it at full price. This game has been out for 5 years now and is still fully supported. Fatshark is one of the few companies that actually listens to its player base and is worthy of that praise.

The only thing so far that I wish they would add is a little more variety with cosmetics--body cosmetics specifically.  The ones that you can buy with shillings are just recolors mainly, which can be fine, but that's all there is (besides the $ cosmetics).  Even in the Holy Grail cosmetic dlc that I got for example, when I started looking at the body cosmetics, I'm pretty sure that they're simply just recolors--nothing new, and that's something you have to pay for with real money.  Also, you have to do some decently long challenges to unlock them, which, I didn't think they'd be as long as they were and I was surprised there were any challenges at all but... maybe they could adjust that in the future.

I also hope they can update the Winds of Magic dlc because it sounds like it has a lot of cool content like maps, weapons, (especially) cosmetics, enemies, and so forth, but every time I see something about it, it's negative--all focused on how the fun is sucked out of the dlc.

Oh man, I am very happy with how they've treated the game since I last played. Before the game was laggy, unbalanced, and terrible to play with other people. Now, they have worked on the actual feel of the game, and made the game not only fun again, but also balanced. They made the game better overall! They are remaining consistent on the updates and patches, and generally are paying more attention to who they listen to. Yeah, they're still doing things I'm not happy about, such as having DLC for your DLC, but I'm just happy the game is finally playable. Now if only we can get the PVP game mode they said they were working on...

-Old Review-
I really was late to Vermintide (The first one) game, but I became a fan of the advanced melee combat, and the ability to blitzkrieg though Man the Ramparts, and I spent a lot of hours on it, but Vermintide 2, it's a mess. 

As I said, I was late to the party for Vermintide, so I was not around when the bugs and unplayable game-play was a thing. So keep that in mind.

Vermintide 2 is, as I stated a train wreck. There were problems between players screens (Such as a door being open on my  screen, but not on my friends screen, and a lot of bombs were thrown in our faces because of this :/) Also, some of the characters were broken, or just unplayable. There was some questionable actions that the devs made that just made me confused. Like removing potion stacking, or adding only 3 (or 4, I can't remember as I write this) maps from the original Vermintide, and they were the least liked maps. There is also making the PVP game-mode, just to find that it was buggy, unbalanced, and was made to milk more money. 

Some of their ideas were cool, I'll give them that. And the lore, while not totally accurate, it was impressive how much they got accurate. The characters are amazing, and will forever stay with me!

Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros in this case, and it really disappointed me. I will always love Vermintide 1, but because of this, it left a bad taste in my mouth for the devs, so I don't even play V1 anymore.

Not much story but plenty of atmosphere in its highly developed dark fantasy setting, this game is all action with short, linear levels swarming with varied, interesting enemies who come at you in waves and occasionally require teamwork between your 4 squad members.

It is a co-op melee-oriented horde game with some of the best combat in any game out there. There are five characters who all have four classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You pick a combination of melee and ranged weapons, perks, and supplementary gear to bring into the battle against hordes of enemies. You play in teams of four, and teamwork is key for survival. The game has a wide range of difficulty options and can be fun no matter how easy or hard you like things to be. It is set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe, but you don't need to know anything about it to enjoy the game. I had no interest in Warhammer Fantasy or 40k before playing this game, but my friends convinced me to pick it up as a fun co-op game and I fell in love with it. I certainly don't have a lot of time in the game as of writing this, but I feel like I could keep playing it forever and never get bored. I would rate this game a strong 9/10, maybe even a 10/10 depending on how I am feeling.

The first topic I would like to cover is melee combat. When it comes to first person melee combat I genuinely don't believe anything tops this game. An argument could be made for some games like Chivalry, and I will concede that some other games do have absolutely stellar melee combat, however this is best in class for PvE games. Every character has a wide array of weapons to choose from, and each weapon brings something different to the table. Every melee weapon has a light string, a heavy string, and a push-stab. Some weapons also have an extra utility attack such as the rapier's pistol which can be fired while blocking. Each attack has its own properties such as varying levels of cleave, stagger, and armor piercing. This means that you can chain together combos using different attacks from light and heavy strings to find the most optimized way to deal with any situation. Some weapons are simple like the rapier or the executioner sword, light string for hordes, heavy string for single targets. Some are more complicated where the combo depends heavily on enemy density and enemy type.

As I just talked about melee weapons, I feel that ranged weapons would be a good next topic. Melee weapons are the cornerstone of your gameplay, and ranged weapons are usually there to compliment your melee weapon. Ranged weapons require ammo, which inherently makes you use them more conservatively. However, every character has access to a ranged career that greatly increases the power of ranged weapons as well as helps to lessen the restrictions they have in exchange for some melee power. Though, even as a ranged career, you still will find yourself using your melee weapon quite often, mostly for self-defense.

For the last bit of information before I talk about combat as a whole: enemies. There are many different enemies, each with their strengths and weaknesses. There are four different types of enemies: generic, elites, specials, and monsters. You will have likely heard these terms before from other horde shooters if you are familiar with them. Elites are powerful enemies that demand attention before they are allowed to deal too much damage to the party. Specials are disabler enemies that can temporarily incapacitate an ally. They are easy to manage in isolation, but hard to deal with in the chaos. If they catch you, an ally will have to help you get the special off of you. Monsters are the bosses of this game, all present unique threats that you have to learn to deal with in order to cleanly take them out.

Now, finally, onto the flow of combat. Vermintide takes place in missions on preset maps. The enemy spawns are random, so you will never have the exact same experience twice. The levels are generally linear with little events along the way you have to clear before proceeding. The flow of combat is extremely fun and rewarding. You will have to play combat very actively; constantly dodging in and out of enemy ranges while blocking attacks and delivering blows of your own. All the while, keeping an eye out for ranged and special threats and dealing with them before they are able to disrupt your team. The extensive combo system allows each weapon to have its own niche while also allowing you to have a lot of tools at your disposal in the form of various types of attacks. Having enough knowledge and skill will allow you to deal with nearly any situation by yourself, no matter how impossible the odds may seem.

As stated before, teamwork is core to success. While you can do a lot on your own, everything is manageable as a team. The enemy diversity ensures that no one weapon can do everything and that every person can have their own role in combat. Weapons that are good at cleaving hordes may not be able to keep up against armored targets; Weapons with a lot of defensive capabilities may not be able to kill enemies very efficiently. Specials work to distract you and disable your allies, opening up the more powerful elites to take advantage of the distraction. This helps encourage everyone to watch out for each other and gives a really rewarding feeling of teamwork.

Speaking of allies, next up are the characters. Each character has four careers (Sienna only has three at the moment, but her last career is on the way). These careers have varying stats, weapons options, and their own perk tree. This allows for a lot of playstyles for every character; you are bound to find something you like. Every character is incredibly charming and I found myself really falling in love with this charming band of heroes. They are the perfect example of their respective stereotype: Bardin is a gregarious and prideful dwarf on the path of self-discovery. Kruber is a loyal and light-hearted mercenary who does his best to do what he thinks is right. Kerillian is a moody and enigmatic elf who looks down on everyone else but secretly cares about all of them. Saltzpyre is an eccentric and overly-confident zealot brimming with holy fury. Lastly, Sienna is a carefree and impulsive wizard who would love nothing more than to just let everything burn. The game is brimming with banter and exchanges between the characters in a way that really communicates each character's captivating personality.

To finish things up, I'll cover everything that wasn't in a previous section. The overall balance of the game is quite good. Almost nothing in this game is bad, every option is perfectly usable. Some choices are stronger than others, but everything is able to get the job done. The game has a lot of DLCs, though none of them are really core to the experience. Most of them add maps and weapons, others add each character's fourth DLC career. You can buy all of them, none of them, or just pick out what you want. As for cosmetics, there are paid and earned cosmetics. The earned cosmetics are acquired by completing specific challenges on the respective career. The hub is a fun place to run around and parkour, you can freely test out weapons and skills as well as hear a lot of banter between the characters. There are some alternate gamemodes like the Chaos Wastes, a roguelite mode. This game really is endless fun, especially with friends. If you have the money, I highly suggest picking it up.",1679112187,1679112187,True,9,0,0.569618344306945801,0,True,False,False

As an example, I tried to queue up for a match and was put into one that was in-progress. I was put in the position the bot was in, which happened to be surrounded by a giant horde. The other players were a thousand miles away, apparently trying to run away from the bot for fun?
This type of experience is very common. People will also leave randomly, causing the game to end because they happened to be the one hosting it. 

Also, there is an in-game voicechat. Turn it off if you play with strangers - it's unhelpful and not even in a funny way.

Requires connection to run.

Toxic and elitist community, especially the forums.

Online play is more often than not a goat fuck...quite often people run off on their own, get killed, etc.

No dedicated servers, and sometimes ""quick play"" connects you to players in your own country or region, and sometimes it connects you to the other side of the planet.

Spike in difficulty from one level to the next is MASSIVE.

Since the last patch the game crashes constantly, spawns are seriously screwed up...things spawn right on top of you, giving you no time to react.

Edit...2 patches later......
It is now painfully obvious that every time they release a patch, things get worse...they fix 1 problem and create another 3.

Much of the games mechanics, such as quick match system and weapons / items you get for completing missions is completely broken. Most times you will need to manually select the map/mission you want because the quick play function will give you the same 4 maps/missions again and again and again.

The weapons, necklaces, rings, and trinkets along with the properties are a massive pain in the ass, and seriously convoluted....it's almost to the point that it needs an instructional video.
Crafting is slow, boring and repetitive.

I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam.

""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Dinkum and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.""",1678852286,1678852286,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Coming from Darktide (I never usually like going 'backwards' with games and VT2 is 5 years old), Vermintide 2 feels very fleshed-out;

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
There's nice campaign styled maps that follow a story.
The item crafting is very straight forward and available ASAP.
The cosmetics are enough that I can sort-of find a look I like, without paying cash, but they are mostly recolors. 
The professions diversity is VERY cool and I love that I can just swap mid-game without having to exit a game to change like MOST games do.
With the professions, you can also assign one of your other characters/professions as an AI... It ACTUALLY makes playing the other character have a purpose (I personally would not have played the dwarf otherwise), SUPER cool!
Feels like there is plenty of replay-ability

[h]Cons:[/h1]
I can tell that the game is 5 years old... It's not a fault, just a fact.
Wonderfully designed 'personal' space, that is virtually useless because it can all be accessed via the start menu.

If you never played Vermintide, it's conceptually similar to Left 4 Dead. Four characters venture out and face swarms of monsters, with occasional ""special"" monsters mixed in. The characters are charming and funny, and you'll still be hearing new interactions after 100+ hours.

Where it differs is in the RPG elements. There are 15 separate careers (19 if you have the DLC), 3 for each of the five characters. There are some similarities between the careers of a character, but each have entirely unique traits and talent trees. As you level up to level 35 you slowly unlock new passives, and are free to swap between them at any time. Where Left 4 Dead eventually lost it's charm for me, I'm still perfecting my build in Vermintide 2.

Its my absolute favorite coop game up to date that even after 700 hours doesn't bore me at all. The default game as well as the roguelike mode are fantastic and offer alot of replayability and the balance is at a very good place right now making everyone viable and nobody OP.

What stands out to me especially in comparison to lets say Left 4 Dead are the bots, the characters and the world around them. The gameplay also feels timeless, the build possabilities are amazing and the gore is fantastic. Great variety too with all the maps and gamemodes, not a fan of the WoM DLC however.

1) Bots are insanely good, you can beat Legend with them and they are better than 90% of the players. Some people even beat Catacylsm with them - absolute chads, just make sure you give them the tanky career and a mod to further improve them. They even tag enemies for you! Back in the day when Legend was the highest difficulty and the max level was 5 levels below what it is right now I frequently played Legend with bots and even took all bonus items that made the run harder and had a better time than with players.

The melee combat is flawless and you can really feel like you are in full control of your weapons; and there are a lot of great weapons. Spear, sword and board, great hammer, dual wield axe & falchion, flaming flail, bow, crossbow, pistol, portable explosives cannon, the list goes on. Some of the best weapons are unlockable via DLC which can also unlock more maps, skins, achievements, etc. I thought 90% of them were worth it.

In terms of progression, there is always something to look forward to even if that thing might be a hat that you may never wear. At least it's there and gives players a reason to play after having unlocked all gameplay possibilities.

The final point I want to make is how amazing the voice acting is in this game. It is so so soo much chef's kiss. It adds so much more depth to what is already a great experience.

I know that having kernel access allows for modification of the computer without my knowledge, that's all I need to know. Take as much precaution as you can. A leak is better than just being open.

As for the claims I made here eh, its not as cut and dry as I made it out. It does have kernel access. It has been caught running in the background.  There are mixed claims on the keylogging and data stealing.

Fundamentally there are plenty of games out there that are multiplayer that can prevent cheating without being as invasive. The fact that some people have gone to some pretty horrific insinuations makes me think they know it is wrong and want to justify their weakness to resting privacy invasion. Just remember, you know the man and they are in your pocket. Give away to much about yourself, and you give up yourself.

As for the game itself, pretty fun with friends, but so is anything. Grindathon with good flavoring.",1643430893,1677815005,False,117,36,0.616849243640899658,22,True,False,False

Basically Left 4 Dead but melee focused and playing in the Warhammer universe.

Has better graphics, sound, stability and balance.

The additional career paths add much replayability and are lore-wise correct. Their respective playstyles are unique and fun. Talent trees and weapon combinations provide much more experimentations.
Additional careers can be purchased with DLC.

V2 offers much more weapon variety than V1.
Many weapons are locked behind DLC, which is annoying. If I remember correctly it is 28 whole weapons locked away behind DLC !

The maps are beautiful and unique. More are locked behind DLC.
19 whole maps are MISSING from the 1st game. Fatshark is too LAZY and GREEDY to give them to us.



Warning:
The Cosmetic upgrade DLC for DLC is one of the worst things in the gaming industry and a historic crime. It set a dangerous precedent! Disgusting.

Winds of Magic DLC is one of the worst additions, it actively makes your game worse.

The community can be the worst.

Some local kids had obviously key'd the glass so it read dick.breath in the bottom right hand corner.  Upon further observation I found a small CD nestled on the window ledge with the words Left 4 dead 3 written in black sharpie all over it. I jumped with excitement, screaming in my mind with a high pitch squeal. I quickly rushed home with my treasure safely tucked under my bosom. The second I get through the door to my one bedroom apartment, I slap that god damn CD straight into my floppy disk drive. To my whimsical surprise it instantly boots up but strangely it was titled differently from what was on the disk, it read Warhammer : Vermintide 2. I was shocked and sceptical but I had to delve deeper. I built up the courage to press that start game button and what happened afterwards has scarred me for the rest of my life.

I spent hours upon hours being sexually violated by scrawny rat men with poles, viciously abhorred by grotesque apostates of the chaos lords, rigorously rimmed by rat assassins, burnt alive at the stake for no reason other than they can and to top it all of forcefully grabbed, abused and flung around like a d.ildo found between a lesbian legs.

Ranged combat is a beauty to play with either, as different characters with different classes use different weapons with different mechanics. Maps do not get boring easily due to the loot aspects (but may be a turn off for those who don't like grining). Cosmetics are grindable. Almost everything is kinda free. Grinding is not much of a chore either as you can try for better loot by adjusting difficulties or craft better loot to your liking. Some expansions are also free, so there. Overall, great game.

A good game when you only want to play the early to mid part of the game offers.

My negative take:

The end game grind is behind legend and above difficulty and the fact that you are still at mercy of RNG to get the end game gear. I know there is a crafting system but you need to scrap 5 of the end gear item to upgrade. And what is worst is bots are bad on legend and higher difficulty.

I like almost everything about this game, from the melee combat to the sound effect of the monsters, to the weapons hitting the enemies, to the goddamn conversations, all are master pieces. The thing that sucks are some of the songs, which it fits the chaos of the combat but it sounds like noise. Now on to the main point of the game, dissecting it piece by piece. First off the story.
The story is pretty simple, there's a big gate that can summon a large army of Chaos and Skaven really deep inside the Empires land, which is very bad for the war. But inside the game are bits of lore for Warhammer Fantasy which is a nice way to learn about the world around them.
The melee combat is the best part of the game and probably the reason people get the game. The hammers have impact and feel powerful, the axes and sword can dismember enemies and feel very light, as they should for characters of their history. None of the weapons are bad but there are just better version of some of the weapons, for example the mace and shield is way better than the sword and shield for Kruber.
The ranged weapons are also pretty good but they're not the main focus, so their ammo is more limited but they hit like a truck, and they're just used to kill specials and bosses, and at times elites. They have nice sounds and look amazing and fit into the fantasy world.
Now most people complain about the DLCs and its understandable, having one class locked behind a paywall sucks and having some pretty OP weapons also locked behind that paywall, but the base characters are solid and can do their roles pretty well.
Other thing to the game is the roster, there are 5 characters with 3 classes (and one locked behind a DLC), they're solid, each has a role and they have banter and conversations with each other and the conversations are a bit edited depending on which class you pick. There are youtubers who explain it in more detailed so I won't bore you with that, but they're nice, interesting and have lore behind them which they will discuss.

Overall, the game is worth it, it can get repetitive but there is a huge free DLC called ""Chaos Wastes"" which makes it fun to replay.",1677195882,1677195882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hmm really difficult to give this a thumbs up or down. So to summarise


Pros; 
good fun, especially with friends
good graphics
decent characters, except Kerillian, a character so unlikable that it seems like a plot to gain public support for a genocide of elves.

Cons;
Limited maps, not too bad but nothing that won't get very very repetitive after a while (more so with tome and grimoire placements not being random)
Heavy amounts of DLC, not necessary dlc, but still.
Wind of magic the latest DLC is poorly made and awful, essentially requires you leveling up from the beginning but virtually requires you to play with others at exactly the same stage as you, (if they are doing a stage you've done then expect to get about 5% of the reward for doing it for the 1st time)
Apparently about 36% of the company is owned by Chinese company Tencent, infamous for being awful in just about every conceivable way.
No dedicated servers so P2P only.

This game has an incredible amount of maps and game modes with the maps having a linearly connected story that feels like a campaign. This is in stark contrast to Darktide where the maps feel more like one off missions with no relation to each other and with way less map variety. The interactions and voice lines between different characters are well thought out and give the characters personality and charm that I sorely missed in Darktide. If you get bored there's always the rouge like game mode to keep things interesting. Crafting is also fair and rewarding allowing for optimized character builds once enough time has been spent playing the game. Unlike the dumb shop system in Darktide, your given way more control over the weapons you're able to obtain and getting rolls you want since you can simply craft the weapon instead of praying you get the one you need in the rng Darktide shop.

Fun, that's the first word that comes to my mind hot, I played only ""quick matches"" so only with random teams and I admit I had fun. 
There are various difficulty levels, at the lowest level things are very easy and even if you are not an expert in the game the missions are easily completed without too many problems, as you go up in difficulty the enemies become more aggressive, do more damage and it becomes essential to use the parry and dodge commands in certain situations or to assess well how to move against certain enemies. Even at the item level obtained the difference changes depending on the difficulty level selected. Item crafting system quite good but not great, maybe it's me who didn't really understand how to make the most of it.
Otherwise, this game is keeping me company at times when I want to relax for a moment after work and is proving to be, as I said initially, fun, so my final rating is positive.",1676299114,1676299114,True,1,0,0.514285683631896973,1,True,False,False

Darktide comes out recently and had me wanting to try this one again before I think about purchasing Darktide (which looked like it still needed work anyways.) 

ANd just...WOW.  The game is MUCH better than when it came out.  The loot box tally at the end of missions can be sped up now, they've added challenges and quests to do alongside the main missions, the menus are a HELLUVA lot nicer to get through, the AI for the bots is MUCH better (and you can issue them commands!) and my favorite part....They added a rogue like mode where you gain perks/boons/weapons on a large expedition campaign that is like having multiple missions tied together.    The weapon/loot progression of the main campaigns become a bore once you  regularly get the max power'd items in lootboxes for weapons you don't want anyways.  Fun progression until you hit that point though.

The new mode, chaos wastes, is an arcade version of this Left4Dead formula that is fun as hell for me and starts everyone out at the default power level for weapons, with no trinkets, which evens the playing field of old and new players.  Only difference is the experience levels of the characters themselves still being the same, which only grant special Talents every 5 levels (max is lvl 35, atm.)  Each expedition is randomized and teams vote for the next area on the map to travel to, similar way to other roguelikes like Peglin/Slay The Spire/Inscryption.

And I've not even checked out the modded realm yet, still trying to get through all of the chaos wastes.  

So yeah, this game is worth trying out if you want a team based game ala Left4Dead/Deep Rock Galactic with satisfying evisceration.  

Fair warning though: The Banter between the characters, though very well acted for Voice actors (Saltspyre and Bardin are fantastic), REALLY takes it toll after a while.  And you cannot turn it off, ever.  Kerillian's VA does a good job, but Kerillian is tiringly oversnarky.

I love the new units, classes and features, but, they are not balanced into the ai directors rng formula well yet. Mobs use overly aggressive rng dodge and block calcs to bi-pass most skill-based combat methods from the first game which leaves the game feeling to random.

This is especially true on LEGEND which they may as well re-name RANDOM. on Legend mode, the game just decides if you win or lose based on dice. Plus, the extreme number of armored units on legend necessitates certain equipment choices and classes which combined with the randomness of the ai director and imbalanced unit damage/dodge mechanics leaves the game feeling more boring than challenging.

I played V1 for something like 2000 hours, at least 1500 of which were pure cata pug groups. The thing i liked about cata was that even though we lost a lot, it could always be chalked up to human error. The AI director didn’t just execute 2-3 team members randomly with unstaggered spawns and buggy unit mechanics. So, while we wiped a TON in V1, it was almost always something we could control and subsequently laugh about. In this game it’s just like ""yep, 2 gutters, 1 hook, a chaos horde, 4 SV's and 2 CW's all just aggro at the exact same time right on top of us, we lose i guess. I don’t feel engaged, I feel like it was never winnable in the first place and that is just plain boring.

Truth is CATA sucked on V1 at first to though. It took them a long time to balance it to the work of art it was later in the games life. I’ll keep trying back and I am sure they will make it more fun eventually, but as for right now, I would pass.

With probably the greatest melee combat of any game I've ever played, a world that is gorgeous and well-designed, and characters that are both distinct from one another mechanically, and infinitely memeable as individual personalities, the game does a great job placing you within the End Times, fighting Skaven, Norscan Chaos, and Beastmen.

That being said, Having owned this game for a long while, the journey to get to where its at has been... rocky, which makes me cautiously optimistic for the future of the developers of this game. Some changes, like the Chaos Wastes (Free DLC), add repeatability and excitement back to the game, while DLC like the Winds of Magic (Paid DLC) split the player base into two different random queues and introduced a frustrating new game mechanic.

All around fantastic game as it is now. It goes on sale a lot, and if you can pick up the game with all the DLC (excluding the cosmetic DLC for each character), then it is well worth the cost, though it's even still worth it at full price.

The game features intense melee combat and a wide variety of weapons and classes to choose from, making it a thrilling experience for both casual and hardcore gamers.

The game's graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail in the character models and environments is impressive. The game's AI enemies, known as Skaven, are varied and challenging, providing a nice level of difficulty for players. The game's co-op play is one of its strongest features, allowing players to work together to take on hordes of Skaven and complete missions.

Funny points:

The game's dialogue is often hilarious, with characters frequently cracking jokes and making puns
The character animations are so over the top that it's hard not to laugh when you see your character flail around wildly while fighting
The Skaven enemies are so comically evil-looking that it's hard not to chuckle when you take them down

[olist]
[*] Install [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395655171] Bot Improvements [/url] mod and start by playing a few games on recruit with bots. This will give you time to explore the map and try out new things without worrying about your team rushing ahead.

The story is interesting, but hard to understand and follow (in my opinion) as there is no Campaign mode and only Quick Play, which allows you to delve in to different zones and missions to complete with others. There are also weekly challenges with effects on creatures and other fun challenges that drop off certain mobs (e.g. Deeds).

A fun, polished horde slayer set in the Warhammer universe (obviously, you should've realized that by now silly). I was worried at first starting off, thinking there could be a lack of content and that after a few days I would be bored. Having now 14 hours under my belt, I can see that the variety of missions and design of the progression system will keep you playing for a pretty long time.

In its current state, Vermintide 2 is probably one of the best horde combat games out there, though it took a long time for it to get to the excellent state it is in now.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ Top-class melee combat system with great depth. You'll very frequently find something else to learn about the combat system, whether it be early stuff like learning to best use your block and shove, or later stuff like learning a proper dodge dance + weapon-specific attack combos to maximize your effectiveness.
+ Varied weapons and classes give you many different ways to play the game.
+ Charming characters with amusing banter gives the game a bit of welcome relief from the rat-induced horrors and general darkness associated with the End Times setting.
+ A free roguelike mode which can give you some fresh (and chaotic) experiences should you ever tire of the main story missions.

[h1]The YMMVs[/h1]
= Occasional weird bugginess, but not enough for me to call it a hard con. Most of the time, the bugs are pretty innocent or even amusing.
= Player hosting for lobbies can leave you at the mercy of the host's connection. Though, in my experience, it's a solid netcode that really will only fall apart if the host has a particularly awful connection. 

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Poor in-game explanation of much of the game's mechanics. You'll need to check around for some resources if you really want a numerical understanding of what different weapons are exactly capable of.
- Getting good gear is a bit of a grind, as you'll frequently be subject to the whims of RNG.
- Some enemy hitboxes can be extremely janky. Don't be surprised if a Plague Monk (the loud screechy rats with the awful puke green cult robes) somehow chunks your HP bar despite you being on a cliff 5 feet above them.",1673996003,1673996003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
- Replayability
- Cathartic
- Good progression and loot system
- Decent talent/build system
- Great combat system
- Nice graphics, character designs, level designs and general aesthetics
- Challenging (at higher difficulties)

CONS:
- Can be inconsistent at times (miss a hip fire with a sniper weapon when enemy is LITERALLY like 2m away)
- Has a nice quick play system; however, qp randomly selects the same like 4 maps over and over and over...
- Higher difficulties require decent teamplay, but the game has a solo-minded community and no incentive mechanic to play as a team. Playing as a team increases survival odds tenfold, but no one seems to care. Everyone will also have more fun as a team :)

Each character has multiple classes to help you find what you're looking for, whether it be a more support oriented tank, horde slaying dps, or elite focusing boss killer. Every class has its place.
microtransactions don't get in the way of the gameplay and you can go hundreds of hours not dishing out any extra money unless you want a funny little hat on your dwarf. A lot of cosmetics are bought with a currency you can earn in gameplay, so customization isn't off the table.

I never expect to be addicted to this game since first play. One of the best Hack and Slash game I've ever played. You can play with others by just joining in lobby browser or quick play. OR you can play with bots! Bots in this game are freaking great, probably better than an average player, ngl.

The loot system is terrible, gain a loot box after every mission containing 3 new pieces of equipment with a slightly higher gear score, play another mission to get another loot box containing 3 new pieces of gear with a slightly higher gear score level. Repeat until you gradually become strong enough to do the higher difficulty.

Difficulty, there is no difference between the easiest difficulty and the toughest difficulty the mobs of rats just hit harder. It's a forced artificial difficulty that revolves around the badly designed loot system and leveling system.

Leveling, you gain the same amount of experience playing on the easiest difficulty as you do on the toughest difficulty, it's a boring grind to lvl to the maximum level of 35 where your characters ""power level"" increases along with his ""gear score""

Normally I'd write a more detailed review, but I'm not far into the game enough to give my opinion on everything. So first impressions, it's awesome. I can see myself sinking hundreds of hours into this trying to master the characters and challenge myself with the harder difficulties. I really want to see this game succeed.

EDIT: After 140 hours, yeah, I love this game. The characters and banter are amazing, which for me is a huge deal in these co-op horde games. The combat is visceral, satisfying, and varied not just with different weapons but also with how to use them most effectively. The environments are gorgeous and Fatshark is the first to make me legitimately interested in the Warhammer universe.

If I had one complaint it would be that the leveling takes way too long. The weapon progression is fine, but the character progression is a detriment to the game in my opinion. Classes really don't start to get interesting until about level 20, which takes quite a while. I still don't know if I'll like 3 of the 5 characters because I don't want to go through the slog of leveling them when I've already found a character that I know I like.

I bought this game a few years ago, I went into this game with no expectations, and at a first glance I felt like it was a more melee focused Left 4 Dead copy with a Warhammer: Age of Sigmar theme. Now I enjoy both AoS and 40K on tabletop, with more of an appreciation for 40K than AoS, so I went in with some bias. Stopped playing after an hour or so and completely forgot about the game. Came back to it a few months before all the Darktide hype and figured ""eh, why not give it a shot?"" Best choice I've made in a while. It's been hard to put the game down.

Pros:
- Each character has a lot of variety to choose from
- 3 classes each character (With the exception of the fire mage, each character has access to an additional class as paid DLC at this time)
- A decent selection of options for weapons
- Very satisfying combat
- Soundtrack fits the game very well
- Sound design is very satisfying 
- Good amount of content in the base game
- Crafting is fun, but not reqired
- Lootbox system that's fair and fun
- The game looks nice, even on the lowest setting
- The banter between characters feels natural, tension and arguing being organic at times.
- Being called a Lumberfoot
- The only explanation you have for the dwarf's language is in tool tips, which makes loading screens a bit more fun.
- The Chaos Wastes are a really fun way to play the game
- The Solo option is nice

Cons:
- Lots of paid DLC
- Cosmetics that have any effort put into them cost money
- The level design can be confusing at times
- The game will sometimes expect you to know the way to proceed with no explanation. I'm looking at you Trail of Treachery finale
- It takes quite a few matches to level up your characters
- The game can feel like a slog at times
- The dodge mechanic feels a bit clunky
- The prologue
- Load screens can take a while. Not a huge issue but if you don't like waiting it can get annoying
- Quickplay seems to be a mess? Never tried it but I've seen a lot of complaints

Overall, this game has a lot going for it. Don't go into it expecting a beautiful game where everyone looks like a supermodel, it takes place in a time where baths are a luxury, everything is filthy and it shows. If you can get the game on sale it's a steal, grab a few friends and you'll have a good time.",1669651402,1673195144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You won't know the exact year of the events, so it's not clear whether Altdorf is already burning and Archaon has reached Middenheim, but the mood of the end of the world is omnipresent and heavy. Dust falls on the ruins, doom hangs in the air, and Nurgle's gardens of loathing and decay thrive among the broken houses. The occasional cheerful song from the dwarf or the wizard Sienna teasing remark to the devoted sigmarite Victor is like a spark of hope in the darkness and, with its contrast, deepens the hopeless distress. The Warhammer lover will be delighted.
An exception would be found, however, in the form of the elf Kerillian. Yes, Warhammer elves tend to be dismissive and condescending towards other races, but there's a difference between the good-natured bickering of others and a constant stream of annoying insults that the heroine spews wherever she goes. You can put up with it for a while, but when he doesn't close his mouth even after two hundred hours and utters a hundred venomous rants during a mission, it gets on your nerves. In the end, one finds oneself actually quite glad when the elf is finally cut down by the hardened assassin.

Vermintide 2 is a sequel as it should be. The successful action core of the first one remains preserved, only a little more dynamism and rawness has been added to it, resulting from a larger number of enemies and therefore even more headless carnage. The creators have reworked the item acquisition system to some extent, eliminating much of the annoying role of randomness through simple but purposeful crafting. There were also light RPG elements, a more diverse environment that is no longer bound by a single city, and more types of enemies, as the original rats (Skaven) were joined by hordes of Norse barbarians in the service of Nurgle, and hideous armies of Beastmen. Fatshark's Vermintide 2 excels at conveying warrior euphoria.

Nineteen character options.
The ensemble of five heroes looks to have remained the same from last time, but that's only true at first glance. The latter will already reveal the welcome changes. Everyone now has a choice of 4 careers, which open up completely new possibilities and game styles.
If you want a dwarf Bardin, an indestructible ironbreaker or a possessed slayer with vision worthy of death. Depending on your own taste and mood, you can play the sorceress Sienna as a deadly fire-throwing machine or a melee fighter dressed in flame armor. Human mercenary Markus Kruber reveals the campaign as a Bretonnian warrior or a hunter with a death-sowing bow. Templar Viktor Saltzpyre also has a decent selection of characters available. My favorite character remains elf Kerillian, even though everyone hates him, especially his campaign as Shade, the servant of Malekith.

You literally have to build each character according to your imagination and choose the best combinations of skills, equipment and weapons and their respective properties.
Personally, after hundreds of hours I have mastered the legendary campaigns of all characters (which was my main goal) and I enjoyed each one.

I've read many Warhammer Fantasy books, so I have to criticize the game for one thing - it's not bloody enough. It would definitely need more second animation of death, real carnage as described in the books, just don't mess with heroes in gloves. Being torn apart by skaven, having a skull crushed by a beast, being eaten alive by a chaos monster... maybe I sound weird now, but this just belongs to Warhammer.

I may have beaten the game and have nothing to gain from it, but unless I find a successor, I'll still enjoy the carnage of Warhammer. I choose from 19 campaigns based on a random number generator.

I'll say that again: I don't hate the game! It's actually really fun! 

So WHY am I not recommending it? Good question.

People don't seem to understand recommendations on steam. I don't *hate* Vermintide 2. I just wouldn't recommend it to other players. With that said...

Pros:

Graphics and atmosphere. Amazing realization of the Warhammer Fantasy setting. Fantastic job, Fatshark. 

Combat is... amazing. Best melee combat in a first person game ever, in my personal opinion. 

Extensive build diversity. Lots of careers and talents to pick from, that's great.

Cons:

GRINDY. AS. HELL. Seriously. So many of you are willing to tolerate the grind because the combat is great. For those who haven't played the game yet, this is how loot and progression works:

You get a loot box at the end of every mission. The ""level"" of the lootbox depends on difficulty, whether or not you're in quickplay, how many collectibles you got in the level, loot dice from (random) bosses and drops, and total RNG. This is the only way to get new weapons and items. There is NO way to get a specific weapon you want aside from crafting, and you can only get crafting materials by smelting down whatever you don't want. 

This means the most efficient way of gettting high-quality gear is if you play one specific mission on a high difficulty OVER and OVER and OVER again. This isn't like Deep Rock Galactic where the maps are randomly generated. You play the same mission on the same map over and over, grabbing all the collectibles. It's tedious as hell, and EVEN then it's still up to chance whether you get a Tier 6 chest or not. 

Even then, all loot in the game has an ""item power"" (like Gear Score in Tom Clancy's Division).

How do you get items with high power? Play on higher difficulties? Complete specific challenges? Nope. You just mindlessly open chests. Just keep opening em, and the item power for each item in each chest has a CHANCE of increasing anywhere from 1-5 or DECREASING from 1-2 according to the highest item power you've previously acquired. I'm 45 hours into the game and I've maybe opened 150-200 chests of various types, and I'm roughly at Item Power 250. The max is *300*. Y'know what that means? At LEAST another week of grinding. 

This is not a satisfying way of getting items. This has absolutely nothing to do with merit or skill and everything to do with grinding and patience. The actual skill and tryharding doesn't start until you've maxed out your item power. Until then: gotta open that next chest, baby.

Also, Winds of Magic is a terrible DLC, fight me. It costs the most despite adding the least (ONE new map). The new weapons are cool, but the new enemies have cheap, low-quality looking animations, and the new difficulty (cataclysm). No additional XP, no better loot. I find this especially bizarre because the Chaos Wastes roguelike mode easily adds twice as much content as Winds of Magic and it's FREE for everybody. 

I like the game and I'm going to keep playing it, but I'm concerned for the future of Vermintide 2. The grindy, tedious progression system combined with the fact that Tencent is a major Fatshark shareholder are not good signs. Fatshark's 40k title, Darktide, is an objectively unfinished buggy mess with the same progression tedium as Vermintide 2.

- have friends that play this game (especially if they're experienced) or are willing to go in on it with you to give it a shot
- are interested in the Warhammer IP already or are willing to try getting invested through this game (which probably isn't the best place to start but everyone starts somewhere!)
- enjoy L4D-style gameplay loops or are coming from a similar game like Darktide, except it's generally melee-focused with medieval weapons/magic
- like action RPGs like Marvel's Avengers, but want something with much slower progression and more grinding
- find this game on sale

If more than one of the above apply to you, you'll have a good time. I've had the best time playing with friends and not a ton of success playing with randos because I prefer to use a mic and that's generally not the experience I've had - oh well.

There's not a ton of customization in terms of your character's cosmetics, which is fine I suppose but it does leave something to be desired) and the amount of grind that's needed to fully level a character's gear levels is off-putting to me as a beginner, especially when everyone else you play with has been playing longer and on higher difficulties. So, if you're in a position where you'd be the odd person out and you'd feel like you'd have to grind to keep up or feel awkward and don't have the time (I don't usually care - they can pick me up or choose a lower difficulty lol I got better things to do than grind levels man), then that might be a sticking point.

Other than that, it's still a lot of fun. I just don't have the energy to grind as much as this game seems to want me to.",1672968331,1672968331,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can be played both co-op or solo with bots. Bots are actually alright and often offer a better experience than playing with players. Bots are especially perfect for picking up tomes and grimoires: hidden collectable items you can collect each time you play a mission for more challenge and more reward (players aren't so consistent at picking those up, often not knowing where they are, or not caring). The playable classes and sub-classes are quite unique and (for the most part) greatly change up the gameplay experience. It's fun to level them all up individually. The loot system feels fair and has nice mechanics for consistent progression. 

The game consists of many long, replayable campaign missions, that can be completed and repeated on various difficulties. Boss fights are fun due to interesting mechanics rather than just being enemies with lots of health and damage. The level design is great, big and open with many nooks and crannies, allowing for many ways to deal with combat scenarios, as well as interesting hiding spots and platforming sections for the collectable tomes and grimoires mentioned earlier.

It also has more special monsters than L4D which immobilizes careless players so more cooperation is needed. Also on higher difficulties you need to be better at dodging, blocking and pushing which is really nice and making game not ""braindead"".
So far (didn't play last DLC yet) I really liked the ""adventure"" thing in this game where you can choose which path you go and play several maps until final battle with boss.

The negative I would say is maybe there is not a ""city"" or ""marketplace"" where players would gather and I could see other players outside of battles. So hard to tell how many players actually play this (yea I know there is something like watching trend of this game but can't find it :D ).

Also next negative thing at least for me as a new player are collecting books and grimoires on every damn map... it takes a lot of time searching, jumping which most of times isn't fun and some books are located ridiculously hard places to get and impossible to find by trying to search completely (you have to search youtube or internet to find it).",1672664552,1672664552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is currently 2022 and there are no dedicated servers. There are no community servers. Everything is peer 2 peer and your experience is dependent on the Host's computer and internet connection. If you lose connection to the host (d/c, crash, rage quit) it is game over. Host Migration does not save progress, unless it is in Chaos Wastes, and only work some of the time.

Characters are verry well written (exept Kerillian the elf who sounds like a american b*tch feminism character). I have been playing mostly with bots and they are pretty damn good, because you can give them your gear and they can be strong as you. Only in the last mission they are pretty useless, because of the boss fight. Otherwise they are doing well. But its like in l4d2. You die, mission is over. No spoilers for the story. Back to the characters - you can play as 5 characters and each has 3 classes and 4 of them have a dlc class... I personaly hate it. First and my favourite is Kruber - human. Sounds nice, is nice to everyone and loves to drink. Best guy i could ask for in this game. Next is a dwarf named Bardin - again he is nice to everyone and sounds like a dwarf and also loves to drink. Next is Victor (human again) who believes in Sigmar - he sounds ok and interesting when he talks about Sigmar, but he can get annoying and he sometimes sounds so proud that it makes me feel sick. Next is a  Brightwizard called Sienna (human) - yes it is she not he - should be called brightwitch if ya ask me. But whatever - she is old and sometimes sounds annoying as all hell - interestaing aint it? Since she can summon a cyrcle of fire. And now the worst character of all Kerrilian the elf - yes... SHE HAS NO GOOD LINE! AND I MEAN IT! Listening to the worst tone of a guitar would still be better then listening to her. She is nothing but annoying b*tch. Always talking about how she is the best and nothing else. She deserves to be deleted, but she is still a bit better then Pavlovna from Call of duty: Vanguard... Now our friend in the main lobby in the keep, from where you go to missions. His shop is nothing but useless. Litteraly. You either have to complete his quests to get silver to buy cosmetics or buy them for real money... Litteraly nothing but useless. Difficulties of the missions - i played up to champion difficulty and i reccomend to play ONLY UP TO THIS DIFFICUTLY, because then its like expert in l4d2 - unplayable... And one difficulty is only playable if you pay a dlc... And that dlc only gives you a one more mission and a boring gamemode...

This game is amazing. It is similar to Left for Dead and Killing Floor, but melee focused. I've only played with bots (they are viable until the hardest difficulty), so my review will not cover trying to play with other people.

Pros:
- The combat system. There are different weapons with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some weapons are great for killing hordes of weak enemies, while others are great at killing armored elites. Some weapons are even adequate at dealing with both. Once you learn a weapons strengths, you then learn the intricacy of the weapon's rotation of attacks, and when to interrupt that rotation with a block to better deal with a situation. Unfortunately, many weapon guides are outdated since there have been a couple of weapon updates.
- Characters have their own play styles, and each character has 3 character classes that play differently.
- The game looks great, and the weapon skins (illusions as the game calls them) also look great.
- Talents add some more variety to how each class is played, though some talents are obviously better than others.
- 13 maps, lasting about 20-30min each. No run is the same (there are a few scripted mini-boss fights), some runs will be easier and others more difficult. It is amazing to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat (also known as a Chaos Spawn). Each map stands out from the others.
- The daily quests and achievement rewards give better loot than one will encounter when just starting out (until you start playing on the hardest difficulty).
- The bots pick up potions and grenades. While they don't use them, they will give them to players that have an empty slot.
- Bots can be very effective at tanking bosses and mini-bosses (given favorable factors with terrain).
- Sanctioned mods that can be played on the official realm.
- You can pick what class (and what characters), talents, and weapons bots use. Since the bots use your characters, it is important to level up all characters that you use as bots and equip them with better weapons and accessories.
- As of patch 1.2.1 there is greater control over bots.

Meh:
- There aren't any stats for weapons, so some weapons are viewed as being useless when their benefits are hard to see (example: Kruber's two-handed sword seems worse than his executioners sword, but it does better stagger on heavy/charged attacks which is useful on preventing high-damaging elite enemies from attacking). (EDIT: There have been significant changes to certain weapons in version 2.0)
- The beginning can be very hard until you get better equipment. Crafting weapons becomes necessary to more quickly raise the power level of the equipment you get. This can be discouraging at first, but bearing through it rewards you with a fun game.
- The developers do not communicate very well.

Cons:
- A lot of old bugs keep returning when a major patch is released (hits on enemies not registering, enemies spawning on top of you, talents not working, bots getting stuck).
- It takes around 270 hours to level up all characters to the max level of 30. Now you have to level up to 35.
- Bots have had their range attack distances greatly reduced. Bots will not attack beastmen archers that are firing on them.
- Character classes are locked behind level unlocks, as are weapon blueprints to craft weapons.
- Very grindy.
- RNG (also known as Ranald) can be very cruel and unkind when getting loot. It seems like I mostly get trinkets, charms, and necklaces rather than weapons, and uncommonly get weapons with illusions (it does get better with better loot chests).
- Ranald, again, is not kind when re-rolling for traits and properties on weapons and accessories.
- Cosmetic hats can be very rare, and the different armor cosmetics are just re-colors of the default armors. These re-colored armors look bad with all the hats, because the hats are colored to match the default armors.
- Not all new player friendly weapons are available in the beginning. You have to level up to get access to blueprints to craft weapons and accessories, or hope Ranauld (RNGesus) gives you a variety of weapons.
- Losing connection to steam will end a run, and a run ending or being defeated results in no rewards (you do get a small amount of experience for being defeated though).",1534363657,1672308515,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Almost every game there is a game breaking bug such as people getting stuck in walls/floor, falling through floor, losing connection with stable internet connection, rounds not ending, events not triggering, waves not spawning. All these bugs during the last few days. I really like the concept of this game but even when I ignore the questionable design choices of devs I just can't ignore all the game breaking bugs there are.

If that's not enough, we have absolutely twisted difficulties in the modded section for the madlads and the psychopaths. And it all goes on sale so often, it's more expensive NOT to buy it!
Don't worry, all the daily login and MTX crap the game got as it grew is EXTREMELY safe to just ignore, you're not losing out on any progress.

Old Review: This game was a blast when I were a Windows user for fun with friends, but the content becomes quite drab as you go through and the DLC is extremely high priced with mixed reviews, as well the graphical fidelity of the game while beautiful is poorly optimized and just leads to many computers running far slower. This game as well features some of the most egregious Easy Anti Cheat and as such does not function AT ALL on Linux. Compared to the first title, which is a gold rated protondb game, this is pathetic. 
tl;dr: Either way, if you're on Windows or Linux, I would avoid this game and rather await a better sequel, and if on Linux I would buy the first title and as well await the day EAC dies so it can be removed from these games.",1606732244,1671210518,True,0,0,0.509153366088867188,0,True,False,False

After the most recent patch (which introduced the wolf-fathers gifts) any time I play the game, all I get is a black screen with UI elements. Presumably this is Easy AntiCheat thinking that the game files are modified and trying to prevent me from playing. I have attempted to verify my files and have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, to no avail. Nothing I do makes any difference. I can't speak for anyone else but for me personally the game is literally unplayable and I don't know why.



So I've played this game a lot more since my original review/rant, and feel more/less like I can make a 180 with the current state of the game.

FS has made a lot of very player friendly changes in the time since WoM came out, and have maybe not ""reverted"" but well.....reverted... a lot of the class nerfs, allowing specialization again while doing a fair job keeping balance. They have expressed a desire to make any future ""DLC"" (Maps.) free to all players in favor of some amount of micro being added (It was originally only cosmetic, but now includes very unique takes on hero careers; but its not super expensive and keeps the rest of the game free going forward so I consider it.....Acceptable

Over all without explaining every single thing that has been changed since my original review I'll just say that in its current state I would 100% recommend the game regardless of it being on sale or not





** Old Review Begin

I love this game, I want to keep loving this game, but I feel like the devs are too responsive with how quickly they're willing to buff/nerf things, and are too focused on making recruit/veteran as playable as possible, while leaving Legend as that near impossibly feat since just after launch.

7.5/10

Editing my already negative review of how FS handles game balance during the WoM ""beta"" 2 days before its release-

Assuming FS doesn't just pull some elaborate ""April Fools!"" and revert many of the changes made in 2.0, this game will remain in a sorry state of combat for months, and this is coming from someone who doesn't even mind how bad it actually is right now. I can't, and won't suggest you buy WoM at this moment, and I can't really suggest buying the base game either, as you cant just avoid the horrid 180 they've made unless you stick to Recruit/Veteran difficulties. Many talents that allowed careers with blatant downsides to improve survivability have been fully removed, I.E. slayer lost most of his damage reduction seemingly due to his main downside- the lack of ranged weapons no longer being a thing due to throwing axes, Unchained lost her health increase, mind you she gains overheat for taking damage meaning she needs HP far more than many other careers, and just overall your ability to use one career as a class specialist is gone. Regenerating arrows using the Waystalker passive? (You know, the range focused elf?) Gone. Free shooting with BH? Gone. They more/less threw everyone in 1 bucket and gave minimal new traits to compensate for the fact that they're all mostly mediocre at the one thing they're meant to be good at, bringing the good careers down to the level of the bad ones, so now they're all bad, and even then, careers almost no one played had nieche useful talents removed due to single instance use of them making them almost good.

rant end

This game could have been great. Like this it's just good.

Itemization is very boring, talents (skills) are mostly bland (+damage, + health, only about half has some little utility), end game is just farming or starting from scratch in another game mode. Bots are basically potatoes. Combat is fun, but everything else around it is half-baked, unpolished.
Worst though is that there is no real end-game, the rarest items don't really offer anything substantial and their drop rate is ridiculous therefore grinding is tedious and unrewarding.

It's a really interesting take on the Left 4 Dead/survival horror format. It really does well making you feel like you're fighting overwhelming odds, and the gameplay really makes you feel like a fantasy super hero. It also has a more traditional RPG gear system that can make this game with only a few playable characters/classes feel much more diverse. The only thing I think they didn't nail when it comes to gameplay is map design. The maps are really interesting and immersive but there are times where you feel totally lost. It doesn't hold your hand at all when it comes to directions. 

Unfortunately, it can get pretty repetitive. Not all the levels are going to feel completely unique, and the character progression system can feel really slow for new players. There are a surprisingly high amount of concurrent players, but the slow and repetitious gameplay loop hasn't appealed to a lot of my friends.

However, it has a lot of problems. The main one for me personally is the latency issue of taking damage even though you blocked/dodged way before the attack hit you. On Legend and Cat this will result in dying and takes away all my motivation to play when I'm not the host. Even with a stable ping of over 100 (I normally have 120) the game just feels unplayable. You'll constantly be taking chip damage which on anything but a full tank character will result in you going down multiple times a game when I rarely go down a single time in legend as the host. 

The game is also full of BS that punishes players for things outside of their control. Blightstormers are a great example, on legend a blightstormer can cast through a wall and cause an entire party to wipe. This is frustrating because there is nothing the player can do to prevent the situation. 

The dumbest issue I have with this game is so simple and yet it will never get fixed. WHY DON'T ENEMIES HAVE FOOTSTEPS?! an enemy can just run up behind you a stab you with you being non-the-wiser. In a game where getting hit a single time as a non-tank character can be extremely detrimental it so stupid enemies can silently sneak up behind you causing you to constantly spin around like an idiot the entire match to make sure nothings behind you.",1661213578,1670733573,False,2,1,0.491071432828903198,0,True,False,False

Seriously though, awesome game and really fun for those of us who love the more medieval/steampunk setting as opposed to the spacey-wacey side of Warhammer. I'm a fairly new inductee, so it's been a bit touch-and-go with learning the lore. This game helps me put pieces together slower, like in the Chaos Wastes when you fight against certain Chaos Gods, I have a better understanding of what Slaanesh does versus Khorne, and so on. 

Only real downside in my eyes are the bots. They are *SHIT* when it's just you, thus I strongly recommend making at least three friends and getting them hooked on this game too. Really makes it all much more enjoyable! :)",1670719323,1670719323,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I would classify the story mode as average. Some missions are really good that you enjoy their entire passage and processing, some are more boring. There are 5 branches for which characters to play as, which are then divided into even more sub-branches, where each character then has different abilities. The difficulty of cataclysm can be nerve wracking, but it's nothing that isn't doable. Your stacking of weapons and their perks + amulets also play a big role in your successful passage. After completing the basic missions, I enjoyed the Chaos Wastes mod the most, where, on the other hand, at the beginning of the game you only have basic weapon colors and no perks.

Instead you rely on matchmaking that connects you to unstable host rather than starting your (stable) hosted game. I admit  few runs were failed (one of them was minotaur instantly pushing whole group off the edge right at the start of second stage, and most of these include minotaurs which seem pretty OP to a newbie, even tho I had few successful Cataclysm runs on first Vermintide). I still have to say that 75 %  of weave runs end up with you disconnecting because of weird ""Backend error"" or ""Broken connection"" (that happens regularly even at the end of achiev and grim runs), or host leaving etc.

Also high ping renders you unable to block attacks in time!!!

TL;DR This is disguised SINGLEPLAYER game. Nonhosted multiplayer will fuck with you HARDLY. You better stick to localy hosted games. Matchmaking will make you wanna commit suicide.

Also Vermintide 1 seemed way better balanced and optimalized.

I almost forgot bots freezing randomly. So even singleplayer is big nerve-wrecker.

UPDATE: Weaves seem to be good as long as you play them during hours, when there's only few players playing. It will likely make you a game host, so you can simply kick low skilled players ruining your runs. This is necessary as weaves are way harder than either a story mission or Chaos Wastes expedition.

The roadmap was abandoned, major bugs still exist, and people still crash for various reasons. This is a joke. 

Weaves died with zero effort made to fix the content. This was a paid expansion btw that also let you play the highest difficulty in the game. Unless you buy Winds of Magic you are stuck on Legend difficulty. Cataclysm in vermintide 1 was free. 

Blatantly overpowered paid weapons. Spear and Shield, Sword and Mace, Masterwork Pistol, Trollhammer Torpedo, Dual Hammers, Bilhook, Griffonfoot Pistols, Coruscation Staff, etc all outperform almost every other weapon in the base game by miles. Why did I skip over elf's dlc weapons? Well...

Releasing a blatantly overpowered class with overpowered weapons then waiting months to nerf it to the ground. What Fatshark did with Sister of Thorns release was disgusting. +50% crit, attack speed, and crit damage self buff on a ""support"" class, with a ""ranged"" weapon that melee stabbed monsters to death in seconds. With moonfire bow being released as well (pay for that skin btw), why would you NOT buy her? It took them weeks to slightly nerf her, then months to hard gut her. SOT was a scam career. You got scammed if you purchased her. 

Let's be real here, the only reason Fatshark didn't get enough criticism is because of the free content. Say goodbye to that, because Tencent owns a majority share in the company. Enjoy your daily login shillings, testing the waters to see if it affects daily player count so they can roll out predatory systems in future releases.

I'm happy to see it's been fixed. Would recommend this game again. Still has a healthy player base, lots of content since it's been out for a while. Best with friends, but properly kitted you can get a solid solo experience with the bots. Great characters, memorable missions and locations, and each character has unique weapons and play styles. Also a great alternative if you want co op, tried Darktide and were unsatisfied with what you got.

This game was great. A real underrated gem when it released. As someone who loves both L4D and Warhammer, this game was a match made in heaven. To this day, even with all the developers mistakes (radio silence for extended periods, promised content never delivered, new content breaking the game ie weaves of magic etc) I would still recommend it if not for one thing: the game has become unplayable. No matter what solution I try, I can't get the stuttering and sudden frame drops to go away after this latest patch. This isn't the first time but it appears it's the last time. FS, I love you guys, flaws and all. But when I'm running this on an i7 8700k, RTX 3090, 32gb DDR4, and a 970 evo, and I go from 100 ish frames on high to suddenly 40s, something is wrong. When I drop everything to the lowest settings and it barely makes a difference, something is wrong. When the game is saying I'm getting 120+ fps but it feels like 24fps every few seconds, something is wrong. I've dug up every solution I could find online, and nothing works. Every other game on my PC runs without a hitch, so I know this isn't on my end.

So no, even after 650hrs I don't recommend this game to anyone interested because this isn't the first time a patch has been introduced that breaks the game. This trend dates back to launch. Ran great at first, and with every patch something broke and performance just got worse. Thanks to this it's killed my hype for Darktide. I won't be picking it up. I don't want to be burned again after investing so much time, energy, and money into something. If this ever gets fixed, I will happily change this review and get on Darktide. But I just don't see that happening. Shame, because I think you guys have great vision FS. This is easily the best if not one of the best co op first person games out there.

At the lower difficulties there's plenty of people to play with during any time of day. Try to not stick to the lowest difficulties for too long as nobody in recruit or veteran knows where the tomes and grimoires are, and you're bound to reinforce bad habits and not learn the game properly. 

Don't stick to Kruber too much, compared to the others he's quite bland. Try leveling Saltzpyre, Kerilian or Sienna.(especially Sienna, most new players are put off by the overheat mechanics, but Battle Wizard Sienna is the strongest class in the game)

Progression feels smooth, leveling to max is quite fast but item level grind might take new players a bit. Getting the important items in red ""veteran"" quality is the last step to the power-curve. Afterwards, it's just class mechanics and personal skill to carry you through the game.

There are a few classes that didn't receive as much love as others, like huntsman or pyromancer, who perform worse than competing alternatives from other classes OR other classes of the same character, but they can be fun to play regardless.

Of the DLC's, get them when discounted, but the most important ones are the weapon bundle (for torpedo launcher on Bardin, griffinfeet pistols on Saltzpyre and Coruscation staff - best staff on Sienna) and the expansions for more content (more maps to play).",1670187219,1670187219,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do you want to be mired in the bloodbath, surrounded by the gore and viscera of countless rats that charge you and throw themselves upon your blade? Utterly swamped in a tide of blood and vermin?

Vermintide is very similar to the game ""Left 4 Dead"" except replace the zombies with rats and significantly restrict your ammo supplies so you have to focus heavily on melee combat. You'll go through missions having to complete specific objectives while the game throws commoner rats and ""northlanders"" (basically L4D common horde) at you, tossing in things like machine-gun toting rats, armored soldier rats, berserker northlanders, gas-rats, flamethrower rats, minotaurs, and even super-armored hulking chaos warriors at you, and even random bosses, often several of the former at the same time depending on how much the AI director wants to screw you over. It's not easy, either... well, unless you're playing on recruit difficulty but that's more of a ""learning the controls"" gamemode than anything else.
That paragraph alone makes for an okay game, BUT the real meat of this game comes from the characters, and is what really sets it apart from other games in its genre of sorts. The Ubersreik Five are quite an interesting little quintet with a long history and very colorful dialogue with each other all throughout the missions, in the hub, and in the background story stuff, making for a very memorable cast in a genre that is typically lacking in such. It's this character flavoring in particular that enriches the experience of VT2 so much, the constant quips... the jabs at each other when you friendly fire, the thinly-veiled threats and clear tension yet existing comraderie between these five is something to behold and truly makes the experience what it is.
Each of the five characters has a ton of weapons to unlock as well, and has a sort of XP bar progression and an overall loot progression shared across all five characters (the more gear you get the higher the score goes until it caps at 300). These varying weapons as well as the 3-4 sub-classes each character has adds a lot of replayability and build variety to things and does a really good job at preventing the experience from growing dull, while also not serving as so much of a grind that it makes things tedious, managing to almost perfectly strike that happy medium of progress without excess grind that few games can strike... and that Fatshark has failed to strike with other ventures of theirs.
I will say this, though, if you are going to get this game, wait for sale as usual (duh!), but also I'd say to get all the gameplay-focused DLC save for character DLCs... and then consider getting the character DLC if you end up liking the character or the game as a whole enough to try such.",1670011004,1670011004,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

While reading this article, keep in mind that the game has been ""in service"" for 7 years.
- Crashes occur due to random error in the game. (Imagine playing the game for 20 minutes and closing just as you were about to finish the level).
- This game has more lag (ping) than other online games.
- The game uses a P2P system and you have no choice but to return to the main screen when the host of the current game quits the game due to an error or gets angry. (There should be a checkpoint system; when the host of the game leaves, one of the existing players should be replaced and he should be able to continue from that checkpoint).
- The game's player base is cancerous. Majority of the players have no respect for other players. For example, I witnessed that a player wanted the buff potion on the other player and that other player didn't want to give it, then killed that player and got the potion.
- Most of the players don't know how to play and are not inclined to learn. (It must be related to what I wrote above).
- Again, according to what I wrote above, there is another common occurrence while playing the game; The person who hosts the game (not directly related to being the host) goes somewhere without telling his teammates where he is going. Usually, this person dies ahead of the team because he is separate from the team and leaves the game. If it is the host who leaves the game, your time is wasted again and imagine that you enter the next game with this psychology.
- Most of the cosmetic upgrades of the game career DLCs do not unlock the skins in the game. It unlocks the challenges required to unlock those skins. And most of them are not challenges that require talent, they are challenges that you can accomplish with random events during the match. Therefore, you have to wait for a random event to get what you pay for. As a result, you have no choice but to watch the skins on the challenge page saying, ""I wonder if I can have this skin one day?""
- The patches brought to the game are very few and progress slowly. (And it often brings other problems with it).
- Many mods were made to the game for the reason I wrote before. As I wrote at the beginning of this article, this game has been operating for 7 years, although the developers of the game have also half-assed some of these modes. So I don't have any hope for improvement anymore.
- There is no balance regarding the characters and weapons in the game. It is possible to see the same character careers and builds in the game.
- Doing the challenges in the game and developing your characters quickly become boring. There is no improvement in these. Therefore, you find yourself entering a random match by ignoring the challenges and simply saying ""meh"".",1669900913,1669900913,False,12,2,0.485878497362136841,0,True,False,False

But while L4D2 had very tight design and perfect gameplay loop, this wants to be soo much bigger that it hurts that gameplay, in my opinion.

Specifically:

- there are different ""classes"" or characters with different special abilities and tons of various bonuses
- weapons you have depend on the class and what you selected before the battle. This alone makes such a huge difference to L4D interesting design where you had to use what you found, and you had to use various weapons in general.
- there is this weird pseudo-RPG level up system, where basically you get to improve the damage you deal.

I'm not saying it's a bad game, but I got fooled thinking I would get some of the L4D2 magic here, and for me it's not there.

Tons of challenges, plenty of unlocks, and the events are nice, too. I finished the Halloween event and got some weapon cosmetics, and a couple cool new frames. Great for some extra challenge, too.

It copies a lot of mechanics of that kind of game - hordes of enemies spawning at intervals to attack you, special enemies that can disable you and that teammates can save you from if you get caught, bosses - plus adds a lot of new stuff on top of having much improved combat.

You go through missions primarily fighting Skaven (rat people), but also fighting human followers of the Chaos Gods. There are five characters you can choose from, each with different weapons, special activated ultimate abilities, and three (four with DLC) variants you can choose from. You can customize your character with gear - new weapons and such - as you play the game and unlock new weapons. You gain talent points every 5 levels up to about level 30 which lets you customize your character somewhat, so you can focus specifically on a build that gains temporary health with multiple enemies hit and wield greatswords that cleave through foes, or focus on weapons with armor-piercing abilities and fast attacks then focus on single target kills. Characters have both ranged and melee weapons, with ranged and melee sub-classes existing. There is a crafting system that lets you customize your weapons and such, such as re-forging their special traits (like 10% bonus vs infantry or extra stamina shields for blocking), or upgrading them to the next rarity tier (which might give them additional bonuses, or something like ""when you use a potion the nearest ally gets its effect as well"").

All in all it's a fun game to go through. It does require four players to get the most out of it, but I do quite well with two-player co-op (bots fill the other two slots, and while they aren't very competent they aren't completely useless most of the time). On sale it 100% is worth it, and I'm probably going to pick up some of the DLC before the current sale ends.

Edit: After playing a couple dozen more hours since this review, I have played through all of the missions except the Return to Ubersreik ones (which I played in Vermintide 1 years ago anyway somewhat), and have gotten through a handful of missions on Legendary difficult with a single friend in co-op. It is definitely worth playing, though I would grab it on sale if you aren't sure or don't have enough friends to play it with (as playing solo or with random players isn't for everyone).",1668410158,1669677621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're a chivalry fan looking for something a bit more PvE, an old L4D Fan, someone who can't stand the melee nerfs in Back4Blood, or just and RPG enthusiast looking for some character customization and looting in a co-op setting; there is plenty of fun to be had. 

Excellent character dialogue and depth through sparse interactions through your long playtime.  Multiple classes to pick from (a bit of character locking for classes but having played Darktide I'm actually viewing that as a plus now if the alternative is boring stagnant create a character stiff board nonsense). 

Engaging story with a few missions from the first game (narrator character won't SHUT UP DURING, which takes the place of the old character dialogue unfortunately). An amazing experience that anyone can enjoy and a class for any type of playstyle. 

This game is STILL BEING UPDATED DESPITE IT LIKELY HAVING SOME OVERLAP IN PLAYERBASE WITH NEWLY RELEASED DARKTIDE. The devs have a vision for updating it and they're not through yet with no signs of slowing down. Unlike Darktide it also features a unique cast of multiple races instead of all samey and equally ugly humans (likely lore accurate for 40k but still painful to the eyes).  

Can't wait to see the as of yet unreleased fourth class for Sienna (she's effectively a pyromancer for those uninitiated in Warhammer lore), and the direction this newest set of unreleased stages are going to go.

If you're still reading up to this point than quit wasting time and GET THIS GEM NOW you will not regret it.

Enemy damage directly relates to where your weapon impacts, and those hits matter.  Cracking someone in the side of the knee will knock them to the ground.  The shields actually protect only the shielded area, and don't give the enemies a magical barrier that protects against damage.  If you aim carefully, you can bypass the shields with skill.  It's very satisfying. 

Also, the weapon actually all play differently.  Each weapon type has its own style of gameplay, and not just the same weapon animations with slightly different stats.

It has great mechanics and depth, while still being fun and easily accessible. It's basically a Left 4 Dead-like game, with a focus on melee, magic and fantasy style combat, with added RPG elements such as levelling, talents, abilities, and a variety of gear rarities, stats and traits that you can create and modify yourself using a basic crafting system. It's not super in-depth compared to most RPG games, but it's enough and It works tremendously well with this style of gameplay, in my opinion it's taken the basic essence of Left4Dead and expanded on it for a much more comprehensive experience.

Like L4D it is a co-op game, so the experience is definitely better with friends, but it's a really fun game to play and to waste a few hours. The only thing it's really lacking gameplay-wise is more variety in the levels, enemies and bosses, and sadly it has no versus mode, despite this being promised by the developers for years. 

Another positive thing to note is that It also has great characters, with brilliant voice acting, some of the best I've probably heard in a video game, and even though i'm not particularly knowledgeable on Warhammer lore, I find it fun and engaging.

Very few FPS games can pull off melee as well as VT2 does. You got a bladed weapon? Alright, have fun mowing through hordes of ratmen and rotbloods, but watch your ass the moment anything with a bit of armor comes around. You got a hammer? Deal with the armored guys for your sharper buddies while they cover your ass against a wave of lighter, less metallic enemies. Simple as.

Gunplay's relatively consistent despite the limits of the time period in WH lore. Anything single-shot feels really satisfying to land a OHK with, and anything with more than one shot before reloading is fun to spam despite the smaller ammunition pool that all ranged weapons have. 

Very few games with build systems or skill trees have matched heads with something like Borderlands 2 for me, but VT2 gets pretty damn close. I was a little angry at first due to all heroes having one to two identical aspects in their skill-tree, but the temporary health on melee damage/kill/stagger abilities will literally carry the hell out of you. Other than that, very little in the heroes' respective skill-trees seems to make them too overpowered or too underwhelming. 

Moral of the story is, for a horde shooter, this game has a surprisingly high skill ceiling, and is 100% worth grabbing anytime a discount rolls around.

Each of the 5 characters has 3 different careers (most have a 4th career as dlc) which suit different play styles, and have distinct personalities. Missions have decent repeatability, with random special enemies, hordes and bosses from start to finish, as well as tomes and grimoires to collect. One issue with Vermintide 2 is that it forces you to play the lowest difficulty to begin with, which can be quite easy, but later difficulties can give a decent challenge once you unlock them. I'd say give it a shot, especially if you can grab the game on sale or get a group of friends to play it with you. Also the voice acting is brilliant, listening to Saltzpyre shouting about heresy or Sienna being a crazy pyromaniac is great fun, and depending on which characters there are in your team, you get to hear some amusing conversations.",1669418418,1669418418,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you prefer dull and repetitive game play where you can literally just button mash one button and win, then this game may be for you. The upgrades are so useless, that you don't even need them and can skip them and still do just fine.
The only difficult part of this game is that certain enemies can stop you from doing anything and slowly kill you if your team mates do do anything about it when this happens. You can't fight them off or anything if you are the one attacked.
So it's incredibly easy or completely hopeless in the perfect circumstances, but to be honest, it's not that hard to not get attacked by these specific enemies.
