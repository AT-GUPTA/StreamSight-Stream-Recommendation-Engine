As Rico Rodriguez, players embark on a whirlwind adventure filled with explosive action, breathtaking stunts, and liberating an entire fictional Mediterranean island from a ruthless dictator. It's definitely a game worth every dollar in my opinion.

Pros:

Expansive Open World: The island of Medici is a sprawling playground, teeming with diverse landscapes, from sun-drenched beaches to snow-capped mountains and bustling cities. The sheer scale of the world encourages exploration and discovery, with hidden secrets and challenges waiting around every corner.

Unbridled Freedom: ""Just Cause 3"" embraces the ethos of freedom with open arms, allowing players to tackle missions and objectives however they see fit. Whether you prefer to traverse the landscape by land, sea, or air, the game offers a vast array of vehicles and traversal options, from sports cars and fighter jets to wingsuits and grappling hooks.

Spectacular Action and Destruction: The game's signature feature is its over-the-top action and destruction, with players able to wreak havoc on the environment using a variety of weapons, explosives, and vehicles. From toppling statues and blowing up bridges to engaging in epic aerial dogfights, the chaos knows no bounds.

Fluid Movement and Combat: Rico's traversal abilities, including the iconic grappling hook and parachute combination, provide fluid and exhilarating movement options both in and out of combat. The controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for seamless transitions between traversal and combat encounters.

Stunning Visuals and Audio: ""Just Cause 3"" impresses with its stunning visuals and immersive audio design. The vibrant colors, detailed environments, and breathtaking vistas make for a visually striking experience, while the dynamic soundtrack and sound effects enhance the adrenaline-fueled action and intensity.

Cons:

Repetitive Mission Structure: Despite its expansive open world, the mission structure in ""Just Cause 3"" can feel repetitive and formulaic. Many missions boil down to a familiar pattern of liberating settlements, destroying enemy infrastructure, and engaging in repetitive objectives, leading to a sense of monotony over time.

Technical Issues: The game's launch was marred by technical issues, including performance optimization problems, bugs, and glitches. While many of these issues have been addressed through patches and updates, some players may still encounter occasional frame rate drops, texture pop-ins, or other technical hiccups.

Thin Story and Characters: While ""Just Cause 3"" excels in its action and gameplay, the story and characters are relatively thin and forgettable. The narrative takes a backseat to the chaotic gameplay, with shallow character motivations and minimal development hindering emotional investment in the overarching plot.

Limited Enemy Variety: The game suffers from a lack of enemy variety, with players facing off against the same generic soldiers and vehicles throughout the majority of the game. A greater variety of enemy types and encounters could add depth and challenge to the combat experience.

Lack of Meaningful Progression: Despite its emphasis on chaos and destruction, ""Just Cause 3"" lacks meaningful progression systems to incentivize players to continue playing beyond the initial thrill of causing mayhem. The absence of character progression or meaningful rewards for completing objectives may lead to a lack of long-term engagement for some players.

Conclusion:

""Just Cause 3"" delivers an adrenaline-fueled thrill ride through its expansive open world, offering players the freedom to unleash chaos and destruction on an epic scale. While it has its flaws, including repetitive missions and technical issues, its strengths in action-packed gameplay, fluid traversal mechanics, and stunning visuals make it a standout title in the open-world action genre. Whether you're soaring through the skies in a wingsuit, liberating settlements from oppression, or causing massive explosions, ""Just Cause 3"" delivers an exhilarating and unforgettable experience that is sure to leave players craving more chaos.",1555950881,1708900415,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Rating: ★★★★☆

Just Cause 3, developed by Avalanche Studios, catapults players into a Mediterranean playground of chaos and destruction, offering a whirlwind experience of action-packed stunts, massive explosions, and liberating an entire island nation. While the narrative may falter, the game's emphasis on unrestrained fun and an expansive open world makes it a thrilling adventure for fans of explosive action.

The standout feature of Just Cause 3 is its vast and visually stunning open world of Medici. The sheer scale of the environment, from picturesque coastal towns to towering mountains, provides players with a playground for adrenaline-fueled antics. The inclusion of a wingsuit and a grappling hook, both seamlessly integrated into the protagonist's arsenal, amplifies the sense of freedom and verticality in exploration.

The grappling hook, in particular, becomes a versatile tool for creative mayhem. From tethering enemies to explosive barrels, creating makeshift slingshots, or enabling daring mid-air stunts, the grappling hook adds an extra layer of creativity to the chaos. The destructible environments further enhance the joy of wreaking havoc on an epic scale.

The game's emphasis on vehicular mayhem, including a diverse array of cars, motorcycles, helicopters, and fighter jets, adds variety to the gameplay. The ability to hijack any vehicle on the fly and seamlessly transition between land, sea, and air contributes to the game's sense of fluidity.

Just Cause 3 boasts a visually appealing and vibrant aesthetic. The sun-soaked landscapes, detailed environments, and explosive pyrotechnics create a visually stunning backdrop for the game's action. The occasional technical hiccups and frame rate drops, while present, do little to dampen the overall spectacle.

However, Just Cause 3 falls short in terms of its narrative depth. The story, revolving around protagonist Rico Rodriguez's quest to liberate Medici from a tyrannical dictator, is predictable and serves as a backdrop rather than a driving force. The characters lack significant development, and the overall plot feels like a mere justification for the game's chaotic gameplay.

The game's progression system, based on liberating territories and completing challenges, may become repetitive for some players. While the explosive action remains entertaining, the lack of meaningful character progression or narrative rewards may leave some longing for more depth in their experience.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 delivers an explosive and entertaining sandbox experience that revels in chaotic creativity. The game's open-world freedom, stunning visuals, and adrenaline-pumping stunts make it a must-play for fans of over-the-top action. While the narrative may be forgettable, the sheer joy of causing havoc in the beautifully crafted Mediterranean playground more than makes up for any shortcomings.",1708474638,1708474638,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only negative is the lack of diversity in weapon, many weapons feel like they repeat and are useless like the mag grenade launcher, outperformed by the grenade shotgun. It is the same for rockets and snipers. There is no reason to switch explosives assault rifles and sidearms from revolver, tactical assault rifle and the 5 burst rocket launcher. The DLCs do not fix the problem. Gunplay is good until the drones and juggernauts appear, the juggernauts are just uninteresting and slow bullet sponges, drones cannot be harmed unless from a explosive or tether to the ground. Another problem would be the sky fortress dlc which gives you a permanent upgrade to the wingsuit that also only creates probles, dodging missles from drones or stationary turrets is impossible, get stun locked and repeatedly locked on unless getting out of the wingsuit which negates all the wepons that it comes with.

Set six years after its predecessor, Just Cause 3 follows series protagonist, Rico Rodriguez as he returns to his homeland of Medici, a fictional Mediterranean island country under the control of dictator General Sebastiano Di Ravello. The game is played from a third-person perspective and allows players to explore the tropical island of Medici in an open world environment.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]Graphics are really gorgeous. The tropical environment is really well done here. The cities are well designed, the water is beautiful, and the attention to detail is pretty good for the time this game was made. The car and character models look pretty decent as well. Now the destruction effects are impressive, even by today's standards. One tip I recommend is to make sure you don’t use SMAA 2x, just use SMAA since that looks much sharper (for some reason). Overall the graphics are really good, and have had zero issues with them. A truly stunning game, and world.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]The gameplay is the main course here. Being able to wingsuit around the map is such a unique method to travel around. You also get a grapple tool as well, making interactions with the enemy and environments much more engaging. You can also be really creative on how to deal with targets with the grapple tool. The destruction is some of the best destruction in an open world game, Being able to destroy bridges, towers, walls, etc. It’s so fun just to cause havoc. Now the destruction isn't 100% perfect since you can’t destroy most buildings, but overall it’s really well done. You have tons of cool vehicles and weapons in this game. The better thing is that you have a tool called the “Rebel Drop”. These rebel drops allow you to create your own care package of 1 vehicle and some weapons of your choosing. The more vehicles you store in your garage, the more vehicles you can choose from in your Rebel Drop. There are TONS of vehicles in this game. This includes cars, bikes, boats, planes, helicopters, and military vehicles. Gear mods are also a cool feature. These are basically like perks for your character, vehicles, wingsuit, etc. The stupid thing about these gear mods, is that you can only get them from challenge missions. And I have to say that these challenge missions get old really fast, and are so frustrating at times. Why not just give me gear mods from natural progression? That would have been a better option. I do have gripes with this game. The gunplay feels stale and so boring. Gunfights are just a snoozefest here. The driving is stiff and not fun at all. The AI are brain dead at best. Also the controls are annoying at times. Keyboard controls feel like an afterthought, because some keybinds are just horrible. So I recommend a controller if you want a good time here.[/td]

        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]The story is pretty lame in my opinion. It’s uninteresting, boring, and just cliche. Basically take control of the island and kill the bad dictator. It was so stale and lame. I was basically just dragging my feet to beat the story. Now the island control (taking territories) felt pretty cool and gave me a sense of progression. Taking outposts can be fun since you have so much freedom on how to take them. Wanna grab a tank and destroy everything you can, Wanna crash a plane into the outpost, you can as well. You don’t have many restrictions here. I mean the gameplay and taking outposts just overshadows the story in every way! Now I’m sure Just Cause was never really known for its good story, but it doesn’t mean they can get away with a generic lame story. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]Playtime is around 50+ hours if you plan on getting everything done. You do have good replayability since you have many collectables, challenges, and good overall progression. Also the overall gameplay is really fun here.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]I love the sound design. The explosions sound really incredible. Also the weapons sound really good. They are punchy and have an echo/reverb effect since you are around many mountains. The voice acting is okay. Some cringy and annoying lines, but overall pretty good.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]AI pathing is pretty bad at times. I saw them get stuck on rocks, houses, etc. Physics can be a little odd. A little jump can make you go flying after landing. Also the timer will skip seconds. This is frustrating when you do challenge missions.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]Performance is pretty inconsistent. Now my PC specs are way above the recommended specs and I still got a lot of stutters and lag at times. I even got a low memory warning with 16GB ram (I never had this issue with any other game). I had many odd framedrops (would go back to 60 after a few seconds), stutters when using wingsuit, and some other minor hiccups. [/td]

        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]Just Cause 3 has a pretty fun gameplay loop. With tons of destruction and a huge map to explore, you can get lost in the island of Medici. Now it may not be indepth, and can have some annoying problems like performance and some odd design choices, but overall it can be a fun game. I don’t like how some things are done here, but I’m sure others prefer how it was designed. I just wish they change how you can achieve gear mods, and made the story at least somewhat interesting. The game is okay, not amazing or bad, but a joy to mess around in. Don’t come in here expecting something incredible. You will have stale driving, gunplay, and a story. In trade off, you will have a huge map with tons of vehicles and great destruction, and some cool gameplay mechanics. I’d say give this game a try. It may or may not be for you. If you are conflicted on this, than wait for a sale.[/td]

This is one of my favorite games of all time. If you are looking for GTA with more explosions and none of the ""realistic"" crap (trading stocks, playing sports, having to buy ammo and parachutes and etc.) then this this is the game for you. While it does get a little repetitive with the town liberation after a while, the explosions truly never get old (especially the spherical gas tanks or the mining machines). 

Nothing compares to busting into an enemy base with a tank and leveling the entire place, or taking out an ENTIRE outpost with a SINGLE shot from the nuclear rocket launcher.

The DLC's are all totally worth it to. They add some story missions but also add some really nice gear including a jetpack to attach to the wing-suite (you'll never need a helicopter again), a ""lightening gun"", and the fastest boat you will ever drive!

Not because of your storyline or your combat system, but because of your absolutely gorgeous visual design.
I can't say how many times I've been running, driving and gliding across the islands and wishing that it was a real place I could visit. The bright colour scheme used in towns, nature and different weathers is marvelous.

This totally makes up for the terrible writing. Seriously, it's worse than the Fast & Furious movies. Plot armour there, plot armour here, unnatural conversations and some very predictable plot points.
It's... really bad.

The combat system on keyboard is doable and with all the gadgets Rico has you can still try new things 20 hours in. On controller it's an absolute nightmare (at least for me) and I only use the controller for driving or flying. Yes, you can switch back an forth like that.

Other mechanics in the game are all quite easy to get used to and the challenges spread across the islands will keep you busy for a while.

The DLCs are nice additions, mainly because of the new vehicles, gadgets and challenges. The storyline is... just as bad.

You’ve all already heard about this game (you won’t be reading that if not) and honestly, it’s worth it. First of all, you must understand that to really enjoy the game, you will have to master 3 things: grapping, the wingsuit and your weapons.

The main story is cool, just follow it but what we can call side-quest here are also important as they’ll let you be stronger with better modifications.
The game is fun while you follow the storyline, but as soon as you achieve it totally, it’s starting to be a bit boring doing those side-quest which are all the same in a way.

That’s why, you’ll probably do some break, that could be days, or months, but I can assure you that you will come back, whether it is to aim for 100% of the game or simply to blow up everything that moves or doesn’t and kill some poor civilians :)",1706564107,1706564107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the past two games presented a great dark humor about the CIA interventions and double crossings in any given banana republic, where there are truly no good guys and rooting for anyone is a grave mistake, this game throws all that away and paints a poetic picture of revolution and liberation where there is a clear side to be taken. Worse yet, our beloved Rico Rodriguez who used to be a MexAmerican covert operative is now fighting for his home nation of Medici (I guess Italy?) further forging a bond between one side of the equation and the player. Added to this are the unbearable quips and clown-like comedic characters and dialogues that throw the whole dark humor aspect of the franchise into garbage for the benefit of a lazily written story that lacks any depth, creativity, or brilliance. Furthermore, the story is downright preposterous. While the old games followed a sensible story such as narcoterrorism and oil dictatorship, this game for some reason is written with the intention of chasing an imaginary substance called Bavarium in the hands of a dictator whose arsenal of helicopters and troops is greater than the US and who probably wouldn't need the substance in the first place. To add insult to injury we can collect diary tapes of this dictator where he narrates a story of his rise to power in the most black-n-white way possible, justifying why the bad guy is bad to the player. Instead of all these the game could easily create a cynical dictator who has nuclear weapons or biological ones or heck even one who does human testing or something tangible. But alas the writers seem to have conceptualized the story while still in middle school, where gray areas of life are still unknown and subtlety is nonexistent.
Add to all these the horrific ludonarrative dissonance this game suffers from, where Rico (our Mexican native of Italy) is called a savior by the NPCs at the same time that he steals their cars to add to his collection, murders them without consequence, and bombards their homes in fits of unpunished war crimes. If anything, here we should assume that the supposed bad guys are the true heroes for going after Rico as soon as he hurts civilians all the while our revered rebels stand to the side and talk about how they worship him.
But the crown jewel of annoyances in this game is the constant online login messages you get in the middle of play. Started a mission but your internet was unstable? Forced pause to ask if you want to keep playing offline. Quickly trying to check the map? Forced pause telling you the game is logging you in online. Opening the main menu for whatever reason? Logging in again. This will happen way more often than you'd think and despite having a stable connection for some reason it keeps happening to me and many others on the internet. I guess you can't play a terribly composed game without added annoyance these days.
Finally, the liberation activities of the game do not match with the questline. You may liberate a whole island and have no enemy presence in there but the story would still be behind you and its missions would still show opposition control of the areas you have already taken. This could have been easily fixed by gating the areas behind story missions as do many other open world games. But I guess the makers were just too careless to do that.
All in all this is a missed opportunity and wasted mechanical perfection.",1706392541,1706392541,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Firstly, I am a huge fan of the second game, which has a spectacular map, a fun B-movie like story and a cast of quirky characters like dear old Bolo Santosi.

Compared to it, the third game is a lot less about fun and more about repetition, and not in a nice way.

But there is still something under that shiny surface which saves the game from being bad to me, which is the gameplay (much improved grappling hook) and the gliding suit (especially with the DLC upgrade). Together with that the island of Medici is simply staggering, and those who have been to a Mediterranean location could attest to how true to life the map can be.

I also appreciate the amount of hidden details in this game, seems like the devs have poured a lot of love into the world.

Now with the positives out of the way, what is so bad about the game?

From the gameplay perspective, the challenges are horrible. Why are game altering mechanics such as car nitros, glide-to-ground, and hook-to-kick stuck behind repetitive missions that have to be done in a specific way in order to receive the highest amount of gears just to unlock one ability? Furthermore, who designed some of these? I swear, it's like most of the challenges have not been properly tested since you can fail them just because the game glitches out or you unintentionally strain the physics some way. 

Furthermore, the car and especially the bike physics are just asinine, the worst. No car in the real world behaves like those at all and this would not be such a problem had the cars not been the focus of several missions including escort ones. Likewise, helicopter/plane/boat nitros? Really?

Some challenges like the gliding ones can be cool, or maybe the shooting galleries, while simple, can be nice as well. But the rest, like the destruction challenges are just horrible to do.

And is it just me or does Rico die too easily while the NPCs are bullet sponges? Sure, you get a respawn next to the location where you died, but it is still annoying since the enemies have laser-like sight and a tendency to spawn right when you are hacking a SAM unit. Quite annoying. Likewise, why are the sprint and the evasion buttons gone? They were great in JC2, without them, Rico is just harder to control and play with.

And while the world is awesome, half of it is empty. Sure, there is a reason for it lore-wise but it makes the last third of territory liberation borderline tedious since there is not a lot of variety in those later locations, compared to the first or the second island.

And while we're on the topic of liberation, the liberation/mission structure makes no sense, like why would Rico liberate a central military outpost when the next mission destroys it anyway, making its liberation worthless in turn?

The storyline as well is just weak, with one particular moment near the end also making absolutely no sense the way it was set up and shown. You'll know it when you play it.

Also, please, let me go into permanent offline mode. The worst thing is how much loading there is with the online service, which I did not even want to use!

So then why am I still recommending this game with such a large amount of negatives?

It's not bad.

I grew to not expect much from the JC series, but what it lacks in depth it makes up for in sheer fun. Liberation and blowing stuff up is still cool, and some of the vehicles you can use to do that make the game have some impressive legs. The Sky Expansion especially was a godsend here since it made the gameplay much better.

It's a 7.5-8 out of 10 for me, but for anyone who just wants to turn off their brain after a terrible day at school/work this might well as be a 10/10.",1706131524,1706132364,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now that I have finished the story, all the DLCs, and of course liberated everything, I can say this is an absolutely amazing game.

Here the full list of issues in the first hour of gameplay.
* AI has different rules applied.
* AI Rebels attack small guard tower. I help and then get treated worse than the AI would have.
* Control scheme is a s bloated as a 2010 game with a lot of overlapping rules for gliding, parachuting and more.
* Control scheme seems hella limited due to dead zone. I did not care to look into the settings past the graphics.
* examples for overlapping: landing with tether grapple only works with some angles. tether does not speed you up unless you somehow learn the bad but skillful system. Collision with gliding is awkward.
* one of the slowest controller control schemes ever.
* game tells you at least 3 times to open up the map and follow instructions which do not even work unless it is pixel perfectly executed.

I would recommend this game if you were just leisurely playing. I’ve found this game very relaxing after coming home from work. I enjoy gliding over the plains and mountains. 
However, a few weeks ago I decided to complete everything in the game. I discovered the hard way that there is a save file issue and no steam cloud backup. I had gotten to 79% completion when I accidentally dropped my controller on the start screen clicking start new game. The new game deletes your save file. So, I had to start over. That’s when I learned to back up my save files manually. I would go on to discover that if the Square Enix servers fail to login when the game starts can also delete your save file. But luckily I had backups.

Just Cause 3 brings you the experience of many other traditional open-world games. Outside of missions, you are free to roam and explore the vast world of Medici (where the game takes place). And the map of Medici, is large. By large, I mean very, very large. The environment and map design helps re-imagine a place that reassembles around the Mediterranean sea; forests, mountains, hillsides, countrysides and a large portion of water (lakes and rivers included!) With the tools of a parachute, grapple and wingsuit combined, you will find yourself soaring over the skies and cities often, to get around. While of course, travel by car is also possible.

The main activity you would be doing outside of missions is taking over bases and outposts - mainly by destroying the so called ""chaos objects"". And of course, with destruction comes explosion, and the game has many, many explosive objects. Alongside this, you have your tether tool to tether multiple objects together, bring them together, or tearing them apart to witness more explosions. This is, what I believe, makes the sandbox experience more immersive. 

There are also many challenges in forms of mini games which you can do to unlock ""Gear Mods"" - unlocking a more, fun play style to your arsenal of weapons. One thing I do feel inclined to mention about challenges though, is that some of them may seem quite challenging, and by challenging, I mean extremely difficult to the point where you are required to follow exact procedures to unlock all possible gear mods for the challenge (five maximum).

[h2]Lack of ""features""[/h2]
[list]
[*]No minimap. Uhm.. just, why? You will find yourself repeatedly having to open the map amidst of all chaos in order to find where the last missing chaos objects are to completely liberate a base, which is very, very annoying.
[*]No sprinting. Apparently the developers believed that it is unnecessary to add a sprint button, since you already have your grapple and parachute to move around easily.
[*]Weapon ADS is an upgrade. I honestly cannot comprehend why something as simple as aiming down sight was locked behind a gear mod upgrade.
[/list]

Overall though, really good game. All the variety of vehicles you have, ranging from cars to boats, to planes, to helicopters, to jets, to military assets, and an arsenal of explosive weapons, this is a truly a sandbox experience, where your creativity also plays a role (making use of your tools to cause different kinds of destruction).",1705181272,1705181272,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Estimated 100% Completion time: 40-60 hours.

To put it in one sentence, Just Cause 3 is a Michael Bay simulator in a sandbox environment. Yes, the story isn't particularly compelling, nor are the characters anything complex, but the gameplay is just fantastic. From the flow of the movement mid-air to the incredible levels of demolition that the series is known for, Just Cause 3 somehow made a fairly repetitive gameplay style become ever more entertaining the further into the game I got.

My only complaints are that the vehicle controls aren't particularly great. The driving feels very heavy compared to other titles, and this made using certain vehicles near impossible. This is alongside the fact that this game doesn't run particularly well on occasion, crashing every now and then. However, this only happened to me a few times in my nearly 50 hour playthrough of the main game + all DLC.",1656805729,1705025748,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

     Simplified game play: Just use your ropes to kill enemies for 1 million time. Story was too week even tho I got this game nearly 8 years ago, finally I did finish up 2024. What a wasteful finale. I am desperately sorry for playing this game for 40 hours. You do not need to get all the enemy bases for finishing the game too. Some part of the map there was no story line. I just enjoyed the big city part which I did come across luckily. There is just one story line passes through the city and make you kill 4 snipers, that's all......
     I am a rider and I can't use the motorcycles no matter what, when you driving fast it does not turn.
     And who the **** gave you the idea that TRYING TO FIND NEARLY 200 ITEMS IN A HUGE *** MAP AND CAN NOT USE IT BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT GAME WILL ASK YOU TO GET MORE ENEMY BASES AND CITY BEFORE YOU ENTER THE NEXT STORY LINE, AND SUDDENLY YOU FINISHED AND YOU CAN NOT EVEN PRESS ESC OR ANYTHING TO GO TO THE GAME AND FINISH IT.

Challenge Missions and Collectibles: Embark on dozens of challenge missions and hunt for collectibles, adding an adventurous layer to the quest for chaos.

Online Community Features: Engage with online community features, fostering connectivity and interaction within the chaotic world of Medici.

BUT the game physics for a game based on destruction is absolutely terrible. It is all jumpy in wrong places. The progression system is based on challenges which are mostly fun except for some. A couple of challenges are impossible to do the intended way. Yet they were shipped and the required scores were not lowered to make the game completion more enjoyable.
 A lot of them require you to already have upgraded gear or have unlocked faster vehicles. Boat races are dog shit. The boats jump around and decide to turn whenever they please. The waves that play the part of rnd can really mess you up. Getting 5 gears on those is quite impossible. Part of it may be a skill issue, but seeing as other people have complained, perhaps not.",1704050907,1704050907,False,6,1,0.498364388942718506,0,True,False,False

Both games are huge sandboxes that you will only play if you like destroying things. Both stories can be summarised on a stamp: there is a dictator on an island and you have to help the rebellion to knock him down.
I liked both games but of course since it is quite old, everything seems heavier in JC2 and at the end I had more fun in JC3. Maybe it's also because JC3's DLCs provide big guns and if you unlock them early you can play like in a god mode! Is it a problem? Actually no! I love feeling indestructible and feeling that no enemy has a chance against me. It’s just what theses game should be! JC2 is more old-school with the management of the health and ammos and for this kind of game, it's just not so fun.
From a graphics point of view, JC2 looks definitely old but the environments (tropical, mountains, jungle and dessert) still look pretty. In comparison, JC3 offers a bit less diversity (mountains, countryside, Mediterranean cost) but it looks gorgeous with textures from another dimension compared to JC2.
In the end, if you have not played any JC, just skip JC2 and take JC3 with the DLCs. Also I did not play JC4 so maybe just go for this one since it's apparently a JC3 + tornadoes ;)",1624401345,1703893354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

the story in the just cause series has never been any good, but 3 made steps towards its improvement. it doesn't waste time when moving the plot forward. the acting is believable. the characters actually have an arc ill be it minimal, and there is a consistent theme of cause and effect *comedy drum roll*

[b] Pros [/b]
- Great visuals, environments, explosions. 
- Great accompanying main menu OST
- Health system has been improved compared to JC2
- Fast travel option available, albeit not at the start
- There's fun to be had, especially for the first few hours
- Cutscenes can be skipped from the main menu. This is vital, considering the crashes and inadequate autosave feature which force you to re-do missions. 

[b] Cons [/b] 
- Main menu loading time is too long! Took 1 min and 13 seconds at one point. This adds insult to injury when desktop/system crashes occur out of the blue. 
- Story is subpar even compared to previous games. Dialogue is atrocious, with above average voice acting. 
- Rico is now upbeat and lighthearted. Far less serious than before. Quite the change in personality from JC2.
- Fatal crash during a sprint challenge. Another right before finishing a mission. Yet another while close to establishing record time while on a rampage. Plenty of others thoughout my time playing. In all instances the game wasn't saved properly! 
- Vehicle controls are as horrific and janky as ever, especially while driving backwards. Moreover, if the camera controls don't give you a headache, it's hard to say what will.
- Such atrocious vehicle controls make challenges a pain to complete.
- Far too much busy work for barely any gain. Liberating cities becomes repetitive. Traveling between places is also an issue that exacerbates this.
- After completing the sniper challenge, the precision aim toggle stays on, requiring a full restart of the game.
- Dialogue lines can overlap, regardless of person. They can even bleed into other, unrelated missions/challenges. 
- Mario's dancing belongs in this section. Ya, really!
- Some cutscenes show game debris flying across the screen at supersonic speeds. Temporarily amusing.

Conclusion: Honestly, due to all the cons and crashes, I initially wanted to give this game a thumbs down. However, for what it's worth I did have fun at the end of the day and I suppose that's what ultimately matters. If you intend to get this, doing so on a sale/in a bundle would be best. 

PS: Tested on PC. Intel 12th gen CPU, Nvidia 30 series GPU, Windows 10. [b] If you've tested this on Linux, leave a comment as I'd like to know how it performs. [/b]",1703717583,1703717625,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Yes, the gameplay was a bit too fast to offer proper tactical gameplay, but you could still have fun AND play tactically with your team (if they actually bothered to cooperate in any way, but that´s the curse of online gaming and the braindead masses). And then the overhaul came. And, i liked the idea. Everything i read about it sounded great. PIP scopes, more tactical cooperation and everything else the game needed to be closer to PR than battlefield. And then the update dropped. And it´s utter ♥♥♥♥. Just.... bad. Terrible performance. PIP scopes are a disgrace to video gaming. (ever heard of SCP secret lab? Free to play game. Got pip scopes too AND THEY WORK. IN A FREE GAME) Adsing causes constant stutters, frame drops and worst off all? Black frames. You try to ads while allready seeing an enemy in front of you? Enjoy a second of blackscreen and gunhandling as if you were in the middle of a 9 on the richter scala earthquake. Scopes literally cut out while you try to ads. They just turn black for a moment. And i haven´t even gotten to the part where your guy takes three days and a vacation to aim in the first place, shakes like he withdrawing from seven different substances at once and suffers from recoil as if he was using a shoulder fired 30 mm anti-air battery. One way to lessen all of these problems, would´ve been something the playerbase has been demanding long before the infantry overhaul. REDUCE MOVEMENT SPEED. Now we have people sprinting by the doorway you´re covering, circling you two times and then just spray you without ads while you TRY to get your gun into their aproximate direction. Instead of fixing the game by actually fixing the damn game, the devs rather waste hundreds if not thousands of hours of development work on things the playerbase has not asked for.
Oh and now to why this game will be dead soon anyway. Tencent. Now owi is trying to push skins, in an effort to ""finance further development"". Funny. Right after being bought by a mega corp, microtransactions appear. Hm, where did i see that allready. Oh yeah, all of those dead studios and games. One example, Insurgency Sandstorm! First they added micro-crap with the reasoning of financing development. Then all the devs magically were fired and their positions outsourced for cheap. And then ALL OF A SUDDEN there wasn´t enough money to pay for development, while the investors were marking record profits, and THE WHOLE STUDIO WAS LAID OFF. But nah, couldn´t be EXACTLY WHAT´S HAPPENING HERE

Just Cause 3, available on Steam, is a whirlwind of explosive action and unbridled mayhem that solidifies its place as an adrenaline-pumping open-world experience. Developed by Avalanche Studios, this third installment in the series takes the concept of sandbox chaos to new heights.

Visually, the game is a feast for the eyes. The Mediterranean archipelago of Medici is a stunning and diverse backdrop, featuring lush landscapes, picturesque coastlines, and towering mountains. The attention to detail, combined with vibrant graphics, creates a visually captivating playground for the chaos that ensues.

At the core of Just Cause 3's appeal is the freedom it offers. The protagonist, Rico Rodriguez, equipped with his iconic grappling hook, parachute, and wingsuit, becomes a one-man wrecking crew. The seamless transitions between these tools empower players to traverse the expansive world with unparalleled freedom, turning every mission into a canvas for creative destruction.

The game's arsenal of weapons and vehicles amplifies the chaos. From high-speed chases to explosive shootouts, the action is relentless and over-the-top. The destructive capabilities, coupled with the expansive map, provide players with countless opportunities to engineer chaos in their unique style.

While the story takes a backseat to the gameplay, offering a somewhat predictable narrative, the focus on fun and spectacle compensates for any storytelling shortcomings. Some players might encounter occasional performance issues, with frame rate drops during intense moments, but these drawbacks don't significantly hinder the overall experience.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 on Steam is a must-play for fans of open-world mayhem. Its breathtaking visuals, seamless traversal mechanics, and explosive gameplay make it a standout title in the genre. If you're ready to unleash chaos on a grand scale, Just Cause 3 invites you to tether, glide, and explode your way through the vibrant chaos of Medici.",1703617613,1703617613,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I almost got JC4 Reloaded, but reviews really favored 3 as best in the series and so far I've not been disappointed. I bought the game and all the DLCs for under $10 USD and its definitely been worth it. 

I'm still going through the campaign, but I'll say this, I really enjoy being able to just play the game without feeling stuck to the storyline and or having to complete missions/objectives in any specific order. The DLC really makes the game even more fun with the jet suit and mech. I've yet to even do the Sea Heist DLC yet. The controls feel a little janky at first such as using the grappling hook and wing suit, but with a little practice its a lot of fun getting around the map. Most of the time you won't even be using vehicles (helis, planes, ships, cars etc). 

There is a ton of stuff to blow up and quite a bit of weapons at your disposal. Completing challenges as side objectives opens up gear mods which provide extra abilities based on what the challenge is so that opens up even more of what you can do in the game. 

I put this game on my wishlist and the next day it went on sale, so I got lucky! Definitely worth playing and it'll eat up quite a few hours liberating towns within its huge map!",1703233367,1703233440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Blowing up enemy bases is fun but does get a bit repetitive especially if you go for 100% completion (which I did and fully recommend doing so that you can get the most out of your experience)

Sound - 10/10
No sound compression as far as I could tell and the explosion sound effects are great.

Story - 3/10
Don't play this game for the story as it is pretty 'meh' but still better than Just Cause 4's and I only played the story missions to get 100% completion.

DLC - 8/10
Again, Don't play the DLCs for their stories, but the weapons you get from them however, are great. The wing suit that you get from the Sky Fortress DLC is really fun and can rinse a small base in a few well placed rockets. The ship from Bavariam Sea Heist DLC can beat all the sea races with almost no difficulty. The Eden Spark that you also get from the Bavarium Sea Heist is so fun as you literally summon lightning down on your enemies. The mech that you get from the Mechland Assault DLC can one shot the final boss (Just use the rebel drops to drop it in and chuck Di Ravello into the lava) and is also pretty much needed to get a boat that is stuck in a lake that you need to transport to a garage to chop (You can do it with a helicopter but it is like 10x easier with the mech.

Price
The XXL edition, which includes the base game and all of its DLC, is the one I recommend and is I think £55 but usually goes on sale for about £3 (that's how much i bought the XXL edition for)",1649882630,1702682511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics: ★★★★☆
Just Cause 3 delivers a visually stunning open-world environment filled with lush landscapes, vibrant colors, and expansive vistas. The Mediterranean-inspired setting provides a diverse backdrop for chaos, and the level of detail in explosions and environmental destruction is impressive. However, occasional frame rate drops on some platforms can be a minor drawback.

Gameplay: ★★★★★
Just Cause 3 excels in providing a sandbox of destruction and creativity. The grappling hook and parachute mechanics, combined with an expansive arsenal of weapons and vehicles, empower players to create chaos in countless ways. The freedom to approach missions and challenges creatively adds a layer of replayability that few open-world games can match.

Story: ★★★☆☆
While the narrative is serviceable, Just Cause 3 places a stronger emphasis on over-the-top action and mayhem rather than a deep, engaging story. The characters and plot are somewhat forgettable, serving as a backdrop for the game's true focus – providing a playground for chaotic and explosive gameplay.

Soundtrack: ★★★☆☆
The soundtrack complements the game's high-octane action with energetic and fitting tunes. The use of licensed music during intense moments enhances the overall experience. However, the soundtrack may not be particularly memorable outside of the game's context.

Level Design: ★★★☆☆
The world of Medici is vast and filled with diverse regions, each offering a unique backdrop for destruction. The level design accommodates the game's chaotic nature, with numerous settlements, military bases, and challenges to conquer. However, some areas may feel repetitive, and the lack of truly distinct landmarks can make navigation challenging.

Replayability: ★★★★☆
Just Cause 3's replay value is substantial, thanks to the sheer variety of ways players can approach challenges and wreak havoc. The liberation of settlements, completion of challenges, and experimentation with different weapons and vehicles provide ample reasons to return to the chaos of Medici.

Overall: ★★★★☆
Just Cause 3 is a playground of destruction and mayhem that delivers on its promise of explosive action in a vast open world. While it may not offer a deep narrative experience, its strengths lie in providing players with unparalleled freedom to create their own brand of chaos. For those who value pure, unbridled fun in a video game, Just Cause 3 is a wild and exhilarating ride.",1695474811,1702619336,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

This game isn't the deepest game, the story isn't all that thought provoking, the gameplay isn't too complex, and there isn't a ton of substance overall, but d*mn if it isn't fun. The movement with the grapple and wing suit is an absolute blast, explosions are awesome, the weapons are crazy, the destruction is immense and the colors of everything are gorgeous. I had the most fun just gliding around and blowing things up for the fun of it as opposed to following the set missions.

Car driving in Borderlands and the FarCry games is much better.

A lot of areas in the game have plot armor so they can't be destroyed. I can't honestly say the game is BAD because in the very limited confines of its weak plot the game is fun. The leveling up process is utter garbage and the camera bouncing all over the place makes the game almost unplayable. The camera in this game is criminally bad to the point it almost ruins the game.

JC3 is one of those games in the open world genre that can be boiled down to ""shoot red thing."" Sounds simple right? Well that's because it is. Blow up military bases, liberate provinces under siege, and blast through 3 massive islands in a near 16 hour romp that never gets old because of the limitless experimentation granted by the numerous weapons and the abuse of a silly physics system... and that's not even half of it. 
The other bits are a little hit or miss though, I like the activity system, rewarding you with new ways to play as you go through them (i.e wingsuit challenges or mayhem a la Saints Row). The game is actually surprisingly restraint on collectibles, as nobody wants to collect a hundred useless artifacts, instead opting for lore dumps and vintage weapon/vehicle parts. 
Now the most meh thing about this game would be its main story, it only takes up 4-5 hours of runtime, but because Avalanche couldn't come up with mission ideas past ""escort this"" or ""follow pipes"" it feels so much longer. Couple that with a very paper thin plot and a LAME ending, and yeah you'll be glad you never have to play it again after completion. At least the characters were fun to be around otherwise it would just be flat out bad.
Ignoring a weak story (which is not hard to do), Just Cause 3 is one of the best ""blow up thing move on"" open world games since Crackdown 1.

I bought it when it's on sale and didn't give it high expectation. But it is so satisfying to play. Two days, I've already spent 10 hours on that. I'm not in hurry to go over the story (average, actually) since all my time were spending on play with super interesting reels and shooting everybody everywhere. So much fun!

I only needed my rocket launcher and its 6 shots.

[i] I only get my political education from the best media out there. [/i]

Having picked up Avalanche's cult classic, Just Cause 3, after playing the recent The Legend of Zelda games, I realized just how damn ahead of its time this game was.
While it is in certain ways a mechanical downgrade from Just Cause 2, the game explodes (ha) the quality and quantity of the Hollywood action spectacle to epic proportions. The store page really does not lie when it promises an entire mediterranean island state for you to explore and blow up its fascist regime, one base after another.

The game definitely lacks variety concerning enemies, NPCs, mission objectives, and even much of the open world is littered with very obviously copy-pasted structures, but it doesn't really matter.
The best open world games are, in my opinion, those that don't give a damn about exploration and are all about your direct and immediate interactions with the world, so that any ordinary land- or cityscape can serve as a setting for a whole array of different activities. Just Cause 3, like Insomniac's Spider-Man, the Batman Arkham trilogy and Zelda Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, excels at the moment-based gameplay.

Graphically, this 2015 game is eye candy.
The lighting, textures, particle effects and oversaturated colors all work in harmony to paint the fictional mediterranean nation of Medici as a wonderful panorama.
Only real graphical complaints are the low-res debris from explosions, as well as the characters’ stiff faces.
Performance on Steam Deck is extremely stable, with only occasional technical jank or crashes. The game also experiences no slow-downs whatsoever when there is a lot of action on screen, a far cry from its disastrous launch in 2015 and yet more proof that western soft- and hardware should just always be bought at least two years after launch.

The gameplay is a constant thrillride.
You get exactly what's on the box, if not way more. Rico Rodriguez' insanity cannot be contained by a box art.
Even if seeing the same copy-pasted structures, enemies and vehicles gets visually boring, the action never does.
It takes time to learn the mechanics and physics system, and I've had plenty of frustrations as a result, but if you focus, you'll keep on improving until you turn from an action hero to an unstoppable force of primal destruction.
Also, don't skip the challenges when you unlock them. They're a bit boring, compared to the 1-on-50 gunfights, but they're your only source of 'Gears', the currency used to unlock upgrades to all your moves, weapons and vehicles.

This game also knows how to pace itself well.
Especially in areas you've liberated, the peaceful atmosphere provides a stark, but wonderful contrast to the insanity of war. Not only is it legitimately relaxing to drive, fly, swim, climb and wingsuit across these beautiful landscapes and search for collectibles, but it also reminds you what the war that the game's story centers around, is about.
This is massively helped by the incredible soundtrack by the masterful Henry Jackman, who knows precisely how to make you melancholic when at peace, and how to get and keep you hyped when fighting the dictator's forces.
And I swear, the soundtrack is mixed adaptively by the game, according to your gameplay…

The story reminds me of old Bond films, but with a slightly more down-to-earth and also personal touch.
The previous game didn't take itself seriously at all and was very obviously satire.
In it, a younger CIA Special Agent Rico Rodriguez tore down the government of the fictional eastern country of P A N A U, simply because the local dictator turned his foreign policy against the US after murdering the previous guy. You also infiltrated the organizations of extremely stereotypical mafia-like criminals.
In a massive tonal shift, Just Cause 3 balances the political satire with the personal story of Rico Rodriguez and sees him fight the enigmatic, if generic, fascist dictator General Di Ravello, in order to finally free his home country from decades of the man's brutal oppression.
A few characters, specifically Mario Frigo and Annika, may be extremely annoying, but it hardly detracts from the overall experience.
I also love the little detail of David Tennant getting kidnapped at the start and being forced to narrate the General's radio propaganda and progressively losing more of his mind as the story goes on.

There are also audio tapes that Di Ravello hid across the country over the years, which serve as one of the primary optional collectibles. While they really only please lore junkies like myself, they are very interesting to listen to, both regarding the relationship between Rico Rodriguez and General Di Ravello, as well as the worldbuilding of the country of Medici.
The General may be a 2D character, but he does serve as a baseline example of fascism.
I was only half joking when I opened this with ""I only get my political education from the best media out there"", as especially the tapes are a legitimately educational documentation of the never-changing method that political psychopaths use to convert free countries into fascist collectives. It's food for thought, and especially important to me, a Gen Z German who's studied his country's past.

[i] A wonderful package of an exhilarating open-world action-fantasy marathon with substance, creative gameplay, beautiful graphics that bring out a beautiful world and a thrilling soundtrack. [/i]

To be honest, it's just not working for me. The AI, gunplay, lack of precision in aiming, and overall control issues are quite frustrating. Additionally, the way AI seems to materialize behind you like specters is perplexing. Over the years, my preference has shifted towards other open-world games that offer more refined shooting mechanics and superior driving controls. Take CyberPunk, for example. The driving in that game was initially too rigid, and many players didn't like it. However, the developers revisited and improved it. Therefore, as time goes on, Just Cause should consider reevaluating its approach and reimagining a more polished gameplay experience.""",1466958567,1699069293,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In Just Cause 3 it's just the Dictator and the Rebels, but you still get supply drops etc. What you gain in Just Cause 3 is a grappling hook, parachute and a wing suit, as well as every vehicle and aircraft in the game is player usable. Can't recommend this enough. Totally gives me my Mercenaries fix. :)

Just Cause 3 is a wild, action-packed rollercoaster that takes you on a breathtaking adventure through the fictional Mediterranean island of Medici. With 27.8 hours of gameplay, I've had ample time to experience the game's unique blend of open-world mayhem and unbridled freedom.

The game's central premise revolves around your role as Rico Rodriguez, a one-man wrecking crew tasked with liberating Medici from the tyrannical grip of General Di Ravello. From the moment you hit the ground (or the air), it's clear that Just Cause 3 is all about creating chaos. The game's open world is your playground, and your destructive arsenal includes an impressive array of weaponry, vehicles, and, of course, the iconic grappling hook and wingsuit combo.

The real star of Just Cause 3 is the grappling hook, and it's not your typical grappling tool. It allows for boundless creativity and destruction. You can tether objects together, pull them apart, create makeshift zip lines, or even use them to slingshot vehicles into the air. The grappling hook, combined with the wingsuit, grants you a sense of freedom and mobility that few games can match. Soaring through the skies and gliding over lush landscapes is a truly exhilarating experience.

The world of Medici is vast and diverse, featuring scenic coastlines, towering mountains, dense forests, and bustling cities. The visual design is stunning, capturing the essence of a Mediterranean paradise corrupted by dictatorship. The variety of environments encourages exploration and experimentation.

Despite the freedom and mayhem, the main story missions can feel somewhat formulaic, often involving liberating bases, destroying infrastructure, and taking on General Di Ravello's forces. However, the real fun in Just Cause 3 lies in the sandbox nature of the game. Side activities, like challenges and stunts, are where the game truly shines. Racing jets, wingsuit courses, and engaging in creative chaos is where you'll find the most fun.

The game's chaotic nature, while thrilling, can sometimes lead to a lack of focus. Storytelling takes a backseat to the action, and the characters, including Rico himself, are not particularly well-developed. But for players looking for a pure adrenaline rush, this may not be a significant drawback.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 is a love letter to explosive, high-octane action and the exhilaration of unfettered freedom. With 27.8 hours of gameplay, you've likely experienced countless explosions, death-defying stunts, and a fair share of laughter at the sheer absurdity of it all. While the story and character development might not match the intensity of the gameplay, Just Cause 3 delivers unapologetic and chaotic fun that will keep you hooked as you explore the bounds of your creativity and the limits of the game's explosive potential. It's a beautiful symphony of destruction and freedom that's sure to leave a lasting impression.",1697696889,1697696889,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was surprised to see that Just Case 3 is almost a copy of just Cause 2. It seems as if the developers simply moved the story from the tropical South-east Asian island Panau to the Mediterranean. Other than that, the addition of a wingsuit and improved graphics it's almost the same game.

But since Just Cause 2 was a huge success and lots of fun, creating a copy was probably not the worse thing to do. Just Cause 3 is a huge open world playground with tons of things to do and a blast to play. The game offers...

- 22 story missions
Scripted and too childish in my opinion. If you only concentrate on the story you'll miss the best of the game. In my opinion the story is the weakest part of the game. It's rather boring, too easy and silly.

- 3 DLCs
Just Cause 3 comes with three major story add-ons: Bavarium Sea Heist, Mech Land Assault, and Sky Fortress.
Story-wise the DLCs are not much better than the main story but add some great new equipment to the game.

Bavarium Sea Heist adds the Loochador, an armoured jet-powered boat, armed with missiles and mini-guns. Besides being a lot of fun to operate, the Loochador helps a lot when it comes to collecting a few specific achievements.

The Mech Land Assault adds two new mini-games to the game where you have to defend two different military bases from waves of incoming invaders with a mech. While the mech doesn't really feel like you would expect a mech to feel, it's still a lot of fun to defend the bases. These mini-games are great add-ons!

Sky Fortress enhances your wingsuit dramatically by adding a Bavarium-powered booster, homing rockets and a machine gun. The DLC also adds the 'Bavarium Splitter' an extremely powerful assault rifle that you don't want to miss.

- Free Medici
Besides completing the story you have to free Medici. This means you have to free villages, small outposts and military bases - some of them huge - from the oppressor. In order to do so you have to destroy chaos objects such as fuel depots, pipelines, gas pumps, radars, communications masts, satellite dishes, wind turbines, generators, transformer, police stations etc. Although repetitive, this is a lot of fun. Causing chaos while igniting explosions all over the place with a huge arsenal of weapons never grows old.

- Challenges
In order to upgrade you gear you can complete the following challenges:

Destruction Frenzy Challenges: Destroy as many Chaos objects as possible with a specified weapons / vehicle

Crash Bomb Challenges: Drive a super-charged vehicle towards a target without losing too much speed, then bail out and watch the fireworks.

Shooting Gallery Challenges: Complete various weapons training courses to increase your proficiency with different types of armaments.

Scrapyard Scramble Challenges: Collect and deliver caches of Bavarium using a specially designed magnet attached to a vehicle.

Wingsuit Course Challenges: Fly through the markers to complete the course - the closer to the center of each marker you get, the higher your score will be.

Land Race Challenges: Race a land vehicle (car, truck, tank, etc.) through a series of checkpoints. The faster your time, the faster your score.

Air Race Challenges: Pilot an aircraft through a series of checkpoints while racing against the clock.

Sea Race Challenges: Drive a boat through a series of checkpoints while racing against the clock for a high score.

- Collectables
There are tons of collectibles in Medici. Scattered all over the island you can collect the following items:

DiRavello Audio Tapes - tapes recorded by your enemy DiRavello that add additional story content to the game when found

Rebel Shrines - small, blue shrines with candles that need to be light to access quick travel

Vintage Parts - Dig them up to unlock additional nostalgic weapons

Daredevil Jumps - Jump of ramps with cars as fast and far as you can

Ancient Tombs - Old graves you can only find on the last island you visit.

- Achievements
Some very cool achievements like collecting all vehicles including all planes and boats. This was a lot of fun!

Pros:
- beautiful graphics
- excessive explosions
- brilliant sound effects, cars sound better than in many racing games, insects, birds, waves
- parachute and wingsuit
- insane stunts
- driving cars in Medici is wonderful
- and all cars feel very different and individual
- boats, planes, helicopters, tanks, jets
- huge arsenal of weapons
- good music
- fantastic start screen
- peaceful sceneries
- wild action

Cons:
- rather childish and boring main story
- repetitive gameplay, but lots of fun if you like it
- requires a potent rig
- rather long loading times
- very poor German voice acting, except from DiRavellos speaker who did an outstanding good job
- some challenges seem impossible to beat with highest rating",1697675324,1697675324,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

All the weapons in the game are satisfying to use and aren't unbalanced. The aircraft is a major win, as all of them have great controls and feel like an extension of you, rather than a limitation. Challenges are super fun and varied (except for Laguna Blast). The open world is also pretty well designed and feels rewarding to explore.

However, there are a few reasons why it's not perfect. The game has many, many bugs. They can range from minor physics glitches that mess up Rico's grapple hook, to catastrophic errors that can randomly crash the game, corrupt saves, or just force the game to not start at all. They degrade the quality of the game a lot, it wouldn't be a problem if the game was short as you would be much less likely to encounter them, but since the game is quite long, bugs will inevitably appear as you play.",1632879887,1696864541,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

Game sometimes crashes during missions when specific things are not done as game intended forcing you to start mission again. 

At one specific time I was driving a tank on a road and suddenly it just disappeared into thin air. I wasted one beacon on that tank and it just disappeared without even letting me get to my destination. Definitely not what I expected from this game. 

When vehicles or aircraft are left at a specific spot then they risk to disappear for no reason. Sometimes they are still there after you come back from whatever you where doing far away from them and sometimes they just vanish. 

Fell through the map while driving a jet on a bumpy surface. Managed to get back up by using wingsuit and grappling hook but jet fell through. 

Gear upgrade system is stupid. Difficult challenges must be completed to gain gear upgrades but I would enjoy gaining them from progressing the story, completing missions. 

Enemy reinforcements always randomly appear out of sight very close to you and immediately after they are called which is what I hate.  If you are in a slow turning vehicle like tank or helicopter that is easily destructible by rockets then helicopters, tanks and warships who are called as reinforcements can easily destroy it and leave you with nothing but your guns who are useless against them with their limited ammo. 

Just cause 3 has a few fast cars but has no race tracks to test them and enjoy the speed. Instead one is forced to race on the streets where NPC cars are getting in the way resulting in race nearly always ending with crash and car in flames. There are a few air fields but none of them are long enough to test the max speed.

This game has potential, it could be a great game but bugs and unsatisfying game play mechanics are ruining this experience and seems like developers are not doing anything to fix this game. 

Additionally, missions and challenges are designed with intent to annoy the devil out of you. They are insanely hard and player will fail over and over again. If you want destruction and explosions, go play Half life 2 and its custom maps, they won't disappoint you. But if you do decide to buy this game then buy it with dlc together. Dlc has incredibly fun new weapons and vehicles that can make gameplay much smoother and destructive.

It’s a nice game for some mindless mayhem and blowing stuff up. 

[h1]Story[/h1]
There’s a story? Oh, right. One-man-army guy specialising in deposing tyrannical dictators and working for a secret US agency comes home to his tropical Mediterranean island-country to depose the local tyrant… by blowing up all the towns and military bases he comes across along the way. There are 25 main story missions, but most of them are easy and forgettable. You’ll be spending far more time sowing chaos and destruction in freeroam to remember the actual story. Unlike the second game, the story doesn’t take itself seriously most of the time here.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
After the first mission or two, you’re free to roam around the entirety of the game’s map. You’ll spend most of that time going from location to location and “liberating” it by blowing up all the military installations and items, or just messing around in general. You can carry one main weapon, a twin side arm, a special weapon and grenades + bombs as extras. You can order more gear from your menu to be airdropped to your location when you run out of ammo or want to switch weapons. Or you can order vehicles to travel from one location to another, or help you blow stuff up. While there are a whole lot of places that you can blow up in the game, they all start getting same-y after a while; the locations are just there to have something to blow up, so none of them really stand out or are very memorable.

The game has plenty of side activities (so much so that they feel more like chores) that reward you with various upgrades (e.g. carry more grenades, more tethers, faster vehicles etc.). Side activities include races for all vehicle types, obstacle courses for your wingsuit, base destruction in style with specified weapons, gathering ore with a magnet, and the dreaded crash bombs. The races are okay, but you’re probably going to need to switch to the fastest vehicle you have and unlock all nitrous upgrades to have a chance to get all five “gears” (stars) for the challenge. The wingsuit courses require you to fly through rings to earn points; some of the courses are pretty simple, but some require quite a bit of practice to nail down the sudden turns or steep dives. Base destruction repopulates “liberated” bases with objects to blow up again, but now there’s a timer and combo counter, so you have to be quick with your explosions. The ore challenge requires driving a vehicle with a magnet to bring ore scattered around the base into the furnace… while being attacked by random military goons, but the most difficult part of this challenge will be figuring out how to actually activate the magnet for starters, since it doesn’t actually come with instructions. The crash bombs, however, are the most annoying and pointless challenges in the game: you have to drive a vehicle with a loaded bomb to ram it into a bunch of goons at a marked location – basically, you have to cut corners while maintaining speed and avoiding damage so that the bomb doesn’t explode prematurely. On paper, it doesn’t sound too bad… until you realise that the challenges are horribly buggy and your car often explodes prematurely or without dealing any damage, because there’s some invisible wall between you and your target… and the explosion is so ineffective at dealing damage that you’d be better off getting out of the car to plant your own bombs instead of ramming the car into the enemies and hoping you’ve dealt at least some damage to them with it.

+Movement tech is very fun, if you get used to it.
+DLCs are aren't really needed to have fun. Unless it's on Sale, grab it! 
+You can compete for records against the world, and/or your friends!
+You can either walk, sail, use a land vehicle, and fly towards your Mission/Shenanigans
+...You can also just use a boat on land if your determined enough.
+Did I mention Explosions?
+Collecting is reasonably not needed, unless you're an achiever.
-Enemy engagement is really meh... but I have a huge Ion cannon gun with my hands so...
-No Coop. Unless you're using that mod's name I forgot about.
-Collecting is going to be a bit of a tease, but once you unlock the specific perks it'll be all worth it.

I'm 16 going on 17 and since I was 5 years old basically all I've done is play video games. I have spent, realistically, something like 12,000-15,000 hours playing video games in my life, which may pale in comparison to some, but is still a LOT of time. 

I may be young, brash, hyperactive and opinionated, but I'll be damned if I don't know who I am, and that person says that Just Cause 3 is probably his favorite game of all time. I've spent about 325 or so hours playing Just Cause 3 and I've beaten it and gotten 100% maybe 6 times now? (Although I only got ""100%"" once because I never bothered to collect every gear, just enough for all the upgrades.) It is a SUPERB experience. 

I am very sentimental. Things that happened in my past or things that defined any small facet of my life for any small period of time are grasped firmly by my mind and siphoned of all their little hits of painful nostalgia until I can hardly stand to think about them anymore. In this sense, Just Cause 3 is very special to me. But make no mistake: if I picked it up for the first time tomorrow, I'd love it just as much.

The story is pretty weak, and so are a couple of characters, but the gameplay, mechanics, music, collectibles, and graphics are all top notch. The game has astonishing graphics for something that came out in 2015. This game has the same effect as the Rocky Horror Picture Show (American cult classic) or any other movie you boot up once a year, whose lines you have memorized, whose characters you know better than you know some of your family members, whose soundtrack you could turn on and listen to in full without any device but your own brain. I go through the whole story captivated by every explosion, with the massive environment filled with little details and hand-crafted Easter eggs born of devotion and passion, driving around and killing 4-digit numbers of innocent civilians with all the weaponry the game offers.

I don't know how fairly I can really describe the game while my lens is so cloudy with the pervasive gas of nostalgia but I can tell you that after you've liberated the whole country and you just drive or fly around the verdant countryside, industrial roads, and gorgeous forests of Medici, you feel like you're in a different world. That experience alone is what I come back for. And for killing innocent people. 


Confession: I'm a fake fan. I haven't played the first or second game, but I've been meaning to. I didn't finish the fourth game because it's a pile of irreverent garbage not worth buying. 
Speaking of garbage, the DLCs are godawful. They either provide useless/broken vehicles or some scorpion gun, or they provide the BEST WEAPON/MECHS/WINGSUIT ever with the awful cost of having some out-of-place mass take up space in Medici's waters. The DLC stories for land/air/sea are garbage. I recommend buying them for the weapons but I kind of ignore the rest, but you know your boy has to get those thick juicy 100%'s.

I came back to write this review because I'm in a little bit of a depressive rut, grappling with the realization that it's not likely we're ever gonna get a fifth game. But we have Just Cause 3. And that's more than enough for me, and more than any of us deserve. And, if you somehow find this review, I want you to give it a try.

The world is very large and looks quite appealing. Though, as I was playing the game I kept thinking that if Avalanche Studios had invested more attention to detail, making the ingame world a more believable, lived in place, it could've been an amazing game. Beyond liberating settlements and regions, completing challenges to earn upgrade points there's not much else that's a big draw to the game.

All that the ingame world serves for is as a huge sandbox to cause mindless, repetative yet fun mayhem. What I enjoyed most was darting around with the wingsuit, especially what's added through the Sky Fortress DLC. The story for me was boring and bland. They tried to give the characters their own personalities but the story, which lacked impact, prevented me from being interested in the main cast. Again, a little more attention to detail from Avalanche Studios could've elevated the game to something much more. Due to this I often just skipped cut-scenes and story beats.

What I disliked the most is how some vehicles handled. I avoided motorcycles like the plague and just didn't use helicopters and planes. The driving model (programming) for those vehicles are just subpar. Cars are okay. When I unlocked certain upgrades for the wingsuit I just used that as my main means of transportation even if it took me much longer to get from point A to B.

In conclusion: A fun game to play when you just want some mindless fun. The game could've been that much more with more attention from the developers and some extra game mechanics to immerse ourselves more into the game world. The reason why I played as many hours as I did was a drive within me to complete as many activities as possible and complete the entire game.

Definitely a buy on sale with the DLC included.",1695404976,1695404976,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- The second game was a cheesy spy action movie. This one is a Mediterranean vacation simulator, Ubisoft style. 
- Rico used to be an undercover spy posing as an anonymous terrorist, and that was cool. Now, every person in the world calls him by name (and talks about how great he is, constantly). It makes no sense, and it's dumb. 
- Rico used to be very Mexican, maybe the only thing that set him apart from other action game protagonists. Now he's basically Nathan Drake crossed with Ezio. Hard to think of a more generic combination. 
- I started skipping the cutscenes, which I never do. The dialogue is kind of annoying. It was always hammy and cliche, which was fine. Now it's also trying to be witty and sentimental, and it doesn't work for me. 
- In the second game, you were rewarded for just causing (^^) general mayhem and destruction, like a good little terrorist. Now, you are conquering outposts by going down a checklist of things to break. The first one is fun, the second is homework. It's also thematically, a weird fit. Feels more like AssCreedFarCry than it should.
- At least so far, the story feels more sanctimonious about Rico's mission. Previously, he was an assassin, mostly in Panau to murder someone, and cause chaos along the way. He spends a lot of time threatening to kill people. Here in the third game, they play it up like he's the new Gandhi or something. I dunno, feels a lot less believable than before, which somehow makes it more scummy. Even if he wasn't employed by a morally bankrupt intelligence agency, this is a guy who sticks detonating rockets to civilians' heads for no reason. (Or that could just be me)
++ On the plus side, this game has a wingsuit, and a mech DLC, and some improvements to the grapple.

This is the peak of the Just Cause series and what it is known for, and that is being the perfect video game, doing things you cant do in real life. Just Cause 3 lets you live out a never ending action movie in the most beautiful paradise of your dreams... Do I need to say more? Well I will because I love this game haha. Just cause 3 in my opinion is the best in the series. The world of Medici is absolutely stunning, and has this homely Mediterranean feel that is hard to explain, I think the soundtrack definitely helps with this aswell. Unlike Just Cause 2 which, despite being an amazing game, honestly has an unsettling soundtrack which kind of makes the game feel like a horror game. Just cause 3 in comparison, the music makes the world feel so alive and calming! Which is a great feeling after causing absolute chaos! Its a beautiful juxtaposition that cant be explained or understated. Its odd since Medici doesnt have as many different biomes in the world as the other games however it still somehow has the most beautiful world! The grappling hook, parachute, and wing suit combo also peaked in this game and makes traversing the game world so satisfyingly fluid in a way that must be experienced! Furthermore the game play using all the tools at your disposal is not only super fun but creative! The game encourages you to tackle objectives in any way you see fit and in my opinion encouraging creativity in games is really lacking these days!

As standard, there are something like 21 story missions, few of which have any actual rewards.  The gameplay in each of them is entirely the same as the rest of the game, with the exception that a few of them take place inside structures.

Since your only interaction with your allies is in the cutscenes of these missions, or floating high above them during them, there's no engagement or involvement with them - contrast with Rockstar games. When one ally sacrifices themselves, the response is just ""Meh, whatever"".

The vast majority of the game time goes into repeating the same limited set of liberation activities over and over and over and over.  Granted, the engine is fine, and the addition of the wingsuit, and (with an expansion) the Bavarium wingsuit, adds even more pleasure to the basic activity of travelling around and raining down death.

But most of the upgrades that you earn through activities only apply to later attempts to complete that activity. Combat never changes much, and you can complete any combat mission at any time. Conversely, some vehicle missions can only be completed once you've finished the story, something that I find particularly frustrating.

There's no real payoff to completion, or to any of the activities, so all we've got here is a basic Skinner box where you chase rewards to get rewards.  It's enjoyable in the moment, but ultimately hollow and frustrating.",1527931649,1694943440,False,3,0,0.522302150726318359,0,True,False,False

The traversal using the grapple is janky as ever as you phase through object or get caught and stopped on empty air, the constant respawning enemies are made worse by an addition of large amount of bullet sponges except for times when you have to reach certain ""havoc"" goals when liberating some settlements and they stop spawning for minutes at a time so you just stand around and wait, the AI is positively rarted - I have seen it crash more helicopters than I shot down and I have shot down 0 jets on my own, yet I have a couple on record because they keep ramming into buildings, they keep shooting their own allies and vehicles, etc.

The writing, the story and characters are somehow even worse than Just Cause 2, which had to take a looot of effort, because JC2 was already absolutely atrocious.

This game is not chaos gamified, it's simply a mess - not in terms of it's technical side, which is not perfect, but not bad either. However, its gameplay is an utter mess. There are games which have chaotic, but ultimately balanced and fun gameplay. This isn't one of them.

The only two redeeming qualities of this game are the beautiful environments which are again an improvement over the already great looks and atmosphere of the previous games, and the again surprisingly competent vehicle sounds which are again a step up from the already pretty good sounds in JC2. This dev team definitely knows how to deliver on the looks and atmosphere of a tropic paradise.",1694871853,1694871853,False,1,1,0.485294133424758911,0,True,False,False

But wait I can hear you think, isn't this a single player game? Why would it need to be connected to servers? Well that's for the public leader boards, cause nothing is more important than knowing if you have flown your wing suit longer than any one else in the game. This screen is god damn relentless, game might work fine all day, but then the games leader board servers go wonky and you might as well just shut the thing down and go browse reddit.

Screen pops up and starts trying to reconnect which take 30 seconds to 2 minutes before failing and it gives you another pop up asking if you want to try again or go to offline mode. So screw the lead boards, off line mode it is right? You go back to gaming, but as soon as any thing happens like finishing a challenge, starting a quest..... boom Attempting to Connect to Servers. Then 2 minutes later go off line mode. This is endless, occasionally it will actually connect to servers but that only last a few minutes before it drops you again. IT is insane, just an endless loop of staring at a connecting to servers screen before you get a few minutes of game play just to get dumped right back into the connecting screen.

It seems a decent and fun game, but this is the single stupidest game mechanic I think I've ever seen, If they shut down the servers and just make it offliine I would give it a 5.

I've had my fair share of adventures in Just Cause 3, both on PS4 and PC, and it's been an enjoyable ride. As someone who owns and has played Just Cause 2, I know this might be a divisive opinion, but I actually prefer this game over its predecessor. The graphics, while not groundbreaking, were decent for the time it was released. However, it's worth noting that there are still quite a few bugs and glitches that I wish had been patched, but we don't always get everything we hope for, and we have to make do with what we've got. :3

I wouldn't say it's worth the full price, though. My recommendation is to wait for a special offer or sale to pick it up.

Overall, I'd give Just Cause 3 a 6/10. It's an explosive and action-packed game, but it can become a bit repetitive and lose its charm after a while. While the graphics are okay, the bugs can be a bit of a downer. That said, there's still something oddly satisfying about kamikaze-ing into a bridge to take down a convoy, and that's a memory I'll cherish.",1573476630,1694358906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

      This game is amazing. It's packed with explosions, guns, and non-stop action. The story is well-written and incredibly captivating. The range of options for guns, cars, and gadget upgrades available to you is just right. The freedom to roam around an open world and do as you please is liberating. The colors are bright and vivid, and the overall quality is crisp and clean. The game is very mod-friendly. I initially played it on both Xbox and PlayStation, and I had to get it on here. I would say this game is worth the $20, but if it's on sale, it's a no-brainer. It doesn't require a super-intensive PC specification lineup. You won't regret buying this game if you decide to go for it.",1694287537,1694287537,True,24,1,0.71870720386505127,0,True,False,False

-Gunplay is somewhat mediocre, not great not terrible
-Vehicle handling feels clunky (though more with some vehicles than others)
-A lot of repetitive objectives
-Storyline is similar to 1&2 (as in, unremarkable and somewhat forgettable)

The weird:
-Voice acting is extra cheesy (some will love it, some will hate it)
-The UI has a lot of strange bugs (like waypoints being placed in a different place than your cursor, or incorrect button prompts when using custom keybinds)

Just Cause 3 is (often literally) an absolute blast to play. The goal of the game is simple: Shoot everyone you meet (usually bad people, but the game doesn't penalize you in any way for killing civilians), attach bombs to things, throw bombs at things, hijack innocent people's vehicles, hijack limousines to send their not-so-innocent occupants hurtling off the local bridge, and generally cause mass amounts of destruction, all in the name of freedom (i think).

You're given an enormous open world to mess around in, all KINDS of different weapons and vehicles to play with, and plenty of enemies to kill with your new toys. There isn't much variety among basic infantry units, which usually either shoot you, throw grenades at you, or call in more reinforcements, but this is balanced out by their array of [i] scary [/i] vehicles to chase you down in. They might try to ram you off the road in a boxy jeep, shoot you from afar in a weaponized speedboat, rain the fires of Hell upon ye with an attack helicopter, or just straight up kill you with a [b] [u] VERY FAST[/u] [/b] tank. Seriously, do not misconstrue the power of enemy tanks. You will die.

I haven't finished the game yet (a testament to how fun just playing around is), but so far the story is pretty nice. Nothing award-winning, a little corny at times, but it's still neat. Not much else to say about it.

The game unfortunately doesn't take much time to explain the controls in detail, so a lot of the tricks you have up your sleeves must be pulled out through trial and error. I'm only recently discovering how to properly use several of the game's major tools. A few YouTube videos might steer you in the right direction, but it's still a shame most of the cool game mechanics are only briefly clarified in their respective tutorials.

All in all, I think this is a really fun turn-your-brain-off game. It encourages creating and employing unique methods of killing everything you see while generally offering very few puzzles or serious neuron-activating moments. Shoot bang. Big fun.

Even if you're not into the game because of the chaos, there's much more to do than just blow stuff up.

[b]Absolute destruction everywhere.[/b]
The game is so much fun and a massive step up from the 2nd game, in every aspects. Physics, stunning environments, a more engaging story (even though it's an excuse to blow everything up, it still hooks you more), a lot of weapons, vehicules, skills... Even in 2023 it still looks great with amazing destructions physics. The feeling of power & freedom is amazing. Dimah is a great character too, the acting on her is really good. And for once, a game that is not about driving stuff did a wonderful job at making the vehicules FUN to handle, without too many shitty mechanisms. It's simple & perfect.
I barely stopped playing once I started it. While I had a hard time really getting into Just Cause 2. Honestly Avalanche deserves a lot of credits for this game.
... You can also die from falling structures!

[b]Still not perfect[/b]
A lot of visual bugs in big explosions, randomly popping enemies that can become a pain in the ass when they're everywhere, 3 BIG crashes for no reasons (I had to reboot my PC), the online feature at the start of the game takes either forever or doesn't work at all, and a bit too many collectibles for my taste.",1691910968,1691910968,True,3,0,0.560560345649719238,0,True,False,False

Huge map split into 3 main islands, You unlock more and more vehicles and weapons as you progress through the game.

There is a story and it's not bad (though the ending was unsatisfying) - but the main focus is just on causing chaos and liberating bases.

The physics are fun to toy with with Tethers, Grappling Hooks and Wing suits, creating an interesting mechanic I haven't seen in many games which gives you the ability to stand or attach yourself to enemy vehicles.

The visuals of this game are amazing, and so are the mechanics.

Though this game has faults, the story was pursued poorly and made it hard to connect with anything going on. Additionally, you don’t get to use any of the cool end game content because there’s nothing left after you get it. 

The game is still great, and I highly recommend it.


ALTHOUGH, THE CHALLENGES RUIN ANY AND ALL FUN. If I add my 100% completion of this game into the mix, this game is a 4/10 because the challenges DRAIN ALL FUN.
What do I get for it? A few extra explosives and more tethers. The most helpful thing out of my pain was the boosting while parachuting and wing suiting. Not to mention the NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE bomb drive challenge. 


As for DLC content, I actually like this story more than the original line. I am able to follow with the story more easily, and connect with what’s happening. What’s even better is all of the awesome new weapons and toys I have to blow things up! I also really like how the Black Hand actually attempt to reclaim territory before you liberate a camp too.

I like the missions, the game isn't totally narrative driven, you can always do the missions later, but when clearing the central command for the regions you need to do the missions in order to effectively clear it. 

I don't like the difficulty of the wing suit courses, they feel a bit too buggy, the physics are a bit off with the rings, but most of all, it's the difficulty. Just Cause 3 doesn't scale, meaning everyone has to hit the same goals, regardless of if they're a veteran to the series, or a person who's first introduction into Just Cause was this game.

I like the explosions, they are certainly worse than that of Just Cause 4, but with newer games usually comes better graphics.

I don't like the explosion physics, when the Falco Maxime FOW fires, the nuke is devastating, almost nearly killing you if your too close. The version of it that you get feels dramatically under-powered despite being the same projectile, a direct hit doesn't kill you.

I love the variety, most vehicles and weapons bring something new to the table, weather it be a powerful rifle or a new shotgun. A new sport car or a new vintage vehicle, there's almost always something new.

I like the collectibles, they aren't hidden so bad that you cannot possibly find them, but they don't stick out, again, I like the variety of the collectibles, there's several different collectibles, there's tapes, tombs, and various vintage parts. Collecting all of them grants an achievement, and collecting all of one type grants a weapon/vehicle.

I like the soundtrack, it's easily one that fades into the background, but when it's not there, something just feels off about the game.

Overall, I love this game and I would recommend anyone who wants a good challenge but also an open world experience to get this game. I should note that I am not an experienced critic, and this is one of the first times I have ever reviewed a game. You should look at other reviews from more experienced critics before making your choice.",1690848427,1690848427,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

- When the developers of GTA5 and the authors of the Rimbaud film franchise spent the night together, before watching enough Indian action movies;
- When the cat hook becomes the central idea of the gameplay and the reason to rewrite physics textbooks;
- The best simulator of dismantling dictatorial infrastructure;
- If nothing explodes around you, then most likely you are doing something wrong, and you will have to reboot;
- Beautiful ""resort"" graphics with excellent optimization and juicy special effects;
- Minimum bugs. Developers from AAA studios should be bored;
- When it's easier to tell what the main character of the game can'T do than he can;
- Jumping on a tank from a kilometer-long cliff you will not die, and the enemy will die by jumping from a tree. Landing from a helicopter without a parachute, you probably won't die either. Damn, it's hard to die here at all!
- When there is complete order with the Russian voice acting. Developers from AAA... well, you understand;
- A lot of military equipment. Helicopters, tanks, boats,

With many weapons and vehicles and weaponized vehicles, and a huge open world full of stuff to bLoW Up, you can lose a lot of hours in this. The story is a good mix of seriousness and humor, and broken up into missions so you can screw around instead if you'd like.

Overall, I'd highly recommend Just Cause 3. It controls well, the physics are well-designed (save for being able to wingsuit into a cliff head-on, and just walk it off. But hey, it gets crazier.) and if you have the hardware, it's got some pretty graphics.

Personally, that's the biggest issue for me.
The missions aren't hard but definetly take times. So, if you can't continue in the middle of a mission, then BOOM, you must restart it from the beginning. Checkpoints only available inside the mission. It's gone when you get back to the menu. So, you have to start from the beginning.

The story is bull, but the missions are mostly fun and rarely repetitive. IMO, liberating stuff is not as repetitive as people say, because you can approach it in so many different ways that you can always have fun. My biggest criticism with this game is the controls. I know this game is meant to play with a controller, but I would need so much time to get used to that and I just think that shooters are better with mouse & keyboard. But that leads to weird things like the car's brake being bound to shift on default and stuff that just feels weird to me. But still easier to get used to than controller for me. One thing I cannot comprehend is the plane's nitrous being bound to the same key as acceleration no matter what you bind either to, which is just a mistake.

Honestly some of the challenges to unlock gear points are the hardest part of this game lol. Regardless though, it's a fun shooter and you get to blow up so much stuff, the entertainment is still there and that's why I have 100+ hours into this game. With huge open worlds like this you can literally just drive an F1 car around and do nothing useful, or you can go completing missions, finding all the parts to unique weapons or whatever else your mind wants to focus on.

However, it also actually is its biggest issue: to minimize requirements and maximize depth of field, many crucial assets regularly fail to load up. 
This translates into invisible enemies:
- That helicopter firing at you? Make a 360° and clearly LOOK for it please, to signify I need to draw it now on your... aww, you're dead. 
- Wait! There are 8 soldiers, not 4, because I loaded them two-by-two on top of each other to save space and... you're dead. 
- Same thing with that tank. I didn't load it up while you were scouting that base and... you're dead. 
- You don't mind if I spawn another soldier with the one you just killed? It saves RAM. Yes, that means the room you just cleared isn't... you're dead. 
And also:
- Reload your gun! No, I have to prioritize enemy actions to manage the huge open world. Re-mash that reload key! I purged the order from... you're dead.
- I told you already! I can't prioritize your actions over the enemies'! The world's too huge! Re-mash the 'draw weapon' key and.... you're dead.
- You've thrown a grenade on that squad??? No, I only computed it killing you. But if you insist, since you've just respawned, here it is, on your ass. Boom gift! You're dead. Again. (true story, I swear)
And my favourite:
- You pressed 'turn left'? Twice already? Aw, shit, I have to catch up. Here it is, your three commands, all at once! You hit an incoming truck? ... You're dead!

And still the punching-bag boasts and self-congratulates, as if he was some big, badass action hero... *sigh*

Well, at least, everything is simulated: the wind, the texture of the sand, the sea waves... Okay, since it's only virtuality on a screen, you won't actually feel any of it... But they WILL impact your vehicles. Ah! The joy of playing dodge-ball when you're blind.

Also, since the game came from console, the number of usable keys is limited to that of a controller, not the number of keys actually used in the game. So, the key to 'jump' with your car and 'use nitro' is the same, for some interesting accidents... Same thing with 'accelerate' and 'use nitro' with planes; except, the plane decelerates and falls if you release the key, and nitro doesn't recharge if you don't release the key. Very handy. (But you'll love planes if you're the kind that likes being trampled by stilettos)
And the 'F' key is permanently bound to 'trigger explosives', no matter what you do - which makes remapping kind of useless. Very handy too. 
 
Time for the frosting! Since we're already in the mood... Enemies can bob and weave around your bullets. Yes, like in a boxing ring! And it takes three headshots to kill them. Unless they get back up. You're dead. And helicopters can fire right underneath themselves. You're dead. And vehicles don't have health bars, they progressively smoke and catch fire, which you can't see since there's always fire and smoke everywhere from all the explosions and... you're dead. And your allies don't care if you're in their line of fire. You're dead. And the rebels will send rescue in dire situations, if you can rescue the rescue first. You're dead. And now the baddies have armour-plated 'Terminators' with gateling guns. You're... rage quit???

Still, if the game is on sale (like 90-95% off) AND you're a Mass Effect fan, take JC3. Play Ricco a while. Then play Sheppard. *grin*

[b]TLDR: Fun gameplay and movement, but an uninspired narrative, lacklustre gameplay progression, and disappointing difficulty. [/b]

Pros:
- Good Traversal: It's entertaining to experiment with the traversal using the wing-suit and the graphing hook.
- Destruction and Explosions: The following is quite enjoyable to see.
- Tethers and Ragdolls: This game contains a feature that allows you to connect numerous hooks to one another. You could, for instance, strap an NPC to the tail of a car or a helicopter. With this, there are lots of hilarious possibilities.
- The Main Menu: It was a nice touch that the gameplay seamlessly transitions from the interface to the gameplay.

Cons: 
- The Story: This is a tedious, forgettable slog of a story. Without it, the game would have been better because it contributes nothing except bloat and boredom. 
- Lack of Weapons: This game is lacking in weapons. You won't ever use all of the weapons because some are objectively superior than others, and many of them feel out of balance. Additionally, some of the funnier weapons are DLC-locked.
- The Progression: With the exception of the wing-suit mods, the ""Gear Mods"" that act as this game upgrades are under-baked and can be dismissed. You must complete the same monotonous side tasks in order to unlock gears. The game linearly unlocks the mods, so you cannot choose which ones you want.
- Usless Collectibles: The game contains the following: 71 Audio Tapes, 49 Rebel Shrines, 54 Vintage Parts, 30 Stunt Jumps, and 23 Ancient Tombs. The tapes unlock a skin for a helicopter, the shrines unlocks free fast travels(which is completely useless as you can easily get fast travel flares by dying as it restocks all of your ammo for free), vintage parts unlock 2 weapons and 1 plane(the actual useful collectible), stunt jumps only unlocks an achievement, and ancient tombs unlocks 1 weapon.
- Difficulty: There are no settings for difficulty. The only option to make the game more challenging other than by self-handicapping yourself. So the game is quite an easy one. The game is particularly forgiving when you die since it gives you free ammo refills, turning death into a way to gain more ammo.
– Poor AI. The AI is your typical terrible AI that makes no effort to behave intelligently at all.
Bullet Sponge Enemies. Enemies simply have greater health in the late game, allowing you to mag dump an enemy's head with a lot of lead shots.
- Strange Keyboard Mapping. The default mappings are somewhat unusual. Thankfully, excluding menu controls, you can remap them. So have fun using the CTRL key to back out of menus.
- Long Intro Opening. Every time you start the game, an initial cutscene plays without letting you skip it. Thankfully, a steam guide may be used to get around this.
- Terrible DLC Policy There should of have been only 1 DLC. But money-hungry developers divided it up into many DLCS. 
- Cutscenes in DLC. In order to save money, they substituted a slideshow for the in-game cutscenes for the DLC missions. Every time you play a mission that isn't part of the DLC followed by one that is, it is very apparent and off-putting. This stinks of a lack of consistency and effort.
- Bugs and Glitches: This game features the typical, small problems that you get in all games, but some of them are actually rather game-breaking. I was taken to a city when I initially started playing, however there was a problem because the city wasn't correctly loaded. As a result, I had to restart the mission in order for it to load properly. Speaking of things that don't load, the enemy vehicles frequently have problems with loading and being invisible. The firearms occasionally not making any sounds is another common problem. A softlocke on the task ""Rico and the Rose"" was the worst problem I ever encountered. You are given the task of shielding an ally's plane from enemy planes while flying a jet in this game. The issue is that your missiles' lock on capabilities aren't applied to the planes. This leads to the destruction of your ally and the mission's failure. You must employ a speed-run technique to get around, which involves continuously spamming your missiles to stop the enemy jets from shooting. Despite this softlocke being a problem for many other players, the developers never fixed it.",1688236001,1690106467,False,2,1,0.470420777797698975,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- over the top destruction is lots of fun. Seeing all the pretty explosions happen as you rampage through a base never gets old.
- wide variety of vehicles - cars, helicopters, boats, planes, tanks, and more!
- voice acting and cutscenes are good
- some genuinely funny bits
- huge and varied map, with forests, mountains, caves, mines, cities, oil rigs, etc.
- cute italian/spanish/french style villages dotted around
- easy to get around even without vehicles, with the grapple, parachute and wingsuit - with some upgrades...

Cons:
- the plot is your bog-standard fare: overthrow island dictator, clear the areas, blah blah, you've played it before
- the bad guy is portrayed as a wily and clever man in the tapes illustrating his rise to power, but is portrayed as a blithering idiot in the (very few, sadly) cutscenes we get. More screen time for the bad guy would have been better.
- not that many missions: the meat of the game is in its destruction/liberation of enemy outposts
- poor car/motorbike driving physics
- annoying console port issues, like negative mouse acceleration in tank turrets
- a few annoying gamebreaking bugs, like precision aiming breaking missile lockons (mandatory for a campaign mission)
- absolutely ridiculous spawning AI. Whenever they need to produce more enemies for you, they simply spawn them in a few metres away from you out of your line of sight, so you will often find enemies in places you knew were clear just two seconds ago. Most obnoxious when clearing oil rigs in a helicopter - by the time the radio tells you that helicopters have been called in, it is 100% guaranteed that they are right behind you and about 2 seconds away from shoving rockets up your behind.
- the game drags on way too much. There is simply too much to do - too many settlements and guard posts, too many collectibles of various kinds, [b]way[/b] too many challenges, etc. There isn't enough variety or incentive to do all this either - you'll be freeing tons of guard posts by blowing up the same ol' fuel tanks, radar dishes, transformers, etc., and most of the time you'll be getting some weapon or vehicle that you already have something else better of. Once you realise this, maybe 1/3 or 1/2 way through the game, you'll just start wanting to get it over with.

In summary, the bugs and annoyances don't detract too much from the tons of fun for the time it remains novel, and it remains a great sandbox for destruction and mayhem. Given the shockingly low prices to which it goes on sale, it's well worth it, but perhaps a bit too boring at full price.",1689833231,1689833231,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

just cause 3 is a open-world action-adventure game developed by avalanche studios and published by square enix. it released worldwide on december 1st, 2015 on pc, xbox one, and ps4. it is the third game in the just cause series, following 2006's just cause and 2010's just cause 2. it's set six years after JC2 and you're still playing as series protagonist rico rodriguez. this game however, you play in the mediterranean republic of medici, which is where rico grew up. it's an interesting premise for the third game, as it was at risk of becoming stale and that alone was enough (for me at least) to spice things up. of the three just cause games i've played so far, they always have some cliché-filled story that is usually an afterthought, but the gameplay and action is usually fun enough to keep me playing until 100% completion. the first JC game was so boring and repetitive i gave up after less than two hours, as i couldn't bring myself to spend 30 or so hours doing the same things over and over again. JC2 was bloated with way too much filler side content, and while the gameplay was refined enough to keep me playing for 90 hours as i was completing the game, it definitely should've been a 60-ish hour experience instead. JC3 was a perfect step forward in that regard, as i took 55 hours, but i could see it taking as low as 45 hours for some, and at most, i could see it taking like 75 hours.

development began in 2012, handled by avalanche studios' side studio while the main studio focused on the development of mad max (2015). they ended up with a map that was similar in size to JC2, but they expanded it vertically, and the amount of actual playable area was very dense comparatively. they also focused more on making things dynamically destructible, adding a lot of mechanics to the game. they also wanted to keep the humor and wackiness that was seen in JC2, but they also wanted to explore rico's backstory more. JC3 was first teased by the CEO of avalanche studios in february 2013, and a official announcement came in november 2014, with the first gameplay trailer coming at square enix's 2015 E3 conference. 

gameplay wise, they took everything that kept you playing JC2 and expanded on it, giving rico more gadgets and more ways to traverse around the map. there's a lot of refinement throughout the game, and the developer has steadily improved over the course of the JC franchise. i am definitely excited to eventually buy and play JC4, because i feel as if they will go even bigger and even better for the fourth game. while this game released at $60 full price, and it's been marked down several times (to $50, then $30, and now full price is only $20) but the cherry on top is that you can routinely find JC3 for 85% off on sale, making it only $3 instead, which is an insane value, even if you're just playing through the main story only, which will still take most players around 20 hours or so. to me, the original JC game is a 1 out of 10, and JC2 is a like 4 or 5 out of 10, and then JC3 would be like a 6 or 7 out of 10.",1689609245,1689609245,True,1,0,0.485011786222457886,0,True,False,False

Avalanche Studios has truly outdone themselves with this action-packed sequel, delivering an explosive playground of destruction, freedom, and pure unadulterated fun. Brace yourself for a high-octane adventure that will have you grinning from ear to ear.

First and foremost, the open-world environment of Just Cause 3 is nothing short of spectacular. The fictional Mediterranean island of Medici is vast, diverse, and brimming with life. From lush forests to shimmering coastlines and towering mountain ranges, each region offers breathtaking views and a wealth of opportunities for exploration. The attention to detail is outstanding, making every corner of the map feel immersive and alive.

But what truly sets Just Cause 3 apart is its unrivaled freedom and sandbox gameplay. As protagonist Rico Rodriguez, you have access to an impressive arsenal of weapons and gadgets, including the iconic grappling hook and parachute combination. These tools allow for seamless traversal across the sprawling landscapes, letting you soar through the air, scale buildings, and hijack vehicles with unmatched ease. The sheer freedom to approach missions and objectives in any way you desire is liberating and adds an unparalleled level of creativity to the gameplay.

The heart of Just Cause 3 lies in its chaotic and explosive combat. Engaging in epic battles against dictator General Di Ravello's forces is an absolute thrill. Whether you're raining down destruction from a fighter jet, attaching explosives to enemy infrastructure, or engaging in intense gunfights, the action never disappoints. The destructible environments take the mayhem to another level, as bridges crumble, buildings collapse, and explosions reverberate throughout the world. It's a visually stunning spectacle that will leave you in awe.

Furthermore, the game's missions are varied, exciting, and always offer room for experimentation. You'll find yourself liberating towns, causing chaos, and taking down key targets in a series of exhilarating set pieces. The pacing is well-executed, providing a perfect balance between high-stakes missions and the freedom to explore and wreak havoc at your own leisure.

Just Cause 3 also delivers a captivating storyline that keeps you invested throughout your adventure. Rico's quest to liberate Medici and uncover the truth behind his past is engaging, supported by memorable characters and solid voice acting. While the narrative takes a backseat to the explosive gameplay, it still manages to provide a satisfying backdrop for your actions.

In terms of technical aspects, Just Cause 3 impresses with its stunning visuals and smooth performance. The graphics are vibrant and rich in detail, enhancing the already immersive experience. The vast draw distances and seamless transitions between different regions of the island are seamless, creating a truly seamless open-world environment.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 is an absolute triumph that takes open-world action to new heights. It embraces the chaos, offering players an adrenaline-fueled playground where they can unleash their wildest fantasies. With its breathtaking world, explosive combat, and boundless freedom, this game is a must-play for anyone seeking an unforgettable and relentlessly fun gaming experience. Brace yourself for an adventure that will keep you hooked from start to finish.",1689281583,1689281583,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Besides this, the game offered just the right amount of fun for me. It felt like an uncomplicated open-world sandbox shooter, which was a refreshing experience.

This was my first time playing a Just Cause game, and I found its model truly enjoyable.

The third entry in the franchise is pretty to look at and run smoothly too. The world map is big with varied environments spread across 3 main regions/ islands. There are a lot of activities or objectives to complete. From the very start you can approach and complete objectives in any way you like. Rico (player) is equipped with tools, vehicles, and weapons that you can access from beginning. There isn’t a mandatory character progression or upgrade system which you often expected in games like this. It’s great for people who wants to feel overpowered from the get-go. But, there is a demerit to this approach.
As a replacement for upgrades, there’s a “mod” system that you can unlock by completing challenges/side objectives. Mod is used to increase your inventories, upgrade your tools and effectiveness, etc. Sadly, you can’t unlock mod by progressing organically trough the main campaign. It doesn’t help that the gameplay loop start becoming stale pretty fast. Players are tasked to liberate outposts and strongholds spread across the map. These tasks are often similar with minimal variations to keep players engaged.
The main campaign itself is lackluster and forgettable like in previous entries. Avalanche devs tried to tie the setting and characters with Rico’s backstory to increase his personal stakes in the story. At the end of the day tough, players isn’t invested in the story. Mostly due to lack of connectivity between the tone of the story, gameplay structure, and characters’ goofy attitude.
Another issue I had with this game is the “always online/connected” policy. Avalanche & Square Enix tried to mitigate this requirement as a part of mandatory online ranking/leaderboard for challenges, side activities and co-op. The problem I had was that my internet connection was spotty and unreliable most of the time. So, it buggered me a lot when suddenly a message popped up that said the game is trying to re-connect while I tried to play or even opened the map.
The internet connection problem didn’t hindered my progression, tough. I could finished the main campaign. In the end, it is still a fun game if you can look past all the problems. And it’s super cheap too for AAA open world games if you buy it during steam sale.",1689136241,1689136241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ahora, en 2022, me lo pasé de nuevo, pero al 100% y con todos los logros. Es una bomba de diversión, horas y horas sin parar (a veces más de 700 minutos de una sola sentada hice).

Mucho contenido, explosiones y pueblos que liberar. Es un Just Cause, debes esperar que sea un poquitito repetitivo, pero la acción sandbox y las múltiples y diferentes maneras de jugar es lo que hace una experiencia distinta cada vez que lo juegas.

Totalmente recomendado, pillatelo con todos los DLC's (al menos los que no son cosmeticos), en especial de Sky Fortress, dado que te da un Wingsuit con propulsor, cohetes y ametralladora los cuales son muy útiles.

Corre muy bien en computadores de bajo-medio recursos. Muy buenos graficos para la época, solamente que tiene muuuy poquitos bugs o glitches, pero nada como Cyberpunk jajaja.

PD: Para la misión de salvar un avión con ""X"" personaje importante que está llegando a la isla (evito spoilers), desactiven el Gear MOD de una mira especial con el mouse (Ayuda de apuntado creo que se llama), luego de ello, reinicien el juego.

This game is [i]really[/i] fun. The freedom you get in exploring the world after unlocking the wingsuit in the beginning is insane. And the beautiful visuals make exploring that much more appealing. Using them in combat is also quite appealing, being able to zip through the skies and shoot rockets like a mosquito is extremely fun, so in that regard this game is a hug W.

Storywise, this game is eh... It's not the greatest writing i've ever seen and it does get a bit cliche at times. Thankfully the game doesn't take itself too seriously in regards to story, rather focusing more on the action and explosions... like any Michael Bay movie. It reminds me alot of the movie ""Hardcore"" where you can just turn your brain off and focus on the action and explosions. Eye candy essentially. 

What i really have i problem is with the enemies. With any game, the difficulty will increase the more you get into it, and so it makes sense to make the enemies shoot more accurately the farther in you go. However, it's so broken that the enemies rival the accuracy of TF2 aimbotters. You can literally be flying at 300 km/h and some group of soldiers with a combined iq of -2 will somehow snipe you out of the air in an instant.
But it's not just that, enemies that arrive after calling reinforcements will appear out of thin air if they're not in your line of sight. I swear, you can find a small enemy boat in the middle of the ocean and shooting it will somehow cause 2 boats with aimbot miniguns to appear out of Narnia. You can be attacking a base in a heli and suddenly get shot in the back by a heli which spawned like 10 meters behind you. You can fight people from one side of a tunnel and suddenly have a bunch of soldiers coming from both sides. It's like the cyberpunk police force, hit one and suddenly 20 appear out of nowhere with godlike accuracy. It is by far the most annoying mechanic i've ever seen in any game. And i hate how they didn't at least make it seamless

Honestly I love my open world games, but I like them to full of shit to do like in Far Cry 3 and 4, plenty of space to run around while also having plenty of things to keep the player occupied. Unfortunately Square Enix and Avalanche missed the mark with how open the world should be but still made it fun and enjoyable, hijacking tanks to turn it against hostiles, flying bombers that allow you to run a fade on some of the bases and outposts, an arsenal of weapons that would make the American military blush, memorable characters like Mario, Dimah, Theo, and Anika, with the two faced Sheldon returning once more to stir the pot, it feels and plays like a JC entry, sure it's buggy but the bugs I've found have allowed me to, surprisingly enough, become more immersed. An example I'll use is when assaulting Griphon, a plane that tried to take off crashed into a fuel tank simply because I was running along the runway and the pathfinding essentially panicked, another example was when taking Tridente, I had reprogrammed the SAM sites to take care of enemy air support which happened to be interceptors/fighters. the SAM's constant volley of missiles forced the pathfinding to once again panic. Two of the 5 jets crashed into each other, another slammed into a corvette, and the remaining 2 got shot down by the SAM's making it feel like an actual breakdown on the battlefield where the sole objective of the ai in those jets was to survive.

The title may be misleading because at this point I've played 7-8 hours or something, but here is my review!

This game is amazing. Eight years old, and I bought it on a wim for $3. Let me tell you, this is worth more than full price. The main draw is the destruction and gunplay, but the movement is one of my favorites ever (fr!). The vehicles are good (although turn sensitivity is way down?) and complaints about them just show that the player isn't used to them. 

The weapons are great, but my favorite pastime is planting bombs on bridges, waiting for the enemies to chase me over,  and sending them plummeting to their doom. Or that without enemies. 

The story is a big draw, and all the characters are well made and funny. The game will run well on a system from the last five years, but it is automatically set to 720p. The environments can seem tedious (similar scenery) but it's action packed.

Good game, but the ""specs"" you need to play this without it crashing or running poorly are very misleading.

Performance is very bad. See ""PERFORMANCE""

That said it is a fun game [i] when it works [/i] and I have more hours than Steam has logged. Yes, you know what to expect when someone says there is a discrepancy between the hours Steam is logging and how long they play the game: the game has some serious software flaws and you may be unlucky enough to encounter them!

But the upside is that I can play the game with my brother, and I can't be too hard on games that support co-op or multiplayer. Especially not when you can have a lot of fun! It's a shame that fun can get interrupted by a litany of bugs.

-- PERFORMANCE SECTION --

First off, I'd like to say I play this game at 2560x1080 (2560x1440 [1440P] is the reference resolution I use).

I can tell you this game runs mysteriously bad on better hardware like a GTX 1650, RX 480, 2060, etc. -- fact is that on max this game ain't play well with those cards that have less than 8GB VRAM and maybe ones that aren't recent.

 On all the GPUs mentioned above the framerate was inconsistent, there was terrible stuttering, and other issues that plagued the game. The performance is very, very bad if you have a lower-end GPU. I thought maybe it was just me, but if I am testing 6 different configs with GPUs under 6GB of VRAM and they all suck hard at playing the game, I think it's safe to conclude the performance and specs are misleading.

It's not until you get a GPU around the power of a RX 6600 that you can get a stutter-free experience with minimal frame drops (virtually none) suggesting it may be extremely poor VRAM handling. This game also needs a patch to fix some bugs, but it doesn't seem like the devs care or will ever update it so we gonna handle these issues without them.",1688508149,1688508149,True,1,0,0.507575750350952148,0,True,False,False

Even trying to manually rebind them using a keybind.txt file that they have in the system files doesn't work.  For example, if you rebind anything to Mouse2, you can't set remote explosives anymore.  
Not to mention, I felt like I was wrestling with the game every second.  Like on the wingsuit - you press left adjust your position.  Nothing happens.  You press it a little more.  It starts BARELY turning you to the left.  Then you suddenly lurch to the left, nearly rolling over, and you more or less fall out of the sky.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Halfway through, I was a happy camper and would have rated the game 80%, and planned to liberate all the regions. Then a couple of broken game mechanics came into focus and changed my mind.

As you get better at controlling the crazy movements you can accomplish with the grappling hook combined with the wingsuit, you become a target that's very hard to corner and hit for your enemies. As you progress through the game, the difficulty is obviously supposed to escalate. The devs apparently didn't have the brains to come up with anything better than giving your enemies 100% aimbot aim from any distance, regardless of what weapon they wield, along with an absolutely ridiculous spawn algorithm.

For instance, the split second you enter their awareness sphere, they can hit you from miles away with anti-aircraft guns, even though you're whizzing through the air in your wingsuit. You can run through a town fighting enemies on foot, but the instant there's a line of sight to an enemy warship a mile out at sea, it WILL hit you with a cannon.

But the overshadowing problem for me is the super-aggressive enemy spawn algorithm. Enemy soldiers and vehicles will spawn as close as 10 meters from you anywhere outside of your field of view where there is no obstructing object. You can be all alone, with nothing in your proximity apart from one soldier. As soon as he becomes aware of your presence, you'll get five aimbot soldiers right behind you, filling you with lead. You can look up to spot a chopper, and as you look back down to the ground, there are suddenly two jeeps and a tank full of soldiers right in front of you. I mean... COME. ON.!

One of the key elements for me in an FPS is having situational awareness - knowing where your enemies are and responding accordingly. That's absolutely worthless here! You end up hardly bothering to engage in gunfights and instead solely focus on quickly grappling yourself around the enemy bases and destroying the target buildings to accomplish the liberation objective. The gameplay loop became frustrating and unsatisfying for me.

Having lost enjoyment of the base liberation objectives, I took the straight route to finish the story campaign. What an underwhelming boss fight.

My overall verdict is 65% - I did get something like 10-15 very enjoyable hours of gaming here, but the second half of the playthrough was a chore.",1687886126,1687886173,True,50,6,0.785344064235687256,1,True,False,False

But sometimes it is a royal annoyance to play. When it works, you feel like a god of destruction, perfectly coordinated and able to take on any obstacle with infinite fun toys at your disposal. However, there are a lot of little frustrations that make this game unplayable sometimes.

-Slow controls. There is often a lot of lag in responding to input. Land in water with enemies firing at you? Well, you'll have to wait a moment and press for a second before you dive. Transitioning from a jump to firing to grappling just takes a little too long, so Rico feels less agile than in previous games.
-No controls: no crouching, sprinting, etc. Despite breaking out controls into categories (on foot, in plane, in helicopter) setting changes are global (I.E. you're stuck with the same weapons controls on plane, helicopter, and vehicle). Rico has less movement at his disposal, despite new features such as the wingsuit.
-Broken features. You can't use the large transport plane because it can't take off or land at most runways. Blow up said transport plane trying to use it? Prepare to wait 30 minutes to drop another. Some weapons with single-shot mags don't reload automatically.
-Grapple errors. Why does Rico get stuck on intermediate objects? Why can't you unstick yourself from a wall without taking 2 seconds to jump UP (I.E. just hop onto the ground if you're right above it)? Why does going straight to a grapple from parachute sometimes fail? Why is grappling on vehicles like the train so prone to error?
-Enemy AI. Enemies spawn endlessly, and without a good way to protect yourself and with awkward 3rd person combat mechanics, taking a base on foot often means suffering multiple deaths.",1669433914,1687729393,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This prompted me to move onto other games in the series, and at this moment of this review, (June 22nd, 2023,) I am playing JC2, and having just as much fun, if not more.

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

So let's first talk about the challenges. I have mixed feelings about some of the challenges. Some of them are very fun, while others are a huge pain in the ass (Laguna Blast). And like I said earlier, I got all the achievements, so I had to get five gears in all the challenges of the game.

Now let's talk about the gameplay. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. Fun. No, but seriously, this game is the most fun game that I've ever played. You can do anything in this game. It's even better if you play with friends with the multiplayer mod.

Now the story. I'll be honest, it kinda sucks.

-Beautiful and smooth open world
-Many various weapons, vehicles, and secrets/collectibles
-Decent if not cliche story
-Parachute
-Grappling hook
-Wingsuit
-Jetpack (w/ DLC)
-Pilotable mechs with punching arms (w/ DLC)
-The ability to tether things together at ever increasing velocity
-Grappling onto a moving jet and then skydiving off it as it explodes
-Explosions are really satisfying
-50+ hours in and i'm barely done

Cons: 
-Enemies are ridiculously accurate. It's broken to the point where not even gliding in a wingsuit/grappling to and fro is enough to dodge most enemy fire, and there is no cover/running/dodge/crouch mechanic to speak of, though why would you need that when you are basically a super hero, right? ...Eh. It gets really punishing, especially mid-late game where there are only enemies on roads and any mook that you can't kill fast enough will keep calling in reinforcements until the 5 star threat level is reached and all you wanna do is tether two baddies together at mach 3 for the laughs. It's a balance thing to compensate for the fact that you almost always have the advantage with the chaos you can cause, but sometimes it doesn't feel like it when you can barely stick a pinkie finger out from a corner before getting aimbotted to death no matter what you are doing.

-Half the vehicles in the game are inherently useless and a chore to even drive, such as motorcycles that slide all over the place and the awkward camera that leans with you when you turn, and this is perpetuated when the game forces you to use the crappy vehicles in the race challenges that rely solely on SPEED.

-Dead multiplayer

It's probably worth $20 despite those cons, still. I was late to the party, but I don't regret anything. It will keep you occupied for a good while if you're waiting for games like Cyperpunk 2077 or Baldur's Gate 3 to finally become playable, and even then, it's a solid game in it's own right; the best of the franchise.

I highly recommend this extremely replayable games. It is just pure chaos and fun run around and blow stuff up never felt so good it also helps that the enemy’s are pretty fascist goons really helps with you not feeling bad for blowing them up with a tank. If you’re deciding between this and the 4th i’d recommend to pick this one up. The 4th one kinda took all the fun from this game and that was blowing up bases and instead takes up a tile game. This game also goes on sale for like $5 every now and then and that makes it even better. 10/10 One of the best games i have ever played.

Review:

Just Cause 3 is a thrilling and action-packed open-world adventure that embraces chaos and offers players a sandbox of destruction and mayhem. With its expansive map, versatile gameplay mechanics, and explosive set pieces, it delivers an exhilarating experience that fans of the series have come to love.

One of the standout features of Just Cause 3 is the massive and beautifully realized world of Medici. The Mediterranean-inspired setting is a joy to explore, with diverse landscapes ranging from sun-soaked beaches to towering mountains. The sheer scale of the map, combined with a wide variety of vehicles and traversal options, ensures that players always have new adventures waiting around every corner.

The gameplay mechanics in Just Cause 3 are a true highlight. The protagonist Rico Rodriguez's signature grappling hook and wingsuit combo provide an unmatched sense of freedom and mobility. The ability to seamlessly traverse the environment, combine grappling hook tethers for creative stunts, and unleash chaos with an impressive arsenal of weapons and explosives is immensely satisfying.

The destructible environments in Just Cause 3 take the action to new heights. Blowing up bridges, toppling statues, and bringing down entire military bases offer a visceral and explosive experience. The game embraces the spirit of wanton destruction, allowing players to approach missions and challenges with a wide range of creative and destructive strategies.

The visual design of Just Cause 3 is vibrant and captivating, with lush environments and stunning vistas. The attention to detail in the world's architecture, foliage, and weather effects adds to the immersive experience. It's a visual treat to witness the chaos unfold amidst the picturesque landscapes of Medici.

While Just Cause 3 shines in terms of gameplay and visuals, the story and character development take a backseat. The narrative serves as a backdrop for the action rather than a driving force, and the characters often feel underdeveloped. However, this does not detract significantly from the enjoyment of the game, as the focus primarily lies on the explosive gameplay and open-world exploration.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 delivers an adrenaline-fueled experience that thrives on chaos and destruction. The vast open world, versatile gameplay mechanics, and explosive set pieces provide countless hours of thrilling entertainment. If you're looking for an action-packed adventure that encourages creative mayhem and offers a visually stunning playground, Just Cause 3 is the game for you. Prepare to unleash chaos and embark on an unforgettable journey through the explosive world of Medici.",1686687866,1686687866,True,7,1,0.615877091884613037,0,True,False,False

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

Just Cause 3 is a thrilling open-world action-adventure game that brings together a captivating story and an absolute blast of gameplay. From its explosive action sequences to its vast and beautiful landscapes, the game offers an exhilarating experience that will keep players hooked from start to finish.

One of the standout aspects of Just Cause 3 is the sheer amount of fun it delivers. The game places players in the shoes of Rico Rodriguez, a charismatic protagonist known for his audacious stunts and mastery of all things explosive. The freedom to wreak havoc and create chaos in the fictional Mediterranean island of Medici is unparalleled. Whether it's soaring through the air with the aid of Rico's iconic grappling hook and parachute combo or causing mayhem with a vast arsenal of weapons and vehicles, Just Cause 3 offers an abundance of creative and explosive possibilities.

The game's open-world environment is a playground for destruction, allowing players to engage in breathtaking stunts, daring vehicle chases, and intense gunfights. The mechanics of tethering objects together with the grappling hook provide endless opportunities for inventive and explosive action, making every encounter a unique and thrilling experience. The level of destruction and chaos players can unleash is simply awe-inspiring and contributes to the sheer joy and satisfaction derived from playing Just Cause 3.

While the gameplay alone would be enough to make this game stand out, Just Cause 3 also manages to weave an engaging and surprisingly compelling story into the experience. The narrative revolves around Rico's mission to liberate Medici from the oppressive rule of General Di Ravello. The story unfolds through a series of missions and cinematic sequences, and while it may not be the deepest or most profound narrative, it successfully keeps players invested in Rico's journey and provides enough motivation to keep pushing forward.

Furthermore, the voice acting and character development are commendable, adding depth to the world and creating a sense of attachment to the cast of characters Rico encounters throughout his adventure. The interactions and banter between characters inject moments of humor and humanity into the game, enhancing the overall experience and making it more memorable.

Visually, Just Cause 3 is stunning. The sprawling Mediterranean landscapes, picturesque coastal towns, and lush forests are beautifully rendered, creating a visually appealing backdrop for the chaos and destruction that unfolds. The attention to detail, combined with the game's vibrant color palette, contributes to an immersive and visually satisfying experience.

Just Cause 3 is an outstanding game that excels in both its gameplay and storytelling. Its ability to deliver exhilarating and explosive action is unmatched, providing players with endless hours of fun and excitement. The compelling story, combined with memorable characters and breathtaking visuals, further enhances the overall experience. With its perfect balance of chaos, freedom, and an engaging narrative, Just Cause 3 is an absolute must-play for fans of open-world games and action enthusiasts alike.",1579801542,1686510669,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Slow map navigation? -  wingsuit. Still too slow?  Rocket wingsuit
Tedious settlement clearing? -  fewer but larger and more complex settlements with clearing objectives marked on the map.

Boring small explosions? - Giant explosions, with lighting bloom
Pointless zipline attachment function? Now it can reel in and you can attach engine mines to stuff. Its wild.

Its not perfect though. There are some.....

As an avid gamer who appreciates both intense action sequences and the thrill of flight, Just Cause 3 was an absolute delight.

One of the standout features of this game is the seamless integration of action-packed gameplay with an open-world environment. The vast Mediterranean-inspired island of Medici serves as the backdrop for your daring escapades, and it's an absolute playground for mayhem. With a wide range of explosive weapons and gadgets at your disposal, you'll find countless opportunities to wreak havoc on military outposts, blow up bridges, and engage in thrilling vehicle chases.

However, it's the ability to take to the skies that truly sets Just Cause 3 apart from other action games. The introduction of the wing suit adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay, allowing you to effortlessly glide through the air, perform death-defying stunts, and execute precision attacks from above. The feeling of freedom as you navigate the stunning landscapes while performing incredible aerial acrobatics is simply unmatched.

The graphics in Just Cause 3 are nothing short of breathtaking. The lush, vibrant environments are filled with intricate details, from dense forests and shimmering lakes to sprawling cities and towering mountains. The attention to detail in both the landscapes and the character models is commendable, further immersing you in this explosive world.

While Just Cause 3 shines in terms of gameplay and visuals, it does have a few minor drawbacks. Occasionally, the frame rate can drop during intense moments with a lot of explosions and chaotic action, which can momentarily disrupt the otherwise smooth experience. Additionally, the story, while serviceable, may not be as engaging or memorable as some other aspects of the game.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 is a must-play for anyone who craves action and a thrilling flying experience. It successfully combines a vast open-world environment, explosive gameplay mechanics, and the exhilaration of flying, creating a truly immersive and unforgettable adventure. Despite a few minor technical hiccups and a somewhat forgettable story, the game's strengths easily outweigh its weaknesses. Strap on your wing suit, buckle up, and get ready to unleash chaos like never before in Just Cause 3.",1686021335,1686021335,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

As a player who craves adrenaline-pumping adventures, I have had a mixed experience with the game. While it delivers on its promise of chaotic fun and breathtaking stunts, it also suffers from some notable flaws that can detract from the overall enjoyment.

Let's start with the positive aspects of Just Cause 3. The game's vast open world is a playground for destruction and exploration. The sheer scale and variety of environments, from sprawling cities to breathtaking landscapes, create a sense of wonder and encourage exploration. The grapple hook and parachute mechanics provide a unique and enjoyable way to traverse the terrain, allowing for seamless transitions between soaring through the air and engaging in high-octane gunfights on the ground.

Additionally, Just Cause 3 offers a wide array of tools and vehicles to wreak havoc with, ranging from tanks and helicopters to boats and fighter jets. The freedom to approach missions and challenges in multiple ways gives players a sense of agency and encourages experimentation. The explosions, destruction, and over-the-top action set pieces create thrilling and memorable moments that can leave you on the edge of your seat.

However, it's important to address the game's shortcomings. Just Cause 3 suffers from notable performance issues and technical glitches, especially on lower-end systems. Framerate drops, occasional crashes, and long loading times can disrupt the immersion and hinder the overall experience. While these issues may not detract from the core gameplay, they are noticeable and can be frustrating.

Furthermore, the game's story and mission structure fall flat compared to its gameplay mechanics. The narrative feels generic and fails to engage on a deeper level. Missions often boil down to repetitive tasks that lack variety and fail to offer meaningful challenges. This lack of depth in the storytelling and mission design can leave players wanting more substance and purpose behind their actions.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 delivers on its promise of explosive chaos and moments of thrilling freedom. The open world, versatile mechanics, and breathtaking stunts create an exhilarating experience that can be immensely enjoyable. However, the game's technical issues and lackluster story and mission design are notable drawbacks that may diminish the overall experience. If you're seeking a wild and action-packed adventure, Just Cause 3 has plenty to offer, but be prepared for its shortcomings along the way.",1668022480,1685390239,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Duh.  I paid $30, half price for this game and feel I should have waited for a better sale. Better yet, I should have paid attention to the many negative reviews from my fellow gamers. What’s really sad is that somewhere hiding within is a great game. 

The gameplay mechanics are typical of console ports; they’re like threading a needle with a pair of plyers and a vise.  It's probably just me but I don’t recall JC2 being anywhere near this difficult to play.  For example, it’s too easy to end up in grappling hook h311 during those heavy action sequences.  During one of the missions, “Abandon Ship” the absurdly poor AI has the character “Mario,” whom the object is to protect, is out walking in the middle of the firefight waiting to get whacked. During this time you’re evading airstrikes, shooting down helicopters, etc.  You’re half a second from mission completion and wham, Mario dies …or worse the game’s well-documented memory leak takes hold and crashes the game completely.  Once that happens, the player is forced to replay the mission from the beginning since there is no built-in resume checkpoint feature.  Didn’t any of the developers test their product?  

The game's map is a couple steps up from useless.  The map should give the player all they need in terms of status, potential targets and so on.  Nope, the player is forced to turd hunt in order to ""discover"" said targets.  

I'll say it again, I should have paid attention to this game's less than stellar reviews.

My rig: built PC, Windows 10 Pro, i5-4690K, 16Gig Ram, GTX970, Gaming 7 MSI board.

Update: May 28, 2023.  

Here it is almost 7 years later and I just finished playing this game and everything I said above still holds.  I’m now up-voting the game since it cost $20 and it seems a decent price even with the well-documented runtime issues, i.e., he game still crashes randomly.  I ran the game with a 64 Gig, 8700K PC and had MSI Afterburner running.  I’m still running the same ole GTX 970.  I really didn’t see much evidence of a memory leak during a crash.  The event viewer of course says very little.  Usually the game would crash once and sometimes twice a session. 

I downloaded a buggy grapple hook mod that created as many problems as it solved.  I suggest buying this game, better on sale, but know ahead of time it can be frustrating and challenging due to crashes.",1472599579,1685281849,True,0,0,0.511002421379089355,0,True,False,False

The game is a lot of fun, and it's very easy to get lost in the world. The graphics are also very good, and the game runs smoothly on my PC.

Here are some of the things that I've enjoyed about Just Cause 3:

The open-world is massive and beautiful. There's so much to explore, and I've found myself getting lost in the world for hours on end.
The game-play is fun and varied. There's a lot of different things to do in the game, and I've never gotten bored.
The weapons and vehicles are awesome. There's a huge variety of weapons and vehicles to choose from, and they're all a lot of fun to use.
The destruction is satisfying. I love blowing things up in Just Cause 3, and the destruction is always satisfying.
The story is cheesy but enjoyable. The story is a bit cheesy, but it's still enjoyable. I've found myself laughing out loud at some of the dialogue.
Overall, I would highly recommend Just Cause 3 to anyone who enjoys open-world action-adventure games. It's a lot of fun to play, and it's sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.

Here are some additional thoughts that I have about the game:

The grappling hook is one of the best features in the game. It allows you to do all sorts of crazy things, like grapple onto a helicopter and then swing it into a building.
The wing-suit is also a lot of fun to use. It allows you to fly through the air and perform all sorts of stunts.
The game is very forgiving. If you make a mistake, you can usually just try again. This makes it a lot of fun to experiment with different things.
If you're looking for a game that will let you blow stuff up and have fun, then Just Cause 3 is definitely worth checking out.",1685205770,1685205770,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As the game is now, though, it is buggy in the extreme, with frequent graphical hitches. That's a shame, because otherwise it is a very beautiful game with beautiful explosions, but that doesn't mean a thing if the game will freeze up every few seconds.

Likewise, I remember the game being fun but now I'm asking myself why I ever thought that. Every base is the same, in essence. The only real differences being how many red themed volatile objects you need to obliterate before the game goes ""you win!"" The brief couple of hours I played recently were just...dull...which is an odd thing to say about a game where you fly around in a wingsuit attaching bombs to stuff.

Also, for gameplay issues, the pop in is disgusting. I've literally turned around and seen enemies manifest out of the ether, so I felt no shame whenever the game would surprise me with a sudden Tank/Helo/Gunboat assassination.

Finally, in the vein of gameplay...your character moves like garbage. You slow to a crawl on boats. You can drop from orbit and survive if you grapple to the ground but god forbid you hit a branch in your wingsuit. Most importantly, the grapple was problematic. It was as if I'd select where I want to grapple, but the game would decide that what I wanted  was whatever was in the way instead, which is kind of annoying, ramming feet first into gas cans in the middle of a firefight.

Glitches, inconsistent physics, offensive amounts of enemy pop-in and, most vitally, a lack of simple enjoyment. Like I said, I remember my first playthrough being enjoyable but, now? No. I was not having fun.",1685195556,1685196157,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Anyway, great game, solid 8.9/10. The amount of bases are just enough I believe, comparing to JC2 that had like 50 repetitive locations, the story missions offers a great range of challenges and minigames that makes the game very diverse, but it appears only in mission, so that's a bummer.

 The other challenges, like the wingsuit, destruction and race are a good addition too, contributing to the unique mechanic of getting perks for the reward.

The DLC adds more story, and more things to play with, such as mechs, jetwings, an OP boat. If you do pick up those DLC, I suggest you do it later, as it really makes the game (and its missions) easier to beat, unless you really want to speedrun this game, which I did lol

Overall, solid game and probably the best in this series (never played JC4, but judging by reviews, its not better). Pick up the XXL edition during a sale as it's very cheap for a quality 5 year+ game.",1684928602,1684929476,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a bunch of copy paste areas that you shoot like 6 guns in, kill the fuel tanks, and then go to the next copy paste area to kill more inanimate objects. You can parachute, and wing suit, and neither are very fun to use because the map isn't designed around them. Hell calling it designed is charitable.
It isn't even fun to blow shit up, because it has little impact on larger scale things. Like blowing up 50 antennas doesn't hinder their communications at all. But if you remove all the power boxes we tell you to, the enemies despawn in this area permanently, and are replaced with friendly reskins.

Even the idea of being in a revolution is weak. The dictator is comically evil. Every NPC calls you a savior, yes they use that word. You are compared to Christ whenever you walk down the street which you think would be funny but is so jarring, especially when I steal someones car and the say ""Have fun, Rico!"" as if I didn't just do grand theft auto on them. The revolution has 0 ideals. Like they're just ""revolution."" Fucking De Blob was more political. It's impossible to buy into or ignore, because it's constantly beaten onto your head.

I probably put more effort into this review that I'm making up on the spot than the devs that got given a week and one cup of water as a budget to make this fucking thing. And I'm only doing this to stay awake because it's 11am, and I WANNA HAVE A NORMAL BEDTIME DAMNIT!

The port to PC was clearly not given enough care, though, as there are still references to console features such as aim assist. There is also a bug that prevents homing missiles from actually homing when you have Precision Aim enabled.

The story is decent for what it's worth, about what you'd expect – it's not a major component of what makes the game interesting.

The gameplay manages to remain fun for entirety of the game. I thought it would have been fun for a bit and then become boring, but no.

The game looks great in my opinion, and I never saw an area that looked like it lacked detail.

I would definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you can get it on sale.",1561982257,1684619827,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is",1684498200,1684498200,True,1,0,0.485294133424758911,0,True,False,False

You get a rocket powered jetpack along with your wingsuit which totally changes the game in my opinion. Being able to fly around like a jet instead of grappling everywhere is just insane and totally transforms the way you traverse through the map, i could on forever, you have to try it for yourself. Oh and you get rockets and turrets attached to it too so have fun.

So, starting off, the core gameplay, explosions as they advertise, yes indeed. Liberating the settlements/provinces etc. Is so fun and hectic and so damn satisfying. Its the main thing you do in the game aside from the story (which i didnt really start til i liberated 95% of the map). Youll never get bored, especially if you get the rocket powered wingsuit which i cant stress enough. Youll find yourself going from settlement to settlement liberating them Just Cause its that much fun.

The story is good, nothing to write home about but Mario is good comedic relief. The missions are pretty fun though but not too many memorable characters besides the protagonist Rico and his best friend Mario.

I could go on forever but ill have to cut it short and just get the game, best one by far out of the whole series and especially 4. Oh and one last time, GET THE SKY FORTRESS DLC.",1684488702,1684488702,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My friend Praharsh recommend this game to me.
I tought nothing of it and just purchased it to just try it out. Oh Boy! this is more than just a game
this is a work of art
This has been one of the best games I've ever played.
The best part: The action never stops! even though repetitive, there are always more creative ways to kill your enemies.

If you are looking to play an action packed, explosive, story filled, single player.
Then this game is for you

Rating: ★★★★★

Just Cause 3 is an absolute triumph of open-world gaming that manages to raise the bar for the entire genre. From the moment I stepped foot into the sprawling island paradise of Medici, I was completely blown away by the sheer scale, freedom, and exhilaration that this game offers. It is an adrenaline-fueled adventure that kept me hooked from start to finish, leaving me with an insatiable hunger for more.

Let's start with the breathtaking visuals. The stunning landscapes of Medici are a sight to behold, ranging from sun-soaked beaches to towering snow-capped mountains. The attention to detail is exceptional, and the vibrant colors make every corner of the map come alive. Whether you're skydiving from an aircraft or speeding through the lush forests in a high-powered sports car, the visuals never fail to impress.

But Just Cause 3 isn't just about eye candy; it's about delivering pure, unadulterated fun. The gameplay mechanics are a pure joy to experience. The grappling hook and parachute combination is a stroke of genius, allowing you to effortlessly traverse the vast open world with an unmatched sense of freedom. The fluidity of movement and the ability to seamlessly switch between different gadgets and weapons make every encounter a sandbox of destruction and creativity.

Speaking of destruction, the chaos and mayhem that Just Cause 3 offers are nothing short of mind-blowing. The game grants you access to an awe-inspiring arsenal of explosive weaponry and vehicles, each designed to wreak havoc in its own unique way. Whether you're sending enemy bases crumbling to the ground with a well-placed rocket launcher or tethering objects together to create absurdly satisfying chain reactions, the possibilities for destruction are endless. Just Cause 3 rewards creativity and experimentation, and I found myself constantly discovering new and entertaining ways to obliterate everything in sight.

The missions and challenges are both varied and engaging. The main story missions strike a perfect balance between high-octane action and compelling storytelling, filled with memorable characters and plot twists that kept me invested in Rico Rodriguez's quest to liberate Medici from the oppressive regime. Side missions and challenges offer a fantastic distraction from the main storyline, providing a wealth of activities to partake in, from daring wingsuit races to liberating outposts with your own unique flair.

The audio design in Just Cause 3 is also worth applauding. The soundtrack perfectly complements the game's exhilarating gameplay, delivering an adrenaline-pumping experience that immerses you deeper into the chaos. From the rumble of explosions to the satisfying thump of gunfire, every sound effect feels satisfying and impactful, adding an extra layer of immersion to the overall experience.

Furthermore, the game offers exceptional replay value. Even after completing the main campaign and side missions, I found myself constantly revisiting Medici to experiment with new strategies, unlock hidden secrets, and engage in spontaneous bouts of destruction for the sheer thrill of it. The world of Just Cause 3 is so vast and rich with content that there is always something new to discover and enjoy.

In conclusion, Just Cause 3 is an extraordinary game that sets a new standard for open-world action and adventure. Its explosive gameplay, stunning visuals, and unmatched sense of freedom make for an unforgettable experience that will keep you entertained for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer to the franchise, Just Cause 3 is an absolute must-play. Strap on your wingsuit, buckle up in your favorite vehicle, and get ready for an adventure that will leave you exhilarated and begging for more.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is.",1684184508,1684184508,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The grapple hook, parachute, and new wingsuit are AMAZING. You feel like a mix of Spiderman, Batman, and a flying squirrel. Once you learn to cancel your grapplehook mid-pull to stay midair and readjust, and master the wingsuit's realistic weight and momentum, you feel amazing. The wingsuit is genuinely one of the best mobility options I've ever had the pleasure of controlling in a videogame.

There's many cars, scooters, helicopters, planes, and water vehicles to drive around (and eventually crash.) They handle MUCH better than GTA. 

The story isn't the main draw of the game, it's a bit ridiculous and cheesy, but I was actually kind of surprised by some of the characters and more serious scenes they managed pulled off. Rico is less cut-throat and more chill, love his new look. The dictator is a genuinely captivating presence with blunt and brutal tactics. Even the scientist lady, while your typical awkward bustling scientist, starts to grow on you and has a surprising conclusion. I was shocked to hear David Tennant as the compelled government propaganda radio host lol.

Only major criticism is we're missing some tactical options from Just Cause 2. There's no run, roll, or hanging onto cars, now you can only stand on top of them. It kinda sucks and makes combat feel less deep, but we now have better grappling and the wingsuit, so maybe that makes up for it. Not a deal breaker, but I do miss those options.

As well, the map isn't quite as good as Just Cause 2. JC2's map was a massive tropical continent with snowy mountains in the middle, a great city to the east, and a great desert to the south. JC3 has 2 island regions in the south, and a larger continent in the north, with small desert regions and snowy mountains within it. It's not as interconnected or varied as JC2's world was. Not saying JC3's is outright bad, but it's not ""as"" good. Just a small thing to be aware of. It's still plenty of space to rampage and fly around in.

If you have the chance to get JC3, the wingsuit and grapple are great!",1682358953,1683868176,True,14,0,0.653846144676208496,0,True,False,False

I think that Just Cause 3 is the best game yet in the franchise,
Many reasons like:
-Very interactive world.
-Gear mods
-Story was good, wouldn't say it was better than Just Cause 2's story, but good nonetheless.
-Rebel drop was a great feature as well.
-Best graphics in the series arguably.
-Many things to do after you complete the game.
-Loved the fact that you could fight and free regions as you went.
And many other things.
Cons:
-Fast travel was a nuisance, unlike Just Cause 2 where you could fast travel at anytime to any discovered locations, you had to have flares. You needed to unlock gear mods to get the number of flares up to 5, otherwise you could light up all rebel shrines to unlock infinite fast travel, which while a great feature is still a pretty big nuisance.
-Car handling was worse than GTA 4's car handling.

If you enjoy parts of games like Assasin's Creed where you conquer locations by attacking outposts, this is a great game. This is a perfect game for completionists because of how nice it is to obtain achievements. I played this for 50 hours within 2 weeks and it was amazing. Highly recommend. The only problem is that it is quite annoying to work with at times, and doesn't really make much sense.

Completionists note: Definitely recommend this if you are a completionist. It was so nice and fun to complete the game.

Keep in mind:

If you're on the fence about action games, this is IMO the best game to start with. The story is quite engaging and the charachters are well written, and for a game this old the graphics are stunning and even on my sub par PC can run the game at a smooth 60fps. The main point of the game is blowing stuff up and boy does it feel great. There is also a lot of vareity to destruction, you can shoot, grapple, Drive into things, Blow up with rocket launchers, grenade launchers, helicopters, tanks, bombs, mounted explosives and grenades. You can even call in an air strike* or shoot a god damn nukes at things*. The combat in this game is also really dynamic, and don't even get me started on the movement because that is the stuff. Of course as with everything there are flaws, some chalanges are unreasonably difficult requiring either extreme percition or luck (or both) to get the perfect score, but unless you are a masochist like me and you are trying to get the legendary 100% completion those challanges can just be skipped. The biggest issue IMO are the glitches, because this game is really bug infested for some reason, and likes to crash, although crashes are relatively rare (once every 10-20h on average for me). Most glithes don't affect the game but some straight up prevent you from doing certain missions. But in general despite it's flaws it's a great game. 9/10

+ mechanics of the parachute, wingsuit and grappling hook are great
- normal vehicles not as useful (apart from just messing around)
- control of the cars is finicky (especially bikes)
+ when it comes to guns and explosions, the game excels - lots to blow up along
+ difficulty from various kinds of enemies, ramps up well
+ plenty of challenges and collectibles to improve your skills in wingsuit flying, racing, etc.  in a natural way to train you to get better instead of just progressively adding features
? I beat the main story and most collectibles first time in 23 hours or so, not 100%. Granted, I am not one to free roam, and there is plenty of easter eggs and fun ways to mess around - giving plenty of extra hours of fun.

Story:
- at a surface level and at the beginning, it's hard to find depth to the story.
- comical, ridiculous style of the game makes you not expect much
+ lore building and themes come as you collect the dictator's audio tapes
- the final boss felt somewhat anticlimactic
+ good game progression

Graphics and Sound:
+ gorgeous game - one of the few games that not only impressed me technically but also aesthetically
+ pretty explosions
+ your character animations are especially smooth
- other characters' animations fall into average.
- LOD mesh and texture popping (there are good mods online that fix this)
+ sounds and music are great, fit the environment and tone well
- loading screens take a bit sometimes, playing with a solid-state drive is recommended

Saving: I added this section because it's one of the few things I legitimately got mad about in this game. It's an autosave that works in the background as you navigate and progress.  That aspect of it works great - unnoticeable. However, despite having great Internet, the game will PAUSE ITSELF to try to reattempt to sign in if it couldn't earlier (signing in to keep track of leaderboards, DRM, etc.).  It does give an option to try being offline for a while, but the next time you pause the game, it'll reattempt to sign in.  I think this wouldn't be as big of an issue if it was fast, but it can take 10-15s to attempt to sign in and save (and this happens every time you open the game). I ended up adding a firewall so it wouldn't attempt to save online, but of course that disables social leaderboards (I personally don't care with that, but some may).

Overall: very fun game with a gorgeous world to play around in.  It's one of the best sandbox games I've played.  Apart from a few graphics and saving issues, it's very satisfying to play.",1585798337,1683134311,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In these ways, this game is a shooter that forces you to not only shoot at enemy, but to do it strategically, from behind cover, from the safety of an armoured tank, or with lots of rebel buddies.

The game is the third installment in the Just Cause series and was released in 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. In this review, I will share my thoughts on the game based on my experience playing it.

First and foremost, the game's world is vast and beautiful. The Mediterranean island of Medici, where the game is set, is full of breathtaking landscapes, from sandy beaches to snowy mountains. The game's graphics are stunning, and the attention to detail is impressive. The world feels alive, and there is always something to discover, whether it's a hidden cave or a military base to liberate.

The gameplay is where Just Cause 3 truly shines. The player takes on the role of Rico Rodriguez, a skilled agent tasked with overthrowing the oppressive dictatorship of General Di Ravello. The game is all about causing chaos, and there are countless ways to do so. Rico is armed with a grappling hook and a wingsuit, which allow for incredible mobility and acrobatics. The player can attach the grappling hook to nearly any surface and use it to propel themselves forward or tether objects together, creating hilarious and explosive results.",1671110089,1682149170,True,1,0,0.504854321479797363,0,True,False,False

Do note, if you decide to pick up this game, it is VERY repetitive. Every Outpost, Base, Town; they all blend in together and rarely have distinguishing features between each other. Save for a few notable ones. Story is lackluster and predictable, trite even. Collectibles are extremely tedious as well, and I recommend you liberate an entire area before looking for them, or follow a guide. Rewards for most completions are lackluster as well. 

Where this game does shine is in the sandbox mechanics. You may be liberating tons of bases, but you can always do things a different way each time or playthrough. There's plenty of different paths you could go for each time you do liberate one. Helis, Jets, Tanks, ground vehicles; ect.. Destruction effects are satisfying as well.

Just Cause 3 is most certainly an addictive game that I would recommend to anyone who just wants to enjoy themselves in a fun open world by either: 

- Blowing stuff up
- Launching innocent bystanders off the edge of mountains 
- Planting rocket powered explosives on an animal's rear end
And/or do whatever else your imagination comes up with.

Now, YES, there are more than a few ""clunky"" gameplay elements. But no, they definitely should NOT ruin the entire experience for you. 

Ultimately, Just Cause 3 is a LOAD of fun. And, IF you can get it on sale for a few bucks, it's totally worth it. I truly believe that you'll have as much fun as I did, if not more. Just remember not to take this game too seriously though.

One of the biggest issues with the game is its repetitive gameplay. While the destruction mechanics and the open world environment initially seem exciting, it quickly becomes apparent that the missions and objectives are all very similar, offering little in the way of variety or challenge.

Another issue is its poor optimization for PC, causing frequent crashes, stuttering, and other technical issues. This can be extremely frustrating for players, especially when combined with the repetitive gameplay and lack of variety.

The story and characters are also lackluster, failing to engage the player and ultimately feeling forgettable. The dialogue is often cheesy and clichéd, and the voice acting can be grating at times.

Additionally, the game's AI is often buggy and unreliable, with enemies frequently behaving in illogical ways and making the game feel more frustrating than fun. The lack of any real difficulty curve also means that the game quickly becomes too easy and predictable.

Overall, while Just Cause 3 has some fun elements, such as the ability to create chaos and destruction in the game world, these are ultimately not enough to overcome the game's many flaws. The repetitive gameplay, technical issues, poor optimization, and lackluster story and characters all make for a frustrating and underwhelming gaming experience.",1605733252,1681691628,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Fast food has more substance. Porn has more depth. It's not a game that requires any special skill or presents you with any real role-playing elements. 

What this game is:
Beautiful, constant explosions, more over-the-top action than a 90's action movie, plenty of guns, lots of ammo, lots of wild means to create chaos, wild unearthly items, and lots of vehicular mayhem. 

Do you want to launch a tank through the air to attack an oil refinery? Check
Do you want to summon lightning from the sky to blow up a power plant? Check
Are you getting bored with fighting your enemies and just want to attach them to a nuclear missile instead? Check

While it is kind of lackluster without the expansions, if you get the expansions with it, it becomes what it was meant to be. It's not a game you walk away from reflecting on the story or characters. It is a game you walk away from looking out while civilization burns behind you saying ""That was fun.""

The story is entertaining, with plenty of over-the-top action sequences and memorable characters. But where Just Cause 3 really shines is in its sandbox gameplay.

The graphics are stunning, with bright colors and gorgeous vistas that make every moment of gameplay feel like a cinematic experience. And with a huge arsenal of weapons and gadgets at your disposal, you can approach every situation in a different way.

-Blowing up bridges with cars on them

-When a deer glitches onto the roof of a car that you're driving into the ocean and starts spazzing

-Your rebel pals will watch you kill their brethren while saying ""Yeah, Rico, keep up the good work!""

-A serviceable plot that isn't really necessary if you just want to cause

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him in the online mode. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and I cant wait to make future memories with my son.

Before we start, I've already sank at least 100 hours in this game on PS4 (playing the main story twice without DLC) and I've still had a blast.

However, warning to those who are easily irritated at the smallest programme error or feature then think its the worst game in the world. (Yes that person over there in the back. Get out. Now.) This game features many bugs. Not just that but also annoying features which may annoy some depending on your opinion.

(Listed below are features that the community has agreed to be annoying. Bugs will be listed as of my discovery)

Bad Features:
- Online Leaderboards. No you can't turn this off as far as i can tell, despite an offline mode existing when it randomly disconnects.
- Limited Rebel Drops (5 max). I don't understand what the issue is when there is plenty of resupply points all over the map. Especially at outposts.
- ""Tough"" driving. In contrast to JC2's driving, JC3's is very limiting as most cars have weight and cannot turn when driving at high speeds.

Bugs:
- Small dirt mounds on roads
- *Some* small cliffs in Insula Striate do not load in correctly
- Lock-on system for any weapons that use it does not lock-on half the time. Causing one mission in particular to be softlocked.

Now, for DLC.
As of playing this on the PC, this is my first time playing (and using) all of the DLC within JC3.
For simplicity, the 3 campaign DLCs (Air, Land and Sea) will be reviewed.

Sky Fortress -
The best out of the three. This includes a Bavarium Wingsuit which acts as a jetpack with built-in machine guns and rockets for Rico to wreak havoc on anyone he comes across. New drones, a whole new airship between Insula Fonte and Dracon which is INCREDIBLE to fly through and liberate. And a decent storyline to boot. Plus the now permanent (and fair) balance that SAM sites will lock onto you whenever the player uses the wingsuit. Its a shame the only negative in the DLC is that all of the bases (2 for airship and 2 mining outposts) cannot be Re-oppressed if you have completed the main story.

Bavarium Sea Heist -
The middle man of the DLCs, one that ticks all of the boxes for your stereotypical heist movie. A new OP boat with near-infinite boost, a set of sea platforms to the east of Insula Dracon to liberate and...
Well let's just say you wield the power of Thor by the end of the campaign.

Mech Land Assault -
The worst of the DLCs despite its introduction of OP mechs. A mediocre campaign with little to no tension that never hooks the viewer and annoying ass eDEN outposts to takeover (I'm not lying, you'll be ripping your hair out by the time you liberate ONE). Ironically, this (and the lore of the DLCs) hints directly at the 2018 sequel; Just Cause 4

There is plenty of fun to be had. Whilst the environment is rather bare in many ways and offers nothing of interest, it's fun to liberate bases, towns and think of creative ways to go about it. This is the heart of the gameplay beyond the fun of relaxing traversal with the wingsuit etc. 

I've found that when it comes to Just Cause, the way you have fun is by experimenting with new ways to go about the same task. Think outside the box and you'll have a lot of fun. For example, instead of shooting a weapon at one of the red tanks, drive a jet into it, or use the grappling hook tethers and smash something into it and so on. 

Whilst it's also fun and such to rain hell from above in the air, I've found that ground combat adds an additional challenge factor particularly if you use less powerful weapons against the enemy. So there is plenty of ways to enjoy the game and also add replayablility as well.

I do highly recommend the DLC content as it completes the game and really provides you with all you need to really make the most of what the game has to offer. You can still enjoy the game without it. But if you can get it all, I can say it's a wonderful addition and provides you with more ways to go about playing.

Don't expect much from the story, it's not what Just Cause is supposed to be about. The Sandbox aspect is where you'll have your fun. Map itself isn't what I'd call amazing. But overall it's a beautiful game. Love the ocean. Weather I found is not as pretty as Just Cause 2. There are no thunderstorms either sadly.

One of my favorite open world action games I've ever played

Steam Deck(some of these apply to the pc version):

Pros:
-Portable JC3
-if you have played this game on controller in the past its a very familiar feel.
-Your getting the full game experience
-The PC port is the definitive way to play this game and the steam deck version is the second most definitive way
Cons: 
-Performance is shaky(20-30 fps) in certain conditions on Low graphics especially on the games large island and in big military bases but can keep a solid 40 fps in most areas.
-The map is a little finicky and needs a patch
-Do not play this game with motion blur on, Especially on Steam Deck
-You need to be connected to the games online servers(DRM) once before entering the map

Conclusion: The game is really good but is in need of a steam deck patch/Definitive edition, also if you have a shakey/no  internet connection I recommend buying the game and its DLC on steam and then playing a pirated version of the game with DLC's as it skirts past the online functionality(do actually buy it as its a really good game and Embracier will hopefully fund more Just Cause games or a patch to this game in the future,)",1575231260,1679974570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The game's mechanics are great, with a grappling hook and wing suit that allow for unique and creative ways to traverse the environment and take down enemies. The game's story is also engaging, with a colorful cast of characters and over-the-top action set pieces that keep players on the edge of their seat.

Compared to the Far Cry franchise, Just Cause 3 offers a different kind of experience that is more focused on explosive action and destruction. The game's open world is massive and varied, with countless towns, bases, and landmarks to discover and liberate. Overall, Just Cause 3 is a must-play for fans of open-world action games, and it's a great challenger to the Far Cry franchise.",1678740080,1678740080,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The enemies never develop into anything other than a generic dictator and his army.  There's no sense of impending doom from them, no sense of a personal vendetta (the game tries for about 30 seconds to create one), there's no sense of anything, really.

Even with the plot, or lack of, the core gameplay has issues as well.  Movement and aiming is overly loose and you never truly feel like you have complete control over your character.  Everything simply feels off from grappling to aiming to driving.

So, yes, the explosions and wing suit will hold your interest at first, but soon you'll realize that you're basically doing the exact same things over and over to help characters you don't care about crush an evil leader you don't care about.  There's nothing here besides gliding and shooting things until they blow up and then you move on to the next location to do the same thing there.

Still pretty rough around the edges at times and if you have AMD hardware or certain Nvidia cards you'll need to do some tinkering to get textures and even terrain to function right.

If you are lucky enough to NOT have those problems the game works pretty well most of the time.

Just Cause 3 is like many 3rd entries into series full of technical wonders and very fun toys. The devs over time have found what works and cut away what doesn't (for the most part). Rico usually feels responsive and easy to control if sometimes a little slow or stilted.
Namely you'll find yourself wishing he would move faster during some of his animations such as deploying the chute or when he decides to take a 5 minute nap after tripping on a rock.

on the topic of controls key board and mouse works fine but i've always liked 3rd person with a controller and while they did manage to map everything to the controller some of the choices feel...odd like using X and B (or Circle and square) to steer the rudder on planes. Sounds ok on paper but in practice takes a great deal of getting used to.

Vehicle physics in general feel a little silly, land vehicles seem to lose mass when they get airborne which makes for some funny visuals. Flying vehicles and watercraft feel fine though on the topic of transportation vehicles feel almost like a afterthought in this entry due to the tether winch, wingsuit, parachute and (if you got the DLC) jet pack giving you more options for getting around on foot than you can shake a stick at. Its not uncommon for you to end up traveling 10 clicks without stepping foot inside a vehicle and when you get a nice wingsuit run going its really fun.

Shooting feels as lackluster as it always has in the franchise. a small handful of weapons feel tight and powerful but the rest feel like clutter that you'll rarely ever use. Shotguns seem to only exist to help the enemy as when you use them they only work inside the torso of another enemy but when a guy from 2 miles away hits you with a single pellet you'll stagger.

The biggest problem you'll encounter in this title is when in the heat of combat some random piece of debris will hit you and make you slowly ragdoll to the ground, flail and then slowly get back up all the while you are most certainly being shot from a dozen sources, its obnoxious sometimes but once you've got some options of heavy duty vehicles to call in itll become just a minor annoyance.

There's a bunch of DLC for this game some of which is pretty cool but the Devs seemed WAY more interested in getting said DLC out rather than fixing and optimizing the game. Several years later with the game patched and in a good working state its a non-issue now but those of us who played shortly after release will remember the pain.

The story is blah, but this series isn't known for its spectacular story and writing (our hero says ""FUCK YOU MISSILE"" at one point.) Its serviceable sure but is mostly just a excuse to set up situations like jumping from a jet to a prop plane or riding a ICBM to defuse it as it enters the lower atmosphere.

If you want some fun action and lots of explosions this is probably the most interesting entry into the series, its fixed, it works and is fun to play. Grab it and all its DLC in a bundle when its on sale sometime.",1471419676,1677948451,True,0,0,0.526243388652801514,0,True,False,False

As I walked towards the restroom, I heard a strange noise coming from one of the stalls. It sounded like someone was struggling to break free. Curious, I pushed open the door to find a man grinding furiously out of the toilet. Without missing a beat, he stood up and walked out of the stall.

To my shock, the man then approached a nearby military tank and began to bottle flip with impressive accuracy. The tank's crew was so surprised that they exited the vehicle to watch the man's feat.

But the man's incredible display of bottle flipping was not just for entertainment. Suddenly, a group of terrorists attacked the rest stop, firing shots and throwing explosives. Without hesitation, the man used his bottle flipping skills to knock out the terrorists and save the day.

I watched in awe as the man calmly walked away from the scene, as if it was just another day in his life. I knew I had just witnessed something truly extraordinary, and I couldn't wait to share the story with my friends and family.",1677867256,1677867256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I mean who doesn't love loud explosions on a daily basis? (the amount of explosions may vary depending on how lunatic you can be)


+What about flying mechanics?
-Even a bird cannot fly this well, Nice job, 3-pointer to the devs. (if the birds have a wingsuit then proceed to ignore this one)

+Fast cars that roar?
-You got it. (your average racing experience on a budget)

+Aerial vehicles?
-Might take some time to get used to them but it's worth your patience.

+Gravity?
-Screw gravity! (proceeds to launch himself with a wingsuit and a grappling hook)

And do not forget that if you happen to run out of ammunition, YOU are the ammunition.

Warning to the dear readers: Do not be surprised if you die in a random explosion that happens next to you. Remember that you are playing Just Cause 3. Anything can explode.

But vehicle control is horrible for motorcycles, cars start to smoke on 3rd impact, explode on 5th, which is especially stupid for armored ones. No option to repair them, so fast driving is not fun - your car will explode in a couple of minutes and you will be left in the middle of nowhere. All but maybe 2-3 cars are boring to ride (either too slow or ridiculous steering). 

Combat is meh due to your and enemies auto-aiming. Weapon choice is limited, so you get used to them within a couple of hours.

Taking bases is unfortunately also gets boring quickly. It's always the same strategy - grenades for machine gunners (or you're dead), assault rifle for everyone else (not to run out of ammo). Helis and planes are mostly useless, as they always lose to SAMs (anti-air rocket launchers). And there is a ton of them on each,  so by the time you disabled all of them - you also cleared the base. Some bugs like rebels not boarding vehicle which says ""accommodates up to 12 rebels"" means you cannot bring a small army with you.

The game's mechanics allow you to use a wide range of weapons, vehicles, and gadgets to wreak havoc on the island, from skydiving and parachuting to driving fast cars and flying planes.

Just Cause 3 is a fantastic open-world action game that is the pinnacle of the Just Cause series. Developed by Avalanche Studios, the game takes place on the fictional Mediterranean island of Medici, where the player takes on the role of Rico Rodriguez, a skilled agent of chaos on a mission to liberate his homeland from the tyrannical rule of General Di Ravello.


[h1][b]Gameplay review - 9/10[/b][/h1]
The gameplay in Just Cause 3 is a blast. The game offers a massive open-world environment filled with a plethora of vehicles, weapons, and gadgets to cause destruction with. The core gameplay loop of liberating towns and bases is engaging, with a variety of approaches to each scenario. The standout mechanics of the game are the grappling hook and wingsuit, which provide an unparalleled level of freedom and mobility. Players can use the grappling hook to tether objects and enemies together or use it to attach themselves to buildings and launch themselves into the air. The wingsuit allows for seamless transitions between the grappling hook and gliding, allowing for endless creativity in traversing the game world.


[h1][b]Graphics review - 9/10[/b][/h1]
The graphics in Just Cause 3 are stunning. The game's tropical setting and the vibrant color palette make the game world come to life. Explosions and destruction effects look fantastic, and the attention to detail in the environment is impressive. However, the game does suffer from some performance issues on consoles, with occasional drops in frame rates and long load times.


[h1][b]Final review - 9/10[/b][/h1]
Just Cause 3 is an excellent game that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys open-world action games. The gameplay is engaging and provides endless opportunities for destruction and creativity. The graphics are stunning and immersive, but the game does have some performance issues on consoles. Despite its flaws, Just Cause 3 is a must-play for anyone who wants to experience the ultimate sandbox of destruction.

Third part was awesome, it had some nice details, gameplay, but it also had lots of problems, even today and when I googled it, it was years old, they just dont care to fix. Nothing major, but some stuff was pretty annoying.
Random mission around the world to unlock sanctuary etc, not working. Audio in some story missions doesnt work, also had problems with features like auto-aim on rockets or reloading a weapon. It happened after few hours of playing, I guess too much memory, simple restart fixed that.
Motorcycle driving, worst there is.
When you complete side mission, get gears, oh my god, the time you have to wait till you can press continue is extremely long.
Some challenges are broken, like driving a rigged car. When you jump out, the car will explode before hitting anything, it will hit an invisible war and its almost impossible to finish. On the other hand, some challenges were extremely easy, no challenge at all.
Too many cutscenes .. long loading, the game cant properly use all the hardware. My PC is pretty good, can run anything there is, it still took kinda long for my taste. Which reminds me, draw distance, too low. All the trees, buildings, cars, loading like 100 meters ahead of you, extremely annoying in oper world game where you can fly. When clear the whole map, destroy everything, you can still see those objects from afar, but when you come close, it will disappear because you already destroyed it, lazy.
And what I hated most in cutscenes, after every scene, Rico turns and shows you his back and just standing there. It gets annyoing after 2nd time.
Some missing option, you have car auto camera adjustment, but no wingsuiting, just lazy.
When you finish game, you cant skip credits, almost 10 minutes wasted lifetime, grrr.

Just Cause 3[/h1]
Pros:
1. Explosions
2. Incredible destruction (many things including bridges are destructible)
3. Huge open world
4. Tethering things to buildings and flinging them off is fun fun as hell
5. Traversal is exhilarating
6. Colourful graphics
7. Allows for many fun and creative gameplay. You have mechs, nuclear launchers and all. You can pull off stunts
8. Large variety of vehicles to have fun with

Cons:
1. Can get repetitive
2. Mediocre performance
3. The world is huge but looks almost the same from start to finish
4. Dumbass car driving mechanics
5. The cars just blows up the moment you leave the car, which is freaking frustrating in Crash Bombs challenges
6. The aftermath of destruction is underwhelming (Many debris just disappears after hitting the ground)
7. No Steam Cloud (if you delete your save file you are basically fucked)
8. Collectibles? Why?
9. Weapons are limited
10. Laguna Blast can go to hell

Although there are many shortcomings, I enjoyed this game a lot. You can tell by me spending 165 hours on this game. With the recent reveal of JC4 (my most anticipated game of the year), I hope that most of these issues are fixed.

Firstly, it clearly suffers from being designed for consoles. You can't edit the FOV or edit controls at all. Things that I would absolutely expect in any PC game.

Secondly, the plot sucks so bad. You are ""liberating"" a chain of islands. How are you liberating it? By destroying pretty much everything. Literally the more you destroy, the better. If the game could at least acknowledge how ridiculous this is, I might be more willing to give it a pass... but it presents you as a ""heroic savior"" narrative. Every NPC you talk to can't stop talking about how great and heroic you are. But you aren't. You're just some dumb idiot with big guns. A game like this should go one of two ways, pick either:
- Lean hard into the dumbness of it all and don't even pretend to have a plot. If you must have a plot make it as unobtrusive as possible.
- Actually engage with the topic with some seriousness. Make the player thoughtful about their destruction by recognizing that some things shouldn't be destroyed. Maybe penalize the player for carpet bombing civilian settlements. Maybe present at least one NPC which is sincerely critical of mass destruction. Otherwise the whole thing comes off like ""Terrorist Simulator"".

If you really do just want to switch off and blow up a lot of things, sure, maybe you'll have some fun with this. But it's all terribly superficial and senseless.",1676411683,1676411683,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

1. Square Enix requires you to log into their servers for a singleplayer only game. There's no multiplayer, no being in the same ""lobby"" with other people like some of the Need For Speed games, you are just in singleplayer the ENTIRE time. It is absolutely redundant when the game can just be played without wifi. It even wastes a whole 60-90 seconds each time going into the game, so you just have to sit there. It also means when Square Enix inevitably shuts down the servers for JC3, this game will likely be DOA. 

2. Using the grappler half the time is just a straight up mess, especially when trying to climb up a mountain. Half the time when you reach your destination, you slip off and have to grapple again (and sometimes also jump depending on what you're trying to grapple to), which just makes for a mess when traversing through places and you don't have one of the Rebel Drop flares. Grappling onto other things above you have a similar experience depending on what you are grappling towards, so grappling all around is mid at best.

3. Precision Aim can only be acquired if you get enough mini-challenge gears to unlock it, which I find incredibly dumb. Games like Saints Row, which are also third person shooters, have precision aim straight out of the box. It should've been the same way here. In addition, they don't even bind it to LT - which has nothing mapped to it - and instead makes you push down the right stick for some reason. I guess you could maybe re-map that to LT (I didn't try) if the game allows, but I still find it incredibly bizarre considering LT was just not used in shooting controls. 

4. Load times are kinda bad, even today on modern SSDs. I did all of my playthrough on my Steam Deck (512 GB model, didn't change the SSD). The load times were about 60-90 seconds, and it didn't even look like they started in the cutscenes. I can understand not getting it fully loaded in time since the cutscenes are kinda short most of the time, but it doesn't seem like they load during the cutscenes, which just adds way more time to waste in between missions. Maybe you can boil it down to poor SSD optimization, but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it's more of Square Enix's time wasting. 

5. The final boss battle against Di Ravello was kind of overpowered. Going into it I would say that I had most if not all of my original ammo, and when I got his helicopter down to about 30% health, I was starting to run out of all of my ammo, including my RPG. On my first attempt, I ran out of ammo and died because I had zero clue what I was supposed to do after I ran out, because it's not like I could grapple under Di Ravello's helicopter the entire time since he had the Bavarium Shield (Which, by the way, felt like it only went down for like 3 seconds and went back up for that first 2/3rds of the boss fight. It got better as the fight went on). Thankfully I realized that I had a rebel drop and I was able to use it, however, if the boss fight lasted for 5-10 more minutes, I would've run out of all the ammo I had gotten from the Rebel Drop, and then I would be utterly screwed. It also didn't help that there didn't seem to be any mini-challenges to upgrade your ammo capacity, or else it wouldn't be as much if at all an issue.


Frankly, the only pro of this game was the story. It was bearable enough for me to keep playing through this.


P.S. This isn't part of the reason why I gave the game a downvote, but HLTB (How Long To Beat, a website that lists how long it takes to beat games) via a Deckyloader plugin said that the game takes 18 hours for the main story. It took me approximately 44 hours, which I'd imagine 3-5 of those could equate to how much time it took for me to keep going after dying or doing very few of the mini-challenges to unlock some tether and precision aim upgrades. Essentially it took me roughly 38 hours give or take to beat the game, so do with that information what you will.",1676278275,1676318505,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

But you have to play for 20 hours before you get some basic quality of life upgrades like being able to chain grapple hooks before the full pull is complete, or grappling from the wingsuit. Because the core mechanics are unlocked right at the start, it makes the upgrades a lot less exciting. Not to mention the upgrades are really just things that should be in from the start. Like fast traveling - it works on a consumable. But you can get more of them after a lot of gameplay. Though the fastest way to restock them is usually to just close the game and re-open. The stupidest upgrade is the ability to slow and roll out of the wingsuit, because before that you have to open the parachute then close the parachute to land. Just terrible decisions to lock basic QoL upgrades behind tons of hours of gameplay.

Few things that really bother me about movement is that you can't return to an aerial free-fall after using the parachute, wingsuit, or grapple. I would love to fling myself through the air ragdoll style and take advantage of physics, but once you deploy a movement mechanic you can no longer free-fall. Another serious issue is that you cannot turn off camera auto-centering for the wingsuit. You can do it for all vehicles but not the wingsuit. So if you're using the jetpack wingsuit, flying over a town, looking for an objective, your camera will constantly keep pulling upwards.

The game is a destruction focused open world. But there are only like 20 weapons in the whole game. There are more non-combat vehicles than there are weapons. Moreso, the vehicles handle really poorly. Every base has automatic surface-to-air missle sites that will automatically target you in an aerial vehicle, even if there is no combat engagement. They will also target you immediately in the wingsuit, but they cannot target you in the parachute?

The DLCs are really weird. Usually a game's DLCs come with gameplay content, but here they are really just giving you a single gimmick that should be in the base game. One DLC has a jetpack that works with the wingsuit, the other an infinite ammo heavy weapon that calls down lightning strikes, the other gets you mechsuits. Each of the DLCs can be completed in under an hour, the cutscenes are animated still images with voice overlaid, have interesting locations but are over so quick.

There are so many bugs in the game. In fact I couldn't even play the entire 3rd act of the campaign because you are supposed to follow/protect an ally plane. When it breaks out of the cutscene, I am 2km away and can only go 350khp, enemy jets are flying past me at twice the speed to kill the ally. They take him down before I even get to 1km away. I tried exiting the plane and grappling to a faster enemy jet, but it fails the mission because I left my jet.

All in all, the game has some really interesting ideas, a well crafted open world, but poorly executed movement systems, progression, vehicles, and gameplay loop. You will not experience anything new after the first hour.",1676223218,1676229589,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Your grappling hook, parachute and wingsuit help you move around the island so you can destroy things quicker with your expansive arsenal of weapons and vehicles. If that got you interested, get this game on a big fat sale.
I really wish I could give this game the most neutral score possible. Not because it is bad, but because what I described is what you do in the previous games, and at least the second one does them much better.

[i]TL;DR at the bottom, lots of complaining incoming.[/i]

The core loop is there and it's even improved. Going around the island is much quicker thanks to new and improved movement options, between the wingsuit adding a method to go faster horizontally and the slingshot ability to add further specialized movement. Destructive elements are more sturdy but can be quickly destroyed by hitting a specific weakpoint that you have to find yourself, sometimes behind a gate or by destroying a specific part. Activities like races, going through rings or destroying things now have a reason to be completed, being what unlocks new powerful abilities.

And I think that's where I run out of positive things to say about the game.

Locking character progression behind doing races and stuff is boring, especially because cars in this game SUCK. I cannot believe they were almost boasting about getting ""Criterion Games"" developers (from Need for Speed fame) to do vehicles, and they end up feeling the worst in the franchise. They have a weird ""weight"", like if Rico was actually handling the steering wheel inside the car, and like he needs to fully turn it to neutral before turning to the other side quickly. Cars are also made of paper mache, both because they lift into the air at the smallest bump and also because of how quick they explode over the smallest crash. Bikes are no different and this problem is visible, turning to one side physically rotates the bike and the character leans to that side, and so to be able to quickly turn to the other side they first need to lean back to neutral position, and then lean to the other side, making the action have a weird delay and like you're lacking control over what you're driving. This game didn't need realistic driving. I can't believe the most shared tip to complete a specific difficult bike race in the game is ""Spawn a car before starting the race, then ride the car instead of the bike"".

Storywise it starts somewhat interesting, Rico coming back to his home country and fighting over freeing his old friends, and hearing his origin story, and having conflicting decisions over who to trust. And it very quickly drops the ball, introducing reoccurring characters with no influence in the story, making conflicts be quickly resolved with no afterthought, making super weird plot decisions that no sane human being would actually do... they said they wanted to make the story more serious compared to JC2, and I don't think it worked out for them. The villain felt actually threatening, sure, more cunning and smart, but he didn't have the power or weaponry like Baby Panay in JC2 to back it up. [i]I literally two shot the dude in the final fight.[/i]

And for a quickfire round for random problems I have with the game:
[list]
[*]WHY DO YOU BLOCK SUCH A BASIC THING LIKE [u]AIMING[/u] BEHIND PROGRESSION?!?!?!
[*]Why is the best handling, heaviest, most durable car in the game an F1 car.
[*]I understand that for explosive challenges I am driving an explosive car, but could it not blow up at the smallest bump in the road? People are calling these missions [i]bugged[/i] everywhere else when searching how to complete them.
[*]Why is turning with a plane bound to Z and C, and I'm unable to rebind it to something sane like Q or E because E ejects me from the plane with no way to rebind that. At least I got to use my controller I guess.
[*]Why do homing missiles on my fighter jet stop working for the entirety of the play session if I decided to AIM DOWNSIGHTS with my weapon ON FOOT at any point before?
[*]Why is my camera so far up my ass, and no FOV slider? I need a third party program to be able to edit it every single time I ran the game, it's honestly uncomfortable, and while it was close to the player in JC2 it was still at a more comfortable distance than now.
[*]The minimalist HUD, probably intended to have less things on screen while you fly around, really plays against you. No way to track health, no way to track oxygen for the 3 times in the entire game that you need to go on water, randomly getting two shot because I didn't hear that the only indication of my health, a heartbeat sound which was drowned by gunfire, hadn't completely faded out, which meant I was still regenerating health.
[*]Was my soundtrack bugged? I see the game has over 20 songs, but it felt like the same 3 played all the time, and it forced me to just mute the music about 30 hours in. I'm honestly playing some of these songs on Youtube and I have never heard them ingame.
[*]Why is Denuvo still in this game 7 years after being released. Why do I need to confirm I still own the game every week. Please Square Enix.
[*]After about 2-3 hours the game starts to break down on me. Particle effects stretch across my screen, models start stretching weirdly, low poly models don't unload; my GPU isn't running hot enough to cause this and the problems have persisted through driver updates.

Also to note, I almost immediately blocked this game from my firewall, and installed a ""Skip Intros"" mod. Doing both massively speeds up the game boot up time from over 3 minutes down to like 20 seconds at worst. The only multiplayer element in the game is Leaderboards so I really see no reason to have online activated. And disabling it [b]improved my game performance[/b].... what?

The only thing I'm missing to complete is the DLC, and I will update this review when I finish them.

I'm very critical over this game because I like the franchise. I like having this big fat ""Ubisoft open world"" map that I can quickly traverse across and cause chaos just because xd. Having them regress so much after a successful attempt, with no one catching it or recommending changes is baffling to me. I understand it was a ""team B"" developing this game while the ""A team"" developed Mad Max, but were they so far up theirs thinking that they were able to create a better game than the other team and just completely ignored all feedback, or even worse, thought that the game was fine? Did Squeenix force them to just launch the game as it was, but they weren't able to release bugfixes or changes to make the game feel better? I honestly need a post-mortem of this game, hell even the franchise in general, where did it go wrong?.

[u]TL;DR:[/u] If you like shooting things that explode and cool fast movement systems and don't care for story, get this game on a big sale. It's a great experience for those factors  I myself wouldn't recommend it to people coming from Just Cause 2 because it's honestly so rough seeing these changes. But it's not a bad, unfinished game, it just has weird changes, and maybe you can live with them. If so, hope you have fun.

Downside is repetitiveness - not much of a story to speak of and god-like ability of the main character makes the game-play feel like chore very soon as you go through enormous map and ""liberate"" one settlement after another again and again and again restroying the same objects scattered around similar bases, strike from heaven, nothing can harm you nothing can stop you. I'd appreciate a bit more challenge. A reason to cover a little in the fight or be forced to think about how to approach the base, because now you can just drop in the base packed with tanks, choppers, soldiers, sentries and just break it all without even minding the soldiers.
The mini-games (skydiving, racing) pose a nice challenge and there's a lot of things to be collected and various records to be set (although I feel like all of those have been broken by modders - it shows you who was better and no matter how you try every record is set several magnitudes higher than the game realistically allows)

BIG downside is poor PC optimization. All the controls are clearly meant for game-pad which results in motorbikes and cars having really strange turn gradient making especially the bikes nearly unusable. Key layout is the weirdest I ever encountered and if you change it for one type of vehicle, it changes for other too. Like you want to change plane controlls to wasd and arrows (instead of wasd zc shift ctrl (!)) but then you jump in the mech and cannot go straight. So you change it for the mech and then the helicopter shoots boosts with the same button etc etc... so you either 
a) change key settings every time you get in a vehicle
b) accept the game settings and grow an extra pair of fingers from your palm
c) connect game-pad (which would be great if I was able to aim with it)
Also every time you minimaze the game it goes to window view",1675507671,1676023328,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Giant map and the game dev love making you loose your time for a 10 sec cutscene. They get you to drive for 5 min straigh to end a mission just because they've decided that to end the mission you need to do 8km for nothin.

[h1] The Game [/h1]
Bring chaos in this open world action game where weapons, vehicles and gadgets at your disposal. 

[h1] The Achievements [/h1]
The achievements are everything that a open world ""should"" have: challenges, collectibles and missions. Only a few where you have to beat a friends score but can be done fairly easily enough. DLC required, completion depends on skill and can be done in 60-70 hours. Guide is available.

[h1] Recommendation [/h1]
A truly open world experience where you can go wherever you want and complete whatever you want (after progression of course). Even with the DLC requirement the game is great for a more explorative open world game. A good recommendation.",1674758614,1674758959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the explosion physics and the and the way you can combine different mechanics to travel like using the wingsuit and paraglider. The amount of freedom in this game is also amazing, either you can just free-roam and hyjack helicopters, planes, cars and boats or you can do the different challenges you get by liberating different outposts and villages. 

Although thats all great and all the story is a bit wack, it just seems rushed and poorly worked on and you will have to do it in order to liberate all of the outposts because some missions disable the airstrike and nuke fow.

first of all the random lag spikes that randomly occurred. i even set the graphics to the lowest level that were allowed and it still had lag spikes for no reason. even tho my pc can run GTA 5, which is a much more graphically intense game, at 60 frames per second without any lag spikes. but a 30 gigabite game? nah, to much to handle. and GTA 5 is over 100 gigabites. (and still runs perfectly smooth) even the opening logo's have lag, how the fuck can a video, cause lag?
Second of all the uncontrollable car controlls. now yes, i know that its not really supposed to make sense, but  one time the car controlls were so bad that i could not get 5 gears on a challenge just because of the stupidly difficult car controlls. and thats when you're driving at high speeds, at slow speeds, hit a car and it will look like you had a very bad car crash.
Third of all, the destructible rocks on the map. when you drive insanely slow, they break into pieces. but when you drive very fast and hit it, you will lose complete control of the car and the rock is not damaged at all. (not the mountain rocks, but the traffic objects in town's)
my conclusion is that the developers just dind't bother to actually fix any of this.
good job guys, appreciate it.

----original review starts here----

This game has a LOT of issues. Seeing as it's in the sale and there will be a lot of people considering buying it, I feel like I should outline the issues. TL;DR and specs at the bottom.

- Performance, it varies from person to person but personally I have a medium/high-end gaming rig and still get stuttering and frame drops. I get smoother framerates on games with more graphic fedelity. On consoles it's the same story, constant frame rate drops.

- There's a memory leak issue that is yet to be fixed. Instead of fixing the issue, the devs just raised the minimum RAM requirement from 8GB to 16GB and added a message for every time you boot up the game telling you that you have insufficient memory. Apparently getting more RAM actually fixes a lot of performance issues with the game, go figure.

- The car handling in this game is so, so, bad. People says that Just Cause 2's handling was bad, but that game is a shining light of glory compared to JC3's habdling. And then just wait until you try a motorbike. The turning is horrid, it feels like you have no control sometimes. You hold down the button or move the stick to turn and there's a delay of about 1 second until your bike actually starts turning.  It's so easy to make them spin out and / or flip. Again, when the devs were questioned about this, they literally said ""We think it's fine!"" (can't find the link to the tweet but I'm sure it's out there).

- There's no native way to change the FOV. There's mods that let you do so but then when you do change it a whole bunch of glitches appear, like terrain not rendering, animations ending, etc. I usually wouldn't mind, but the default FOV is so low to begin with, try driving a car, it's right up in your face and you can barely see past it. 

- Missions are creative until you realise that a lot of them are the same being repeated multiple times. Story is boring, I ended up ignoring it and just fucking around. Plus, at least for me, destroying bases got boring after a while because there's so god damn many. Just Cause 2 did the whole ""Chaos"" thing better. When you destroyed military vehicles, killed personnel, destroyed bases, etc. you would gain Chaos and once you reached a certain point you would unlock new items and missions. This worked great because you would end up unlocking things just by fucking around. Just Cause 3 however makes you liberate towns and bases, which are mostly just the same thing over and over again. Destroy these buildings, shut down this surveillance system, open this door, free these prisoners, kill there people. Over and over. It's very repetitive. As for Chaos? It's just a meanless stat. 

- The rebel drop system is stupid. In JC3 you have to collect flares from rebel bases, and then use those to call in a rebel drop. You have limited flares, but that's ok because you can just get whatever you want for free whenever you want. Right? Wrong, because there's fucking WAIT TIMERS. You sometimes have to wait up to 20 minutes before you can drop in a plane again. It's one of the most anti-fun things a developer can do and is often paired with micro transactions that let you reduce the wait, but JC3 doesn't even HAVE microtransactions so the decision makes no sense.

Those are my main issues, but while I'm at it:

- There's no minimap. Why is there no minimap. You can pause the game and look at the map from there to find things buy that's no reason not to have a mini map.

- There's no sprint button. It makes Rico feel really slow in combat because you can't make him run any faster. The devs said that they want you to ""use Rico's other movement skills"" or whatever but JC2's sprint button was super useful.

- Devs said they wanted to support modders but every patch completely broke most mod. I think there's still some mods that haven't been updated to the latest versions of the game.

- Speaking of patches, there hasn't been one in months. You know what the latest patch was? DLC release. No big fixes. These devs charged us heaps of money for lackluster DLC and the worst part is I was idiotic enough to buy the first one. I'll give them the fact that have a booster on my wingsuit is cool but maybe they could use the extra time spent on DLC fixing the huge bugs in the game? Wait, that doesn't earn them money. Whoops, lol

- WHY DID THEY RE-INVENT THE WHEEL AND BIND LEFT CTRL TO BACK. WHY NOT JUST USE ESC. YOU KNOW, LIKE EVERY OTHER PROGRAM AND GAME EVER PROGRAMMED LIKE EVER. WHY. 

TL;DR: Is this game fun? Hell yeah, I have like 70 hours on it. Is it worth full price? Fuck no. Buy Just Cause 2 in the next sale for like $3 and then play it for three years until Just Cause 3 is a similar price. Just Cause 3 could have been great given another year of development. But it's just gonna forever be that game that could have been fucking awesome but instead blowed and probably killed the entire franchise. Good job, Avalanche. Next time give the game to a competent development team.

Rant over. Can you tell I'm still salty about a nearly 1 year old release?

This game exemplifies the majority of mediocre AAA games: weak story, functionable gameplay, lots of collectibles (many of them in form of explosions). The only novelty it had going on for it was the grapple hook, but the Arkham Series implemented  it with finesse in a much better series. After two hours, you discover there’s barely any variety in the missions, you’ll just keep doing the same thing for at least 18 hours in a very underwhelming plot. Don’t forget the obligatory grinding to unlock the main missions, even DLC ones. Playable game (6/10), but not really worthy anyone’s time.

The parachute and wingsuit are a lot of fun to use - until you realize that they basically are the only way to get around, and there's absolutely zero reason to care about any of the vehicles in the game. You could use a helicopter - only to get it shot out of the sky by SAM sites, so you might as well just parachute or wingsuit dive around at the same speed (as long as you're above land you can grapple for speed) or faster while avoiding all danger. You can use cars of various types, but that just makes you a bigger target and again is pointless compared to just grappling around. I know some people will say ""it's a sandbox, play how you want,"" but I and many other people do not enjoy actively handicapping ourselves and making things take far longer in games just so we get ""variety.""

There are pointless collectibles you can find around to waste your time, but for the most part the map is extremely empty - without interesting things to find or dynamic events or anything really worthwhile. So you'll spend most of your time between towns and such just quickly flying at mach 3 with your wingsuit, observing pretty but pointless scenery so you can actually get gameplay. Doing occasional timed challenges to destroy things or do wingsuit races or such so you can unlock what are effectively skill points for obligatory upgrades you have little agency over.

I really enjoyed Just Cause 2, and might still get through more of this game. The movement and grappling hook mechanics are great and have been refined very well. What disappoints me is that the world itself feels very boring to explore, and lacks the scale and ""realism"" (I say half in jest, you could grapple to the ground while falling in that game too) of Just Cause 2 that kept me immersed long enough to want to keep playing. The villain in this game is charismatic enough to keep me interested when you get the occasional audio log from him or see him in a cutscene, but otherwise there's not much to the characters or world that I care about.

In summary: Just Cause 3 is a generic open world collect-a-thon with above average movement mechanics and destruction, but unfortunately has all of the downsides of other generic open world collect-a-thons which I despise in the first place. If you enjoy games like every Assasin's Creed game ever released, or Ghost Recon Wildlands, or that kind of thing - you might like this. If you want something more substantial though, which values your time and doesn't have an open world solely to fill it with pointless nonsense - you won't get that here.

Edit: Another minor annoyance I just thought of is that when you finish the last objective in a zone, enemies in the area magically teleport out and resistance forces appear. I know that the game isn't very grounded in the first place, but it takes the tension out of things completely that destroying a random sign-post causes the two attack helicopters and dozens of soldiers currently shooting at me to just leave in disappointment.",1673549365,1673691358,False,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

Nope this game is not for me. I have experienced too many common bugs to enjoy it(saves disappearing, keybinds resetting, waypoints/missions glitching and unable to start or complete). 
The worst being the gamepad controls being EXTREMELY unresponsive. I would have use K+M but the keyboard and mouse bindings often reset and the default layout does not work for me.

I really don't like the objective structure of this game, because it simply encourages you to blow up an object, die, and then blow up an another object, or maybe blow a few in a row and then die. the game puts you in an enemy base with everything attacking you, and you just need to move around and avoid as many hits as possible while destroying structures. the thing is, at times because of the incredible amounts of enemy forces in the base, you find yourself looking at a black and white screen, waiting for a rocket to kill you or for you to be able to properly see again, while also hoping you won't crash into a wall. This simply isn't fun. I'd recommend you to play it only if you're not gonna try to finish it (weird thing to say, right?) and just roam around this massive open world using the incredible moveset (which is also poorly built for tighter spaces, like bases and tight cities for example) and maybe conquer some small bases and knock down some bridges.",1647808167,1673211293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And yes, this is a rant.  I fully admit that.  I have a free day today.  Downloaded the game last night and was excited to get up early this morning and play a new game.   

The start stinks.  Timed missions with poor guidance.  BS.  

Had to do the opening missions 4 or 5 times each because I'm expected to learn the  controls in the first 5 minutes while I'm defending against 20 enemies or have 1 minute to figure out and memorize the button sequence to get to my goal.  When it's that busy, it's too easy to miss the prompts.  Then, very often when I do catch it, it gives keyboard help instead of the controller.

10 seconds left...push [SPACE] to...huh?  GRRRRRRR!

Horrible way of trying to learn the game.  Ever hear of tutorials? 

I've played a lot of games that are frustrating at the start, but I had to shut it down after I tried over and over getting to the top of a mountain on a timed mission (like the 2nd or 3rd mission).  Everywhere I tried to use the grappling hook, it wanted to tether instead of reeling me up the cliff.  Frustrating.  

I can see it being a cool game.  I just wish I could play and not spend the whole morning doing the first missions over and over while I learn the controls.  That's not fun for me.  

Maybe if I can muster a little more patience, I'll try again.  I'll update if that happens.",1673010899,1673010899,False,0,0,0.459930330514907837,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1672988030,1672988030,True,0,0,0.358126729726791382,0,True,False,False

but 2 is crashing every 2 minutes on windows 10, so start with this one (or play the cracked Just Cause 2 - apparently that one doesn't crash - copying the cracked exe to the steam version is enough to make it work fine)

Just Cause 2 was pretty nice because there was no game like it that offered an open world to destroy. Just Cause 3 does the same and adds wingsuits and better tether hook possibilities, but it didn't make a change for me and playing the game felt the same. The only enjoyable way I found playing the game was by getting a bomber jet and bombing every place on the map like I was a NATO pilot bombing Yugoslavia in 1999.

Good points in the game was the aforementioned bomber jet, but also the beautiful graphics and the fact you can unlock vehicles to call in by 'liberating' (in other words bombing the hell out of) villages or military bases. But the game is basically a sea that is 20 centimeter deep. The gameplay is super simple and the map is too large for that. Perk unlocks are too many as well, I modded the game to unlock all of it because I'm not bothered wasting time on that. The controls in the game are super weird on PC as well, the vehicles feel super slow.

The graphics are stunning and the ability to make chaos with all the different gadgets and weapons at my disposal was a blast. I also really appreciated the freedom to explore the beautiful Mediterranean setting and take on a variety of missions.

One of the highlights for me was definitely the range of vehicles available, from cars and motorcycles to planes and helicopters. The controls took a bit of getting used to, but once I had the hang of it, soaring through the skies and causing destruction on the ground was an absolute thrill.

I also had played the expansion DLCs for Just Cause 3, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed by the additional content. The new stories added by the DLCs were engaging and added a lot of value to my overall experience with the game. The expanded map also allowed for even more freedom to explore and cause chaos, which was a joy to experience.

[i]""What you gonna do when I come for you?""[/i] - Rico Rodriguez

My review on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBeggarSoldier/recommended/401850/]Air, Sea & Land Expansion Pass[/url], which you should totally get for your playthrough.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
- Huge map
- Great storyline with fun comedic characters
- Great voice acting [i](Especially the propaganda spokesman)[/i]
- Steam content [i](Achievements, wallpapers, emoticons etc.)[/i]
- Really good animations
- Well done cutscenes
- Soundtrack is pretty good
- Awesome destruction physics
- Lot of Abilities/skills which the game calls ""Gear Mods"", these mods can be obtained by completing challenges around the islands.
- Lot of challenges
- Great variety of weapons
- Great variety of vehicles
- Grappling hook, wingsuit and parachute
- Lots of bases to be liberated

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
- If you don't have at least 16GB of RAM, then the game will crash AFAIK
- Default FOV is really bad
- Game sometimes crashes for no reason
- Some performance issues
- Lot of bugs, sometimes game breaking
- Sniper rifles are considered ""special"" weapons and they take away your rocket/grenade launcher.
- Aiming is a seperate skill [i](Gear mod)[/i]
- Driving some vehicles are clunky

[b][u]Tips and Advices:[/u][/b]
- For the FOV issue, I used the [b]JustFOV mod[/b] which you can download easily, also be sure if you are about to use this mod to [b]have a fov toggle between 35 and your desired FOV[/b], otherwise cutscenes will be broken in some way
- Spoiler alert: [spoiler]There will be a very game breaking bug at the mission [b]""Rico and the Rose""[/b] where your jet won't lock onto the jets that are attacking Rosa's plane. All you have to do is [b]turn off the precision aiming mod[/b] then restart the game.[/spoiler]

[b]8/10[/b] You can have a lot of fun playing this game and I highly recommend it, especially on a sale, even with all the game's flaws.",1598558218,1672400844,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

The positives

+The graphics are pretty good
+Flying around with the rope launcher and jet pack is a great deal of fun
+There are many different and varied vehicles to choose from
+The over-the-top action which consists of blowing stuff up is very fun for the first few hours
+One the three major DLCs is good
+The wanted system is pretty good

The negatives

-The main story is brainless and uninteresting
-The characters aren't memorable
-The voice acting isn't AAA level
-Although the gameplay loop is fun at first, it gets very stale once you realize the entire game is only that
-The open world doesn't really have any proper side missions, just repetitive liberation activities
-The driving is pretty bad
-The entire world looks unvaried with basically every location looking almost identical. This holds especially true for the countryside
-The flying mechanics for planes are abhorrent for keyboard & mouse
-There isn't much in the way of customization
-The other two major DLCs are boring and/or annoying
-The movement while simply walking is subpar

Instead of fixing the issue, the devs just raised the minimum RAM requirement from 8GB to 16GB and added a message for every time you boot up the game telling you that you have insufficient memory.
Apparently getting more RAM actually fixes a lot of performance issues with the game, go figure.- The car handling in this game is so, so, bad.
Just Cause 2 did the whole ""Chaos"" thing better.
In JC3 you have to collect flares from rebel bases, and then use those to call in a rebel drop.

- There's a memory leak issue that is yet to be fixed. Instead of fixing the issue, the devs just raised the minimum RAM requirement from 8GB to 16GB and added a message for every time you boot up the game telling you that you have insufficient memory. Apparently getting more RAM actually fixes a lot of performance issues with the game, go figure.

This game has a LOT of issues. Seeing as it's in the sale and there will be a lot of people considering buying it, I feel like I should outline the issues. TL;DR and specs at the bottom.

- Performance, it varies from person to person but personally I have a medium/high-end gaming rig and still get stuttering and frame drops. I get smoother framerates on games with more graphic fedelity. On consoles it's the same story, constant frame rate drops.

Picked it up for a few buckaroonies on sale and my goodness is it good. I may be biased slightly because me and my friend have spent countless hours playing it on his PlayStation 4 but he already completed the game so now I have the chance to play it on my own and it is amazing. I would say it's worth it at full price, especially if you like blowing up shiet. I can see why some people would say otherwise. But, if it's on sale, I would say it is a must get. The story has a lot to offer, and since I got it maybe 5 days ago (At the time of writing) I have spent 20 hours playing the game in every nook and crannie of free time I have had. It has made me want to 100% the game which is unusual for me. I normally get a few 10s of percent through before I say enough is enough and just do random shiet in the game.

You can tether stuff to crash it into other things. There's a wingsuit so you can fly (and powered flight later on), and blowing stuff up is fun, but I wouldn't recommend it, it's just too silly!

Some people seem to think that this is a realistic game, and it's not. You ride missiles, its not realistic. The lack of realism is quite nice, meaning that you get some really good thrills and some awesome moments ass you play the game.

If you have friends, there are leaderboards that you can challenge them on, but I found it was full of random tryhards with the highest possible scores, and so I couldn't see my friends' scores. In challenges, you can race the ghost of your friend, but it's a bit weird and I feel that the system for this was half completed. It's too buggy and my friend's ghost would disappear, crash into a wall or suddenly teleport throughout a race. It's also annoying that a lot of end game content (like mods and abilities) are locked behind these challenges, and its really hard to unlock them all with 5 gears to get the mod.

On the other hand, JC3 still looks great, and it's honestly one of the prettiest games I've played this year. The cars handle (mostly) fairly well. Big cars feel heavy and small cars feel light. The open world is truly open. Nowhere is off limits and you can go anywhere and do anything, it's great! There's a lot to do, collect, unlock, find, so you will be busy and it keeps completionists happy, but once again, there's too much. It took me another 70 hours after finishing the main story to unlock everything else, and it feels too grindy.

So, do I recommend Just Cause 3? NO. It's too buggy for me, and I find that it's too big, with too much to do with no incentive for it to be fun at all. Once you've beaten the story and the DLC, either you're too overpowered and combat isn't fun, or it's just go somewhere, blow it up, collect and repeat. You can't configure the keyboard to how you like it, which is annoying, and the AI is awful. People just drive into you and it doesn't feel like a normal city. Rico can't sprint, so in combat you're slow or forced to use your grapple. (If you get motion sick like me, its really not fun. I threw up at least 3 times while playing as I got motion sick from being upside down all the time). The rebel characters are also weird. I can kill about 30 and the ones that are alive still go ""Yay Rico, you're the best!"". Enemy spawning is also bad. I have had enemies spawn behind me and it kills the immersion. 

Overall, a great game spoiled by lazy developing and bugs that never got fixed. A poor 4/10. I'd recommend getting on sale if at all.",1662122243,1671724890,False,2,0,0.496254682540893555,0,True,False,False

No other similar game series has this much content and freedom of movement in such a beautiful singleplayer game world. Everything you wished that was there in games like Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row, is there in Just Cause. And what it lacks in terms of storyline progression, it more than makes up for in terms of pretty much all the other gameplay elements.

Pros:
+ The Just Cause 3 XXL Edition, has an insane amount of quality playtime to offer for the price. Especially when it is on sale, for less than ten euros.
+ A 1000 km² open game world with a Mediterranean paradise theme. It looks and feels like you are on holiday in, for example, the province of Istria in Croatia. You will see a lot of similarities with cities/towns like Fažana, Labin, Motovun, Pazin, Rabac, Rovinj and Vrsar. And of course little islands like the surroundings of Brijuni National Park.
+ Just exploring the island is an enjoyable activity in itself. There are also a striking number of details: fully decked out towns/villages and farms, underwater landscapes, cave systems, forests with animals, and a lot of audiovisual propaganda about the policy on the island.
+ Talking about the game world propaganda and the mischievous dictatorial behaviour: it is quite absurdistic and funny, but still realistic enough that some organizations would actually be spreading this kind of stuff in real life. For example, you will notice some behaviour patterns that can be applied to your direct surroundings... The developers really did their homework here!
+ An unprecedented number of vehicles. Including speedboats, jets, helicopters, turbo-fuelled sports cars and super bikes, MechWarrior-like robots, military ships and planes with heavy weaponry.
+ A very large and diverse arsenal of firearms. Everything from remote mines to absurdly overpowered rocket launchers.
+ Introduction of the Wingsuit with jet engine, minigun and missiles.
+ Massive destruction and explosions while annihalating military bases, harbours, prisons, police stations and communications facilities. You can even carry out bombing missions with a military fighter jet. Just Cause has that wow-factor in this regard.
+ Tethering multiple objects together with the grapling hook, sometimes with hilarious results.
+ You can just spend many hours of ""stunting"" with all the game mechanics and vehicles.
+ The overall visual performance is very good. Nice graphics for a game from 2015, without absurd system requirements. And above all: no loading times and few pop-ups while exploring the game world.
+ Day and night cycle looks beautiful.
+ Remarkably few bugs for a game engine of this size and complexity.

Cons:
- Loading time during game startup. Just Cause 4 improved this quite a bit.
- The storyline is a bit mediocre and slow. But that is pretty much the cause with all the games in the series.
- The main villain (a Tropico-like dictator) is not getting enough attention. There are a lot of good character details hidden in the collectibles, which are underexposed during the course of the story missions. But overall he is still a more detailed villain than the main one in Just Cause 4.
- The missions are repetitive in design and execution. But not as bad as in Just Cause 4.
- While there is a diverse set of fun side activities, they will also become a tedious time sink to complete the game on 100%.
- Getting to 100% game completion territory, requires an insane amount of time.
- The music is OK-ish and does the job, but it's nothing special and not very memorable. I will not be listening to this stuff outside of the game. Overall, the music in Just Cause 4 is a lot better.
- AI of the enemies and NPCs doesn't always make sense.",1671625334,1671667313,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Keyboard mouse controls are almost visibly attached to the menu with staples and duct tape. The game literally just makes you go through the intro tutorial period as a free for all because rather than adding the prompts for computer based controllers they just removed the console ones and left you to figure it out, so the first encounter in the game might be the hardest of the entire thing for PC players because your literally just hitting keys trying to figure out out basic functions with the above sensitivity issue described.",1671312071,1671340754,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son recently started Apex Legends and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

The only thing I found enjoyable about jc3 was the on foot movement/gameplay. Being able to be spiderman with a gun is just as fun as it was in jc2 and the wing-suit makes aerial movement engaging. In fact whenever I had to liberate a location, I would hardly use my guns, I would favor swinging/flying around and attaching bombs to everything and then detonating elsewhere because it was that fun.

However, everything else about the game is a massive drag. For a 2016 game, the graphics aren't very good (like the default resolution being like 1280x720 and being stretched so much that the menu options are located off the bottom of the screen is a massive WTF). The cars and boats all handle like trash, as they are either one of two extremes: Incredibly slippery or they move slower than a tank. This (un)intentionally compels the use of either fighter jets or using the wing-suit to get around quickly. Speaking of which, moving around the map is an absolute chore as the map is way to big for how limited the travel options are. Jc3 may as well not have a fast travel system because the only way you can use it is that you can only fast travel to places you have liberated from a liberated location. This is meant to force you to liberate locations to expand this option, but it's not fun. It just feels like a way to force a bootleg far cry experience.

The biggest sin that this game commits is the main story and its missions. They didn't even attempt with this game's main story. It feels rushed and every cutscene lasts for about 2 minutes with all these """"""characters"""""" spewing out garbage one liners while moving along with an extremely generic action plot. Then you're left to deal with the main missions which boil down to 4 types: Wing-suit shilling, set pieces, battlefields and escort missions. The wing-suit missions are only there to force you to try the new mechanic, it's not fun following glowing pipes in the valley for 5 minutes straight, the set pieces are the only interesting content like the train sabotage but are hardly present and the battlefields are generic ""rush to point a and save the ai then go to point b and do the same, etc."" 

But the worse missions are the escort missions which are probably 50-60% of the main story missions. These are all terrible missions that drag on for far too long and are incredibly frustrating due to how fragile the escorts are. The worst example has to be towards the middle section of the game where you have to defend mario (he's easily the worst character in the game and his death here would actually have improved jc3). However the idiot decides to stand in the middle of the beach and face tank all of the missiles and rounds from the tanks, ships and soldiers that bum rush him. ""Well why not use the emp like the game wants you to?"" BECAUSE MARIO IS STANDING IN THE MIDST OF ALL THE STUFF THAT EXPLODES FROM THE EMP BLAST AND HE'LL DIE EVERY TIME. This just forces you to use the care package system to call in a tank/hind/rocket launcher to ignore the game's suggestions and kill everything before mario dies. And this is not an isolated issue.

There are also times where you have to use weapons that do explosive or large damage (like a helicopter) but then the geniuses who designed this game thought it would be a great idea to have friendly fire on, which not only means you can accidentally kill escorts, BUT THE """"""FRIENDLY"""""" NPC'S CAN ALSO KILL YOU RANDOMLY EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

Terrible game, downgrade from jc2 in every way save for the grapple and wing-suit and ultimately a massive waste of time. I only suffered through this game because I made the mistake of buying this on sale not long after release and I only just now got to it.",1670638940,1670638940,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Mostly a game for a boring times when there's nothing interesting to play, even after I completed the game on 100% (without the DLCs) I'm still returning to this game sometimes to explode stuff and use the hook to connect those mf vehicle drivers. It's uncomfortable to drive on a car, and it's even worse on a bike.

In its core, it's basically the same game, with a similar story as the previous ones (serving basically as the new excuse to play around in the sandbox), offering only the added bonus of the new wingsuit to facilitate the traversal.
And yet, the simplicity in changing between transportation methods (grappling hook, parachute and wingsuit) leads the way to some great combinations to get around the map quickly and stylishly. 
Even the simple action of scaling up a building or grappling to a vehicle is made so much easier with the tweeks made to the snapping point that, maybe not that evident, put this one ahead of [i][b]Just Cause 2™[/b][/i]. Fun as it was previously, the grappling hook could be frustrating to use sometimes, especially when in motion.

Despite this, I felt pretty disappointed after completed the main story, as the final mission was very easy and unoriginal, putting us against another helicopter and cutting immediately to credits after the general's death. After the fun and more challenging ending mission of [i][b]Just Cause 2™[/b][/i], jumping between high-rises and having to exploit different attack strategies, this one looks way too lazy and anti-climactic. 
And Sheldon's final witty remarks were sorely missed —even with the pretended more personal story.

It may not shake the formula as much as it should, but all the small improvements allow for a more polished (and, subsequently, fun!) Rico Rodriguez experience.",1622498836,1670419730,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'd say it's more like Red Faction: Guerrilla with frikin' Rico, the way the missions and challenges are and how your friendlies gradually take over and the bad guys disappear. The controls are different in this one, for example, grapple is on the mouse instead of F, which is annoying at first but I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you get used to it, rather than change the mapping, because it turns out to be better once you stop forgetting and wasting your grenades trying to grapple. You kind of get forced into the challenges, unlike JC2, in order to up your gear, but that's not bad, it makes you get good at things you might normally not. I think the missions are better in this one. There is more to feel compassion for the citizens in this one, you have little connection with them in JC2. The wing suit is a great enhancement, especially if you get the Sky Fortress DLC and do the missions to get the wing suit thrusters, which is AWESOME! The map can be completed in less time than JC2, as JC3 has fewer locations (which I think is a good thing because I feel you can spend years to complete the map in JC2, might never finish, I like to finish). It looks like they improved the steering with driving and flying since I had it on PS4, or so I hear.

In this game, you mainly follow the Far Cry gameplay loop of liberating settlements from the big baddie of the region and progressing throughout the area. This game excels in one main thing: enjoyable gameplay.

The gameplay loop in this game is quite fun. The main thing that makes the gameplay fun has to be the grappling hook, the parachute, and wingsuit. Being able to grapple to almost any surface and also have the option to instantly start gliding is amazing. Not to mention the wide variety of environments that this game has to offer, from archipelagos to snowy mountaintops. If you don't find the enjoyment in this, then I don't know how else I could explain it, but I guarantee you that it is a fun experience for most people!

Unfortunately, this game has issues with glitches and being forced online. I never found any issue with the game being forced online but I could see how that would be annoying. However, the glitches were quite annoying, especially with achievement hunting. Some side missions are glitches, some locations of the game show noticeable drops in FPS for no reason, sometimes things just explode for no reason, and more. 

Overall, despite the issues present with Just Cause 3, I would say the enjoyment far outweighs the negatives. You can brush off the negatives present in the game if you truly enjoy the gameplay loop. It is a shame AAA games are just expected to come with issues these days, but it is what it is.",1607945732,1669531243,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,True,False

I could definitely see how someone might find it worth the money, especially with the sales at $3.  But I personally don't see myself playing it much for the reasons I'll explain.  For context I only have less than an hour in the game before I figured I'd give up on it in favor of playing something else, a fair part of that time is loading / trying to log in for a single player game for some reason.

The graphics are good, they hold up 7 years later.  Not amazing graphics by today's standards, but nothing I'll complain about.

The controls weren't natural to me. Some of the tutorials weren't as clear as they could have been.  The big thing in this area that was a big miss for me was the fact there is no sight usage.  You can only hip fire (Except for apparently sniper rifles).  To me that felt like it didn't reward skill (which I don't have but it's more fun).  The sprint speed felt slow.  First mission I parachuted to the ground slightly too soon and it took forever to reach what felt like a few seconds worth of space to cover.

The game play seemed pretty good with the exception of the related things I'll cover elsewhere.  It was pretty fun to grapple from one object to the next and parachute between them quickly.  It wasn't realistic at all but for sake of game play, that was a worthwhile trade.  In my time playing I never got used to the slow steering when driving cars.  It felt too long to respond to directions. Realistic, but hurt the game play in my opinion.  I probably would have gotten over this though.  Some of the movement felt goofy.  The game felt somewhat unrefined and could have used some tweaking to make it feel better.

As for story, I got major vibes that the main character is a 'Gary Stu'.  Firing only from the hip definitely made that feel that way more.  You literally start off firing an rpg while standing on top of an airplane.  There very well might be some good character development later on in the story, but I got the vibes of ""bad ass for sake of being a bad ass"" type character.

The final straw for me to desire a refund on the game was a bug in the map system where I had a rather large tutorial notification to push tab and select a spot to way point.  I couldn't get that off the screen after several minutes of trying and following the tutorial.

You might think I didn't give it enough time to thrive.  The trailers look cool, the map looked very expansive.  It just didn't quite hit the mark for me enough to feel like it was something I wanted to keep in my library and play long enough to disqualify myself from a refund.",1669516517,1669516517,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
