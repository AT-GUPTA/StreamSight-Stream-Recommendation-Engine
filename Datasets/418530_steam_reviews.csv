Gonna be completely honest here, I don't know whether it was the nostalgia of HD forcing me through this or the fact that it is actually a good game I really enjoyed despite it being difficult as hell. This game has you learn from almost every single one of your deaths, you die and you think ""damn why did I do that, that was completely my fault and could have avoided it"", of course there is that occasional almost unavoidable death of spawning into a level and immediately having a crush block in your proximity or casually strolling through a level just to have a UFO get knocked and land right in front of your face causing an explosion. Regardless of all that it was really satisfying getting further and further each time in the game. I alt+F4'd and still do every now and then after a death but I always picked up the game again to try actually beat it [spoiler] especially beat it in all three ways. [/spoiler] I put in 400 hours into this game on Xbox as it was on Gamepass and I had a subscription for that but then it got removed off of that and I wanted to continue playing it so I bought it on here.

The second games difficulty spike is insanely beginner unfriendly and due to rng mechanics makes it so even learning the game and knowing every aspect still isn't enough to have a good run the majority of the time. Half of the traps and enemies one shot you and the ones that don't end up being a one shot anyway in unavoidable and inescapable combos way too frequently to be considered fun or balanced. Some of the series best items were nerfed so hard they're almost not worth using, for example, getting flicked by any fire damage now with a jetpack, hoverpack, or powerpack or if they hit any bomb bags/boxes which can be caused by lava, lavamanders, firebugs, firefrogs, rockdogs, magma men, flaming arrows, etc. You get one shot. Some of the series worst items were also brought back like the spiderweb gun and the baseball glove which range from useless to nearly sabotaging yourself by grabbing it. 

The secret end game path is now so difficult it's not even worth bothering trying to attempt because it would take hundreds of hours for an average person to get to and would take even longer just trying to beat. 

For the game being a painfully difficult roguelike it's also never had the best variety in any aspect of the game from items to enemies and areas with the first game having basically none of it and the second only having a couple alternate levels leaving much to be desired after playing for a long time because you end up doing the same thing over and over and it's not just not fun.

Multiplayer has also has a bug since it came out (at least on pc) where you get stuck in a syncing screen on lower delay settings unless you alt+tab in and out at the start of every level or you can have higher delay syncing settings and wait a really long time before every single level which is equally as bad if not worse.",1694074891,1708999973,False,1,3,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The beginning is rather rough, but after a bit everything just clicks and it feels great. Also the game is not very luck based since items matter a lot less than in games such as Binding of Isaac and Risk of Rain 2 (not that those games are bad in fact I like them both a lot).

[h3] Actual Review (No Spoilers) [/h3]
What can I say? This game is just about the best possible sequel to Spelunky we could've asked for. Spelunky 2 takes the formula from the the first game (Spelunky HD that is) and refines it down to the best possible version it can be. The movement is extremely fluid, The whip feels better than ever (especially backwhipping) and the game overall just feels so satisfying to play and learn. There's a real sense of reward as you get good enough to discover each subsequent area, and almost the entire roster of enemies and items all feel unique and fun to fight/use.

[h3] Gameplay [/h3]
I can't gush about this game enough, especially if you have friends to play it with, as it offers a different and hilarious experience. My first few hours in this game were with friends and I think that's the best possible thing you can do to get yourself into the game. Discovering all the game has to offer and laugh out loud at all the moments that you could have never predicted.

If there is one single thing to complain about with this game is unlike HD, deaths and other happenings in Spelunky 2 aren't always the fault of the player. In the first game, 99.9% of all things that go wrong are the player's fault, no matter how bullshit they may seem. But in Spelunky 2, there is a lot more that happens that feels completely out of the player's control. Altars for example can straight up just spawn in a way that they will instantly be destroyed upon loading into a level. There are various other things that you can just sum up as ""getting spelunky'd"" but despite all that, the vast majority of things in the game still have player-dependent outcomes. Which is why it feels so rewarding to play.

I also should talk about the music. Spelunky HD had some BANGIN tracks and this game is no different. Definitely more atmospheric than HD, but the thing is there is only one long track for each area that dips in and out of each level. In HD, there were multiple different songs that could play for each of the 4 levels in an area which gave some variety, but even without that, Spelunky 2 has some great music.

[h3] Achievements & The Completionist Grind [/h3]
Lastly, going for 100% achievements is certainly a grind. But despite the insane difficulty of it, it was actually one of my favorites to date. I got all my friends into this game at the same time so there was a very organic learning curve that we all went through at the same time which gave me more of a drive than normal to complete such a hard game. Definitely worth it if you're willing to put in the time, especially for some of the harder achievements where you're pretty much at the mercy of having good spawns and the right items in the shops.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]
Overall this game is well worth full price and then some. Especially if you're going for completion, you'll learn the ins and outs of every area, enemy, item, and pretty much every interaction in the game. You'll master advanced tactics like bomb chucking and ledge whipping, and even get good at speedrunning just for good measure. Spelunky 2 is the full package and is a blast any way you look at it. 9.5/10",1685239139,1706669109,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

As a sequel to the acclaimed original, Spelunky 2 not only lives up to the lofty expectations set by its predecessor but ascends to new heights, delivering an unparalleled rogue-like experience that is as challenging as it is captivating.

One of the game's most outstanding features is its procedurally generated levels. Each descent into the depths of Spelunky 2 is a unique adventure, an uncharted territory filled with traps, treasures, and creatures that defy expectations. The genius of the procedural generation lies in its ability to surprise even seasoned players, ensuring that no two runs ever feel the same.

From the charming pixel art style that retains the nostalgic essence of its predecessor to the vibrant and diverse environments, the game is a visual feast.

The original was challenging, but here everything has been cranked up to 11.  The first set of levels, which in the original were a way to ease into the game, are now a nightmarish slog, ultra dense with traps and enemies, including new enemies that are far more difficult than their predecessors.  They take multiple hits to kill (which cannot be done quickly as they are invincible during stun) and have fast, erratic movements.  Then once you graduate to the later levels, your health effectively becomes meaningless because 90% of your deaths will be 1-hit instakills, or effective 1-hit kills where you are stunlocked, thrown around the screen, and juggled to death.  The game does not even appear to be aiming for the ""tough but fair"" label that Souls games often get.  I experienced many deaths due to bizarre enemy interactions halfway across the map, or objects flying at me suddenly from offscreen.

What all of this added difficultly results in is a game that is at odds with itself.  It must be played with extreme caution if the player wants to have any chance of success, but this slows the pace of the game down to a crawl and draws out the length of each run.  This being a roguelike where all progress is lost upon death, this makes every death as painful and disheartening as possible.

Spelunky 2 is an indie, rogue-like experience created and published by Derek  Yu and his team of amazing and talented developers. It has very fun and silly mechanics, that will never bore you, and a lot of cool and creative designs. The story is picked up after the events of Spelunky (the original instalment in the series), and straight from the get-go is a banger! The story is very unique and the cast of characters are very cool and interesting. The plot is about Ana (the main protagonist) going to the moon to search for her parents, after they went to investigate something mysterious on the moon. The world and enemy designs are very fun and creative, as most of the things are based on real-world and historical beings from folklore and tales. As a big fan of creepy monster designs, I love this idea! The game is very tough and unforgiving, and makes you want to pull your hair out, but at the same time, every death feels like your fault, so after time, you will get better. This is why I love the rogue-like genre, as they always are tough and hard to play, but once you complete them, it feels like you accomplished something, which makes you proud! This game is a masterpiece, and every single spec is pure passion.

The greatest aspect of the spelunky experience is the quality replay-ability the game has to offer with its randomly generated rooms throughout different world types, the complex game mechanics that are simple to learn but take extensive time and dedication to master. 

Spelunky 2 is a rogue-like game, (this works well with the randomised rooms), therefore as you play you cant rely on any form of power ups for the player character across games, but you need to learn how the world around you works and how to thrive within it, this would lead the skill ceiling to be even higher.

The game has well rounded graphics and a colour pallet that is not too vibrant or abstract. Each world also has a unique theme that really makes each new location feel different, this consists of the music that seamlessly transitions through levels (10/10 but can be disabled), the huge variety of enemies that all have their own attack patterns and the style of the terrain surrounding you. These aspects lead each level to feel alive and not just a chore to get through.

This game is packed full of npcs to interact with, quest lines to do and secrets waiting to be found. And all of this is documented in a well thought out journal that can provide insight into how far you have progressed through the many hours of content waiting to be explored.

There is also a co-op mode for up to four people and this can be accessed locally or through an online feature, with this you can access the standard adventure game mode and the arena mode to battle your friends to become the ultimate spelunker.",1680588939,1704507641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has a lot to love in the artwork and setting, as well as fun and diverse enemies. The story is barebones but not really what people play the game for.
It's an odd game because it encourages players to ""get good"" at precision platforming by punishing the player hard for simple mistakes. Any slip up means you will probably lose your run immediately. It then tries to walk this back by giving the player a health bar with four hits, in order to be more forgiving. Unfortunately it then walks this back again by stun locking the player every time they are hit, so if you slip up once, youll probably be damaged multiple times from one enemy, making the entire health bar completely meaningless as a mechanic. Besides enemies, there are dozens of statuinary traps which instant-kill the player. They're actually less frustrating and pretty balanced for what they do.
The roguelike elements make the game very frustrating in comparison to others in the genre. The level generation doesnt seem to be very careful about making the floors actually playable. Getting stuck in a poorly generated room without the consumable tools to escape means you have to just restart your run. Some floors generate so you cannot progress without taking fall damage, because there's literally nothing to jump on. Sometimes the only jump down is into a spike pit, so you don't get to continue playing now. Many problems like these can be mitigated by using your consumables, but the random nature of a roguelike means you might go the whole run and never get more than you start with at the beginning.
Every run shouldn't be an easy win, but I should at least be losing because of my own mistakes. Using my consumables sparingly and still not having enough to progress doesn't feel like a ""get good"" issue, just a design problem.
Beside consumables, there are other items you can purchase at shops. Some shops randomly generate, others are always on the same floor every run. It can be frustrating, but at least thr game concedes some consistency.

I want to like this game more, since it's a lot of fun with friends in co op. The co-op mode has its own drawbacks though, in that you have to start from the first floor every single run, and it can get a bit chaotic with more people. Similar to Lethal Company, having things go terribly wrong can be fun with friends, even if the game restricts players from accessing late game together without sloughing through an entire run.

Single player is pretty awful. Due to the nature of small mistakes almost always killing you, the lack of reliable resources, and the difficulty of navigating the random floor designs, playing alone usually falls somewhere between bashing your head against a wall repeatedly and making small amounts of progress only to die to a randomly generated problem which you couldn't foresee or plan for.

The game is so comically RNG dependent that any real improvement in your platforming doesn't result in better performance on average. At the highest level of play (speedrunners), this can be overcome, but for the majority of players, the game is just not rewarding to even try.",1704165706,1704165706,False,14,3,0.501071631908416748,0,True,False,False

While I have beaten the game several times in various ways, I felt I merely held on because of my appreciation for Spelunky HD, wanting to dive deeper into the game attempting to get the same fun out of it as I had in learning Spelunky HD. Overall, I felt this learning experience wasn't fun, rewarding and hilarious as with the first game, but rather tedious, with certain parts becoming more and more repetitive after a while, causing me to f-up after a while because I grew so bored of for example fighting the same mini-Bosses over and over again and becoming negligent because of that.
While the first game was hard in the beginning, it could become trivial after beating it a few times, for several reasons (good items being more powerful and abundant, enemies in the first area being easier, more accessible exploits of certain mechanics). Spelunky 2 mitigates a lot of these, but doesn't succeed in creating more long term fun than Spelunky HD as a result. The first levels of the game have become considerably harder, while giving you less opportunity to get good items for the mid/late game, but also a lot of good items are nerfed, the game over all is way harder. Having the first levels of this game be very similiar in art style to the beginning of Spelunky HD, makes it even more tedious to traverse these levels carefully. The idea of having the music play continiously with elements of it changing when you reach certain points of the game is really cool! But it's a shame that it's always the same, and while I like the Idea I'd rather have it be several randomly choosen musical tracks like in the first game, or expand on the way they did it with more tracks (which I realize would be lots of work).
While the game has even more traversing paths than the first game which I love, I barely ever explored them, because I found survival to be too difficult to make me want to deviate from what I felt is the easiest path.
Derek Yu suggests viewing the game as a sandbox experience, but I find the fun of that wearing out relatively fast. Of course you want to explore and beat the game at some point. Also, when you sandbox the game you die so easily that you will not live very long..
I think it's amazing that this game has even more of the kind of challenges than Spelunky HD, which are very very hard for the average gamer, and I'm totally fine with never beating the cosmic ocean, I'm not even trying that s--t lol! But a lot of the ""easier"" things and endings in the game are to difficult to do to make f-ing around in the game fun for me. I feel the balance of the game is of, and makes it feel like it is tailored to  hardcore gamers too much. It feels like the developers looked at how the very best players trivialized the difficulty of the first game, and sculpted the second game too much after that, with those top players being a very small part of the player base. 
The beauty of the first game IMO was that it was difficult (but fun) to learn, while offering very difficult challenges to the hardcore crowd, which are not necessarily linked to beating the game. while this game feels tedious.
Imo, it is in a lot of ways ""an amazing game which is not fun"".
The frustrating thing for me is, that I feel it could have been the greatest game of all time.",1703877627,1703877627,False,1,1,0.485106378793716431,0,True,False,False

The final secret area contains a kind of block which will instantly kill you, as well as one final hurdle of a boss that always finds a way to kill you in the most unsuspecting way possible.

But, I've gotten into it much more recently, because I really wanted to [spoiler] get to that coveted Cosmic Ocean [/spoiler]. And I've found myself falling in love with this game.

If you've played the first one, this is like that one. Except the charm has been cranked up to eleven, and the difficulty has been cranked up to twelve.

The mechanics feel hugely satisfying. Some improvements over the first game, that I didn't know I needed, were made; such as climbing gloves requiring you to press into the wall to hold on to it, running being the default, ... Moving around feels [i] crisp [/i], and though I wanted to blame the game for many of my deaths, it was just me fatfingering a rope, bomb or jump input where it should have been something else.

I've read that the developers wanted the game to feel much more alive, and, well, they've succeeded. All the small little details and interactions add [i] so [/i], so much. Don't want to spoil any here, obviously, but you don't have to look very far. Just the base camp (entrance cave?) itself is filled to the brim with fantastic little details that makes it ideal to destress a bit after you've died for the hundred-and-sixteenth time -  and all the other times, too. [spoiler] The base camp even 'upgrades' as you progress the game! [/spoiler] [spoiler] And you can pet the dog! [/spoiler] This game is amazing!

But yes, it is [i] hard [/i]. I've not played many games where I felt like I'm doing everything right, just for something I did not account for to end a very deep run. So you learn from your mistake, and try again. But boy, is there a lot to learn.

Personally, I'm fine with a challenge.  Sometimes even overly difficult challenges like Real Platinum God on vanilla BoI:  Rebirth.  That being said, the challenge this game presents is just not fun.  Instead of learning from your mistakes and feeling a sense of accomplishment, the game will find new and creative ways to unfairly kill you in the early levels, wasting your time and leaving you frustrated.  Everything is taken from the first game and made slightly worse.  As many others have said, health is effectively useless in this game, because almost always, 1 hit from literally anything that stuns you will lead to your demise, even if only from stunlock.  The game has several things which are straight up unfair, such as ghost pots being broken by the environment shortly into the stage, spawning the ghost (ending your run), or lava physics infinitely pouring down the shaft created by the drill, making the vampire area impossible to reach.  The most recent one that had me closing the game was when an enemy apparently wandered into a shop offscreen, causing the shopkeeper to fire from offscreen and instantly kill me.  It took me a second to realize that those were shotgun pellets, since I didn't even know there was a shop there.  Huh.  Alt+F4.

When many players of your game all share the same negative points in their review, it indicates that your game has a problem, not that the players themselves are the problem.

TLDR:  Instead of upon dying and finding yourself saying saying: ""Well, guess I could've avoided that enemy/trap better, let's try again"", this game will leave you saying ""Well, that ACTUALLY wasn't my fault, but whatever"", before closing the game and wisely spending your time elsewhere.",1701885567,1701885567,False,5,1,0.485396087169647217,0,True,False,False

Picture this: You start your adventure, all wide-eyed and hopeful, ready to explore caves and unearth treasures. Fast forward ten minutes, and you're face-first in a pit of spikes, questioning every decision you've ever made.

Spelunky 2 is like that friend who insists on telling you a joke that only they find funny, and you're stuck there pretending to laugh while your soul slowly withers away. The difficulty curve is steeper than my grandma's secret pancake recipe, and just as unforgiving.

One thing I've learned is that death in Spelunky 2 is not a setback; it's a lifestyle. It's the only game where my demise is so frequent, I've started treating it as a casual inconvenience. ""Oh look, I triggered a trap and got squished by a giant spider again. Classic Tuesday.""

The characters in this game are like the cast of a sitcom, each with their quirks and tendencies. I've got my go-to explorer who has a talent for tripping over his own feet, and let's not forget the hired help, who can either save your run or sabotage it with the grace of a drunken llama.

The levels are meticulously designed death traps, and every time I think I've got the hang of it, Spelunky 2 throws a curveball. ""Oh, you thought you were safe? Here's a ghost that will make your heart race faster than a cat on a hot tin roof.""

Despite the countless deaths and the occasional rage-induced existential crisis, there's something oddly charming about Spelunky 2. It's like the game is challenging me to be a better, more patient person. Or maybe it's just trying to break me. Jury's still out on that one.

In conclusion, Spelunky 2 is not for the faint of heart. If you're looking for a relaxing gaming experience, this is not it. But if you enjoy testing the limits of your sanity and revel in the absurdity of virtual spelunking, then by all means, take the plunge.

Most significant upside: The story and game design are fantastic--even though the levels are randomly generated! The secrets different paths to the end also keep the game interesting!

Most significant downside: How far you get in the game is basically the difficulty level.

After that, I decided to delete the game. I'm too afraid to challenge other hidden levels. It's not a game for fun at all. I strongly advise people over 25 not to play it. The sense of achievement is very low, and it's not entertaining at all. As I progressed, it felt more like a stubborn determination rather than enjoyment. That's why I worked hard to at least clear it once on my own.

The game seems designed for seasoned Spelunky players. There's no consideration for newcomers or players with less skill. Even in games like Super Mario, which is considered relatively easy, they understand the need for special characters and provide a simple mode.

單人一路開通三條捷徑，透過捷徑跳關終於獨自打贏了Tiamat，總遊戲時長184.6小時。

然後我要刪Game了，完全不敢去挑戰其他隱藏關卡，非常不休閒的遊戲，25歲以上老人真的不建議玩，成就感很低根本沒娛樂性，玩到後面根本是在賭氣，只是想努力至少獨自通關一次。

這遊戲給我的感覺是為了服務Spelunky的老玩家，完全沒有想到新手跟手殘黨，別人超級瑪莉比較簡單，都會設定特別腳色提供簡單模式。

The game will make you rage, a lot, for hours. However, this game is still incredibly fun. With lots of content you'll probably never get to see!
The visuals, levels, enemies, bosses, and almost everything else is an incredible improvement over Spelunky HD, apart from a few things.

That mainly being the music, the music is still very good and is actually dynamic now which is great. There are many amazing tracks you will likely love... however, they all fall short when compared to Spelunky HD. This is likely because that game didn't need to focus on dynamic music and only needed to focus on happy jingles to nod along too.
Another criticism about the game actually stems from 2 new features, that being the back layers and fluid physics. The back layers are a very interesting concept that just isn't used very effectively, with there not being much content or anything interesting to explore there. The other one is fluid physics, while being a great concept, the lava causes more annoyances that great times, blocking level paths and making the drill in volcano slightly more RNG heavy as well as making the game significantly more computer intensive.

Despite this criticism, the game is still amazing and one I heavily implore you to try. While it doesn't have the exact same feel as Spelunky HD you will still have an incredibly, painfully fun time! (Especially, if you enjoyed Spelunky HD.)
The new areas are great to venture through, and you can finally play with your friends online if you can manage the input delay. 

I have completed all achievements and it took me 61.9 hours, the achievements are varied and great and I am almost ready to hang up mining helmet, however I still crave to do one more challenge, that being the endless expanse of pain after those 22 levels of turmoil. You should play the game to understand what I mean, because there is a greater challenge hidden away from the achievements here, one you will likely never complete...

I give this game a solid 9/10 - great gameplay, difficulty and challenges with good but not excellent music. The game is slightly more RNG dependent than the previous game, but this still leaves room for a lot of fun.
Well done to Derek Yu! And remember always to ""ransack those shopkeeper's pockets"" while Kali watches!",1628524023,1699789571,True,1,2,0.522184312343597412,0,True,False,False

To be fair, the few issues i have are drops in the bucket compared to what the game does well, but once noticed they never quite go away. 

One annoyance is the world generation, especially for the first area, the Dwelling. World generation in spelunky works on a sort of grid system, with hand created ""rooms"" being strung together randomly (with a few failsafes to ensure the exit is always reachable), and the ones for Dwelling often result in boring and samey levels with pointless dead ends, sometimes having most of the level not even accessible unless you use one of your precious bombs. Even then there's often nothing worth searching for. This issue is somewhat lessened in other areas, but still very much present, and if your hunting for secrets in a few areas, being constantly cut off from what your looking for and needing a bomb or item to get there is tedious.

Another is the ever known risk of getting ""spelunkyed"". Often Spelunky 2 is rough but fair, rewarding quick thinking and attention, but sometimes it will place you into true no-win situations due to no fault of your own, or a single slip up will send your battered body flying into multiple enemies and traps then finally into a boiling pool of lava, all with no chance of recovery. In these instance the most you can do is try to marvel at how horribly your life was just ended and try again, but if your luck is bad and the game is placing enemies and traps with no remorse it can get annoying.

One of my last issues involves the new ""Background Caves"" and the fluid dynamics, but is a bit of a nitpick. The fluid dynamics is mostly just interesting, but with lava you can sometimes end up screwed either by your own actions, or random things just happening around you (this ties in to the concept of getting spelunkyed). Meanwhile the background caves are just sort of... there. often they have nothing of interest, the small ones often having nothing but a bat or two, while the large ones MAY have a special shop. However, the shops include a caveman run shop who sells rocks and skulls more often then not, and while the other shop you can run into often has a few choice items for grabs the actual chances of FINDING the entrance to the back caves is seemingly totally luck based (I have seen nothing online about there being ANY way to reliably find the things if they exit past getting a bit lucky with an exposed entrance, if a way exists i dont know it)

I front-loaded this review with the things that annoyed me, but i think my hours played can attest to what i think of the game overall. If you think you reach the skill floor for this game (I recommend starting out not really caring too much about finding secrets or playing perfect, just start building your skills to see if you can git gud) and are interested in this type of game, I 100% endorse this one and recommend you buy it.",1699760164,1699760164,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The overall presentation remains polished and comfortably stylish, while the gameplay is quite satisfying and engaging to interact with. Unlike the previous game however the story makes absolutely zero sense, and many conceptual elements of the world have been outright recycled for no explicable reason. Which only renders the story even more nonsensical due to said repetition.

Unfortunately many problems from the previous game are still here, and in this regard the system has seen almost no improvement. The game has zero protection against stun-locking and many hazards that will exploit it, numerous hazards that instantly knock the player out regardless of their health, hazards that will instantly strike the player from off-screen or ambush them as they enter a level, hazards hidden behind objects in the foreground, completely random item and resource acquisition that will sometimes deprive the player of crucial gear, mechanics designed to punish the player for certain actions will be triggered by things other than the player, numerous underpowered items that simply are not worth using unless nothing else is available; and more.

The controls are tight and precise but players are randomly put into overbearing situations that require unreasonable split-second levels of finesse to survive. Most of the time the game rewards the player for being reasonably dexterous and obstacles can be overcome through such, but randomly an overbearing situation will arise that requires an instantaneous and completely exact reaction to survive. These situations are so random and specific that players have zero chance of anticipating or learning from them, which makes surviving those encounters even less plausible for any player that does not have literally perfect reactions; or luck. Beyond that certain elements of the controls are entirely contrary to dexterous gameplay. Such as the wall and ledge grabbing mechanics that players cannot fully control or the finicky grab and crawl mechanics.

As the game has many difficult, nuanced obstacles a massive amount of trial and error is needed to memorize how every single thing works just to avoid instantly getting knocked out by a single threat. The game makes an extremely obvious point of punishing players for their lack of knowledge in regards to any conceivable thing. However this game is filled with mechanics that operate in extremely specific yet variable ways that only become more volatile when they happen to randomly be combined with other things. This results in countless hyper-niche situations where players are punished for not knowing the single answer to a rare problem that will never manifest again for potentially dozens of hours in playtime due to sheer randomness. Which actively serves to contradict the act of learning since by the time players actually encounter that threat again, they will potentially have forgotten the one counter that it has.

Every single time the player makes a mistake, is unlucky or gets presented with an unfair obstacle their entire survival hangs in the balance. It is completely random whether a given mishap will knock the player out, or simply wound them. Thus even the act of failing this game is arbitrary. Sometimes the player will make one mistake during the course of an hour long run and survive, other times they will be completely obliterated. The exact same applies to luck and unfair obstacles, like those mentioned above.



The design of this experience is so incoherent that it simultaneously has zero tolerance for mistakes while absolutely rewarding dexterity and memorization but also randomly forgives mistakes while producing obstacles that explicitly undermine dexterity and memorization. Resulting in an experience that, while appealing in its presentation and satisfying in its gameplay, ultimately comes down to random chance when it comes to whether the player actually survives a run or not.

Players do not beat Spelunky or Spelunky Two, Spelunky and Spelunky Two allow players to beat them; randomly. These games have all the tools necessary to guarantee the demise of the player in numerous moments throughout the course of a run. Whether that happens is just entirely random, which is ultimately the result of incompetent balancing.

The new areas are fun to explore, the mechanics have expanded without invalidating your pre-existing knowledge, and the co-op mode is a hilarious romp. But if you're unfamiliar with Spelunky and want to buy a new game, then Spelunky HD might be a better choice.

Given Spelunky 2's similarities to the originals, it's hard not to compare its messiness against what came before it. Both the freeware version of Spelunky 1 and the HD remake emphasized gradual learning and adaptation. Spelunky 2's additions to that formula are mountable animals, flowing water and lava, mechanical switches, layered levels, and a slew of new enemies. While seeing these things in a familiar game is novel, they don't mesh very well with what was already there. The new creatures and the physics elements primarily just contribute random explosions (and deaths) that are out of your control. The sequel’s overall difficulty curve is also backwards, with a brutally-punishing first area that leads into more manageable later levels. 

Spelunky 2 seems like an ambitious fan mod rather than an official sequel, full of lovely details and ridiculous ideas but lacking in direction, vision, and playtesting. It’s not as elegant or as thoughtfully-designed as the first game, so I would only recommend it if you specifically want a steep challenge or online co-op.",1603677511,1697204642,False,16,0,0.545728147029876709,0,True,False,False

1-4 isn't really randomly generated. You can straight up skip a whole boss for an S tier item in the game.

My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my husband had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

""Spelunky 2"" is a roguelike in its textbook definition: procedurally generated levels, restart fully every time you die, knowledge is the only power-up you can carry over to a new run.
The story is a minor element of the game. There is enough lore to come up with a comprehensive world, but the universe is not fully explained outside of some retreads from the first game.
What took me so long to consider the game ""completed"" is that there are multiple endings. The first two are quite straightforward and reward you with achievements, the other one is a long, LONG challenge for those who are willing to take on it. Don't let your inner completionist prevent you from having fun.
The gameplay is the highlight of the game: the movement is extremely fluid, terraforming allows the player to manipulate levels in multiple ways… and there's also RNG. You will get frustrated from falling particles, bad events outside your control, and sometimes even unpleasant level generation with countless traps.
""Spelunky 2"" offers cross-platform multiplayer and arena modes, but I haven't experimented with them much. If it sounds like your jam — prepare for co-op shenanigans.

You will lose your patience with this game… and it's going to be glorious. Have fun in whatever way you'll choose.",1695581721,1695581721,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Hello everyone, I am here to give you my thorough review on the electronic entertainment application that is Spelunky 2!

One of the fundamental things I would like to say about this electronic entertainment application is that it can be a very frustrating experience to start off with. I would, however like to stress that this frustration does not last as you will find yourself immersed in the never ending, never the same, side-winding caves that make up the fabric of this very game.

Another thing I would like to say about this video game is that losing to the game is a core part of the learning experience, and the main reason I do not play this game any more. There are plenty of players in Spelunky 2 which have completed the 7-99 challenge which is referred to as the highest accomplishment in this game! I am not one of these people and if you can see by the amount of time I have played this game, it's a rather sorry ordeal. Do not let this put you off from trying to beat the 7-99 challenge yourself though!

The core gameplay loop of Spelunky 2 offers a wide range of choices when it comes to your approach to how you play the game. You can choose to be fast and get the best time on the leaderboards or you can play slow and methodical to try and achieve a high score. The lightning-fast response time coded into the games mechanics offers a clean, consistent and fun game experience. The ways in which you can tackle each obstacle presented to you in a given level are almost limitless.

The art style of the game presents itself as an easy to look at, easy to understand interface in which you can decipher where you are in the game world with little to no effort. The jovial and childlike elements to the approach on the art side of things makes this game very accessible to all demographics of people.

The sound design present in Spelunky 4 is pleasant at times and at other times, leaves a lot to be desired. The soundtracks in this game are well composed, as the artists behind the soundtrack in Spelunky 6 is also the same one in Spelunky 3.
Eirik Suhrke's music is some of my favourite video game music in the original Spelunky, however I feel that due to the more atmospheric and ambient approach to the soundtrack in the new game, it lacks a certain charm which was found in Spelunky HD.

In conclusion I would like to say that this game is one of the games of all time. Spelunky 2 presents itself as one of the most challenging games of all time while also not taking itself too seriously. The developer himself, Derek Yu, maintains the viewpoint that this game is akin to that of a permanent learning experience where every death within the game is part of the game play loop, seeing which new wacky and funny way to die, one after the other.

If you are a person who enjoys a fun and casual experience, you should try this game because you will realise when you are not having fun anymore, you'll stop, like a normal person. However if you are a masochist you won't stop, and you'll continue to play the game for almost 1000 hours like me, all the while having nothing to show for it.

Thank you for reading my comprehensive review on Spelunky 2077.

Despite the light-hearted theme, Spelunky 2 is seriously challenging in all the rights ways. After 140 hours and hundreds of runs, I feel like I’ve been on an expansive and fulfilling journey. Not only an in-game journey, exploring new levels, finding cool items, etc. but also a personal journey in which I had to overcome both mental and physical hurdles to get to where I’m at today. Defeating Hundun has to be one of my favorite accomplishments in gaming and one that will mark the end of a journey that I barely thought possible. But who knows, maybe I’ll come back and reach 7-99 someday. After coming this far, I can’t rule it out.

They took the formula of spelunky 1 and expanded on it in probably the best way possible. All the traps and enemies are still just as lethal as in its predecessor, and discovering all the secrets is quite fun, if a bit annoying at times. There are situations where you have to carry a specific item across a lot of areas, so it becomes quite frustrating when you have a good run going, only for you to be squished by a floating block. 
But it is still very much a high skill-ceiling game, so you will feel yourself getting better at it, and it feels so [b] good [/b] once you manage pull off the thing you wanted to.

Now for the coop, oh boy the coop. The coop is the reason why I even decided to write a review. it is so incredibly fun and chaotic, especially if it's late in the evening or you are getting drunk together with your friends. All the different chain reactions that are already common during single player, get amplified by however many friends you bring with you. Arena mode is also incredibly fun if you want to have a quick smackdown at your friends. some of the maps are so chaotic, that at some point it becomes impossible to figure out what is happening, but that is the whole fun of it.

This is for many reasons. Spelunky HD was punishing, and technically has its own issues, but after wrapping your head around it, Spelunky HD becomes very completable in a campy way (learning [spoiler]that you always should go for the worm sword if you're doing a secret route run, and figuring out how to game the pathing on the ghosts to generate enough money to complete a secret run without too much RNG.[/spoiler]). Also, Spelunky HD had multiple soundtracks that would generate for each level. Not so here.

Spelunky HD's level design felt experimental, Spelunky 2's level design feels at times bloated, sometimes bad. With Spelunky HD, the [spoiler]mothership level is pretty much worthless except for very specific things, but it's a single stage that's easy to ignore.[/spoiler] With Spelunky 2 they throw in [spoiler]an entire temple world which is more difficult than the other world options, with no better rewards--but they do this sometime after giving a world selection choice in the same style that is actually meaningful[/spoiler]. Including the [spoiler] temple world [/spoiler], as it is, is touted like a feature, rather than an ugly piece of game design that should have been heavily reworked as soon as playtesting was underway.

The official devs have made excuse threads on Reddit about why there isn't a chat feature in multiplayer, trying to convince others to use their official discord as a 3rd party tool for communication on their game, and this is a problem. Why might a chat feature be important? Here's a very real example; if you use random lobbies to try and see more of the game for yourself than you could solo, eventually you'll get to some secret stuff, specifically with [spoiler] one room in the final world where a giant countdown may appear. This happens when at least one of the players initiates a boss rush, for extra HP. If you make the mistake of thinking that you need to leave before the numbers reach zero, you will be ~permanently hated by your lobby[/spoiler]. The ability to shoot off emoticons, and/or specific other messages, perhaps only unlocked after entering World 3 (to prevent spam and redundancy, the early levels should become muscle memory) would have been nice idea, but we do not have this here.

If you complete a multiplayer game in the style mentioned above, you will not receive the ending achievement. It would be nice if there was a multiplayer-specific separate achievement that the game could award, for seeing the ending this way - it would encourage this playstyle (using multiplayer with experienced players to figure out the levels). You could even build on this idea by giving out achievements to seasoned players for showing new players new sections of the map (would encourage participation in random lobbies). No such luck. Spelunky HD had an issue of not giving out incremental achievements for items between the normal and hard runs of the game, this issue is compounded here. INB4 ""of course the game doesn't have to give you anything for *several* hours of your time if you don't win, it's a roguelike,"" plenty of other roguelikes give you *something* for your work.

Derek Yu would rather embark on book tours about how he reinvented game design than he would dedicate himself to crafting the perfect game. Spelunky HD was lightning in a bottle. Spelunky 2, aside from a quick run-through for visual and comparative purposes, isn't worth the effort. It's not worth returning to.",1691357608,1691358600,False,1,0,0.454545468091964722,1,True,False,False

(depending on gaming skills, mainly)

Gameplay: Exceptional
Spelunky 2 is a rogue-like indie side-scroller and platformer. Each level is randomised, and belongs to an area which defines its enemies, hazards, merits and appearance. It has amazing replay value and multiplayer (Co-op and PVP). Gameplay is frustrating and quite difficult, but nonetheless very enjoyable.

Graphics: Nice
Spelunky 2 has unique, stylised graphics. They are not beautiful, but they are above passable and contribute to the overall atmosphere of the game.

Audio: Also Nice
The soundtrack is very good, not as good as Spelunky HD but nonetheless acceptable. It also matches the game well.

Plot: Satisfactory
Nearly all items, areas, characters and bosses have a degree of lore. Lore is not rich, but it is funny and fairly consistent (rarely seems clunky or patchy). Most characters have an actual legitimate reason to be in the mines. Spelunky 2 retains original lore, though it is greatly expanded upon.

Themes: Very Mild
Includes animated blood droplets and a Hindu goddess (Kali) that you can sacrifice things to. You can kill things like snakes and bats. Shop keepers are capable of being robbed as well as dying (and yes, being killed), though the second two can be hard to achieve. Barely any dark themes. Watch the intro, anything you might consider inappropriate would most likely be featured in it.

Very well done game, still reminiscent of the original but both expanded and refined.

Spelunky 2 is the sequel to the cult classic, critically acclaimed Spelunky. Spelunky 2 takes the difficulty that the first game was known for and ramps it up to its hypothetical limit. This game will test your patience & YOUR GAMER INSTINCTS as you get pummeled to death in hilarious and soul crushing ways.

The concept is easy enough to learn but hard to master, as you die countless times learning new strategies and learning what enemies and traps can instantly kill you and how to work around those. The variety of enemies, level generation, randomized encounters/treasures leaves the levels and gameplay feeling fresh each new run.

The gold and gems, shopkeepers, bombs and items, physics, the dynamic procedurally generated levels are addictive and make you want to keep coming back to play. Co-op multiplayer both couch and online works well, and I can have a lot of fun playing with friends. However, over a broad time period of playing the game, the negatives seems to always outweigh the positives, and I end up getting frustrated and wonder why I keep playing. My problem with the game is really only in two areas which if fixed would make the game a lot more fair and a lot more fun. I don't mind difficulty, and I don't mind instant deaths, but for a game to be fun it should have good controls and be fair. 

1) The controls are terrible. 1/3 of the things you do in this game end up being accidental because of horrible controls. 
A) Player movement is extremely clunky and not analog. Why is a game designed for modern consoles in 2020 using a control scheme of digital pad with hold R to go faster? If the developers only want to have 2 movement speeds, just let the Joystick slightly pressed be 1 speed and joypad 50% or further be the running speed. I don't understand why they have to make the game so clunky and uncontrollable where holding and unholding R just to get the correct speed is required to do basic things... (one speed is useless to get over obstacles, but is uncontrollable in close combat, making you unnecessarily run into enemies and spikes). Mario for SNES in 1983 had better controls. 
B) Throwing items is a complete crapshoot and half the time you have no idea where the thing you are throwing is going to land. Up throw, hit the ceiling riccochet off and kills you. Throw standing still, flies super far and over the thing you're aiming at. Throw down, flies too far to the right. Basic bomb, flies through enemies and way too far behind blowing up a shop keeper in a room you can't even see. Some items fly in a forward arc, some items fly diagonally and up to the right even when holding right. Why would you make the game so frustrating? Again even Mario from 1983 had predictable throw patterns that made the game skill based and fun to play, not random and causing game ending accidents that are 100% due to shitty controls. 
C) Who the hell would ever come up with a gameplay mechanic that punishes the player and makes them drop the item they are carrying if you stand near an edge for a few seconds? Easy answer: a developer who is trying to piss people off. 
D) Why does the whip have to have a .5 second delay to hit???? This mechanic is so stupid and frustrating to no end. A basic enemy can hit you if it appears before your stupid whip has enough time to hit them. 

2) Fix the stun bullshit in this game!! It makes zero sense that enemies stunned can't be hurt, but you can get stunlocked by enemies and chain hit with no way to struggle, and press buttons or move the joystick to wake up. Pick one or the other! Stun while hit or invincibility while stunned. The best option would be to just remove the stupid stun mechanic completely from the game. It's so stupid and frustrating for a platformer standing there waiting for enemies to wake up for 5 seconds to have to jump on them 3 times because if you pick them up they wake up and hit you in less than a second.",1689543883,1689543883,False,1,2,0.422094285488128662,4,True,False,False

This game is incredible. To start, it feels extremely polished, extremely finished, and doesn't feel like there would be any bugs. Though there are some bugs that happen *very* infrequently, they still don't change the playing experience.

..the playing experience, though...

This game is BRUTAL. Easily one of the hardest games ever made. After 315 hours of learning the games mechanics, how everything works, and being able to come up with scenarios in my head of how things will interact (and 99% of the time being correct), I am still finding new ways to die, some of them especially feel extremely unfair. I genuinely love this game though, its such a fun time (when youre not being loopkilled by shopkeepers or getting bullshitted in CO) when I'm playing it. The achievements have a nice challenge to them, and they definitely are extremely rewarding when you get them, especially The Full Spelunky.

The music and artstyle of this game is impeccable. I absolutely love the art in this game, from characters to enemies to bosses, all of them look incredible. The music is no different, it completely fits every place in the game, and the way it works in the files is very interesting, including the fluidity of the tracks.

This game is a solid 10/10. No question. The unfairness is only unfair for a small amount of time, you begin to learn how everything works, and you realize ""oh, I could have done this to prevent that from happening,"" and next time something like that happens, it feels good to have dodged it. This game is perfect, if not it is the closest game to it.

Final comments, I hate Dwellings, LISE Project my beloved, and fuck you Crocmen.

Spelunky 2 is a roguelike platformer, a very challenging one at that.

You make your way through different areas, each containing various deadly traps and enemies that can end your run in an instant if you're not careful or prepared. Every death can be frustrating, especially when it happens out of nowhere (Spelunky moment) but with knowledge and new discoveries comes confidence. What might have made you panic or anxious before, not knowing how to overcome it, is now only just a small problem in a bunch of other complications.

The improvements are quite nice, like better graphics, more precise movement and local/online multiplayer (Co-op/PvP).
Though if you're going for 100% completion you probably will be playing alone most of the time since a lot of the achievements require you to play non-seeded singleplayer runs.

You travel through different areas each with unique graphic and game-play styles. You can defeat bosses and there are [spoiler]multiple endings and secret areas[/spoiler]. You can also find, purchase or steal resources and items to help you with your journey.

It also has many improvements over Spelunky (HD).
Like better graphics, easier movement, a more expansive world and [b]multiplayer![/b] (online co-op/PvP)
Some things that were better in Spelunky (HD) were subjectively the music, the Kali sacrificing graphics, the Jungle's (area) atmosphere and somehow the feeling of nostalgia.

The online co-op with [u]random[/u] players can be a bit glitchy because of the online connection, but it's still playable. Though it can turn chaotic with players not always agreeing.

If you are playing through Steam though the online co-op connection is in my experience usually good.

Also you can play Arena which is a PvP game-mode but at time of writing this review not with random players. Only with bots or through Steam basically. This is probably because it would be even more chaotic than random online co-op due to the same elements mentioned above.",1688700912,1688870734,True,11,0,0.659973025321960449,0,True,False,False

The game is extremely addicting and fun, but the solo play is much better.
While playing with friends can be fun when your trying to kill each other, not having the shortcuts gets very annoying when trying to do something specific in a later on world.

People are afraid of Spelunky; thinking it's too hard, too luck-based, too bullshit, too scary, etc. From playing this game as much as I have, I can understand why people think that. However, I also believe that those people could not be more wrong. This game is fun at every turn. It's always new, always exciting, always entertaining, and the engine it runs in allows for an endless amount of creativity and ease. Movement feels very precise and smooth. Enemies feel very balanced and are fun to interact with. The game will present you with puzzles with multiple solutions and you, as the player, can decide which routes to take to solve them. Just watch Twiggle (May he rest in peace. He will always be one of the most iconic and influential people this community will ever see.) on YouTube and tell me you don't want to try this game for yourself!",1688688104,1688688104,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Many people found it frustrating, but it didn't require lightly reflexes to enjoy, just a bit of a mindset adjustment and a little persistence.  The excellent procedural generation encouraged persistence.  A ""mere mortal"" gamer could certainly get to level 13 or 14 (more than half way through).

Spelunky 2 ruins that finely balanced difficulty curve by giving you 4 too-easy levels followed by an impossible 5th.  Also an odd choice, the 4th level isn't procedurally generated, making it a bit of a grind after 5 or 10 games.

If you're a superhuman who can speedrun Spelunky 1 then this review doesn't apply to you.  Otherwise, give Spelunky 2 a miss (and go play the original classic!)

Spelunky 2 has a similar level of detail, only it feels more like the goal of developer, Derek Yu, was to turn the interactions between the world, the monsters, the traps and the items you can pick up into a Rube Goldberg machine that wants to kill you in the most hilarious way possible.

Art, music, sound, everything is amazing. It's a triumph of design, and an absolute joy to play. I'd strongly recommend reading as little about the game as possible, and playing and learning as you go - it's an intensely satisfying experience to test out different items in different situations just to find a little bit more about the caves yourself.

As a fan of Don't Starve, I decided to get another game in the Roguelike genre. The only memories of the original Spelunky I had was when I was a child; I played it once on my PS Vita, didn't like it, and got a refund. That was so long ago, however. My opinions had to have changed, right?

[h1]The Review[/h1]
The things I like about the roguelike genre is that
[olist]
[*] You can do anything... If you want to steal the items from the shopkeeper you can, but you'll probably get killed.
[*] The game tells you nothing. You have to figure things yourself. It was cool to see that [spoiler]I could blow up a turkey with a bomb to get an item that restores one health.[/spoiler]
[/olist]

Everything in this game can kill you. Threw a rock upwards to try and disarm that trap? Well, the rock has now fallen down right in your face, and you just lost a hit point. This game is extremely difficult, and that is not an overexaggeration. You will die [b]a lot[/b]. As of writing this review I did not make it to the third world yet.

The game is incredibly fun, however. The satisfaction from discovering a technique or a feature in the game to use to your advantage is a good feeling, as well as the confidence you feel when you are starting to get the hang of it (...only for it to be crushed by a poorly misplaced skeleton).

So should you play this game? It depends on the type of person you are. I will admit that this game is not for everyone.
I don't get mad whenever I lose in a video game, but that likely makes me part of a minority. If an arcade platformer game with randomly generated levels and where you will die to the most silly chain of events sounds interesting to you, go ahead and try it.",1688160749,1688160761,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Within the caves, a tale to tell.
A lizard in hand, mischief did brew,

And hurled the creature in a dance.
The lizard soared, an unexpected flight,
A moment's triumph, pure delight.

But Quillback, enraged, with fiery eyes,
Bore down upon me, swift demise.
Hyperspeed he gained, vengeance in stride,
My joy turned to fear, no place to hide.

His lethal charge, relentless and grand,
Ended my journey, fate's heavy hand.
A lesson learned, a price to pay,

Your moveset is limited, the rules are straightforward, and you can beat it in less than 20 minutes. But the content packed in this game is significant (hence the high playtimes that you'll see with many of the more dedicated players).

Past a few nitpicks, I have nothing but great things to say about this game. The design is meticulously crafted to reward smart play, and although you do get punished for rushing, the deaths force you to examine your own skill moreso than the game's perceived ""fairness."" If you played the first Spelunky, you may also be surprised by the beauty of this game. Particularly, the art on the bosses  inspires wonder and intimidation better than most triple A games.

If you are the kind of player who loves to sink their teeth into a game and figure out the inner workings of it, few games will satisfy you more than Spelunky 2. I highly recommend this game as a hallmark of the genre.

Update: now at 80 hours I've got the second ending and I'd like to add a few things that I've grown to love about this game. First, the soundtrack is subtly brilliant. Each biome has it's own genuine ""feel"" to it. Perfectly layered across the visuals is now a soundtrack that will fill you with hope, put you on edge, and lull you into a false sense of security depending on the location. Although a lot of changes have been more lateral compared to the first Spelunky, the soundtrack feels like an obvious candidate for a true improvement.

Upon additional play I have also realized how inspired the branching paths are in this game. Fans of the original Spelunky can find solace in the fact that Jungle and Temple are available to you, and they are a completely viable choice for every run, but for those looking for something new, you have Volcana and Tide Pool. Not only are both a breath of fresh air, but there are advantages to going to each depending on your run. Low on money and don't think the black market will be worth it? Volcana de-emphasizes money. Nervous about your ability to kill enemies? Tide Pool is easier to get through without a weapon. 

Past the moment to moment gameplay decisions, there is now an extra ""meta"" layer of decision making to think about your run on a broader sense when deciding which ""route"" you'd like to take, but never do you feel pigeonholed to choose one over the other. For instance, I will take the Volcana path even if I have tons of money just because I think Vlad's cape, an item you can only get in Volcana, is so phenomenal. Essentially, Spelunky 2 empowers the player to tailor their run as they see fit, which adds to the replayability of the game.",1615142155,1687040890,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For Spelunky 2 I wanted to make something got old fans excited and, also brought in new players. It was important that we didn't change the things that made Spelunky a unique experience in the first place.
So many people became fans of the game through their friends and family; and even strangers on the internet. 
That's one reason why we're adding online multiplayer, so that more people can play the game together. 
And I also wanted to include that feeling of community through the game itself, to make sure the game felt welcoming even though the game is difficult.

Spelunky 2 is one of those games where if you charge headfirst into danger carelessly, you're already dead. The game requires a lot of strategic thought and thinking ""what is that guy about to do?"" with enemy encounters and traps.

Spelunky 2 is also one of those games where you're probably better off throwing caution to the wind every once in a while, and doing something extremely stupid that will either get you and everything you knew killed, destroyed, or ruined, or will some-the-fuck-how work. Almost 75% of the time it's the former, but the latter feels AWESOME.

Spelunky 2 is ALSO one of those games that's super fun to beat normally, but also contains so many weird and stupid secrets that you'll find yourself cursing under your breath over how the hell someone found this.

Yes, level generation can make things difficult and yes, ridiculous Rube Goldberg level events can occur that end in your painful demise, but the majority of them can be avoided with knowledge and skill. I would compare the learning process of Spelunky 2 to rolling dice. As your base of knowledge and muscle memory grows, you begin to roll more and more dice every time you play the game. First couple runs you die easily, to a single factor, because you had only one or two dice to bet on and rolled poorly. By the time you have hundreds of hours, you'll have 50 dice in the game, and know how to use what you get, what to place your bets on. Yet even with all of that being taken into account, sometimes you bet on the wrong die, and sometimes everything comes up snake eyes.

Hit rules are inconsistent (you get hit multiple times in a row and always take damage even if stunned, but enemies get invincibility frames after one hit). The first game was also like this but Spelunky 2 ups the ante to ridiculous levels by increasing enemy spawning to uncontrolable levels.

Enemies like the mole or the armadillo can basically stunlock you to death regardless of your heath points. I have had armadillos kill me at 10HP because they stunlock me with roll attacks or launch me from one side of the level to the other onto spikes due to the poor physics.

I feel the random generation of the levels themselves has also gotten worse. level paths are often blocked by enemy placements that make it impossible to progress without taking damage or outright block the way forward unless you can use bombs or ropes, which often means you do not start with enough resources.

All of these are problems that the first game already had but which were made worse in this sequel. The path forward got harder but the player gets no rewards or incentive. If this works for you, great. I does not work for me.

The existence of alternate paths, secrets, choices and everything else all comes together and truly creates a one of a kind experience.

-Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!
-Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.
-Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).
-Spinach (variation): To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.
-Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.
-Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.
-Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.
-Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.
Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9×13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.
Top the noodles with some of the ricotta cheese mixture. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of noodles and sauce
Cover with foil and bake. Remove foil, top with mozzarella and parmesan, and bake for another 15 minutes.
Once you have prepared the meat sauce and the cheese mixture, you’re ready to layer. This is the order of layers:

sauce – noodles – cheese
sauce – noodles – cheese
sauce – noodles – cheese
noodles – sauce (bake) – cheese
Bake this lasagna recipe for a total of one hour. To get a perfect browned cheese topping, you’ll need to bake it in two stages.

Layer and cover it tightly with aluminum foil to retain the moisture.
Once cooked, and heated through, remove the foil, top with cheese, and return to the oven for an additional 15 minutes, or until the top is browned and the lasagna is bubbling.
Important: Let the Lasagna Rest

Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine). This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when reheating.

Serve with a big slice of Homemade Garlic Bread and garnish with fresh basil or a couple of tablespoons of parsley.

Finish the meal with a Caesar salad or Italian salad.",1683753874,1683753874,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I have come to terms that I most likely will never beat it. And I'm okay with that. I love pushing myself to just get as far as I can. The biomes are interesting with great music and tons and tons of secrets to find. Most of the time when you fail you'll know it was your fault (even if you don't want to admit it) but there are times where you will get rough seeds that are just the game laughing at your futile attempts. 

Again, this game is incredible. Be warned it is CBT though.",1683255708,1683255708,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

it's a dark, accursed, festering cesspool of broken hearts and forsaken dreams. a blightful place where a man's vitality and mental stability are drained to the point any memory of it is forever lost, and any hope for a better future is unceremoniously skewered in the same bloodied spikes countless naive explorers unwillingly sacrificed themselves along with their sanity. 

Spelunky's adorable artstyle hides a sinister deadly trap. behind the game's never ending promises of new secrets, treasures, and colorful NPC companions lies a snare that will not only cost the player its soul, but also the soul of any acquaintance who's unfortunate enough to hear their friend's desperate wailing and proceed to defy all warnings just to try their own luck in this ever hungry tormenting ground. 

everything in Spelunky 2 interacts amongst itself in a completely dynamic way. everything can be picked up, everything can be moved or destroyed, everything collides, everything reacts differently to specific stimuli, everything has a purpose, and that purpose is to make you suffer. sure it can also lead to countless other randomly generated chain-effect spectacles in this marvelous physics playground but make no mistake, the single main objective of every animated pixel in Spelunky is to ruin your life. 

Spelunky 2 has no fancy storyline or heroic duty to be fulfilled. you are a cute, round-nosed little girl in a yellow jacket looking for mom and dad in an ever changing sequence of dungeons that you are meant to freely explore until you reach the last boss or, realistically speaking, die horribly. and die you shall, not in the Dark Souls context of ""die until you learn enough and become sufficiently skilled to master the challenges at hand"", no. here you will die, again and again, forever. without ever becoming the master of anything other than your own screams of desperation.

people often ask themselves ""at what point exactly do you become good at Spelunky?"" and here's the secret, you don't. this is the genius of it all. the more you play, the more you learn. and the more you learn, the more you realize you don't know. along the dozens of hours sunken and the mountains of lifeless carcasses left behind, you will uncover all sorts of techniques. soon, you will be whipping dart trap arrows midair, handling awful item spawns with trickshot bomb throws, effortlessly robbing shopkeepers unscathed, and all of that will amount to absolutely nothing. because each personal improvement on your playstyle will be greeted by a new way for the game to murder you in the blink of an eye. 

you will be boasting an uncanny amount of health points and riches, holding a vast arsenal of exquisite items, wielding mighty armament that can lay waste to any living thing on your path, and soaring with your jetpack as if you were a god in human clothes... only to be struck in the back by a mosquito, land on a thorned vibe, thrown into the stratosphere by a witch doctor's attack while you're still recovering from the fall, and finally end down on the dirt, where a tiki man will stunlock you against a wall with his boomerang for the next 30 seconds before a carnivorous plant comes to feed on your bruised corpse. this is it, this is your adventure's ultimate reward.

you cannot beat Spelunky, because the game was not meant to be beaten. i don't mean that it's impossible to get to the end credits. but by the time you manage to gather enough resources and know-how in order to make it to the last boss you won't be even remotely interested in doing such a thing because all you'll be able to think about is what's behind the secret door in the secret egypt level, which can only be unlocked with the secret accessory purchased in the secret black market whose entrance needs to be located with the aid of the secret artifact from stage one. 

do you understand me now? sure, everything in Spelunky 2 is achievable. everything, except the thing you actually want to do. and what you're currently interested in doing will always change halfway through the journey of what you originally set to accomplish. the more you progress, the more you realize is yet to be discovered and coveted. this is the diabolical twist that keeps the cogs turning in this asymmetrical maze of perpetual disgrace.  

this ceaseless yearning and relentless pursuit of the unobtainable has had a devastating effect on my person. i became dismissive not only of my sleep schedule, my meals, and my social relations but also of the very games i consume. there was a point in time where i had access to two of the most anticipated titles of my life, legendary staples none other than ""God of War: Ragnarok"" and ""Elden Ring"", and yet, all i could dedicate my free time with a controller on hands was Spelunky. cutting-edge graphics and majestic visuals didn't matter, fascinating storytelling and next-generation combat mechanics didn't matter, rich lore and remarkable voice acting didn't matter. all that mattered... was Spelunky.

i often wonder about Spelunky's lead developer and his creative genius. i anxiously pray to whatever god may hear me that i never happen to come across him. for i strive to be a man of peace, and meeting Derek Yu in the real world would mean an unavoidable crash course with cold barbaric violence. this is what Spelunky has reduced me to. a wandering, dust covered, frenzied beast that mindlessly charges toward the next contraption that will inevitably end my life.

this game tells you very little, even its codex only provides vague descriptions of symbolic nature leaving the rest for the player to figure out during his ordeal. however, one of the first things the game tells you is that time and death work differently in the labyrinth. essentially a sugar-coated way of saying that you will lose all notion of time as you continue to walk this house of horrors, and that you shall never find any resemblance of comfort nor relief not even in the sweet embrace of death. you'll devolve into a hollowed husk of raw frustration and denial, frantically attempting to vent all of your untamed hatred at the nearest ragdoll of the abomination this game dares to call an earth mole.  

is Spelunky 2 a masterfully crafted roguelike and an exceptional gem of a game that excels in all departments?
Yes.
is it one of the most thrilling and all-around entertaining products i have ever come across?
Absolutely.
is it worthy of me recommending it to other people so they too may dive into this bottomless chasm of cyclic psychological abuse and self-indulgent masochism?
No.

i beg of you, steer clear from this place. sweep all thoughts of this game from your mind and never look back on it. for the only happiness that's in reach of those who have already been swallowed by this nightmare where we continue to atone for every sin committed in mankind's history, is the soothing thought of having spared others from the same wretched fate.

Spelunky 2 includes almost everything that the first game had, but also revamped the core gameplay tricks, mechanics, and threw in the perfect amount of new shit so that playing through spelunky 2 from the beginning, even with veteran knowledge of spelunky 1, feels like spelunky for the first time. Since most of the core tricks in spelunky 1 have been devilishly trampled on, you go through that loop with little knowledge and dying over and over again to bullshit only to get better and feel that same satisfaction.

I enjoy it but my nostalgia is VERY heavy, I could not and would not recommend this game to new players.

This is a perfect game. And I'd add that it's perfect for everyone.

It's perfect to play casually in my opinion. Yes, it can be frustrating, but I find myself playing Spelunky 2 just to kill some time while I watch some Youtube videos. You're always playing with no interruptions, it has a great pleasing art style and the perfect balance of variation and familiarity to keep you playing.

It's also perfect to play competetively. There is tons of stuff to unlock and explore and by going different routes you set your own difficulty. That alone can take you to up to one of the hardest gaming challenges there is.

The game design is flawless in my opinion, everything has it's purpose and allows for a multitude of strategies to figure out and it's much more complex than it first appears to be.

The price is more than fair. I'd buy it any day for the full price if I could only experience it again for the first time.

Too much bs imo. The game play itself is fun but it's just too frustrating to die to something falling from offscreen killing you, an alien explosion angering the shopkeep, or getting hit once into getting combed by other things that kill you. I did beat Tiammat using the frosty caves checkpoint after having to look up how to beat her but it just didn't feel satisfying like other difficult games do. Theres some mechanics I think are fun and have a good bit of depth like stealing from the store and killing the shopkeeper or trying to leave him alive to be forgiven but theres also just some that are impossible to figure out without looking them up like the moyai statue.

It's somewhere in the cosmic ocean, failing to take a decision on its own)

[b]KEY PROS:[/b]
1. It's HARD! I mean it's true game as we 80s kids LOVE! Definitely buy it if you love challenges!
2. Lode Runner meets Indiana Jones meets Minecraft. Without mining and crafting. Put a grain of RNG in this and sip some Isaac then let cook at INSANELY HIGH temperqatures. 
3. GREAT [who cares about it] STORY, fits in the universe.
4. The ""Beta"" online multiplayer is far beyond what AAA companies call ""beta"" nowadays. Unless you have toaster PC.
5. Influential game. In my game ColorBlend FX the amount of Spelunky references is unmatched. Spelunky is THAT damn good, and I really can't stress enough how I love this game.
6. Great developers and great designer! Derek, mush love. NWDD you too <3
7. Excellent community and even though the game have no official modding support, the modding scene actually makes the game. The developers even allow you to play custom level packs online with your friends
8... im getting too tired about writing this... 

[b]KEY CONS:[/b]
1. It's HARD! I mean it's true game as we 80s kids LOVE! Only buy it if you love challenges!
2. If you still consider 1 a con, and only like AAA/shooters, then go away newb!
3. If you didnt felt insulted by 2, at least TRY the game. Steam Remote Play for example...
4. If you still didnt tried the game somehow, try it.
5. If the game really feels hard for you, then i forfeit, you defeated me, it's a horrible game for you but that's just you, not my issue :D

Despite this, it still stays true to what made the original so great. Like I said at the start, I think it's as much a 9.9/10 sequel as it is a 9.9/10 game.

Original review:
There are quite a few design choices in this that just make no sense to me. It's not because it's different to Spelunky, but that it's pointlessly different to Splenuky. There's no point to the side areas available in levels. Also half of 1-4 is exactly the same in every single playthrough. Chucking Olmec in as a mid level looks like another 'let's just do this to surprise people lol', but doesn't help the flow of the game at all.

Just downright weird across the board. Some stuff in it is quite nice though, but on balance the pacing seems all messed up.",1602439322,1677780215,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I put in hundreds of hours into the first game and consider it a classic. It was difficult, but after a couple dozen hours of gameplay you got most of the game down and can enjoy the real fun, being able to relax and explore each level at your leisure.  The game was cruel, but fair.

Spelunky 2 is not a game that offers that experience and sadly after 89 hours of playing I've had to come to terms with that fact. The game is overly difficult, the music isn't very good, the gameplay changes from the original are practically a detriment, you never feel like you're able to really accomplish anything because of how much easier it is to die, and most importantly its just not much fun.

The game never allows you to really relax or explore like in the first one, The crackhead moles on the dwelling area who you pretty much have to spend the time to kill because it takes twice as much effort to run away from them at times. The ridiculously small hitboxes of the mosquitos from the Jungle area are almost as bad as the thorny walls that you're gonna bump into with your last one or two hit points.
The lavamen and the lava liquid spread from the Volcano will randomly end an amazing run in an instant. Keep in mind these are JUST the first 2 levels of a run.

If these weren't bad enough you also have to now deal with unreliable hitboxes on both enemies, lava, and traps that will end a run faster than a black out. You can be just out of range on several of these and the game will still say you take the hit. Sadly ladders, ropes, and platform edges can also be unreliable and at times, especially when they count.

The level design now has removed a lot of the more open exploring feel the first game had and instead has everything whittled down to maybe two paths and a few dead ends and the game feels incredibly claustrophobic and lacks a more open feel. While the original had a lot of claustrophobic design in the level layout it still maintained some open areas, several settings lack this in the sequels randomly generated map layout and it lacks variety in a lot of the maps as a whole. The Dwelling is especially hit by this.

The games soundtrack is hit or miss. I loved the music in the original and while this games soundtrack does have some really nice tunes, several of them feel flat and bland. Also I was surprised that each setting now only has 1 soundtrack, where as in the first game each setting had several ones which helped create a really unique feel and was always a pleasure to listen too. But with the same soundtrack just endlessly looping until you finish the setting and move onto the next it gets pretty monotonous. Shout out to the Tide Pool soundtrack actually making me want to go to sleep -_-

But the real irritation is you cannot play this game the way you played the first one. Thats an instant death. You have to practically start over and if you spent a couple hundred hours on the first one you have that muscle memory kick in and get penalized for it. Thats not exactly an easy adjustment to make :/

There was an lot of anarchistic to the first game which was a lot of fun and kept you on your toes, but unfortunately this game takes that concept and gives it a steady supply of crack. There are times when you'll find out its just easier to commit suicide in a run rather that continue on and thats honestly a very depressing thing to admit. It feels almost counter productive to try to learn how the game works as I did with the first one because no matter how hard you try, this games randomness will just keep you from ever really going anywhere.

I'm no slouch to Spelunky and its not easy to say that a game is too hard, and I don't want to sound like a games journalist but Spelunky 2 is way too hard. There is an amazing game inside here, but the new design approach to trying to kill you every strep of the way combined with random elements that never allow you to really relax and have fun with the game, isn't fun at all. I'm saying this after the Mole enemy changes from a few days back too.

This isn't a game you can sit down and really have fun with as I did with the first one, and despite all the things in this game I really love, the new Olmec fight, the Temple of Anubis, the hidden levels within each level and the side quests, the non stop difficulty keeps me from getting to savor these moments because you can't enjoy what happened if you die a quarter second later from a Mole, or Lava, or flying saucer that got blown up across the map and ended up launched at you.

Spelunky 2 needs a lot more adjustments to it than just the mole issue on the Dwelling setting. If Jesus Christ was in a world made of video games then Spelunky 2 would be both the nails and his cross.

On the other hand, Spelunky 2 is a great game, but it fails to capture the same feelings of mystery and adventure as Spelunky HD. I like it a lot, but there were points where I wanted to stop playing. 

What I loved: Figuring out the secrets! There's just enough clues for an experienced Spelunky HD player to piece together most of the secrets. This was the highlight of the game for me. I also like the graphics, the smooth animations and the tighter movement feel.

Complaints: Like many others, I think that the first area is a chore to get through. Other than that, I hate how underwhelming the ""casual"" ending is - it offers no sense of accomplishment - instead lulling you towards the much, much harder endings. Dying is also not very fun in this game - maybe I just need to learn to laugh it off. This game cannot be played casually, though. You have to focus, and maintain that focus for a long time. To see all the build-up to a good run go down the drain just because you lost focus for a millisecond  is not fun, and sometimes it's not even your fault!

Denial
In the first stage of the grieving process, denial helps us minimize the overwhelming pain of loss. As we process the reality of our loss, we are also trying to survive emotional pain. It can be hard to believe we have lost an important person in our lives, especially when we may have just spoken with them the previous week or even the previous day.

During this stage in grieving, our reality has shifted completely. It can take our minds time to adjust to our new reality. We reflect on the experiences we've shared with the person we lost, and we might find ourselves wondering how to move forward in life without this person.

This is a lot of information to explore and a lot of painful imagery to process. Denial attempts to slow this process down and take us through it one step at a time, rather than risk the potential of feeling overwhelmed by our emotions.

Anger
The second stage in grieving is anger. We are trying to adjust to a new reality and are likely experiencing extreme emotional discomfort. There is so much to process that anger may feel like it allows us an emotional outlet.

Keep in mind that anger does not require us to be very vulnerable. However, it may feel more socially acceptable than admitting we are scared. Anger allows us to express emotion with less fear of judgment or rejection.

Anger also tends to be the first thing we feel when starting to release emotions related to loss. This can leave us feeling isolated in our experience. It can also cause us to be perceived as unapproachable by others in moments when we could benefit from comfort, connection, and reassurance.


Bargaining
When coping with loss, it isn't unusual to feel so desperate that you are willing to do anything to alleviate or minimize the pain. During this stage in grieving, you may try to bargain to change the situation, agreeing to do something in return for being relieved of the pain you feel.

When bargaining starts to take place, we often direct our requests to a higher power, or something bigger than us that may be able to influence a different outcome. Bargaining during the grieving process can come in the form of a variety of promises, including:

""God, if you can heal this person, I will turn my life around.""
""I promise to be better if you will let this person live.""
""I'll never get angry again if you can stop him/her from dying or leaving me.""

Bargaining comes from a feeling of helplessness and gives us a perceived sense of control over something that feels so out of control. During bargaining, we tend to focus on our personal faults or regrets. We might look back at our interactions with the person we are losing and note all the times we felt disconnected or may have caused them pain.

It is common to recall times when we may have said things we did not mean and wish we could go back and behave differently. We also sometimes make the drastic assumption that if things had played out differently, we would not be in such an emotionally painful place in our lives.


Depression
During our experience of processing grief, there comes a time when our imaginations calm down and we slowly start to look at the reality of our present situation. Bargaining no longer feels like an option and we are faced with what is happening.

In this stage of grieving, we start to feel the loss of our loved one more abundantly. Our panic begins to subside, the emotional fog begins to clear, and the loss feels more present and unavoidable.

In those moments, we tend to pull inward as the sadness grows. We might find ourselves retreating, being less sociable, and reaching out less to others about what we are going through. Although this is a very natural stage in the grieving process, dealing with depression after the loss of a loved one can be extremely isolating.


Acceptance
The last of the 5 Stages of Grief is acceptance. When we come to a place of acceptance, it is not that we no longer feel the pain of loss. Instead, we are no longer resisting the reality of our situation, and we are not struggling to make it something different.

Sadness and regret can still be present in this phase. But the emotional survival tactics of denial, bargaining, and anger are less likely to be present during this phase of the grieving process.",1676876663,1676876755,True,1,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,False

We can do it all, we can run up all the digits
You can spend it all, baby, you don't got a limit
I know I'ma fall when you switch up and you finished

[Verse 3]
I made a wish
I swear that I'ma make her mine, that bitch gave me a kiss
I swear it feels so candid when you're with me and we click
She got me on a roll and she got me doin' tricks
Swear she the only one that make me feel like this
Mad, bitch, we got these bitches mad
I want my bitches bad, want my bitch to get attached

I played it for like 15 minutes and I didn't get the appeal.

Gameplay is feels polished and visually simple, but mechanically feels right. There are some nice simulation elements like objects can bounce off surfaces and hurt you. Enemies are vulnerable to same stuff you are. 

Now to get to why I don't recommend it...
[b]Gameplay loop[/b]
[list]
[*] Get in
[*] (sometimes) Solve the problem of getting where you need to go.
     The path can be blocked, in a difficult to reach place, guarded by enemies, or just over a line of traps.
[*] Die to something random. Some examples: 
   [list] 
      [*] A mole appears with very little notice and destroys you if you're not ready
      [*] Something (lots of candidates) stun-locking you and pushing you into spikes
      [*] Your own bomb bouncing back at you and stunning you to then finished you off)
   [/list] 
[*] Hopefully learn from the experience and restart
[/list]

The process of learning involves both learning controls (like tossing the bomb just right, or platforming) and learning the dangers of the caves. That improves your chances, but does not guarantee success as something random can happen (sometimes off-screen) and you will inevitably die.

Rewards for success includes a few shortcuts, unlockable characters (cosmetic) and beating the game.

To put it bluntly [b]it's a lot of effort for rewards that don't excite me at all[/b].

Spelunky 2 isn't a wolf in sheep's clothing...it's a wild dominatrix in PVC leather with a whip in cute cuddly clothing. 

Don't let the cute graphics fool you: Spelunky 2 wants to hurt you and it will make you beg for more.

I bought the original on Steam and PS4 and now I have this one on Steam and both games are 10/10 masterpieces. Tonnes of content, secrets, levels, items enemies.

Easily hundreds of hours of gameplay here and another example of indie gaming being far superior to the AAA garbage the big companies shovel out.

The only caveat is you have to like this type of game. It will hurt you. It will break your heart. You have to like that. It's the point. Ignore the whiners who complain it's too difficult.

Play Spelunky 2. Love it. Grow addicted.

Spelunky 2 is a fun Platformer/Roguelike game where you explore the moon and die. No really you will die a lot. 
It's the kind of game where you need to learn everything (Enemies, bosses, areas, items). You will play awful the first few hours, then you will see yourself improving, and die again... 
It's a really fun game though, it's addicting and there is online multiplayer even (I don't play multiplayer myself lol). 
Prepare yourself to spend a few hundreds of hours to complete the base game and all the achievements there is.
Add an other few hours to complete the last area of the game (Or don't, I respect that choice too).
I spent 2300 hours and just to say that i pretty much mastered that game in almost every possible ways. I consider myself as a master of the game despite not being a speedrunner. I still find it fun even though i start lacking stuff to do. Even after 2300 hours which is quite something to think about.

It wouldn't cheat you on the times it killed you. When you died, most of the time you knew you made a mistake. It had new fun things to explore and made you feel as though you earned it. Spelunky 2 added a lot of new things to  explore, but most of the time it feels like the best way to advance is to avoid anything you might find interesting or fun in the game and even then some of the traps are unavoidable like a bear trap hidden behind a plant. It also feels as though a lot of the challenge they tried to add was just apmming guys in a single area so it is not necessarily difficult to get through, but tedious.

This is a VERY hard game to recommend.  The game is, at it's core, some sadist's way to dealing with the fact that they were relentlessly bullied in school and is using this game to exact revenge on the anyone dumb enough to play it.  At least, that's what it feels like.  I recommend you play with a friend, that way being killed OVER AND OVER by the game's chickensh!t mechanics are not as frustrating.  I repeat, DO NOT PLAY ALONE.  You will want to break your controller after about 15 minutes of play.  Also,  I really hope you like the first biome as you'll be spending almost all of your time there.  That's why I hesitate to recommend it.  It's relentless, unforgiving and there is no difficulty curve.  It starts a 11, rips the knob off and runs away with it...and then goes up from there.  As a programmer, I can say that it's not RNG that screws you up but the design itself.  There is no way some of the Rube-Goldberg-like series of events (throw a rock, have it bounce off something off screen, spring an arrow trap which hits you, knock you down a pit and you get stun locked but a punching trap) is random.  It has to be carefully designed to screw you over and it is.  The player stun lasts too long, the enemy stun is too short, the whip has a laughably short range and stunned enemies take less damage where as player takes full damage while stunned.  The game is so weighted against the player that it loses it's charm REALLY quickly and becomes a tedious slog through the same areas over and over.  I recommend it only for the multiplayer experience.  Otherwise, this game and whom ever thought it would be fun to make a long game where the player only ever sees the first few levels because even if you do everything perfectly, there is no way to anticipate what garbage the game will pull next is clinically insane.",1673044653,1673044801,True,3,0,0.508771955966949463,0,True,False,False

I bomb a turkey, I die almost immediately after.
I let a magman blow up a shopkeep's items, I die almost immediately after.
I stomp on a leprechaun going after its gold in greed, I die almost immediately after.

It is the easily accessible game that teaches us all about karma. The no-nonsense, nonbiased way of introducing it. Once you get the hang of things, this 'karma' in this game, you'll get why you died in the game about exploring caves on the moon, in search of your long lost parents.

Although the cave systems may look hard to get around it is ultimately really easy. As you play the game the levels and worlds get harder to play and there are different mechanics. You may die a lot but you can always come back. The bosses are absolutely INSANE and there are a lot of secret achievements and a multitude of possibilities. As you can see i only have 40+ hours so I'm kind of new at this as well but I can say that I have had a great time. This is a game I will never ever give up no matter how hard it gets. There is also a really really cute animal that gives u little hearts when you bring her to the door (I personally like the cat but there's also a dog and hamster). 

Sincerely Signed,
Gamer",1672616733,1672616733,True,1,0,0.50151979923248291,0,True,False,False

Perhaps I just disagree with the design principle of the game but I found it extremely boring. I got to the forest level/near the end of it so I never beat the game. I did die/instant restart A LOT in 3 hours which I don't mind. Dying a lot is fine but again... the game just doesn't seem to have anything that makes it fun.

The combat feels very one dimensional (I know its a platformer). There are way too many 1 shot kill traps as well. People recommended looking up YouTube videos to see how to ""play better"" but honestly that shouldn't be necessary. The game's tutorial mostly shows you how to move around but explains nothing about the games mechanics, goals, etc. From what I am reading I am guessing this game was mostly just made for people who already played the 1st one.

There is also no unlock/meta progression. You just start a new run and see what you get. I actually really like that concept but the execution of this game fell flat for me.

I don't think this is a bad game necessarily but after playing it for 3 hours I am not sure why I would keep going. The theme seems to be: avoid instant kill traps, get money, see if you get cool items at a shop and rescue your pet so you can get health.",1672499048,1672499048,False,5,1,0.473092347383499146,0,True,False,False

P.S
A lot of people say the game is bad because the multiplayer is garbage and i don't see what they mean :l. Yeah, the game has issues, but theyre adding it to a game that where it's first was a local coop only game, so give them time. Theyre probably working on other things at the same time

You have to be prepared to ""fail."" A LOT. And by ""fail"" I mean die and start all over with naught but a little more knowledge than you had before. Fortunately, thanks to the artstyle and physics-based interactions, deaths tend to be really funny, as long as you haven't died that way a hundred times already. But that, too, could make the 101st funny in its own right. If you can handle that, this game is for you.

The overarching gameplay loop revolves around exploring, dying, and learning. Every enemy and trap has very specific, predictable behavior, like how far away an arrow trap detects you, how quickly a lion trap activates its spears, or how a horned lizard behaves at 1 HP versus above 1 HP. As you play, you start to build up an understanding of how to approach every hazard both individually and in combination with each other. It's really satisfying to see yourself improve, and that's much of what I enjoy about the game. There's almost always more to learn.

Just one single run involves a whole lot of choices: ""Should I face this enemy to reach that crate?"" ""Should I use a resource here?"" ""Which world would fit my run better?"" ""What do I spend my money on?"" ""Could I get away with robbery?"" The combination of risk assessment and equipment-gathering is something really fantastic, and it keeps bringing me back and saying ""one more run."" One arguable flaw here is that you are basically forced to interact with most hazards if you want to learn from them, which is kind of the antithesis of the game's ""take your time! be careful!"" mentality, but thanks to the beauty that is unlockable shortcuts, you can practice with minimal consequences all you want. (Except if you want to go to the Temple. Or to any secret areas. For that you need mods.)

Exploration as a whole is also pretty fun, especially figuring out how all the secret paths work. There's some major ones that lead to different areas and endings, but there's also some NPC ""sidequests"" as well. I can't comment on what it's like to discover all the secrets yourself because I followed the community early on and they figured out so much of it so quickly, but I imagine it's pretty rewarding. It's certainly rewarding to actually get to those secret areas.

Two difficulty nitpicks here. For a beginner, the first world (the game's structured Mario Bros.-style) takes a LONG time to get a handle on. The game has a high skill floor I guess. Most people start to feel the Dwelling doldrums eventually, even in its current, toned-down state (compared to v1.0). On the opposite end, there's an endgame area related to a 100% optional secret ending that I (with 950 hours of experience (often distracted by podcasts in the background)) have never finished once. I still try, but it's just unreasonably unforgiving. (Derek Yu wasn't sure anyone would be able to beat it iirc. They have, though. Damageless. That ain't me though.) It also breaks the roguelike's promise of a short run you don't need a save & quit button for, which kinda sucks. But because it's totally optional, recognized as unbalanced, and very unlikely for the average player to even attempt, I've consciously kept it from skewing this review.

Aesthetically the game is really clean. Some will prefer Spelunky HD's artstyle, and most prefer its catchy gamey music to 2's dynamic and fitting background music, but I think 2's works very well. The visuals are very clear, aside from the odd red structure in Tide Pool that you forget is actually a physical barrier and not in the background. The sound design is fantastic too; if something weird happens offscreen, you can make a guess as to what it was based on the sound. I'm not sure I'd call the art ""pretty"" most times -- it's pleasing, but it seems to be more functional than aesthetic. But you can decide that based on the promo images and video.

I haven't played co-op at length, but I have had more fun watching experienced players play with inexperienced ones in Spelunky and Spelunky 2 than I have had fun watching just about any other gaming content. It helps a ton if you're familiar with your co-op partner(s) and if you can talk in person or on a call, but online co-op can also be fun, though it mostly consists of highly experienced players and/or sabotaging trolls. Not much you can do about that.

There...I mean, there is a PvP Arena mode, but while it can be fun and chaotic, it's mostly a gimmick. You might very well enjoy it though.

Last comment: mods. Modding is very easy and convenient with modlunky2, and there's lots of stuff done and in progress. There's Overlunky for practicing stuff, Fingerspit's remix mod for a huge rearrangement of the game's features, Jawnlunky (my personal favorite) for room variety and other minor tweaks, multiple kaizo maps, mods adding new items or abilities, in-progress metroidvania and ""99"" (a la Tetris 99) mods, and plenty of aesthetic retextures. These are the reason I'm still playing after all this time, to be honest, and why I highly recommend the PC version.

God. I said it wasn't going to be long. I told myself it wouldn't be long. This is what Spelunky 2 does to you, folks. You think you're gonna be there for 20 minutes and you look at the time and it's 3 hours later. (Buy it. It's good.)",1669223033,1669929061,True,34,1,0.800933957099914551,0,True,False,False

This game took the formula and gameplay loop from its predecessors and expanded and refined it in such a manner that one could call it ""perfect."" One of Spelunky's greatest strengths as a roguelike is that everything is set the moment you step in the level and everything moves and interacts normally even without you being on the screen, with the exception of a few enemies that spawn other enemies. However, it's not like a caveman or bat can pop out of existence. 

The consistency of the Spelunky formula is what gives birth to both high-level optimizations and the classic Spelunky shenanigans most people know and probably love. Traps will be set off because an enemy set it off before you came across them, your pet could be dead before reaching it because of something offscreen killing it. There is no entity that spawns in a level that is an exception to the game. It makes the game about as random as it gets because of all the potential unique interactions, but also probably the most skill-based roguelike I own. The game gives you good indicators of enemy patterns and the stage generation pulls from a consistent pool of shapes. You can learn everything you need to improve in Spelunky by paying attention. You can beat the game without using any items, and you can easily lose with gear that, in other games, would basically win you the game. Spelunky 2 balances some of the more absurd elements of Spelunky HD while also adding brand new dangers to keep you observant. It perfectly leverages risk and reward by accounting for how the world can interact with your character and the items you collect- the game keeps you on your toes at all times. You are never better than the game, one wrong step and your back accessory explodes or you get flung into a pit of spikes. 

Despite this, the Spelunky series, and particularly 2, is an absolutely perfect casual experience as well. The consistent chaos and pretty low average time for a run (assuming you don't intend to truly push yourself, which this game also accounted for) make booting up the game and playing for half an hour so much fun. You don't have to account for all the interacting variables, you can just breeze through a few levels, die/win, and have your fun with the game. You may be slapped into a virtual Rube Goldberg machine that flings you across the map and kills you, but that's just a part of the experience. Playing with friends is also a blast. The game makes everything* play by its rules, including all your friends together. Whipping, throwing, and killing your friends is absolutely on the menu and equally as, if not more, fun as trying to beat the game together. No matter who you are, Spelunky 2 can either offer a challenge or a casual, fun (but potentially infuriating) gaming experience that can kill a few hours easily.

Its really just more Spelunky its bigger and better levels are more interesting secrets are harder and strategies are almost entirely new. 

One thing I love about 2 way more than 1 is that each run varies a lot more with 2 because in 1 once you where good enough it mostly boiled down to killing shopkeepers and avoiding anything that could insta kill you. In Spelunky 2 while doing what you did in spelunky 1 can work its just not the only useable strategy you can still just buy from shops and still easily get enough money to buy important items, or if youre short on cash you could steal and hope for shopkeeper forgiveness by not killing them, or you could go full phyco murderfest and just kill every shopkeeper you see like in spelunky 1 but with even more difficulty since shopkeepers will go even more out of their way to kill you than in 1. this isnt even mentioning the different routes and worlds you can go to that lead to diffrent ways to get secrets. 

but there still is a reason i think 1 is more enjoyable (keyword being enjoyable not better). This is because i feel a lot of deaths feel completely unfair and out of your control. While it also happened in the first likebeing stunlocked by a yeti or a shopkeep or dart trap from off screen you couldnt react to but in two are a lot more of those. I'm not going to say what can cause them since i want to avoid spoiling anything since if your reading this you probably want to play the game. 

all and all good game but damn it really feels not fun when dying is so much more not fair most of the time esp when compared to spelunky 1. its still fun but in my opinion not as fun as spelunky 1 and much more of a slog that can be rewarding much more rewarding if all the stars line up.

Presentation is stellar, controls are tight, but the ennemy quantity and trap placement is very frustrating. I have acquired a lot of traversal skills during my 42 hours of play, I pushed myself through the levels, unlocking all the shortcuts and finally beating the final boss only to be ganged up on by 3 moles in level 1-1 when I started a new playthrough. No matter how good you are, Spelunky 2 will fuck you over for no apparent reason. It's a shame, because with few tweaks it could become one of my favourites games ever. A little less ennemies, less traps, tweaks to hitboxes could make for a far more enjoyable experience in the sense it'd allow the player to think about builds more carefully than he would do in this version of spelunky 2 since he knows he'll get shat on by some alien falling from out of screen after grinding for gold and items during the previous few levels.

Edit - Started playing Spelunky HD again for comparison, reached final boss in 3 runs...
Spelunky 2 is just way too hard for its lenght.

Edit 2 - Took me about 70 hours to get it. I suppose it's addictive but man it is playing with my nerves. Switching my review to positive for now, online is a blast.

this beautiful co-op roguelike takes place in the caves of the moon as you explore deeper you find new characters to play as, new enemies to face, and new friends to help.

as this is a roguelike after every run you are sent back to the start,  and you get sent back a lot this is a very hard game to master but don't let that discourage you, sometimes you die and just can't help but laugh do to the main appeal of spelunky2 and its predecessor,  unique chunk rng that makes every run completely different,  over time you start to die in more and more crazy ways,  and while you will start to notice patterns no run is the same,  paired with the gimmick of only being able to carry one thing at a time makes this game that much more challenging.

Spelunky 2 is a game for people who enjoy very detailed game progression, however skill and luck based, and not grind based. However, as a beginner I recommend using controller or figuring out some ungodly keyboard combination to play the game with. Spelunky 2 is by far the hardest video game I've ever played (and beaten!) and it still manages to give that spike of fucking dopamine every time I play. 

Even if you get bored as well, there's multiplayer, which can (sometimes) make the game easier.

                                 - SPELUNKY IS HARD -
   Spelunky 2 is a fun game for people up to the challenge, and I enjoy it a lot. It takes a while to get into though, and is extremely tough for anyone playing the game and trying to reach a new goal. It often takes hundreds of attempts to reach that goal, and many people will likely get frustrated and leave before accomplishing it. It can be mentally draining, but the sense of accomplishment and the funny things you can discover make it worth the grind.
                                 - THE SECRETS -
   There is a lot to discover in this game, and you can certainly spend hundreds of hours cracking the code of getting the secret endings, like reaching a second boss and two whole new worlds, the latter of which took ages even for the best of players to find the end of, and the theory was that it went on forever, so most people won't even come close to finishing it.
                                 - IT FEELS UNFAIR -
   A common joke in the Spelunky 1&2 community is named Spelunked, and is the event of a spectacular thing out of the player's control ruins their run. This happens a lot, and sometimes it's funny, but sometimes it feels awful and I know for a fact that people have rage quit this game because of it. Another thing I don't like is the lack of balance in some of the mechanics.
                                 


                                 If you read after spoiler warning, return here for my conclusion.
   This game is only for the most resilent people and I would advise caution in playing if you don't feel you fall into that category. This game is the ultimate test of your strength, but if you pass, the game really is enjoyable.

Spelunky 2 is a fantastic sucessor to the originall spelunky keeping the same feel that made the original so great but adding layers and layers onto it. The hard but rewarding gameplay makes you want to improve to get further but never makes you feel like the game cheated you out of a life but instead making you feel like ""i could have done that better"". The amount of unlockables and mystery surronding the game also helps with wanting you to keep playing as you get better while being able to unlock see more and unlock more of the game. The overall controlls and feel of the game is also marevlous and i never felt like i was out of controll  of my own actions. Lastly the soundtrack is nothing to write home about but it acompanies the game so well that i still keep it on while playing.

[h1]The Pros[/h1]
- Huge amount of content. You will find yourself discovering new items, secrets, strategies and interactions while playing.
- An addicting and satisfying game play loop, the game is always changing and it will always keep you on your toes.
- Beautiful graphics that are very easy to read and process. 
- A fun multiplayer / co-op experience. Spelunking the caves with friends is always interesting, and can have great high moments and hilarious interactions.
- Difficult but rewarding achievements and secrets. There are still things i haven't discovered despite pouring countless hours into the game!

[h1]The Cons[/h1]
- Despite being the first level, the beginning area is brutal. I find myself losing most of my runs to the start of the game. It is filled with way more traps and hazards compared to the other areas of the game. Many of my friends have actually dropped the game because of the sheer difficulty of the starting area. This is pretty much the complete opposite of the first game, where the first area was simple, but still had a challenge.

- Unless you are playing with friends, I cannot recommend playing online with strangers. It is beyond easy to grief players in this game so pretty much all random matches result in people leaving, or immediate conflict.

- This game is very difficult to new / inexperienced players. There are a lot of variables to keep count of while playing, and from my experiences with others it can be a major turn off for people. Unless you are willing to put hours into this game, I cannot recommend it to the average player.

Overall, Spelunky 2 is a timeless rouge-like with alot of content to offer. If you enjoyed the first game, or have played other rouge-likes I would highly recommenced giving it a try.",1667812933,1667812933,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The movement is extremely slippery, mobs' hitboxes feel incredibly unforgiving, you very often get soft-locked if you run out of bombs or ropes, the shopkeeper shows no remorse and will start blastin at you if you even so as spit in his general direction. The mobs are deceptively strong, no matter how used to the controls you get every mob kill, even just bugs or bats is a struggle. There are very few I-frames after getting hit, so most mobs can stun-lock you to death regardless of your hp (Do NOT test the armadillo). This game will crush you in so many ways from getting trampled, poisoned, cursed, blasted, impaled, crushed, or incinerated which end the run instantly, despite Monty's best effort to give the player a sizable health pool, sending you back to the gloriously monotonous theme of the first stage. Wanting to get back to where you were, you might want to try to speed past the first few stages, however clearing stages has to be slow and meticulous because there are traps around every single corner. Runs are always dependent on the rng of the items of the shopkeeper. Even if you get cool items like the teleporter, you'll probably accidentally teleport into a wall and die instantly. Simply wanting to tame a turkey will likely lead to your death as it randomly runs around and jumps into a spike pit or an arrow trap. In Coop, accidentally killing your friends is so common that the best strategy is to split up. Even after someone dies they become a ghost and can kill you by freezing or tripping you.

With Spelunky 2, Mossmouth has been taken the original game, broken it down to its individual parts, and tweaked those parts to make them different, better, or more expansive, then assembled them all in a much different way, filling in the cracks with brand new content. There is a lot to like here, especially for die hard Spelunky fans who have squeezed as much enjoyment as they could out of the original game. Mossmouth saw what you were capable of, and built this game to challenge YOU at its very highest levels of play. At its most basic level of play, it is a bit more difficult than Spelunky in many ways, while offering new ways to survive. At its most complex level of play, it is a brutally difficult, complex, and nuanced challenge with many ways to get to the very, very end; one that few players will get to. It is a much bigger difference than the two endings of the original Spelunky; the multiple endings of this game are of vastly different difficulties.

This variety is what leads to this game's biggest strength: more ways to play Spelunky. Even if you haven't beaten Olmec in the first game, the amount of things you can do in this one is remarkably refreshing, and gives you more ways to enjoy the Spelunky experience. It can be easy to experience burnout when playing a one of a kind game such as Spelunky, and giving you more ways to enjoy the experience will allow you to improve much faster at the overall skill. Playing Spelunky 2 greatly improved my ability to play Spelunky 1 after going back to it, and, after playing Spelunky 1 for a while with a much fresher mindset, suffering less burnout from repeated plays, I went back to Spelunky 2 and discovered that I had gotten much better at it. It's a neverending cycle that probably would occur even if Spelunky 2 didn't have the variety it did, but is greatly helped by the fact that it DOES have that variety, and it improves this game's experience as a whole, even when playing it on its own.

It is with all this in mind that I highly recommend playing this game, but probably after playing and getting familiar with Spelunky first. You don't have to get good at it; you just have to get a feel for what its all about. That being said, it's perfectly possible to play this game first, enjoy it, and then play the first game. There are no rules; I can only verify that, in my own experience, playing and watching other people play the first game really allowed me to appreciate Spelunky 2. That's another thing; read up on, discuss, or watch others play these games; it really improves the experience.

Just remember that the joy of the game should be how you tackle each run; not your ability to beat the game. If you concentrate only on whether you beat it or not, you will just end up dissapponting yourself. You will get there eventually.",1667715251,1667715251,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Spelunky 2 is, as the name suggests, a sequel to the classic Indie roguelite Spelunky by Derek Yu. It was released on 29 September 2020. developed by [b]Derek Yu's Mossmouth and Bitworks and self-published by Mossmouth[/b]. I have a ton of hours in this game as you can see. I, in many ways, having revisited Spelunky HD before revisting Spelunky 2, admire Derek Yu's vision, but unfortunately there is a lot that leaves a sour taste in my mouth after having played a hefty (most would argue way too hefty) amount of time with both.
Before I dive into the actual review, here is a list of TL;DR bullet points.


[h1]PROS:[/h1]
+ Lots of Content
+ Smooth Controls and Gameplay
+ Good Humor
+ Co-op with up to 4 players (locally and online!)
+ Many Achievements
+ Stellar Art Direction
+ Cool Lore and Fantastic Use of Mythological Iconography/Monsters/...
+ Some of the Best Physics and Entity/Environment [Chain] Interactions in The History of Gaming

[h1]CONS:[/h1]
- Punishingly Hard → This could be a good thing, unfortunately deaths are often sporadic and come from off screen)
- Runs are way too long → A run to the true ending can take up to an hour, with the little to no error margins, this, I find, is rather poor design
- First world of the game also happens to be one of the hardest → pretty poor difficulty scaling, though also interesting in a novel traditional-game-design-subversion way.
- Tiny Error Margins
- Climbing Gloves
- Climbing Gloves (no, putting these here twice is not an error)
- Much worse Soundtrack than Spelunky 1 → while it fits the game, it's absolutely forgettable, to the point where I was sometimes convinced there was no soundtrack at all
- Inconsistent Hitbox when jumping on foes


[h1]Review:[/h1]
Derek Yu is one of not just Indie gaming's, but gaming's in general, greatest visionairies. His use of procedural level generation in Spelunky 1 was quite innovative at the time, when there were much fewer roguelite games, and the ones that were there mostly dealt in rooms and 2.5D planes, a trait which has mostly stuck around in games like The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, Dead Estate, Enter The Gungeon and to some extent Hades (though that one, while utilizing rooms, has a much more 3D plane, though still from the same top-down slanted camera angle as all other games mentioned here).

This aspect of Spelunky's design played second fiddle to only one other thing in Derek Yu's arsenal: the physics, and, more specifically, the interactions between them. A bat could fly at you, because you were under it and in its FOV, during its flight it could activate an arrow trap, that could send the tiny, exploding alien UFO careening towards you unexpectedly, the explosion taking a good chunk of your health, chucking you against the nearest wall, and throwing your hapless, stunned body onto a mine, or a yeti, who loves to throw all living matter that comes near him. Thus, was the madness of Spelunky HD.

Spelunky 2 handles in much the same way, bigger, better, more visually impressive, smoother, faster. It's everything you could want from a sequel. So why the negative review?

Spelunky 2 is a stellar piece of art, much like its predecessor, etching Yu's name into the annals of the fastest evolving art form of the video game even more firmly, but it's also a game I dislike: a game that wastes your time, that has the addicting gameplay of an old moneygrubbing arcade, and, unfortunately, hell bent on having much the same unforgiving, heavily luck-based difficulty system.

The mechanics are very simple: You run, jump, whip enemies/traps and pick stuff up, such as rocks, or even the occasional handy tool such as a weapon, in order to vanquish your foes, or, much more likely, vanquish yourself by accident.

You'll die, a lot, often from things which couldn't have been prevented unless you had a seer at your side, and even then I'd wager a guess that it would be rather tough, due to the brutal error margins mentioned above. Spelunky is brutal, and flashy, unfortunately for someone who values their time and loves to be engaged by art's messaging, Spelunky's role was only to pass the time while I listened to music or podcasts.

It's very flashy, certainly doesn't lack luster, unfortunately it lacks substance, past the mechanical brilliance, and is too unfair, and when it's not unfair, I still find it too punishing for me to recommend with good conscience.

[h3]Much love to Derek Yu either way![/h3]

The show itself got low scores by critics, which are wrong, but I want to highlight one aspect of this masterpiece, the theme song. Listen to these lyrics.

My name is Cleveland Brown And I am proud to be Back in my hometown With my new family

There's old friends And new friends And even a bear

There's good things and bad things It's true love we share

And so I found a place Where everyone will know My happy mustached face This is The Cleveland Show

As you can see, this theme song perfectly describes the show it belongs to.

The first part tells us that it follows Cleveland Brown, who is part to be in his hometown with his new family. Focus on how he us proud to be in his hometown. Not ashamed or apathetic. This is showing of his optimistic nature.

The second part shows that there are recurring character, newly introduced characters, and a bear. This is important to the structure of the show because the character of Cleveland can't really hold up a show in his own, he mostly relies on the hijinks if other characters.

The third part show us that in the show, there will be both good things and bad things. It also shows how much Cleveland loves his new wife.

The fourth and final part of the song shows that Cleveland has finally found where he is meant to be, and his goals. The opening ends with him proclaiming that it is The Cleveland Show.

This opening is frankly genius. It perfectly explains what the show is about and what it wants to do. This is only one of the many reasons The Cleveland Show is so genius",1667096427,1667096427,True,2,3,0.51836240291595459,0,True,False,False

If you are an experienced Spelunky 1 player, you will be decent at Spelunky 2 right out of the gate.  However, the movement mechanics in Spelunky 2 feel gummy compared to the first game.  In the previous game, the mechanics felt tight and reliable.  Here, they feel like you're trying to hold a bar of wet soap.  

Also, the first 4 levels are too hard.  Everything is so tight and compact, making it super easy to die.  And yea, maybe I should just ""get good.""

Every run is different and you never know if you win or if you get killed in a spectacular way. Meaning there is tons of replay value and will keep you playing for long periods. The daily challenge is a fun way to test your skills to be number 1 out of many people, with only having one chance per day. And if you get bored of the basic characters, strings of text and the good old classic gameplay, then Modlunky will help you change up the game in the way you like!

It is way too easy to get stun locked in only the first area and the throwing mechanics make it way too difficult to hit something 3 spaces in front of you without the pitcher's mitt. You practically have to jump and throw things down at your feet to hit enemies right in front of you if there are blocks directly above your head. Certain traps also do more damage than they should and others are just plain unavoidable. I've played a lot of the first one and it was awesome, but I think Spelunky 2 is trying a little too hard and is too complicated. Spelunky 2 feels like an overly modded, ultra hardcore version of spelunky that is just too overly complex.

I started out playing Spelunky Classic and then started playing Spelunky HD. The remastered version of spelunky added a bunch of new stuff to the original game design/gameplay without going overboard and was very well done. Maybe I'm just a boomer or something, but it feels like Spelunky 2 just strays too far away from what spelunky was originally meant to be.",1625465430,1663084415,False,4,0,0.486067116260528564,0,True,False,False

I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

It is a very difficult game, but for some reason, it is not frustrating. I believe the reason is because you have an incredible amount of agency over yourself and your surroundings, so when you inevitably die, it is typically due to a miss-input, a genuine mistake, lack of planning, cautiousness or awareness. These are things you can learn from and improve on your next run. Restarting is fast too, so sitting through load times is a non-existent problem.

Level design is top-notch. The randomly generated levels are still filled with mystery and don't ever seem to get old or feel samey from run-to-run.

Music and sound effects are perfect.

Multiplayer makes this already great game even better, as playing with friends always makes every experience more fun.

Overall, 10/10. Worth full price. Only warning is that it is very difficult, so if you're the type to like easy-breezy games, this won't be for you.

PS: after beating the game, I will say: this game does contain nonsense, especially at the later levels. There will be traps that are impossible to see coming that will instant kill you, in certain setups. Also, a really annoying gripe i have with the game is that many of their secrets can only be found coincidentally or by finding the answer online. As someone who likes discovering secrets, I find it incredibly annoying that there are no hints or clues that would push you to try certain things. Again, this isn't all secrets, as some do have clues and nudges. I'd say, about 35% of the secrets have no hint that they exist. Otherwise, still a good game.",1660004352,1661112034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I understand, and appreciate what the game is about.  It's very challenging, and was made to be challenging which harkens back to the old school 8-bit/16-bit games.  However, the difficulty in some of those games were due to technical limitations, poor design choices, port from an arcade game trying to screw you out of quarters, or other issues.

I am [u]not a fan of rage games[/u] like these so please be aware of that when seeing my recommendation and review.  

In terms of positives and why I got this game?  Simple!  For the co-op play.  I found the co-op with friends to be [u]so much fun at first[/u].  Going through the challenges and running around was a blast!  Graphically this games is great.  The art style is easy on the eye, and overall very smooth on my increasingly aging computer.  I am of the belief games with art style such as Spelunky 2 will age better than those who go for realism.  Especially since technology is so fast and realism dates itself quickly. 

What I distinctly didn't like about the game [i][b](keep in mind I hadn't played since Jan of 2021 so this info may be out of date as of this writing)[/b][/i] was the fact that once you lost all your lives you start at the [b]very beginning[/b].  We'd reach level 2-1, lose all our lives, and start at level 1-1 all over again.  At first it's funny but, after the 10th time playing with 2 other people of various skill level [i](me probably being the worst one)[/i] it quickly loses its appeal.  The 8-bit era had memory issues hence why progress couldn't be saved in some games.  We don't have those issues today for games. So not being able to save my progress showed how little patience I had.

Another issue?  One hit deaths or worst - fall deaths on blind corners / platforms.  The stages were procedurally generated so this meant you can die in the most tragic, unlucky way.

Like I said just not my kind of game.

[b]Pros:[/b]

+ Fantastic artwork, and style
+ Co-op mode
+ Simple gameplay mechanics and controls

[b]Cons:[/b]

- One hit deaths, no continues, and no saving progress
- Frustrating gameplay (which many may see as a positive)
- Very difficult
- Having start all over again once you lose all your lives

[b]Recommend:[/b] Not a fan of this frustrating, ""git gud"" type of game

Other games I'd suggest besides this one:

-Toree 3d and Toree 2
-Slime rancher

EDIT: I've now played the game for almost 1000 hours, gotten all the achievements, and beat the hardest challenge the game has to offer. I still highly recommend this game. I just want to touch on a few more things.

A lot of the negative reviews that you'll see will label the deaths as unfair. I agree! Some really do seem unfair.  The point is, you can catch on to how not to put yourself into those kinds of situations in the first place. Got unfairly hit by an arrow trap at the edge of the screen into a bed of spikes? Whoops, that's a thing in Spelunky! If it really concerns you, you can walk slower across the platform while staying aware, or throw things in front of you to potentially trigger it. Is there too much lava in the volcano world when you trigger the drill? Maybe the volcano level seems easy at first but has its downsides, and you might get some of the benefits by going to the jungle instead, or figuring out some work-around. That's why there are 2 world choices, it's built to have some downsides and you just have to judge for yourself what you want to do. The world of Spelunky is absolutely cruel and unforgiving, I agree, but the point isn't for everything to have an ""Oh, if only I just-"" answer, sometimes it's just ""Don't even touch situations like that unless I can bomb it or change something about it"". Even in Spelunky death compilations online, you can look at the footage and about 80% of the time be able to say something like ""Oh, he got telefragged by a croc-man after the cobra spit onto it and damaged it? Maybe I shouldn't be horizontally aligned with a croc man and a cobra next to each other."" You really can learn quite a bit. Also honestly, if it's a bit daunting at first, I would honestly recommend starting with the $15 Spelunky title. I think there were more conventionally fair deaths in that game than in this game, and it's much easier (but still tough as nails) to 100% that game. 

This game is seriously very good. The controls are extremely responsive, the world is incredibly fleshed out with interesting things and secrets, only made better by the level generation, and it's an absolute blast to play this with friends. Maybe if you're struggling to get by, like I previously mentioned, this may also be an option? (Just a note, you don't have to share a screen in online multiplayer, so in my opinion it's much better than local if you have somebody else that owns the game). Seriously, this game is worth way more than $20. The interactions between all the different elements in the game make for insanely fun and interesting moments, stories to tell, memories to make, and the more you play the more you'll find that that's absolutely by design. (Or if you listen to any interviews about the game's design by the creator, he'll just tell you that it's his design for the game.)

Simply put, this game is difficult. However, it's not the good type of difficult. Anyone who knows me knows that I love challenging experiences, such as Dark Souls, or Dead Cells, and most other roguelikes. I love to bash my head against a wall again, and again, and again, until eventually the wall begins to crack and I have permanent brain damage from excessive head trauma.

But Spelunky 2 does not embody that type of difficulty. A majority of your deaths will feel unfair, because things you have no way of seeing or knowing will pop out of nowhere, stun you and knock you into insta-kill traps. I think this would be fine, but I'll make another comparison to Dark Souls in terms of difficulty: in Dark Souls, almost every death will feel like your fault, and as you die, you'll learn how to deal with whatever it is that murdered you. A skeleton will cut you up, so you learn to block or roll around it and stab it first. In Spelunky 2, practically every death is the opposite - it rarely feels like your own fault. A cave mole will pop up right underneath you, stun you, and launch you into spikes. You'll try to navigate a ledge, only for a skull you weren't able to see to spawn a skeleton, stun you, and launch you off the ledge to your death.

It's just not as fun as it could be, because it rarely feels like your own fault, and it's a damn shame because the game looks great, and otherwise plays great.

Ultimately, it's not something I can recommend for most. If you read this and think ""wow, this sounds amazing"", then great, I'm happy for you and the enjoyment you might get from it. But for me, seeing the first level 100+ times isn't fun. I enjoy excessive punishment, but not like this.",1659883241,1659883241,False,2,0,0.489875376224517822,0,True,False,False

NO, NOPE, NO WAY

Sure, it adds a whole bunch of new visuals and general stuff, -what you might expect from a mere expansion pack perhaps, it does not improve on or fix anything that was wrong with the original game.

-Difficulty is way, way up
-many things now feel deeply ""unfair"" in ways that the old game didn't
-shopkeepers (and now other NPCs, yay) are still ridiculously op, and can be turned forever hostile by monsters rather than the player
-the whip seems to have a smaller hitbox, and doesn't seem to whip above or behind at all like it used to
-the rope doesn't seem to harm enemies like it used to
-enemies still can have multiple HP, and cannot be hurt while they are stunned, worse, there are more multiple HP enemies, and they're harder than ever.
-meanwhile, YOU can still be hit any time, and can still take damage while stunned, meaning that stunlock issues haven't been fixed since the last game.

Don't let the improved visuals fool you, this game is less polished than the first one, not more. This is not a sequel, more of a collection of new content stapled together.

The thing with Spelunky is that every action you take is a potential death warrant so coop isn't really easier, it's just double chance of dying.

As in real life, the best course of action is to subtly evade violence because violence is the last resort of the incompetent. And yet, the shopkeeper's shotgun is as tempting as ever.

Books could be written on the deep suffering this game incurs but I for one really appreciate from the bottom of my heart the option to sacrifice my loved one on the altar of Kali the goddess of death in exchange for a climbing glove.

An incredible, more accessible sequel, that is somehow worse than the original but it is better than the first game. What I love about Spelunky HD is the progression, it's the only roguelike where the journey is more satisfying than the conclusion and the game almost feels aware of that. The game creates a pace where it begs you, enrages you, to go faster, but on the other hand, go too slow and you'll be chased by a ghost that kills you when you touch it, but rewards you if you manipulate its movement. It's that moment when you strike that perfect medium of pacing, you absorb the randomly generated environment; the soundtrack, seamlessly being woven together to create this incredible atmosphere, that's when you can truly appreciate Spelunky. But what truly makes the game perfect, is the ability to say fuck that and teleport your way to the end because you have the freedom (and clearly the skill) to do so.

Spelunky 2 on the other hand is like: dun dun bwaooooo bwaooo bwaooooo. The soundtrack more bombastic. The environments, more ambitious. The platforming, more noticeable. The gameplay, has more variety. It wants to be different from HD while still being familiar, but I don't want to veer away from the issues I have at the moment. The way the visuals are designed make each block look separate, as if there is a grid displayed at all times so you know what block you're on, It's kind of like if grass blocks were stacked on top of each other in Minecraft but they didn't turn into dirt blocks.

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

This innocent-looking baby's spelling bee game will single-handedly curb stomp any form of willpower present within your being, any hint of motivation that you may possess and bring you into a stoop of absolute disgrace and misery once you see the sheer amount of time, effort and patience you have spent trying to hack away at its dense walls of difficulty and ""Fuck You"" level design. Derek Wu is Satan incarnate and this is his cruel and perverse way of bringing armageddon upon our mortal realm.
This game can be optimally played only when its consumer has an extreme sado-masochism fetish.

For one thing there isn't a ton that differentiates it from its predecessor, the stuff that was added feels pretty inconsequential and are mostly in service of making the game harder than its predecessor, and while there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting to make the game harder, the way that Spelunky 2 was made harder wasn't an improvement in my eyes. 

The original Spelunky is a hard game, but it was hard in a way that made you feel like the fault of dying was your own and that you could overcome the game by learning more about it, cheap deaths were rare and the difficulty was more satisfying, but Spelunky 2 doesn't feel like that, there are a lot more cheap deaths and a lot more instances where you feel like you were put in a situation where there was nothing you could have done differently that wouldn't have resulted in your death, there were a lot more cheap deaths.

Spelunky 2 is also missing some key usability features. In the original Spelunky upon start up you had a quick start option which would start the game using your last used setting, and allowed you to skip all the menus and other stuff and get playing right away. Spelunky 2 doesn't have this, so you are forced to go through the menus each time even if there is nothing you are changing from the last time you played it.

To me, there just isn't enough of an improvement over Spelunky to really recommend Spelunky 2, and in some aspects it feels like a downgrade. If the only thing you were looking for was a more difficult Spelunky then you've got a new game, but for everyone else, just stick with Spelunky.",1657165176,1657165176,False,10,4,0.498343825340270996,0,True,False,False

You have to fight yourself in past the first person who guards the door and as you go deeper into the party each new person is more and more difficult to beat. Anyway the first time you lose at the door and you get kicked out and you're like man this party sucks I'll never learn kung fu. But then you go back every single day and you make it a little further into the party. But the door guy still beats you sometimes. But you learn to use the party itself as a vehicle for kung fu; In the exploding balloons, you learn to breathe in the helium to power your shrill scream ability, partygoers can be lured into glitter bombs that the party owner set, and you begin to find stray nachos and cookies after learning how to look. Finally, you get to the kung fu master at the end and she beats you senseless and she says ""I hope you enjoyed the party"" and you say ""yes, I'll beat you next time and I'll truly know kung fu"" and she smiles and one day you beat her and she says ""You have done well, this party is truly rockin."" And you look her in the eye and hold up the invitation crafted from six scattered golden invitations pieces, all scattered around behind the most notorious of her students, and you say ""take me to the afterparty"" and her eyes go black and she says ""Your kung fu has become strong.

Spelunky 2 is a masterclass in excellent game design and the amount of depth that Derek Yu and Mossmouth have crafted into one game is unprecedented and I can't wait to dive deeper into the content of this game and I feel as though I have only scratched the surface of what there is in this game with mindblowing secrets that are sure to lurk around every corner. It is also much more difficult than the first Spelunky but it rarely feels downright unfair and conquering this game for the first time after only 774 deaths felt amazing. Spelunky 2 was truly incredible and my only real issue is the delay of online coop which was a big feature that disappointedly didn't come out on launch. But apart from that issue, Spelunky 2 was great and I can't wait to play it much more and with friends in the coming weeks.

The best Part is the Difficulty. It is litteraly perfect for an Rougelike! Even after 1400h of Playtime I can still die in Dwellings. (And hear that lovely tune over and over again :D)

This game is a two-d side scroller action game.  The purpose is not to kill things but to get to the end of the level.  Levels are randomly generated so every time it is different.  That is both a good thing for replayability but also just terrible when you get a random floor that is impossible to win.  If you don't mind games where your victory may not be in your hands then you might enjoy Spelunky 2. I personally never find it fun when my success in a video game is up to RNG over my actual skill and ability so overall I don't recommend this game.

Also, the music is outright TERRIBLE.  It's like 7 seconds of music on loop for the different levels. It isn't good enough to listen to or even qualify as a song in my books.  So the best choice is to mute music right away and play something in the background. 

Hit boxes are poor.  Your character's ability to whip attack is so pathetic in it's design it highlights to me that this was probably originally made as a video game student's final project that he then went on to expand into something bigger. But the rookie code that was built first was never improved because of laziness.  The whip attack is so small and poorly designed as to make it feel super useless.  In fact for no reason other than poor animation, it has a larger hit box behind your character then in front.  Consider that a whip, has bigger reach behind you then in front of you.  That's the quality you can expect from this game.",1654866275,1654866275,False,1,2,0.480158746242523193,0,True,False,False

It's a game with a simple goal of spelunking downwards as far as you can go without dying. Each biome has its own respective set of enemies and platforming hazards that the player must use their reflexes and wit to deal with effectively.  Death will force the player back to the start with a clean slate with you losing previously made progress in terms of the distance covered and resources gathered for that run you failed. 

Progress overall is not really measured by ""leveling up"" a character or filling out a skill tree, but the experience the individual player gains that allows them to more effortlessly move through the game's challenges. Don't get frustrated with dying as it helps with expanding your knowledge on how to navigate the various threats the game throws at you as well as  understanding the general ""language"" of the game. Since this is a roguelike the levels are procedurally generated so there's an element of randomness in each playthrough, but each biome has their own specific set of threats/""rules"" that you can always expect once you've learned about them.

A lot of the fun in Spelunky is trial and error using each run as an experiment to see what strategies work and what will get you killed. I think the humor lies in the fact you could hypothetically have a really good run going where you have plenty of resources, a large health pool, useful tools, and momentum then a small series of unfortunate events with NPCs or mob enemies could ruin it all. It's very cartoon-ish when things go wrong like an episode of Tom and Jerry but with a bit of added gore and blood. Though none of this is ever really ""unfair"" and usually the end of a run is due to a mix of impatience, recklessness, or ignorance when approaching certain hazards. Although there are sometimes you'll see a floor and wonder if the game hates you if you get some funky RNG with the level generation, but that's all in good fun.

The controls are really tight and feel really nice mechanically. They're simple but complex in the way you're able to interact with the environment around you. The art style is charming and adorable in comparison to how brutal the moment to moment gameplay can feel sometimes. The music fits the various biomes you'll trek without being distracting or grating on the ears. And the gameplay loop is very addicting once you get over the fact you'll die a lot and have to start over many times.

 Despite its difficulty I believe that Spelunky 2 can be enjoyed by anyone willing to be patient and give the game a fair shake. It's even more amusing with more people in multiplayer, but that also adds more elements of potential chaos that can occur if the gameplay between players is poorly coordinated.

Overall I highly recommend this game, there's lots of replay value in just the way the game is designed with tons of player choice from how you play to how you proceed as you progress from biome to biome. There's also a lot of collectibles, achievements, and hidden secrets for completionists that'll extend the gameplay length since they're typically challenging (meaning it will take time to become skilled enough to obtain them), but rewarding for committed players. Lastly you don't need to have played the first to enjoy this entry, in fact Spelunky 2 is more like an expansion in terms of having everything content wise from the first but adding upon it and refining the original formula to perfection.",1602952433,1654482301,True,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

9/10 (S-tier)
To me this is one of the greatest roguelikes out there. It's addicting, challenging, full of personality and it has great changes compared to its predecessor.

[h1]Details[/h1]
Spelunky 2 is pretty much Spelunky HD but prettier, slightly harder, with different levels, some QoL improvements as well as a few nice new features. If you liked the first game, this one is a must-buy if you ask me.
If you never played a Spelunky game before then you should probably still play the HD version first because it's also a great game.

[h3]Pros[/h3]
[list]
[*]The music, art, sound effects and animations are great
[*]Very addicting because it's easy to pick up and regular runs aren't very long
[*]The basics of the game are very simple but there are many hidden tricks and things to learn
[*]There are some branching paths with different advantages and disadvantages, adding to replayability and making runs more interesting
[*]Many cool secrets
[*]Lots of risk vs. reward situations
[*]Online multiplayer is very fun (and works well in my experience - Besides slight framerate loss and lag sometimes)
[*]If you're looking for a really really challenging experience then there is a secret ending which requires godly skill and patience. The achievements also take considerable effort to get
[*]A decent amount of different items which will change how you approach many situations
[/list]

[h3]Cons[/h3]
[*]Default controls, at least on keyboard, are a bit weird in my opinion but can easily be changed to what you prefer so kind of a moot point (wanted to mention it anyway)
[*]Deaths can be frustrating
[*]While there are branching paths, you'll most likely prefer one over the other and end up always going the same way in the end
[*]Sometimes the game feels a little unfair but generally you're at fault when you take damage
[*]The secrets are kind of hard to find without someone telling you about them so you might miss out on some of the cool stuff. I suggest looking up the secrets online once you run out of ideas and patience
[*]The first world has some very annoying enemies and it punishes you a lot for being impatient. I think the majority of the game's community would agree that the first world could use some changes
[*]Some bugs but not many (if you don't count firebugs)",1605611373,1653741244,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Precision in movement
Precision in decision making

Luckily for Spelunky 2 every part of the gameplay is enjoyable and meaningful. You can never feel sad about losing a good run as the next one might be even better.

It's also worth adding that the ""scenarios"" you find yourself dying within are so complex and surrounded in chance that each one feels...natural. The laws to which this games works are so well written that the unpredictable nature of death is replicated perfectly. It is truly magical in that after 50 hours you'll see it coming a mile off and still not be able to stop it. You will shout ""I knew it...!"" over and over again! It's simply beautiful programming...

9/10 - As near to a perfect game as it could get. I just feel that there is still room to make this even greater by adding more depth and complexity to character choices (different stats and skins) as well as end game options/challenges aside from the inbuilt achievements.

If there's a description I would give to describe the gameplay of Spelunky 2, it would be ""perfectly balanced chaos"". That phrase is a major contradiction, but so were my initial feelings on the game when it first released. I had a lot of fun in those first few hours. I also absolutely hated the game and how it would ruthlessly kick my ass at every turn without mercy. I liked the first game, but I was never a huge fan of it, and much like the first game, it felt needlessly difficult. 

But at a certain point, my opinion shifted completely.

It's hard to say when exactly my opinion shifted, but if I had to pinpoint it, it was after completing my first normal run. At a [i]very[/i] fundamental level, games can fall under four different categories:

[list]
	[*] Easy to learn, easy to master.
	[*] Easy to learn, hard to master.
	[*] Hard to learn, easy to master.
	[*] Hard to learn, hard to master.
[/list]

I used to think that out of these four options, ""easy to learn, hard to master"" was the best that a game should strive for, but after playing Spelunky 2 I realise that ""hard to learn, hard to master"" can be just as incredible. Whilst a game that is ""easy to learn, hard to master"" is great, only the speedrunning crowd will really care about that ""hard to master"" aspect of the game. Spelunky 2 forces you to master it as a mere means of surivival in its unforgiving world. Every tip and trick you find will be useful for all kinds of playthroughs - not just speedrunning. You begin to realise that you probably shouldn't risk life and limb to grab every little piece of gold. You figure out how to manipulate the shopkeepers to your advantage. You find the most optimal way to kill enemies and bosses.

And as you keep playing, hidden mechanics and details begin to reveal and unravel themselves to you in a natural, organic way, all through its gameplay. You begin to work out the best ways to use your bombs, ropes, and whip. You find out how to access secret areas you didn't even know existed. You figure out ways to skip entire sections of the game. 

Unlike roguelikes such as The Binding of Isaac or Enter the Gungeon, you don't unlock items, new areas, or anything that changes the gameplay in Spelunky 2. In Spelunky 2, everything has been there from the start, and the only thing that has progressed is your own skill. Where most roguelikes focus on synergies between the items you collect in a playthrough, Spelunky 2's focus is on the synergies between enemies, the environment, and the player. A trap roguelikes can fall into by focusing on item synergy is making the player horribly overpowered, or so underpowered that the run is over by no fault of the player. In Spelunky 2 this rarely happens due to the low item list: Each item is unique from each other, balanced with advantages and disadvantages, and often have one or two uses that are not immediately obvious to player. This adds so much depth that a game with 300+ items can feel shallow in comparison to Spelunky 2's well-crafted list of around 50 items. 

To go into details on the incredible secrets and the little details that Spelunky 2 hides would be a disservice to the game. If you think you have what it takes to tackle what is a [i]very[/i] difficult platformer I highly recommend Spelunky 2. As I discovered just how deep the rabbit hole goes in terms of its mechanics, my opinion changed from thinking of Spelunky 2 as a good game, to a great game, and then - finally - to perhaps my favourite game of all time. There aren't many games which come close to its genius, and its last challenge is so insane that I'll probably be playing this Kali-forsaken game for many years to come.

First of all they somehow managed to mess-up the crisp platforming mechanics, you have no faith if you are going to actually grab a ledge or not... Often times you are clearly above the ledge and it still does not grab. They also ruined the visual style. It looks like a kid's game now, completely cartoonish in a really childish way... The color pallets are disgusting, and the overall visual style is just so ugly compared to the last one. The soundtrack is totally lame and does not compare even a little bit to the amazing soundtrack of the first game. All of the items are basically the same...

This game is challenging, but incredibly fun. 
The movement is really solid, there are plenty of good items that you can find, purchase or steal and it has different paths with semi-randomly generated levels.
If you are new, try out items and take it slow. Check out your surroundings and plan out an path. You will eventually become an expert speeding through previously difficult parts.
The best part of this game is that most of the time that you die is very much because of yourself.
------------------------

Performance has been good for me both on PC and Switch.
The music is also nice though it has less variety than Spelunky HD (which has an amazing soundtrack).
Online Adventure is mostly smooth but animations and enemy/player positions can start glitching out at poor connections. You could try and mitigate this by modifying your Online Input Latency setting. 3-5 should be good.

This game is best played with others, especially those who are close to you.

I've played this game solo and its fun to unlocking new characters and learning how to platform through the world. You'll have less of difficult time with others, because human error can cause you to die faster than solo. On your own you can practice and play at your own pace. Solo gives you more features than playing online, like check points.

Online multiplayer is a blast but it can turn into a nightmare. Me and my buddies have killed each other multiple times by accident. Communication is needed if you're looking for secrets or items.

EDIT:
4/16/2022
i've finally 100% this game. it's the second game (outside of some visual novels) i've sought every achievement. the only other game was chulip. yes, during this process i slowly went insane. scared my girlfriend every night i played. hit myself out of anger a few times. cried. popped blood vessels. but this is one of the greatest achievements i've ever had in my gamer career as a gaming gamer. the mood stabilizers and anti-depressants helped a bit, but i couldn't have gotten to this point without dedication. dedication i've had for very few projects in my life. i've loved other games (bayonetta, chulip, way of the samurai), but this has been a life-changing experience. even though i have no idea what to do with the rest of my life, i will never regret a second of these 300+ hours. i'm definitely going back in (i have to reach 7-99 after all), but this is the end of an era for me. i honestly can't recommend this to anyone. it's a masochistic experience that will make you lose sight of your family (unless you're 100x better at video games than i am [which i'm sure you are]). i've had several children taken away from me by CPS over the past year and a half. after you read this review, and message me about how i'm sexy and a godly gamer, you should look inside yourself and question if you are down for one of the most rewarding gaming experiences a person can go through.

The reason is simple: the first world is completely, ridiculously overtuned.  It's harder than everything else that comes after it.  It took me dozens of tries to get through it the first time, and I immediately breezed through the second world and made it well into the third before dying.  It took me twenty more tries to get past the first world again and repeat my previous experience.  If the game gradually built up its difficulty, that'd be one thing, but instead it has a huge wall you have to beat your head against to overcome before you can see anything else every time you play the game.

I waited a while to write this review because I was hoping it'd get adjusted, but it hasn't.

This game is really difficult, and early on, there will be alot of things that will kill you for no reason. But you gotta keep going! Once you get past the first area, the game REALLY starts. You will find more traps and enemies, and the stakes are high as ever! You must be super careful. Can I get that diamond without triggering that mace trap? Is getting that idol worth it? Should I steal these bombs or buy them? Spelunky is all about risk and reward. Almost every death is your fault (except during the last few levels) and there is always something to learn from every death, and you will always feel the negative consequences of a bad decision and the rewards of a good decision. Overall, just play the game. $20 is a small price to pay for the perfection that is this masterpiece, don't give up, you will beat it eventually through trial and error.

Well, if the game developers want to tell me to go screw myself with the sheer amount of difficulty they stacked into this game, they can go do the same. 
Health doesn't matter, most things one hit kill you or stun you to death or combine with the rest of the cluttered levels to chain reaction kill you and then it's all the way back to either the start or to the shortcut with a severe money and equipment deficit. 
Oh but to get health you have to waste bombs on the poor turkeys you got killed accidentally or getting your pet to the exit without getting it killed accidentally.
So here we have a game where you're always one mistake away from dying, everything else chips away at your health making you have to stock up and trying to get the health can lead to you taking even more risks and more damage and then stocking up doesn't matter in the long run because you're always one mistake away from dying as I mentioned before.
I have hours and hours on rogue-likes that are actually rewarding to play, with a more fair sense of balance but actually challenge you instead of just pretending to do so while giggling and killing you over and over like this game seems to like to do.

If you're are a masochistic gamer looking for a challenge then this game is for you. But maybe start with the prequel first (Spelunky HD) before you try this game. It's cheaper and more well balanced. And if you like then you will like Spelunky 2.

As for Spelunky 2, the difficulty sometimes comes from the game unfair's randomness. There are several ways your good run can be ruined through no fault of your own. Additionally, the starting area of this game may be too difficult for new players. All these combined can demotivate you and making you wanting to quit the game right from the first few levels.

Spelunky 2 doesn't quite rise to that level, but its pretty dang close, and does a remarkable job holding its own while trying to follow up perfection (or near-perfection). I think there are two main reasons that it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor for me: One, in HD, you'd often meet your demise in crazy, unanticipated ways, but it never felt unfair; in 2, it does, very occasionally, feel unfair (and then I'll be awed by the platforming skills and quick reactions of streamers or youtubers, so ""unfair"" could admittedly be subjective). Two, while the sequel adds a lot of depth in some areas with new zones, new items and enemies, branching paths, etc, some of that depth sometimes feels somewhat shallow, if that makes sense. A lot of the new gear will hardly ever see use, especially for veterans of HD like me, stuck in their ways (the significant nerf to the jetpack goes some way toward making some of those items interesting enough to consider, though many of them share the jetpack's new flaws, so it really only ends up bringing the capes up to par). The back layers are an interesting addition, especially in the implementation of the black market and wet fur zones, but often just feel kind of tacked on and inconsequential. New mechanics like curse and poison are just one way the difficulty is ramped up, but new ways to gain health like royal jelly from Kali altars and turkeys make things significantly easier in others. All of this goes to make for some unevenness in terms of both difficulty and pacing. But I don't want to overstate it, and i can't overstate this: Spelunky 2 is still a really, REALLY good game, worth the hundreds of hours I have and will spend within its shifting walls, and more than worth every penny spent on it, at full or sale price.",1648421961,1648421961,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I absolutely love this game, it's cute, it's fun, runs are short, it's filled with secrets, and I still haven't beaten it after 89 hours. I have not beaten this game a single time after almost 90 hours of gameplay. I've beaten almost ever single souls game in half the time, yet for some reason this game is far more difficult.

And I don't even care. It's so much fun.

Well, technically I could beat it, the game provides you with shortcuts to the later areas, but I refuse to do that. I will beat the game in full without the shortcuts.. eventually.

This game is also great if you want a fun game that you can play in short bursts. I can take a break from work, play for 15-30 minutes, then get back to work.

And new players can feel the joy of trying to traverse the levels while figuring out how to not die so easily, new players will also feel the excitement of trying to uncover the mystery of the caves and all it has to offer, and no run will feel the same as the levels are half auto generated and half authored which is a genius way of making it so you never get tired of the game because of how replayable it is. If you do ever get tired of an area you simply can go a different route because this game has branching paths which diversifies the experience in such a simple yet brilliant way. The characters are so charming and are so much fun to unlock because they feel like prizes for getting to certain areas. The game gets even better because you can explore this magical yet mysterious game with friends and if you're by yourself you can play with randoms, this game even features crossplay. and if none of that convinces you then there is one more thing i have to say about this game to try and convince you to buy it, you can pet the dog. 10/10",1646030982,1646030982,True,1,1,0.49263232946395874,0,True,False,False

But this game still feels closer to a neutral recommendation for me. Playing with friends is a lot of fun and alleviates most of my gripes. Playing solo is still mostly only fun if you have speedrunner levels of dedication. Be prepared to reset your runs. Sometimes early and often to get a good start. If speedrunning is not your thing and you don't have friends to play this game with, recommendations are with those caveats in mind. Maybe if you're willing to mod the game for variety, it could be worth as the platforming and level progression are very good overall (assuming you can progress). Please do not mod your Spelunky 2 install directly to avoid cheats in direct relation to Steam and all that. There's gonna be some spoilers here, but I'll try to keep it vague.

At it's base, Seplunky 2 is a solid 2D platformer. It comes with various upgrades and tools to navigate through the caves, along with various enemies to work around. The movement feels a bit too fast and spastic at times, with hitboxes that can be unforgiving or feel inconsistent. But overall, it can be very smooth. It combines the unforgiving nature of Dead Cells, the utter bullcrap of Dark Souls, along with the obscure pathfinding of a Hollow Knight, all into one (I said this in my original review but still feel it best summarizes the experience). On paper it sounds great. But in execution, it's a bit too brutal at times.

Getting to new locations can be quite rewarding, especially with the struggle just about every level can pose. So many runs can end at any moment to a split second decision, so you want to be on guard at all times. Money can be useful for upgrades, but also a distraction which can put you in situations that whittle away your health or combo you to death.

I've restarted 1000-ish times and beat the first-ish boss, got all the shortcuts, unlocked seeded runs, looked up half the game I'm missing, checked out speedrunner strats, checked out the devs reacting to speedrunner strats, tried to figure out if there's anything new in any area I've been already, and I still don't know how this game was meant to be played. Shortcuts seem best only for bragging rights and a little practice. There are achievements which require you to do them in what I would consider the easier way. (Beat the game without shortcuts? Which shortcut is even good?) I tend to not always piece things together the first way one should, so there's probably a few things I'm being dense about.

The first couple of worlds are where I normally worry about money, as I can't find shops anywhere later on. It starts to give this strange sensation that getting money normally just leads to lost health, so robbing a shopkeeper just ends up helping me navigate the worlds and fend off enemies. Later levels start to follow a trend of more hazards and enemies in tighter spaces. While a nice change of pace after running through early worlds, it gets to be a bit absurd when the level is too busy killing itself and all you need to do is stay out of the crossfire (takes care of the shopkeepers for me). Which a lot of the game in general will kill itself and then blame you for it. Sometimes you can be the culprit, but I've delivered turkeys for Turkey Man (definitely his name) and he dropped a key for me on his turkeys and then killed me for it. The game seems very unable to actually kill the player efficiently, so it makes up for it by sharting damage and aggro for no reason the longer it goes. And for how much I'm expecting things like making the shopkeepers mad or whatever else to kill me, often times I'm getting one shot by terrain. I've even been killed by a flying arrowhead that did zero damage but dropped me onto a conveyor belt which delivered me onto spikes. I wish I could say this doesn't happen often, but that's pretty much how most runs go. Something benign turns into a stun which delivers death. I'm still going back to 1-1 all the same.

For the other half of the game, you still need to go through a couple sequences in the first two worlds for 2 items. Both required for just about any path other than the first-ish boss (give or take advanced tech and/or cheese). At first, it seems fine, but it gets so incredibly tedious to constantly redo these sequences, hoping to find your change of pace in world 3, only to be done in by instant-death mechanics. I've never been a fan of instant-death mechanics. At best, they're annoying once in a while, and at worst, they start to feel like a lazy way to keep the game going. Half the things on screen are likely to kill you at any moment. Along with combo chains that can easily snowball. It is possible to commit no mistakes and still start world 5 with an explosion careen from offscreen the first second the level loads and end your run. That is not weakness. That is Splunkying.

This game is not dynamic enough for it to focus on the singleplayer aspect this much. Multiplayer focus would have been nicer, as it helps alleviate just about all the issues stated above (dividing tasks for the two sequences, not having to restart on one minor error made 5 worlds in, etc...). But couch co-op doesn't have split screen and online doesn't seem to have access to shortcuts, unlocking characters, and arena bots (I believe, but I also still don't know what unlocked my seeded runs). Instead, a lot of what the game offers is something very clip worthy while livestreaming. It is a lot of fun. I livestreamed with friends for my birthday.

Spelunky HD is still one of my favorite games of all time, and Spelunky 2 is now right there next to it complementing it in every way. Standing on the shoulders of a giant, Spelunky 2 is a tribute to its roots as it creates a masterpiece giant twice as tall. Expanding on virtually every game element from the first for increased replayability (when it was already infinitely replayable) and adding a ""back layer"", diverging world paths, and even more endings, Spelunky 2 continues to forge its own path. It's the quintessential roguelike platformer playground where every player choice matters every second for unfathomably infinite permutations. Over 100 hours in, and I just want more. Spelunky 2 is extremely challenging and still feels extremely rewarding when you pull off what seemed impossible. A crucial bonus, again, is how fun it is both to play solo and with co-op play, with a very different dynamic for each.

This game is about the rouguelike experience. Now what do I mean by that, well I believe this game has four main sections that I believe are worth discussing, Movement, Items, Level Design, and Difficulty.

To start I will be discussing Movement. In terms of movement options, you have a walk, run, jump, clamber, and that's it. The movement is very simple, although this incentives the use of items, so that you will have more movement options or other various power tools at your disposal.

Items: The items in Spelunky 2 have many utilities, and purposes, to start I will go over the basic items you start with bombs, and ropes. Bombs and Ropes are both items that are consumed over a gameplay session each providing different utilities, the bombs blow stuff up, whilst ropes let you climb up to higher locations. The next items are equipment, these items are applied to the player character similar to a backpack and each can provide different helpful tools to a player, for example a jetpack to fly, a cape to glide, or a power pack to power up your attacks. Speaking of attacks, the final item type is the weapons and items that you are able to pick up, these items consist of guns, weapons like boomerangs, and even magical weapons that have special properties.

The level design is a short and simple discussion. The game is a roguelike and as such will have a nearly random generation for every level in the game even having special locations that will appear in certain locations if you know what to look out for, but new to the series is a choice between different locations, for example the jungle, or the volcano areas.

Finally there is the difficulty, what I feel is the greatest part of this game. To be absolutely honest, this game loves to not through it's punches, and is absolutely brutal. The tutorial shows you the tools at your disposal, but the rest of the game you have to figure out how to do tasks, you have to learn so much about this game, and you are more than likely to die on your first run-through of the game, but if you stick with it, you will get good, and you will learn to overcome so many obstacles.

To finish out this review, I hope you will join me on this adventure, by buying the game, as I believe this to be an excellent game, and the extra content that I chose to leave out as I believe it is a discovery when you learn how to do a lot of it, will be worth the purchase.",1610477165,1644536173,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1 - Don't try to speedrun every level, as every level/area has a purpose (secret ending?)

2 - There is always a clear path to the exit, don't go using bombs or ropes to go somewhere, unless you are sure to have some extra resources (or worth it, like a jetpack or getting more resources than spent, trading 1 bomb for 3 bombs)

3 - Be careful of what you carry (MY GOD STOP USING THE METAL SHIELD ON MULTIPLAYER JIM!)

4 - Always look down and above you when going somewhere (if you go far enough, you will know that this will save your life more times than you can count)

5 - The whip hits behind you at a diagonal angle (45 degrees), perfect for bats and spiders!

6 - DEREK REMOVE MOLES JESUS CHRIST THEY ARE SO ANNOYING

7 - Play the game, without spoilers, and when you beat it or are really strugling, research secrets or stuff you don't know

8 - PLEASE, have a good idea of the game before you go to multiplayer, or you will have no idea of what is happening and you wont be able to play at all

9 - Remember: Kali altars exist, use them!

10 - Have fun dying! Every death is worth ragequitting and entering the game 3 seconds later!",1601988392,1644285574,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The sequel was executed pretty much almost perfectly and is packed with even more content and playability than its predecessor. It does have a couple weaker points, like the soundtrack (Spelunky HD offered a variation between level music and it was generally more lively), weird level generation (too many arrow traps or moles, weird ""puzzle"" patterns) and weird difficulty scaling (The Dwelling (first stage) is harder than the later stages).

I'd say my favourite aspect of this sequel is not all the new content, but rather the fact that the developers stayed incredibly truthful to the previous part, making the spirit of Spelunky ever-present while also implementing several ""serious"" changes (I hate the new climbing gloves, though). All the tiny nudges, easter eggs and lore elements make the world quite lively.

I love this game, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you're either a content creator, or have friends to play with; though, The sole exception to this is if you've completed Spelunky 1 and want more. 
*Spoiler warning Below!* 
To Summarise: 

The Good
-  There's a lot to do in this game, it's got a really good amount of secrets and discovery; it captures the theme of adventure incredibly well. 
- The animations are very smooth and the art is great, a clear and concise visual upgrade from the previous title and a game that's almost always nice on the eyes
- The gameplay is still really enjoyable most of the time, with good controls and satisfying movement
- The Multiplayer is simply incredible, and easily the best part of the game; It really is better with friends, The deaths become funny and the run isn't immediately over when one person makes a mistake. not to mention, outside of other players' movement, lag is nonexistant. It's really incredible how Mossmouth did it.

The Bad 
- Dwellings is Incredibly, violently repetitive and if you do not have the drive or skill to constantly get past it, You won't enjoy the game. 
- In spelunky 1, most deaths were fair, and the few Rube's Machines to send you to 1-1 were at least, rare enough to be funny, but in spelunky 2 I often find myself not even reacting when one kills me.
- Neo Babylon has the most, cheap and out of control deaths of any area in spelunky history with it's combination of UFOs, Reflecting shields and crushing Elevators. It's not fun; no sane person is arguing that a UFO going mach 9 to teleport you to 1-1 is Well designed and fair 
- While Discovering the secrets is great, Actually doing them is a different story. Spelunky 2 feels as if the Udjat eye spawns in resource-demanding locations so much more than 1, and Olmec's 3 phases still drag on way too long; for something essential to progression 
- I lose brain cells everytime a Shopkeeper outpost spawns with a ghost jar in it. Seriously; Why is that even possible, they always shoot it and it summons the ghost and forces you to speedrun an area with shopkeepers in it 
- I still don't understand why shops don't have a door, or some form of, Entry protection; Firemen, Lizards and Dart Traps can often spawn in front of shops, and if that shop has a bomb bag in it then it simply ceases to exist when the shopkeeper channels their Inner Mr. Sir, and uses a double barrel shotgun to take out a lizard. Seriously, the only reason I can assume this exists is because it generates those ""Family Guy Funny Moments"" compilations where a lizard rolls into a shop and proceeds to blow up the entire shop because of a powerpack and oneshot the player inside of it. It's funny the first 5 or 6 times but, it gets old fast
- The Music, now, don't get me wrong, the Music is Incredible, an OST worth buying, however; each area has one track, unlike 1 where each level has 3. this contributes to the problem I mentioned above, where the dwellings are repetitive, as the music is always, Always identical. 

Overall, I can't recommend the game unless you have friends or an audience. A lot of the downsides are negated by that; The violently repetitive nature of it, the unfair deaths that stop being funny after a while, etc etc. It's a good game, but, Get spelunky 1 instead, and *then*, only then, if you really desire more, get spelunky 2.

Restart from the caverns with your four health, four bombs, four ropes and a DREAM. And that is what makes Spelunky, well, Spelunky!

Mossmouth and BlitWorks took what was good about the first game and just expanded to a degree that was COMPLETELY unnecessary but absolutely appreciated (at least by us true fans). And co-op turns the game from brutal to DEAD UP HILARIOUS. Content with bad friends for this game is amazing just because you die in so many different ways so instantly, which comes full circle. The fact that it's BS hard makes the game what it is. Yes, I have pounded my fist against my table in frustration. That doesn't make the game bad.

First off, as a rouge-like, it is odd that although the levels are randomly generated, they all play out the exact same. That isn't a huge issue, but its annoying in already tedious areas like the dwelling. Secondly, bad game design decisions make the game unplayable. The game is not difficult, it is easy when played slowly and when the player is focused. But it is extremely tedious to deal with the same obstacles every run. Additionally, there are many deaths in the game which are caused by things off screen, and health does not matter often times as a single hit will stun-lock you and you will die regardless. The game starts out with the dwelling which is already the most tedious area in the game. It is filled with clusters of traps and enemies and getting hit by a single lizard will cause death (due to perma-stun). It is a very easy area because every enemy is easily avoided but the halls are littered with traps and in order to keep your lives, you would have to trek through the area slowly. And its the same thing every time in a game where you die every couple minutes. Restarting in the dwelling each time is practically unbearable. Luckily, there is a check point system implemented. In order to unlock a checkpoint, the player will have to deliver 3 different items to the end of a biome. However, you start out with no items, and shop keepers are scarce after olmec. I personally hit a brick wall each biome very quickly where I was not improving in the slightest and I just waited for a fluke to make it past or I could play slowly and drop bombs to skip the level but there is zero fun in that. Even after completing the game, I only make it past the dwelling by fluke or by playing it out very slowly, which is extremely boring, especially in a rougue-like. Its only replayabilty comes with its extreme ease to die at any area in the game. After completion, there is no reason to play on which isn't a good look for a roguelike. The world gen is abysmal often time, not only with the levels playing out the same, but especially in tidal pool, the door can sometimes be completely blocked off. There will be a 1 block gap in which an explosive crab resides, which if hit with a whip is an instant death. This is just one example of a common issue plaguing the game at every turn. The enemy ai is also very awkward in certain areas and missing a jump on an enemies head by a single pixel results in lives lost or death and the hitboxes are pretty small. Without the bad game decisions, this game would be pretty great due to side quests and multiple routes, but it suffers from bad choices.",1642714014,1642714014,False,19,4,0.515289187431335449,0,True,False,False

Despite never actually beating the game or never even reaching Tiamat after 100+ hours of frustrating and rage-inducing deaths, there is something so charming and perfect about this game that keeps me coming back and I think it will not be long before I have 200 and then 300 hours in Spelunky 2. In my opinion this game is one of the best available on Steam, even above popular titles like Call of Duty and Borderlands, but I suppose that's just my personal taste. Every time I play I end up rage quitting, but then I'll play another game and then come right back or I'll just find myself coming back the next day. I really can't imagine myself stopping Spelunky 2 entirely, even if I finally beat the darn thing, unless I stop playing video games as a whole or something. Regardless, the controller feels so perfect and smooth playing and every death truly feels like my own foolish fault, rather than some glitch or technical error; everything is perfect down to a T.

Mela Tsuukamaki

If I could explain him to you like he does to a japanese movie-scene he would look very cool. She's unique to every level and all her abilities suit her gameplay better than every other character, she has a melee weapon like every other character but unlike the others it cannot be replaced on death, she's a pioneer with most of the unique and optional items and she takes no damage. This is the female ""everything"" of Spelunky, with the breasts of caves and the non-lethal sword of sci-fi superheroines.

Pro, con, unknown: dangerous.

The Hardest Challenge to Finish In Spelunky is the one where you have a ten way fight with your own death, multiple auto-attacks of your enemies, a dead-end that sends you to a very cramped area where you have to fight your way out and fight 3 bosses with highly dangerous attacks with a sword the size of a doorknob.

When you fail, you automatically come back with half your health. When you ""die"" your death will be permanent.

And if you aren't willing to die, you will also have a timer that counts down your mission in Spelunky. When you see the timer you have to spend the time to kill every enemy on the way until you get the time to move your hovercraft or escape Spelunky. Because of the way the time mechanic works, there's a chance that you will die while coming back with the time to start again, because you can't move your hovercraft or escape Spelunky during the timer.

This masterpiece is made by a Chinese man who got tired of torturing people with a 1,000 cuts, the water drop, and the e. coli egg noodle. This isn't the caves your uncle explored inside of you. These caves are ever-changing, yours are broken, beat, and gaped. Nobody wants none of that. What you do want is this game. Turkeys, Ankhs, Damsels, and demons await you. Death is nothing more than a familiar feeling, beating this game is something else entirely.

From there, the genre has exploded into many different variations of randomly generated levels and perma-death level difficulty; where the stakes are high and the rewards of succeeding feel that much sweeter. Spelunky was a title that, in certain variations, has existed even as far back as Isaac and it was a game i had always heard about, but never really knew if I would enjoy it.

With Spelunky 2, I decided the time was right to take the plunge; this quirky little platformer could be a bit of fun. Little did I know, this game would bring me immense frustration, laughter, elation, anger, excitement, and feelings of discovery. This game is unforgiving and doesn't hold your hand; it drops you in and leaves you to find your own way out. Maybe that's not for everyone, but at this point in my life, this game has become my favourite in all of the rogue-like genre.

Being able to overcome a level or boss brought me incredible satisfaction; being able to discover secrets and secrets within secrets probed me to dig deeper; getting to a point in the game when you think it's all over only to discover that there's much more. These are the things I've experienced from this game and being able to play with friends and seeing their exact same emotions as mine is something that makes me want to share this with everyone.

With most rogue-likes, there is usually a large slew of items you can pick-up that gives you a unique ""build"" for each run you do of the game. The lack of items in Spelunky means that most of the variation exists in the way the levels are generated; and sometimes, that variation is cursed. I've found that having a small pool of items makes almost all them useful in some way, so no matter the seed that is generated, you know that when you pick up an item, it will prove to be helpful to you in some way.

In regards to the level design, you're fighting against the RNG; sometimes it works in your favour, sometimes you're left to figure out the best escape route possible. Sometimes, the items you need are generated and easy to pick-up or purchase from the shop. Sometimes, the only clean way out is to go down a route and avoid traps and enemies. The more you play this game, the more you are able to navigate the variations in levels better than you ever thought you could.

In almost 100 hours played on Steam as of writing this, and not to mention the time i've spent on the Switch and PS4 as well, this game is an experience for those looking for a meaningful one. If you are patient and determined, I feel like this game can reward you for the time you put in and will keep you coming back to see if you can beat it again and again. I would recommend this game to everyone and hope you, too, can beat this game, even if it's just to say ""I did it"".",1642605867,1642605867,True,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

The game wants you to experiment with pretty much everything, and upon doing so you either just straight up die and get rewarded with knowledge of the game, or end up with rewards to get to get further in your run (or well, you take damage)

The gameplay never gets old. The game offers 16 biomes, in which a number of them require you to do specific objectives, in which again encourages expermentation. When doing a run, there are branching paths (as seen in the trailer) so every run feels fresh and infinitely replayable. Oh, and multiplayer is really great for this game lmao, its of those type of games that end up in a chaotic playthrough with your friends sabotaging one another or just dying hilariously. And if youre lonely with no one to play spelunky with, theres a discord server for this game and you can simply find people there to play with you

Lastly, this game has mods! And holy shit, i love the mods in this game (ill put a link of a yt tutorial video i used on how to do so at the bottom. Youll need it.)

So in conclusion, really, really.good game with infinite replayablity and about the price... in my opinion, buy it on sale, i bought mine during the chirstmas sales though, not sure when its gonna have another.

The game has a whole ton of interesting, diverse and well designed content but the problem is that all that content comes after the first 10 or so minutes of each run (even 30 minutes is not absurd) Because you will be forced to play the first stage which consists of 4 levels every single run to get to the fun point. For your first dozens of hours you will be stuck in the first stages until you get past the first boss, and these first stages happen to be the most boring and tedious ones for some inexplicable reason. With tons of bullet sponge enemies and an absolute time waste of a mini-boss. It is an extremely easy but tedious stage that is filled with traps, enemies with almost the most hp in the entire game and some quest like things that are the same every single run. If you play slow it's impossible to lose but never fun. 

In less than probably 5 hours you will have seen almost every item in the game and will have to do the exact same ""quests"" every single run for the first 30 minutes. If you happen to get past that after hours of game-play you will find yourself in a new stage and will die to some kind of trap due to lack of familiarity for sure. Then you will have to spend all that time to get past the first stage again, which will be extremely discouraging. You will be tempted to play fast and careless which will cause you to die more so you'll have to spend even more time in these stages. In the end no matter how good you get at least 80 percent of your overall playtime will probably be spent on the first stages doing the exact same things. 

The game is filled with good content but for some reason they decided to put all that after the worst, the most boring, the most time consuming and repetitive levels of the game.

Another thing to note is that due to the repetitiveness of the game there are no ""fun"" seeds, there are only good or bad seeds, an altar spawning in a run is a hundred percent good and a key spawning behind some wall is a hundred percent bad, there is a little number of items with all having only positives and no negatives, having more items is always good and least items bad, item positions good or bad. The game feels more like a regular platformer with randomly generated levels than the roguelike me and probably some others are used to where every run is a different experience with some pros, some cons and an interesting combination of items leading to different strategies each run. The level generation in this game is either good or bad with a strict line.

TLDR besides being repetitive  It is more of a tedious game than a hard one, if your life depended on it you would win it first try but if you are like me you will get to see some new and cool stuff one time, die to some new mechanic due to not being familiar then gets ruck in a loop of playing less and less careful and spending hours in the first stage because it is the most tedious and time consuming one. But if you are some kind of platforming god the game is for you because it is no doubt filled with content.",1641925791,1641925791,False,43,5,0.534973025321960449,6,True,False,False

I don't like platformers much but this game has very crisp controls and deep mechanics. It's not like Hollow Knight but I would put it on the same tier of platformers with an exceptional game feel.

The world design of Spelunky 2 is so neat, drawing from various cultures. The game also has a souls-like system for side quests. Quests are cryptic, the quest NPCs will just show up in unexpected spots as you dive deeper into the caves, and all NPCs can be killed. The implied connections between the various characters are delightful as well.

The game is hard as dirt, truly unrelenting, but generally fair (except for the Low Scorer achievement). There is no meta progression to make the game easier like you'd find in other roguelites. And as a general rule the more powerful or useful an item is the more dangerous it can be when used by inexperienced players. The teleporter lets you bypass large sections of levels but also allows you to teleport yourself into a wall, resulting in instant death. The jetpack lets you fly over dangerous obstacles and avoid using ropes to ascend but it also has a tendency to explode when exposed to fire or if punctured. Your only hope of surviving the brutal cycle of death and rebirth in the caves are your wits and experience accumulated over hundreds of failures.

Good luck, and take care of your mental. You'll need both for the journey ahead.

If you want an easy game, DO NOT play this. This hidden gem is one of if not THE hardest game I've played. But although its challenging, I can't stop saying to myself ""I can win THIS time"". In almost every run, you end up dying. Some of these deaths may be infuriating or they may be really funny. The best thing you can do is learn from your mistakes. If you die, make a new plan on how to avoid that happening again. In conclusion, this game gets a 10/10 from me, and is my all time favorite game.

Spelunky 1 was charming for the minimalism of its design and the extremism of its gameplay. The experience of being struck from an arrow-trap at the far edge of the screen and sent flying into a row of run-ending spikes was novel at the time; the consequences of errors were severe and would heavily punish careless play, but nearly any foreseen and understood threat could be avoided with only moderate platforming ability. The combination of those two traits was important: if you got stunned and sent flying, the wacky exaggerated physics meant that the consequences could range from slightly-damaging to fatal, but threats were sufficiently noticeable and telegraphed that this result was generally due to a significant and understandable misplay on the player's part, or the punishment for a 'greedy' maneuver. This also meant that the game could get away with various little clumsinesses; because the game's challenges were only moderately mechanically demanding, it didn't matter so much that some parts of the execution were awkward.  

Spelunky 2 treats the game of Spelunky as though it needs no basic improvements or updates, and only needs increased difficulty. Much content is shamelessly unchanged; for someone expecting the new game to be a *new game*, navigating the same old caves with the same old enemies and even collecting the same old Udjat Eye is a disillusioning experience. As for what content is new, it uniformly departs from the old design philosophy of predictability. New enemies move more chaotically, are harder to hit, have larger and less-avoidable methods of attack, inflict crippling and difficult to remove new status-effects. Additionally, they are more-densely packed into less-open spaces, multiplying the probability that any misstep results in a wacky chain-reaction of unpreventable fatal damage, especially given that old boons like the jetpack now often become explosive liabilities instead. The final region of the game's normal route embodies this chaotic premise wholeheartedly; a bullet-hell landscape of perpetually-circling fireballs not only turns normal enemies and their corpses into high-speed projectiles fully capable of stunlocking and juggling away whatever amount of health the player has managed to accumulate, but will make cheerful pinball-game sound-effects on each impact to emphasize the whimsical unpredictability of having an exploding UFO chucked at you from offscreen. In Spelunky 1, physics-driven instant death was always a possibility, but even near the end, it was the norm for most hazards to just deal a reasonably proportionate amount of damage and then allow you to act again. In many of Spelunky 2's areas, suffering a hit and 'just' taking damage cannot really be expected.

Making matters worse, the game's chaotic new portfolio of threats is not matched by any improvements in controllability. The slightest variation in D-pad input will still arrest the player's movement on ledges or ladders they had no intention of stopping against or flipping over; the climbing glove in particular frequently spells death in the game's chaotic later areas, introducing deadly undesired pauses into the necessarily-rapid navigation of constantly crushing elevators and eternally-milling fireballs, because the game still insists upon a minimalist control scheme for increasingly demanding platforming challenges; overloading the 'move left or right' control with 'also cling to the wall' just doesn't cut it when you have to sprint through a series of narrow, twisting, moving horizontal-and-vertical passages. Sometimes this insistence on control-minimalism makes very basic actions impossible; suppose an item the player wishes to pick up is located on a 1-tile-wide platform which can be descended through, but there is a rope passing through the platform. The player *cannot* pick up the item, because they cannot crouch on the platform to do so, because the crouch-input navigates the rope instead. But Spelunky 2 wears these clumsinesses with pride; mechanical awkwardness is a proud feature with a long history, not a bug to correct. While not a control scheme issue, this proud embrace of pointless problems is best exemplified by the Hired Hand. 'Rescuing' one of these 'allied' NPCs and attempting to actually traverse the dungeon with their 'help' invariably means being killed shortly thereafter by their wild, reckless attacking and throwing of objects; one learns just to not bother rescuing them, or if they are accidentally released, to simply kill them before moving on rather than to suffer their 'help'. No gameplay function is served by having a 'benefit' that is actually a strict liability, but that's just what kind of punitive-for-its-own-sake gameplay Spelunky 2 thinks it's supposed to be about. 

The first Spelunky was fun. This one just feels tedious. There's little joy, after having one run end due to some offscreen lava-spewing explosion, in setting off again to discover what Kaizo-style configuration of hazards will be thrown together this time. In the first game, losses felt mostly deserved and victory felt achievable with attentiveness and a *little* luck; even the alternate Hell route was enjoyable enough to both discover and to conquer without outside spoilers. In this one it's hard enough to put up with the normal game, much less embrace the even-more-random conditions dictating whether following an alternate route is feasible on a given run. So if you're a punishment-craving veteran of unforgiving precision platformers who doesn't mind intentionally-awkward controls in a game willing to punish anything less than a perfect run, go for it. Otherwise, there are other better games for sale.",1640163160,1640163160,False,4,1,0.496980130672454834,0,True,False,False

Everything is finite, nothing good stays that way, and everything you know and love will be gone with one mistake.

You will go through this game hundreds, thousands of times and end up failing on the finish line 99% of the time. Any time you slightly mess up, every time you go on autopilot, any time that you think you're safe even for a second and your run is gone and you have to start from the beginning. 

The progression of the game is one of the most convoluted I've ever seen in a video game, but it gives your existence meaning and purpose. No matter how many times you fail, you learn about the game and use that for every advantage you can before you die to utter bullshit. Eventually, every thought will be about Spelunky 2 with it infecting your dreams and causing nightmares. You will watch tip videos on YouTube that will prove that you know nothing and prove that you will do anything to succeed at this game and after many hours of this game you will finally win. Once you win, you feel amazing that despite the odds, despite everyone and everything being out to kill you, it is finally time for you to rest knowing that you beat Spelunky 2. Then you play another run and realize the only reason you won is because the game decided to be generous and not screw you over as you repeat the process.

Το Spelunly 2 είναι 2d platformer-roguelike τίτλος και ο δεύτερος της σειράς. Γενικά, το παιχνίδι ήταν αρκετά ευχάριστο, αλλά με απογοήτευσε σα sequel, ίσως περίμενα εγώ πολλά δε ξέρω. Σε αυτό το τίτλο η ιστορία είναι ότι η κόρη του πρωταγωνιστή από  το πρώτο παιχνίδι, ψάχνει τους γονείς της που χάθηκαν σε μια εξερεύνηση και πηγαίνεις να τους βρεις. Τα γραφικά και η μουσική πολύ κοντά στο πρώτο αλλά αυτό δεν είναι κάτι που με πείραξε ιδιαίτερα. Ο χειρισμός παραμένει το ίδιο καλός με το προηγούμενο τίτλο. Τα αντικείμενα ήταν ένα από τα αρνητικά για μένα ή πιο σωστά η έλλειψη αυτών. Τα boss ήταν οκ. Τα mobs τα ίδια απλά προστέθηκαν 2-3 ανα κόσμο. Με λίγα λόγια είναι ο ίδιος τίτλος με λίγες προσθήκες, κάτι που προσωπικά με έκανε να νιώθω πως απλά παίζω ένα dlc του πρώτου τίτλου και όχι το νέο τίτλο της σειράς.",1638222045,1638222045,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game challenged me. A lot. Over and over. All the failed attempts made me change my point of view: [i]""As long as you learn something from it, it's fine to die""[/i] says Derek.

Of course I'm not doing that, I'm still gonna play Spelunky 2, and alot of it. But still something feels wrong about reviewing it. Like I'm sending something away, I honestly shouldn't feel that way because it's a game and this is a review. But... after 177 hours... it just feels wrong like I truly cannot put into words how good this game is. 

It's 177 hours of something I love, something I'm passionate about. This game will beat you down, it will humble you, it will hit you like a whip with RNG so awful it makes eve the most RNG centric games want to throw up. But it never stops encouraging you to push forward, to learn, and to grow. With this game comes a mix of optimism but a moment to learn humility and replace over-confidence with a respectable amount of confidence.

And this game is just fun, whether it be the memes, the community surrounding it, the developers, or the game itself you'll find yourself having pure fun.

I waited until I was finished with all achievements to do this review, so I have done basically everything except for 7-99 although I am currently trying to start on the C.O. runs (PB is currently 7-6). I will miss going for those achievements, they kept me on my feet (that darn Eggplant run!) and I will miss the grind of the last few runs.

I don't have much more to say, not because there isn't more to say, but because I'm generally not a good reviewer and words are hard. So here's the gist. Buy this game, learn it, and learn from it. You won't regret it, it's that good.

Thank you Mossmouth, you've truly outdone yourselves.

        [td]Gameplay Loop[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]Spelunky 2 did feel like a worthy sequel to a pretty much perfect game when I first started. New kinds of worlds, completely fresh enemy types, improvements to a lot of things about the game, the addition of so many more elements, branching paths, secrets that IDK how long it's gonna take to find. While no sequel can be as fresh as the original - this one does as much as possible to achieve that. BUT - and I am adding this after a year and a half later to give it a 6 instead of 10 because I think the loop of Spelunky is much better than 2. The fact that there's a boss fight after the first world every time can get tedious. Same with the Olmec boss fight being too early. But the biggest gripe I have is with the game being too long. An everyday Spelunky run was 20ish minutes and change, and Spelunky 2 feels double that. You might say why's that a huge deal? It's because death in this game is instant for very short mistakes, and that only feels good when the runs are very quick to lose, but also win. A lot of patterns also seem much more standardized and flattened. While I do appreciate being able to be forgiven by the shopkeeper, and the mechanical ugprades - there's def a lot I'd pick in the first game that were executed much better. My ideal Spelunky would be the one with the design and music of the first, with mechanics and polish of the second.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Narrative[/td]
        [td]-[/td]
	[td]Not really a narrative other than an intro from what I've seen. But I might update this if I find out that's not the case.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Visuals[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]I REALLY dig the aesthetic design of the Spelunky games. It's actually what drew me towards Spelunky 1 as well. And during the development process, Spelunky 2 wasn't looking as good to me and I'd decided to not pick it up because of that. But it turned out looking better than HD! Much more detailed, yet still maintaining simplicity. Every enemy, object or trap pops right out of an already vibrant backdrop, while every new world feels and looks completely different from the last. But I do hope they made some of the things optional, like the green hoop effect every time you jump wearing spring shoes etc. I do find the spike traps kinda hard to spot as they look very similar to normal blocks. They don't stand out as much. The biggest bane of all though, are the bear traps which sometimes spawn in bushes - becoming completely invisible. Then there's the pink colored spikes in a certain world which blend right into everything else. TBH I don't like the visual design of that whole world itself. But overall still a solid 7/10 for me.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mechanics[/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]Another thing I was skeptical about. How are they going to improve upon an already polished game in the mechanical aspect. But they found little things I didn't know I wanted, and brought those changes. For example, the climbing gloves made you get stuck on a certain surface which could be helpful but also disastrous in Spelunky 1. Now they only work when you hold that direction. This simple change brings the control into the player's hands. The cape that's used to glide was a toggle button prompt, but now it's hold and I can see the difference it makes and the flexibility it adds. The hitbox is even more higher, and the movement is just as fluid and fast paced. The addition of liquid mechanics is a game changer and brings a lot of variety into the gameplay. I don't say this a lot, but nailed it.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Challenge[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]While it retains the identity of Spelunky still, the longer gameplay loop and just ""more stuff"" kinda waters up the overall focused challenge a little bit for. Still great though. Spelunky 1 had me doing quick, 10 minute runs, because you could finish the game really quickly but also die quickly. In this, dying is just as quick but you don't finish it quick.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Variety[/td]
        [td]7[/td]
	[td]On paper, there's just so much more than Spelunky here. Mounts, the 2nd layer, branching paths, more areas, MORE everything. And hence when I started I put a 9/10 here, but now I've come to realize that the runs actually get much more samey in this than the previous. The first area has no variety at all, and has very repeating patterns. Then you fight the same boss the same way, do the same things and it feels much more ""standardized"", down to finding the henchmen. Feels much more designed for speedrunners than for just the random wackiness that I came to appreciate in the first. Things like the Moon challenge and the similar one later felt great the first few times around but now I just find myself skipping them because of the tedium. Similar is the case with many of the game's mechanics.  [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Mapping[/td]
        [td]6[/td]
	[td]Derek Yu has got randomly generated worlds feeling like handcrafted ones down to a science - literally. No roguelike other than Spelunky makes levels feel so different each time. Not even Spelunky 2. Yep. I do think the levels tend to get a little too samey in 2 than they did in 1, for some reason. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Sound[/td]
        [td]5[/td]
	[td]Some enemies have a sound signature before they attack you, which is great. I do find the sound of the boomerang, spring shoes, jetpack, etc. to be very jarring personally, standing out instead of blending in. Udjat eye blinking isn't distinct enough and can be confused with the monkeys sound. The most disappointing thing about the game though, is that the music is just mediocre. The first game had god tier track after god tier track, the next more memorable than the last. Here it's pretty forgettable elevator music for the most part. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Interface[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]The interface is a clear improvement over the previous game. It's cleaner. It doesn't block out elements in-game. It shows PS4 icons rather than just the Xbox ones like the previous ones (even though I use the keyboard 90% of the time anyway). There is a much required ""Quick Restart"" option added. But I still have one solid gripe with it. They removed the option of ""Quick Start"" that showed up as soon the game boot up. It allowed you to get right into the action. But now you need to skip through 3 menus/cutscenes, then watch a rope descend animation, and then another animation every time you open the game. Would've liked that to be optional. Apart from that, pretty much everything is better.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Pricing & Performance[/td]
        [td]8[/td]
	[td]Great for full price, even. Performance has issues on weaker PCs but they've fixed a lot since release.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]Replay Value [/td]
        [td]10[/td]
	[td]Need I say anything? I've been on and off - playing Spelunky HD since the day I bought it to this day. I see myself playing this for years now as well. This is going to be my go-to ""pick up and play"" game and due to the quick runs - has excellent replay value.[/td]

[b]SCORE : 7.3/10[/b]

Overall I'd prob recommend it over Spelunky 1 but not by much. It's basically the mechanics where they're improved a lot, but the music, core loop and overall magical atmosphere isn't there anymore.

777 hours are a lucky number.

This is a really hard game, and very punishing, but it's also really nice. While it's hard the difficulty is adjusted by your objectives. Want to just beat the game? Good luck, it'll take a while but you'll do it reliably with some effort. Want to get the hard ending? It's reasonably harder, but you'll be ready for most of it once you have to do it. Want to get the special ending? Good Luck. That's all. It's a challenge ridiculously hard and long, but you'll enjoy the way.",1637919682,1637919682,True,2,0,0.522551119327545166,0,True,False,False

Note that I have more time with this one than it seems, as I also have the console version.  I'd thought of writing this awhile ago, but... well, it was hard to quite nail down what I thought of this one.

Thing is, I think Spelunky 2 is a good game, but... disappointing at the same time.  Look, I'm sorry, this does NOT feel like a sequel to me.  This feels like a really bizarre DLC for the previous game that, instead of ADDING content, just REPLACED a bunch of it.  That's seriously what it feels like.

Now, that might be fine if this game had GENUINE mod support, but it doesnt... so there's no Workshop to shore up the game's limited content.

And indeed, ""limited"" is how I'd put it.  Well... for the main route anyway.  Thing is, the devs went waaaaayyyyyyyyyy overboard with the stupid secrets, adding next to no content for the actual ""main"" route.  Item variety in particular was REALLY bad in the previous game... I cant think of another roguelike with such little item variety... and it's pretty much the same here.  Oh, there ARE a whole bunch of items that got added... and they're almost all exclusive to the game's overblown secrets.  This is a trend that keeps up all the way through... it aint just the items.

The ""alternate paths"" dont really help, either, as they're horribly unbalanced.  The Jungle, for instance... there's zero reason to go there, and if you've played this enough, you know exactly why.  The Temple is... not much better.  I was hoping for the game to present me with a tough choice each time I got to a branching path, but... it never does that.  I pick the same route.  Every time.  Because I cant see an actual good reason to ever do otherwise.

And the secret stuff is... look, I'll be honest.  I hate it.  I *HATE* it.  All of it.  Now, to be fair, I didnt expect to like that part of the game.  I absolutely LOATHED the entire secret ""path"" in the first game... I did a Hell run once and only once, managed to beat it on the first try (after all, once you learn how to steal in HD, you're pretty much unstoppable), and declared that I'd never, EVER even consider trying it again.   Somehow, the sequel's secrets manage to be even more annoying, which is... baffling.  Oh, dont get me wrong:  It's not a matter of ""OMG it's too hard"".  I've only made an actual attempt at [REDACTED] a few times, and out of those few times, when I screwed it up it was generally because I went in the wrong bloody door on a certain special stage.  While I havent beaten the true final boss yet, well... at the rate I've progressed, it wont be much longer (if I bother to keep trying it, anyway).  But... I dont really WANT to do any of that.  It's not much fun, and never feels rewarding to me... just irritating.  Plus, like in the first game, no matter what fun items you may be carrying with you, you WILL have to drop them at a certain point to instead carry secret-related items.  Run variety, already lacking, plummets off a cliff when doing the secret route.

And I know that Derek has stated that the game is not really meant to be something that you feel you NEED to ""fully"" beat, that it's more about the experience, which I can appreciate, but... as a lot of players know, something about it makes the whole thing just feel incomplete if you ARENT trying to do that.  Which I think is due to the low content variety in the main path... it's hard to say for sure, but the game absolutely gives that feeling, considering that half the bloody content is locked behind secrets.

Also the boss fights are just as bad as they were in the previous games... much of the time, they arent ""fights"" so much as ""massacre them in 5 seconds"".  There's one specific exception early on, but for the most part, they're all like that.

That's not to say that the game is bad... it isnt.  It's still good.  The core gameplay of the series is just as good as ever... movement and basic mechanics are still excellent, the game is still chaotic while never being TRULY unfair (usually) and hilarious things happen all the time.  It's still Spelunky.

And some things really did get improved.  One thing that bugged me about the previous game was that shops were bloody stupid.  The choice of whether to steal or not should be a tough one, but once you knew the method (which was stupid easy) you'd ALWAYS do it.  Always.  Because you were bloody invincible once you did.  It was horribly unbalanced and playing WITHOUT stealing tended to feel VERY lacking.  Here though, they changed... something.  I'm not too clear on WHAT they did, but going the non-crime route is just as valid as doing the murder thing.  Shops are a lot more interesting now and personal playstyle comes into play a lot more.  I very much appreciate that bit.  They brought back the dice game, too. And while there may not be a whole LOT of content, what IS there feels waaaaaaayyyyyyyyy more refined than in the previous game.  It's all just BETTER (except the bosses).  Granted, some things can feel frustrating at first (moles) but once you get the hang of them... you see that it all really does work well.

Heck, even the Hired Hands are better (drastically better AI).  I never, ever bothered with those guys in the previous game, because duh.  But here?  I'll USUALLY free them.  Their psychotic rampages often murder the funky heck outta enemies so I dont have to, and I've yet to have one get me killed.  These guys are way more fun than before, that's for sure.  So that's good.

Really I just wish there was MORE.  Or, that there were mods.  And yes, I know, there ARE mods, but as the game doesnt have innate support, there arent all that many as there COULD be as they are harder to make (still some cool ones out there though).

The game really is darned good, despite all that I've said... it's just that it could have been a bloody masterpiece.  If half the freaking content hadnt been locked behind secrets, anyway.  But hey, that's just me... if you LIKE secrets in games like this, you might enjoy it a lot more than I do.  There's definitely an element of personal preference in there.",1636080263,1636081999,True,18,2,0.62473762035369873,3,True,False,False

I played this for an hour and a half, died about 70-80 times, and found the whole experience absolutely infuriating. The puny jump, the fact most traps will one- or two-hit kill you, the lack of guidance to the systems that aren't necessarily that complicated but are generally quite opaque.

By the end I pretty much always knew what had killed me and had often seen it before it did so, but it wasn't a particularly fun experience, mostly because it didn't feel that rewarding.

I tend to think of myself as a very patient, iterative person, but this really was a bridge too far for me.

EDIT 2 (67 hours in) - am yet to make it past 5-1 without shortcuts. I'M CLIMBING THE GODDAMN LADDER
EDIT 3 (130 hours in) - I am complete, I do not give a single sh*t about all the secrets. This is because I am sorta tired of spikes and moles and spined lizards and witch doctors and magmas and punch-trap combos. Sigh. I beat ""the game"", with no shortcuts (though I never even made it there with shortcuts anyways). Finally. That is all I care about. I have reached what I see as the top of the ladder, I know I can stand on parts of the ladder that aren't meant to be supporting human weight, that many might say you haven't gotten to the absolute height without standing on it, but I don't really want to suffer any longer. If you thought I didn't like this game because of how much I talk cr*p about it, then you would be wrong. This is just a very well made, really hard, REALLY hard game. And I am just not use to hard games. have a good one.
EDIT 4 (424 hours in) - AAH!! This game has corrupted me... I must 100%... but I don't know if I have the strength to do it. The Low-Scorer Achievement causes me actual IRL suffering.

I have a friend who played it a lot, but I really wasn't interested in a simple platformer with cartoon like animation. It wasn't until after I did ila few runs with via remote play that I actually got an idea of this game, and decided to buy it myself.

The game is challenging, and you will die a lot. A LOT. But it's rewarding in its own way. I remember how proud I felt when I could consistently get to the end of the 4th level, and later floors one through four were breeze and I could get as far as the 10th level without a problem, and later near the end of the game (of the normal run, that is). The challenge this game creates is what has brought me back time and time again, the constant failure is what drove me to play and become better. In the end, it becomes a game of not making it to the end, but doing well in the game; finishing with style and prowess.

On top of that, there is a lot more to the game than meets the eye. Secrets, lore (even if it doesn't all make sense), and the things to uncover. Seriously, the wiki for this game is far larger than I thought it would be.

So, if you're looking for a game that will challenge you, or where you and your friends can die in the most hilarious of ways, this one I highly recommend. And for $20, I say go for it. It's worth the cost. I mean, what else are you going to spend it on? A couple of pizzas? Putting gas in your car so you can make it to that job interview? Unimportant, compared to this game.

This game has my thumbs up.

I love the Spelunky HD, and was anxious for Spelunky 2.
But I need to say: this game is more unforgiven than the first one. No matter if you have tons of life, the amount of instakill situations is frustrating. When you make a mistake, there will be a chain reaction that will deplete your life.
I made many mistakes, and died a lot. It took me hundreds hours to kill the first final boss, and many more for the last boss, and reachede the final area after more than a year playing.
This game has more options and more quests than the first one, but still take you to the same place.
Unfortunately, the music is no match to the first. Its too repetitive, and when you die a lot... well, lets say that I hate the caves theme.
I recommend this game to anyone who doesn't care with repetitions and likes to suffer. :)

Long version: I've been playing the prequel (Spelunky HD) for years (just shy of 2000 hours on Steam) and love it. I still play it a lot, try to beat the daily challenge every day and use it to kill time and hone my skills still. This Game does a pretty shitty job as a successor in my opinion and this is due to various causes. For instance, the controls are wonky and awkward. Where the prequel allowed you to precisely control your character, use every millimeter of every movement, this one is just different. It always feels like the character is drunk or kind of ""sticks"" to the ground, every jump feels awkward and just wrong. Enemies' hitboxes seem all over the place, sometimes the whip misses although you're standing right next to your target which is really annoying. I bought this game enthusiastically when it came out and expected a worthy successor to one of my favourite games ever, but I was very disappointed to learn that Spelunky 2 is a completely different game. I do not find it hard from a difficulty point of view, but it next to impossible to do anything right with these wonky controls and game design.

You don't get to keep your perks or inventory. When you die, you start over from the beginning. So this isn't a game where you can mundanely farm xp until your character is strong enough to succeed.

Firstly, the mole enemies are ridiculous, annoying, and unfair. So many runs would end because some random mole enemy would jump onto the screen from above or to the side of you without much or any warning and my character would take damage, it feels very broken. It isn't a fun game mechanic to play around and it encourages the player to have a slow approach. 
Second, the tile in the forest biome that kills you instantly looks almost identical to a regular tile. If it kills you instantly regardless of your health, surely there can be something to differentiate it from other tiles.
Lastly, when you take any damage, you are unable to move. You're still able to take damage though, so this leads to a succession of hits by one enemy, or you just being juggled by enemies and there's nothing you can do about it.

It is hard for me to be invested in each run when you can die so undeservedly and it makes me reluctant to play, otherwise the game is really fun.",1631709427,1631709427,False,4,5,0.485020279884338379,5,True,False,False

Spelunky 2 is a difficult game, and in the 60 hours that I have played this game, I have never beaten it in a non seeded run. I was able to beat it once with this seed: 2EDB3B4F, but that doesn't matter. The dwellings (first world) is brutal, with moles that come out of the walls, and lizards that can send you flying into corners just to get hit again, as well as bats, which are hard to hit from below, unless you know the backswing of your whip. I don't remember how long it took me to consistantly be able to get out of the dwellings but it was a while. The game doesn't have permanent upgrades, other than shortcuts to help you get to later parts of the game without going through the earlier parts, although if your going for secret endings and collectable stuff, you're going to need to start from the beginning either way. 

I think the level generation is alright, to me dwelling has too many repeating structures, but the rest of the levels all feel unique in each seed. Speaking of seeds, the game supports a seeded run mode (as mentioned earlier) but there is no current way to find what seed you just played in a normal run, so if you want to discover new seeds, select a random seed in seeded mode and just do that on repeat until you get a seed you like. 

The controls feel great, it's just fast enough to feel quick and fast paced, but not so fast that you feel like you're losing control of your character. The whip feels nice and heavy, with a small backlash behind and slightly above you before the main hitbox comes out, and it's really satisfying to time it right to hit bats above you, or maybe block incoming arrow traps. You can run, jump, pick up and throw stuff, and use ropes and bombs, all of which are fun to do.

Overall, I think the game is great, and only has a few low points. I think compared to the original, this game has a lot more BS. The hit stun is much longer, making it MUCH easier to get combo'd to death no matter how much heath you're at. The moles are just annoying in my opinion, and same goes for those stupid lizards, but hey the BS goes down after the dwelling. Getting past that first world may be annoying for new players, but once you do, you'll get the hang of it. I think the BS of the dwelling readies you for the game, really punishing you for pretty much everything, giving extreme examples of stuff that could happen in the later levels, and teaching you to be careful.

Overall, I'd give the game a 9/10, if it weren't for that kinda dumb first world, it would be a 10 in my opinion.

Before I go, I'd like to mention one thing, mods are really fun, and you should checkout spelunky.fyi for tons of fun mods, whether it be simple custom characters, or full on randomizers, although some do give you achievements you didn't actually earn. I only got the cosmic ocean from a randomizer, but steam still thinks I did it :|",1630120827,1630963514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The graphics are super beautiful and I love the liquid physics!

Just like the original games there are deaths that feel unfair but it's really your own bad play. Which is actually really funny most times.

I recommend this game to anyone who's played the original games and people who just like gaming in general.
I'm so glad this game came out!

Gameplay: 10/10
Graphics: 10/10
Music and sounds: 10/10

I'm going to be playing Spelunky 2 and the original games for a long time to come.
Thank you Mossmouth and BlitWorks for this amazing game, it's truly a masterpiece.

Spelunky 2 will send you down an ever expanding cave with only one goal, get all the way to the end;  and whether you like it or not, your going to have to learn somethings along the way. Spelunky 2 is a game that gives you know checkpoints and changes the layout of levels as you play; what this does is present you with new levels every time you play, so that if you want to get far your going to have to learn the mechanics or die trying. By presenting you with no real fail save for when you die Spelunky 2 promotes you to thin critically and learn from your mistakes, getting you a little bit closer to the finish line with every death, and with every discovery.

Do you like pain? Suffering even? Are you a masochist but too introverted to go out and find yourself a big titty goth mommy gf to crush your head like a watermelon between your thighs? What if you wanted something that you can sink your time in to whether it's 20 minutes or 4 hours?
Well this soul crushing game is for you!
This little box of horrors is a well veiled menagerie of torture behind a well animated and drawn cast of characters and obstacles. The platforming of the game is wonderfully brutal and buttery smooth. The fact every run starts the same and has different scenery through the levels means that the only thing you can do to improve your gameplay is to GET GUD.

This game is kinda sorta utterly full of shit. It is full of absolute garbage nonsense quarter-stealing poop.
Why is the whip only 2 pixels long? Why can't I pick something up if it lands on a platform? Why do I ALWAYS pick up the about-to-get-back-up enemy instead of the item next to it I'm trying to pick up? Why does it take a full 5 seconds before my character can stand up after 1 hit?  Why do they go ABSOLUTELY SOARING ACROSS THE LITERAL ENTIRE MAP if I get 1 hit from a spiky octopus? The answer is simple: to steal your quarters. BUT THERE ARE NO QUARTERS FOR THIS GAME, YOU'RE JUST STEALING MY FREE TIME AND MY LIFE. 
The unlockables DON'T MATTER, they change NOTHING about the game except which ragdoll you're gonna throw into the maw. Nothing matters. Terrible, awful, cheap bullshit cheating game.

This game is great if you want a real challenge coming from the original games and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something that they will have to learn and master to overcome its challenges.
-
The areas have alot of variety and can be fun to go through.
-
The challenges thrown at you are highly varied throughout the game.
-
Deathmatch is far better and more expanded on than Spelunky HD.
-
Online multiplayer works great and is really enjoyable.

-- Complaints.
The game is FAR more difficult than the first game and feels made more for those who have already played the first game.
-
Although it can still be enjoyed by newcomers its much harder to get far with friends and family who want to play more casually.
-
In Spelunky HD where the first area was easy to learn and prepared you for the next levels, Spelunky 2 the first area feels harder than the next areas strait after it and can quickly end adventures before they really start.
-
My biggest gripe with Spelunky 2 is the lack of secret areas that dont require a chain of items/events to go into,
in Spelunky HD most secret areas could be accessed by simply figuring them out through experimentation, 
but in Spelunky 2 most of the secret areas of the game require you to repeat many steps throughout the game becoming more repetitive making them lose their charm.

Which I understand that this was a reference to the true ending of Spelunky HD being expanded on,
but I wish more focus was put onto the minor secrets which would make you explore the dynamic systems rather than mostly just the ""true ending"" ones that require you to repeat the same steps each game to visit them. 

-- Graphics:
As for the graphics they look great and match the game well.

Though I personally miss the ""Indiania Jones"" feel of Spelunky HD this game brings its own appealing art style 
that feels good.

-- Soundtrack:
The music was ok at best, but honestly felt generic and repetitive most of the time.

Not close a good as the Spelunky HDs soundtrack which gave great feelings of mystery, exploration, and intensity in its levels and were went with the levels theme perfectly.

The artstyle also looks really good it made everything look great and have more detail. The soundtrack is just as good as the original maybe even better and the game has enough old features for the old fans to understand everything and enjoy it but enough new things to be considered a full fledged sequel. For example you can ride mounts in this game like turkeys and every mount gives you a double jump and it's own special power that only that mount has. The game even has a new mode and improved upon the old deathwatch mode.

Basically, there are 2 things that differentiate this game from the original. One good, one bad. Sadly, the bad outweighs the good.
The good is that there is a branching level path. At the end of World 1 and World 3, there is a split in the path, so you can proceed to worlds 2a, 2b, 4a or 4b to bring some variety to the table.
The bad thing is that the game is predictable. The original gave you  a grab bag of different tools to gather from the shop, which made each run feel different from the last as you improvised your way forward.
Those tools are still present, but there are new features you can consistently rely on. Every level has a dog and a ghost pot, which optimally you just carry to the end of the level for extra health, and extra money respectively. But you can only hold 1 item at a time, which makes this tedious. And even worse if you want to grad another holdable item to bring with you. Sometimes, there will be a golden idol in a trap, that you also want to bring to the exit or shopkeeper, which again, just makes the errand running back and forth worse.
Levels 1-2 will have either the udjat eye, another carry item from A to B quest, or wild turkeys. 1-3 will have the other scenaria. Wild turkeys can be bombed or otherwise cooked for extra health, or ridden to enable a double jump and slow falling until they take too much damage and die. Then when they die, you bomb them for extra health. If you're feeling adventurous, you can kill turkey fetish man to grab an extra turkey and some extra treasure. You really shouldn't give him the turkeys though, as they're just more useful than his rewards.
The really big problem with the turkeys is that they largely invalidate many of the items that you would ordinarily have to rely on. The double jump means you need to use far fewer ropes, or the climbing glove, and straight up don't need the spring shoes. The slow falling renders the cape redundant unless you switch mounts or your turkey dies. And since you have access to these every run, the items they invalidate rarely have time to shine. Oh, also, the spike shoes don't work while you're on a turkey.
The game is still a tough as nails fun roguelike platformer. But the predictability really kills the strengths of the roguelike genre. The original did not have this particular issue. Both will kill you a lot though, in a mix of fair and unfair manners. I want to say Spelunky 2 is substantially harder, but it's been long enough since I played the original that I can't say for sure.",1628653873,1628653873,False,2,2,0.493618965148925781,0,True,False,False

EDIT: After beating hard ending on around 230 hours mark and many great QoL updates, I can safely say that this is the best game ever made for me. It hits everything that I love: randomly generated levels each run that always keep me on my toes, no in-game progression that makes my win purely based on my skill and a little bit of luck, and simple mechanics that chain together into a hard, but winnable challenge.

What I dislike on many modern roguelike games are in-game unlockables that makes the character stronger, thus giving an illusion of the players become significantly much better, even though their skills only increase a little. Spelunky will make sure that each challenge that you overcome are the result of you learning from past failures, correct threat identification, and correct response to such threat. You will feel your own skills increasing as you beat the seemingly insane and impossible challenge.

This game may frustrate many players. I can understand that. Due to random nature of the game, sometimes Spelunky just throw a few bullsht at you that you can't respond in time. I too had my fury with this game's bullsht in the past. It's also because it's the first time someone encounter a particular threat. But, most of the time, it's due to the players' own folly. Taking things slow (most importantly, by changing the default movement into ""walk"" instead of ""run""), identifying threats, and act accordingly, are the only things that you need to beat normal ending every time. Hard ending is entirely a different thing, though, and only players who truly enjoy Spelunky will attempt doing that.

If you can't imagine enduring Spelunky by yourself, good news, Spelunky online multiplayer is ready and great to use. Find yourself a friend or two or three and try to beat the game together! It may make the game slightly easier, but everything is much more fun with friends and you can all laugh at your undoing together. You don't have friend to play with? Go to discord.gg/spelunky and find someone to play with there.

In conclusion, Spelunky 2 is a worthy successor to Spelunky HD and a testament to Spelunky's game design. This is the best game ever for me and I truly recommend it for anyone looking for a pure challenge.

The previous Spelunky HD is one of my all time favorites, and my gold standard for modern roguelike games. I can understand that Derek Yu wanted to make his sequel more challenging, but Spelunky 2 goes way too far with it, to the point that it isn't even close to fair anymore. 

But to be fair, the game does some things better than its predecessor, and I wanna list some stuff off, both good and bad.

There's lots of new characters! Each character has a unique kind of rope that they use, which is a nice touch. I also really like the newer character designs and the big influx of new characters to unlock. 

I like the new golden idol altars in zone 1 more than in the original. The giant pillar is much more manageable than a giant wild card boulder of death that could easily ruin a run by crashing into a shop or a vault far off screen from you.

There are many more zones to explore this time. Not only that, there are two different paths you can take at the end of zone 1! I love that! 

I love the turkeys and other mounts that you can use and even keep between floors. Those are cute and I love them.

There are now mini game shops that let you enter a special challenge room where you can earn money and prizes. Sweet!

As for the bad things....

Moles are an obnoxious new enemy that can chase you through walls and floors. I've lost count of how many times they've dropped on me from seemingly out of nowhere because I can't see everywhere at once, or I ended up stuck between a gopher and another hazard and couldn't avoid taking damage because I can't watch the the whole screen.

There is a now an equivalent to the tiki trap that shows up in zone 1, and that's pretty neat! But the arrow traps are now 2 or 3 times as frequent as before. Staying on alert for them means you basically can't ever stop being paranoid about them. The first one wasn't nearly this stressful about that. 

Enemies are far more frequent now, and avoiding one enemy very frequently leads you straight into something else. 
 
The first zone has an actual boss enemy that will very easily instantly kill if you aren't extremely careful, and that got old really fast. 

Sometimes a level will just randomly be HUGE. That wouldn't necessarily be a big problem on its own, except...

The ghost in this game is much more punishing for players who want to explore a bit. And the thing is, it already WAS punishing for players in the last game. It's just even more so now. It now splits into multiple faster ghosts if you aren't quick to get out when it arrives. The previous game already didn't really give you that much freedom to explore levels, so this change seems needlessly aggressive. I could see this being a feature in a version of the game meant to challenge speedrunners, but having it in normal runs seems cruel. 

This game feels a lot like one of those ""insane brutal challenge designed to make children cry"" challenge mods made for the most dedicated fans of a game. Except that's just the standard game here. And its just not that fun to me. 

This would be a whole other thing if the game had a difficulty option, and this were merely the hard mode. But there isn't an option to make any of this less of a chore.

I gave it my best try! But I just can't justify playing it anymore. I sank over 600 hours of my life into the previous game, and I had a blast with it. I'm putting Spelunky 2 down after 30, because it's just not worth playing any more.",1603505451,1628228423,False,33,4,0.548788964748382568,0,True,False,False

I am aware that a lot of the things that made dwelling unfun have now been since patched such as mole iframes, arrow whipping w/ platform descending etc. 

The area is considerably less grating than when the game was first released. I do still stand by the zone being overall bland with its lack of variety (variety that Mines from Spelunky HD had in spades) and formulaic progression. Udjat Eye spawns can be quite frustrating if the key spawns at the bottom of the map and the chest at the top but overall dwelling does feel better and will be less punishing to new players so I will change this review to a recommend, I have accrued over 100 hours in it after all, so I have got my money's worth and I'm sure others will too. 

I will note that I am still a little bit disappointed by Spelunky 2, particularly by the soundtrack and the variety/formulaic nature of a given run, but that is just me.


Everything below this point is from how the game was over a year ago and has since had many patches. Some content is not relevant anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------------------



Heading into Spelunky 2 off the back of hundreds of hours of HD has been great fun and I love a lot of the new mechanics and features, the new shops, optional quests, the back layer, fluid physics etc but I feel like your average person won't find enjoyment from Spelunky 2 for reasons I will detail below

Dwelling, the first stage. I'll split these issues into 3 categories

1/3 Formulaic progression from 1:1 to 1:4
This area is absolutely far too busy and more often than not is extremely unfun and unrewarding. 1:1-1:4 is practically the same everytime save you may find an alter or dark level, and the Key/Yang optional quest may alternate between 1:2 and 1:3. For a game like spelunky this repeating formulae doesn't work and results in very boring, time consuming gameplay which honestly just feels like a chore. I realise the turkeys are optional but the health they give for blowing them up is pretty important considering the difficulty of Dwelling. The further levels do not have this issue really at all. The Quillback fight is incredibly repetitive once you've done it a few times and doesn't need to be a guaranteed event.

2/3 Resource rarity and too resource consuming:
The terrain generation on dwelling is extremely punishing in that you practically have to use all your resources to get around, there's many areas where it's completely impossible to scale back up the level without sacrificing ropes. it's not uncommon to have to use 2 ropes and a bomb or two to get Udjat eye. This wouldn't be so much of an issue if crates weren't so rare. It feels like there's maybe a quarter of the crates you got in this level's equivalent in Spelunky HD and even then crates weren't incredibly common. This wouldn't be a problem (and isn't) if this type of resource consuming level generation was saved for later in the game when you have established a run with resources to spare. 

3/3 The sheer amount of mobs, arrow traps + moles and lizards
Dwelling practically plays out like a Spelunky HD Frozlunky Sashavole generation mod, you'll know what I mean if you've played it. The amount of mobs you can see at any one point in the area is far too high, especially considering the moles which have 3 health and can move through blocks + the lizards which also have 3 health and whilst aren't terribly hard to avoid are still very time consuming and frustrating to deal with. I don't know why Derek/The development team decided to add 2 new mobs both of which have 3 health as it breaks down the pacing of this first stage quite a bit. On top of this, moles seem to have iframes when moving in and out of blocks (I've not tried with explosives as bombs are precious on the first area). Additionally there's also an insane amount of arrow traps, it's not uncommon to see 2 arrow traps pointing directly in the area of your spawn from the getgo, and there's plenty of traps which cannot be dealt with via arrow whipping due to their placement which further breaks the pacing as you have to go find an item to set them off.

Also, the music for Dwelling can get incredibly grating and is generally slightly disappointing when compared to Spelunky HD's first area's 3 great songs, though I appreciate it does fit the theme of the level.

The culmination of all these things makes the first area game a complete slog and will definitely put off would-be new players.

Post-Dwelling

Once you're past the first area the game is actually incredibly fun, Jungle and Volcana are both equally interesting areas. They both have lots of variation and extra flair added to them. Volcana having dead are restless, dark and the factory variations which are rare and exciting to come across + Vlad's castle and the Jungle having dead are restless, dark + the black market and any other variations I've not yet seen. Both areas contain unique, fun and challenging mobs without being overbearing (moles, lizards)

The Olmec fight is okay, it's kind of silly that on the second stage you practically just AFK whilst he destroys the level so you can decide if you want to go to temple or tide pool, but it's okay and i appreciate olmec is kind of a nice homage to the first game if anything even if the fight isn't great.

From my experience Tide Pool, Ice Caves and Babylon are all good zones although I think Babylon's mobs are a little bit boring mechanically even if their artwork is awesome, I've not played enough of temple to comment. Although all of the zones except for maybe temple are far more laid back than the clusterfuck that is dwelling and it causes the games' overall progression to feel disjointed and weird as the game is seemingly getting easier from the first area.

I will note that Tide Pool is a particularly beautiful zone with a brilliant soundtrack and comforting colours on the eyes, I think the balance there is absolutely spot on and it's plenty interesting with the different shops, Excalibur to retrieve, levers which you can interact with to alter the level + other things in the back layer I've not yet worked out.

The problem with all these great zones and pieces of content is that when you die (and you will die a lot) you are sent back to the insanely grating and unfun first zone which really kills motivation to play in general for me. I generally am more upset over having to play on dwelling again than I am about losing all my gear and progress. However I do appreciate the game has only been out for a few days and there is a certain amount of time that needs to pass before people properly adjust, especially HD veterans.

If you are considering buying this game and have not played Spelunky HD, I strongly suggest you go play that before you make a decision as it is on sale fairly frequently and is a great game, especially for its low cost.

I hope the Spelunky 2 team makes some adjustments to Dwelling, either mob spawning being toned down, moles and lizards are adjusted (health, speed or something else) or at least spawn crates more frequently throughout the level to give the player a chance in terms of resources.

Small annoying side notes:

Hitboxes on mobs, particularly skeletons, moles and the rockdogs feel incredibly small if I am off centre by even a fraction I will take damage from what should've been an easy stomp, which makes the game feel clunky and unfair (Unsure if this is still valid, feel like there may have been improvements)


Drill on Volcana almost always goes through lava which can make getting down to Vlad's castle practically impossible which means the time and resources spent getting the Udjat Eye are essentially wasted.

Completing Yang's quest in 1:2/1:3 is almost worthless as you aren't even guaranteed a single crate for the time it takes to do it",1601582571,1628045532,True,0,0,0.710900306701660156,58,True,False,False

Spelunky 2 builds up on all the hard time you had before, making it incredibly hard to go through the game. It's still fun and addictive as hell, bringing a lot to discover and fresh ideas. Also great artwork and animation. And fantastic gameplay. Seriously the game's really good, let me just vent out a little:

Where the problems start, at least for me: the game is somewhat obtuse every now and then. Some sections break the momentum and you're in the middle of something that's not that fun at all, like when the elevator goes through a lava pool, or those infuriating moles don't make up their minds, or having to search for the correct statue, and so on. The number of traps, plus the two ghosts mechanics, get in the way of wanting to search an area better. I get it's part of the difficulty, but it's still something that keeps someone from exploring the game, which I would debate is a good idea. And still the game finds other ways to punish you, like losing Qilin to the ceiling lasers and ruining your run.

Spelunky 2, for me, unfortunately ended up being more frustrating than fun. If you're just playing for the regular ending and not touching it again, then I'd say the game is on point in terms of difficulty and punishment. It's said every death in Spelunky 1 is by your own fault. I'm not so sure about that, but that's definitely not the case here. The game will be upfront unfair now, expect that, and try to laugh in the process.

Just like before, the walls are shifting again.

However, 200 hours into the game it becomes repetitive. The first area is boring and excruciating to play through. All of the deaths are insta kills and half of them aren't the players fault.

Yu had a real time of it with this, a sequel to one of the few nigh-perfect games to exist, and adding More largely did the trick , more secrets, more enemies, more levels, more items, more horrifying ways to die like a bitch, but with a price.


Multiplayer was borked and still is dicey. Some levels are much harder than others and seemingly out of order (Temple FAR outstrips anything till the Cosmic Ocean in terms of sheer lethality), saps the quality from this down from its predecessor a bit.


There's other things that are different but not bad; the game seems to revel in metagaming out in the exact opposite way from 1. Knocking over shopkeeps is much less effectual now, as is using backpacks, but other things are buffed.

I had thousands of runs on Spelunky classic, and about 50 or so hours on the HD remake. When the sequel came out, I was extremely excited! And then I wasn't, because it's hard as fuck. 

I considered it a miracle to get to the jungle area in Spelunky 2 when I first started playing it. Anything beyond that was absolutely unreal to consider. I played for about 5 hours before dropping it completely. 

But my problem was that I was expecting Spelunky HD (Part 2), rather than a proper sequel. The old tricks won't work, there's too much that has changed for me to expect to be good from the start. And this is a good thing! The sequel changes enough of the formula to stand apart from the other two games. But I didn't appreciate that at first, hence why I ragequit. 

After playing it for a bit more, I still haven't beaten it, but I've made it past Olmec, past the Ice Caves, into Neo-Babylon. I'm getting better all the time.

I actually thought that maybe my skills had deteriorated for a bit - but I downloaded Spelunky HD and beat it on my first try. It just goes to show you that Mossmouth has done a fantastic job of adding variety to the game and increased the difficulty so that people like me who've played Classic and HD will not just stroll through this in a few playthroughs.

That's what Spelunky 2 feels like - a fun variety mod of Spelunky with extra stuff and higher difficulty, but not as streamlined and well-balanced as the original.  

Spelunky is a great game.  I didn't think it was perfect, but it had a lot of stuff to do, tight controls, high challenge, and a really engaging quick loop.  Spelunky 2 mostly maintains this...  But increases the challenge, increases the number of instant death traps, makes the first area more irritating (the moles and lizards aren't fun obstacles, at all), adds a couple of bosses that are mostly tedious (does ANYONE like Quillback?) and slow down runs, all kinds of stuff like that.  

This is not to say Spelunky 2 isn't fun or a good game.  It absolutely is, and hence I still recommend it.  If you've played the hell out of Spelunky and want more, you should get it.  But if you're just picking one, I'd take the original.  It's a more fun experience, more replayable, and less frustrating.  

I should be clear here - I did beat Spelunky 2 without shortcuts (I didn't get to the secret levels, not sure if I care too, but I beat the core game).  It's doable.

Yet in spite of the games utterly ruthless and unforgiving nature, in the beginning the feeling of constantly making progress will reward you enough to keep you playing, learning new tricks and mechanics, and improving at the game without even realizing it at times. You'll look forward to each new discovery with equal parts anticipation and dread for how it's going to end up getting you killed. And yet as you play you'll realize that nearly every single one of your deaths were entirely avoidable, and you'll usually know precisely how you fucked up. Spelunky 2 makes it abundantly clear that the only barrier to success is your own knowledge and mastery. 

To compliment this idea, despite having randomly generated levels, Spelunky 2 is very consistent, reliable, and mostly avoids common trappings of games that rely heavily on random elements. In the end, while getting good luck on items is desirable, no matter how well your run is going you can still die to many of the same mistakes that you could die to at the very start. And yet looking at the other side of this coin, the game can always be somewhat reasonably completed front to back without ever picking up anything at all. And while the levels are random, you'll inevitably start to understand and anticipate the world gen for each area. Anything involved in chains/quests will always spawn in the levels you expect them to, and hell, you can even skip entire quest chains if you're good enough to pull it off.

I'm writing this recommendation having just finished acquiring every achievement in the game. The process of learning and mastering this game is one of the most satisfying experiences I've had in gaming. Even when hitting roadblocks, sometimes taking weeks to get by in the case of some achievements, the feeling of pushing past made it well worth it in the end for me. I'd even go as far as to say that this is a game I wouldn't mind forgetting everything about, just so I could experience the thing again.

At this point, the only concrete goal I have left in sight is making it through Cosmic Ocean to 7-99. I don't know if I'll ever get there, but damned if I'm not gonna keep coming back to this game to try. 


Oh, and if there's one bad thing I can say about it, it's that having one music track for each area does suck quite a bit after you've listened to the Dwelling theme 1500+ times. Compared to Spelunky HD having 4+ tracks for most areas, not to mention having generally better music overall, it can be a surprising drag on 2 at times. Doesn't take away from the rest of the game though.",1625620037,1626933455,True,1,0,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

For someone like me going in blind and refusing to look on the internet for help, it can be frustrating to spend an entire day of attempts to reach a new area, only to die instantly because you didn't know what a new enemy did, then have to go through the whole process all over again for each new enemy.

Pretty much the same as the first, which is to say that it's can be a fun game but it's often pretty unfair compared to a lot of other roguelikes so it's not as rewarding as others in that genre. It also feels like it doesn't respect the player's time. A bad ""Time to beat"" vs ""Time to die"" ratio. That mental reward of progressing through something challenging just doesn't click because most of my deaths are bad luck or for example, messing up whipping a bat. Bats aren't normally deadly but since everything has knockback it knocks me into something that is lethal. One hit kill, splat, impale, etc. Go through the mines again, hopefully you don't have levels with barely and gold. Woops, the cat is in a small hole in the ceiling I need to throw bombs to get to. No health for me. Not that it matters.
I have beaten the Lich(and the Rat) in Gungeon, the Captain in Nuclear Throne, gotten to BC3 in Dead Cells, Extreme Measures 4 in Hades, all C sides and Farewell in Celeste, beaten Steredenn, beaten Noita, beaten all bosses in Sekiro. Beat the first Spelunky and got to Hell but didn't beat it through there. I'm good at and enjoy hard games but this I think about playing and then just don't. 

That being said, if you loved the first then get this, but I just liked the first and I think this was a step in the wrong direction. Not recommended, they can keep my money but they're not getting more of my time.",1601504533,1626230497,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The typically fair, but brutally challenging randomness of the generated maps, plus the endless interactions this game has, will provide you with endless goals to strive for. 

The difficulty is somewhat dynamic with multiple endings, and multiple zones to choose from along your way, each with their own unique enemies, traps, npcs, items, and even bosses! 

With it's ultra responsive controls, combined with smooth animations, navigating through the different environments feels perfect, and everything you do, purposeful.

As you learn how enemies move, traps work, and most importantly: how to utilize your whip and items you find, you'll eventually find yourself at the victory screen feeling more accomplished than ever. 

The only thing that might steer you away is it's extreme difficulty. Don't let it's charming nature and sprite-work fool you; nearly everything in this game is designed to end your life if you aren't careful. Despite how much fun the game is, if you take it too seriously it'll piss you off. You'll call the developer things you have never even heard of before. Sometimes though, your death is so spectacular that it feels like a win, especially if you can use shadow play or something to record the moment to share with your friends later.  

I highly recommend that if you are getting particularly frustrated to simply take a break. I often find that my best runs are the first one of the day, or after a long rest. The dwelling is also the most difficult zone in my opinion, so if you can get past 1-4, you can beat Tiamat. Also, don't be afraid to read guides and watch other players. There is no way any one player could figure out everything in this game. I even suspect as of the time of this review, that there may still be secrets left.

So grab your hamter or grab your friends and journey into the forever shifting rabbit hole.
Good Luck, and may Kali be pleased with you.",1625914814,1625914814,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've realised that this is an impossible task, but I will do my best and talk about everything that stands out to me. Compared to the original Spelunky HD, this game just demolishes it in literally every category except one. and you know what? Spelunky HD is my second favourite game in the genre. The only thing Spelunky HD has over Spelunky 2 is the music, with there only being about 2 tracks per area (main theme and dark level theme) compared to Spelunky HD's about 4 tracks per area. Spelunky HD has the better OST, but that almost feels like a nitpick. Similarly to the last game, this is the most replayable game I have ever played in my life. This is due in part to the slow uncovering of separate objectives and the discovering of new areas. This brings me to arguably the best addition to this game. Branching paths. While Spelunky HD was replayable to no end, every run took you to the same 4 main areas (or 5 areas if you were cool); Spelunky HD is a short game, and that wasn't an accident. Spelunky 2, however, while not being much longer, is a lot denser. I know this was said by Derek Yu himself in the overview trailer but I mean he was right. There is simply a lot more to do here (which adds to that replayability). People have been saying that the game is ""too difficult"" or ""not fair""; This is what I have to say to those people: this is a sequel to the game Spelunky. Of course it's going to be difficult and occasionally unfair. I have had my fair share of runs ended or impaired due to bad luck, and while I'm not going to argue that people should ""get better"" I am going to argue that people who bought this game knew or should have known exactly what kind of game they were adding to their steam library. Spelunky 2 is my favourite 2D platformer of all time, and this is coming from the person who's fondest memory is playing New Super Mario Brother Wii with his dad. Screw the Wii and screw Mario. Spelunky 2 is a masterpiece and will be looked back as such in years to come.

-winning a run in multiplayer boots you to the main menu
-cannot change an settings (audio/video) mid multiplayer run

I am 60.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realise that.

Thank you

Somehow the game ends up encouraging you to overestimate your abilities and to bite off more than you can chew in the very limited time given to you to complete each level. As the result eventually you end up failing horribly. (It is actually possible to complete the game in multiple ways which you can choose depending on your arrogance as you progress through the game but you almost never succeed, because you are forced to act fast and in the hurry you almost always end up making SOME kind of a stupid mistake and failing.)
But that's not necessary a bad thing. That's what gives this game an infinite amount of replayability and the fun never runs out. It's difficult to learn and difficult to master. But even if you are a n00b the amount of fun you get makes up for that.
If you are interested in this game then I recommend to start with Spelunky 1 (the ""HD"" version from 2013). If you start with Spelunky 2 instead then you will miss some of the story and also it will be more difficult to start playing than it actually needs to be. So start with Spelunky 1 if you didn't play it yet and try to complete it's most difficult route (which means ""going through hell"") before you start with Spelunky 2. It's not horribly wrong to just start with Spelunky 2, but as someone who played and liked both of these games I don't recommend it.",1623224066,1623224066,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I found myself using the shortcut to the second area all the time after I unlocked it, as the first area just feels the same every time; if I do play it, an incredible number of runs will end right there, becoming rather frustrating.

Overall though I do recommend it, but I would recommend playing the first game beforehand if you haven't yet done so; or if you want an experience that is challenging but less frustrating.

I've been playing Spelunky since the original 2008 game, the remake was fantastic but this one is unfairly difficult. Not the kind of fun git gud difficulty the other games had either, it just feel ridiculous at some points, and moving an extra inch in the wrong direction can get you killed.

This game seems to have gone in the same direction as TBOI: repentance, it might appeal to particularly sadistic veterans but everyone else will be alienated. It would have been nice if they gave you the option to disable that *** ghost by now as well.

This sequel has improved on just about everything that the original had to offer, with more worlds to explore, the addition of mini quests, ride-able mounts, and new gear. Whether you are a long time spelunker or are new to the indie platforming series, I highly recommend this game.

A lot of my review is targeted more towards those who have played one of the two original games, but for those who are new bear with me.

A few things in particular I enjoyed game play and control wise was the addition of the auto run option, as the toll your fingers took from pressing down a button for the entire time you are playing can now be avoided entirely. In this iteration of Spelunky, being able to attack enemies that have been stunned with other objects is very much appreciated, as it use to be that you would have to wait for an enemy to become conscious again before you could land another hit on them.

Some things to keep in mind while playing this game is that this game follows the formula of if you die, you go back to the start, which may be frustrating to some people. There are a lot more ways to die in this game, and quite a few of them are one-hit kills, some of which you can see in the game trailers. While these may appear to be unfair in nature, the longer you play the game, the more tactical you may become and will wisen up on ways to avoid or destroy said obstacles. 

This game has a lot of replay value, and for those who are considering getting this game, I would recommend trying to get all of the steam achievements legitimately. There are three different endings (not saying what they are for those who want the blind experience) and there are may play styles you can follow, being a classic law abiding citizen, a master criminal (which was ultimately what nearly every run ended up looking like in Spelunky HD), a saver of animals, or a fool (shh its a secret!) among other roles.

Once you have gotten ""The Full Spelunky"" I would recommend trying out mods for the single player experience, as my playtime has doubled just playing the Spelunky 2 randomizer and reverse game mods (you can look for instructions to safely install mods online if you are really interested). You can also use mods to practice techniques that otherwise may be costly in a normal run.

I don't want to say too much, as part of the fun of the Spelunky series is finding out all of the secrets for yourself and experiencing the rush of finding a secret location or item. For now I will leave you with my recommendations for this game, and happy spelunking!",1622447785,1622447785,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

With run after run failing, I also fail to laugh at my own failures, only leaving frustration. It certainly does not help that Spelunky 2 is even harder than its successor. I wonder which playerbase is catered here.

What was a huge plus for me, to be able to fail together with a friend online but sadly this is not possible either for now. In my opinion the online coop can maybe eliviate the frustration a littlebit because you ""struggle together"". But all of my friends are reluctant for coop due to Spelunky 2's high difficulty.

This one, however.. I love the charm, and the look. A lot of the new mechanics are really intriguing! But I'm struggling to enjoy my experience because I can't get beyond the jungle or purple industrial area without getting my ass handed to me handily. 

I love Spelunky.. and maybe I do just suck now. But this lovable game is just a bit too punishing, even for seasoned Spelunkers.

Don't expect to walk in and know what you're doing. But for those who are willing to take their lumps and learn from their mistakes, Spelunky 2 is exceptionally rewarding. 

Don't be afraid to look to the community for help when learning, there's always more to learn about Spelunky 2 and I certainly wouldn't be half as good without the community.

What do you normally expect from a sequel? To be worse... Right?

IT'S NOT THE CASE HERE. This game is just.. Incredible. Like absolutely an improvement to every aspect of Spelunky HD. It's harder, It's Bigger, It's More fun, It's a little more revolutionary... Spelunky 2 is Spelunky-ier.

For starters let's talk about traps. Ah yes my favourite part of Spelunky HD and also the bane of most players. Let me explain.

There is a lot more traps (Some come back like the Arrow trap, Crush trap, Spikes, Lava, Water, Boulder) with some being old ones remade. For example, remember the tiki trap? Remember when in your first hours of HD they would get you sooo often, those traps so damn tricky right? You thought That after completing the game 100% and all other shit you would be safe, right? Let me introduce you to Totem traps in the FIRST AREA. Yes they do deal 2 damage instead of 4 but they behave exactly the same. Enemies are also remade. The bat was so annoying in HD right? Yeah how funny it would be when you find Rolling lizards with 3 hitpoints that can charge and slowly kill you with their powerful rolls. Or Meeting the moles, which dig through the ground (Not Wood) and can pop up from the ceiling and really traverse the whole level! Who's got teeth like spades and need no shades? CAVE MOLE! CAVE MOLE! This is balanced because of health being easier to come by, Other than  saving Monty, Percy or Poochi, you can cook turkeys (Find that out for yourself :D). You'll also have to pick between branching paths as you go deeper into the challenges that await you.. And in some cases, One can be better than the other! One of them is a Volcano inspired area with a lot of instadeath lava, And one can even be an place from HD! Please play this game for the love of god. I just want to say.. This is a love letter, for the Spelunky community. Thank you Mossmouth, for working on this game so hard. The only bad thing i can get in my mind is no variety in the official soundtrack of the game. But this is replaced by Dynamic music and It's just more atmospheric. Actually this game can predict how you feel by the music so prepare for that. This is my longest ever review (Even longer than the Spelunky HD one) But. Just straight up buy this game, But prepare yourself for one of the hardest games ever created. Myst3ry's out.
