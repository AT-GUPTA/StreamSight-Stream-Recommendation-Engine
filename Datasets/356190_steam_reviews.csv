This is just a jumbled unfinished mess. Avoid unless you're extremely patient with the janky movement and terrible controls. You're going to die multiple times just because the game decided to jump up a wall instead of jumping over the enemy you're fighting.
 - So many cutscenes mid-fights. A captain appeared, a captain re-appeared. A captain amushed you.
 - Button prompts everywhere
 - Janky sluggish movement in combat
 - Terrible reaction to controls. You press the button prompt and so many times nothing happens
 - You're waiting for a button prompt to counter which never happens
 - The entire nemesis system is a huge annoyance this time around. Feels more like a tax than something you can have fun with.

I've lost count of the amount of times I tried to perform a ledge grab just to end up stabbing some random dude in the middle of enemy camp. Or when I tried to clamber up a wall, while looking at it, just to have Talion literally run the OPPOSITE direction and throw me in the face of an enemy captains trap. I lost a siege, after hours of preparation, because my bodyguard got stuck in a wall and I couldnt handle the sheer amount of enemies stunlocking me in place.

While that was definitely the feeling I got after finishing it, time has passed and my taste in games changed, yet I got back into it to get all the missing achievements and play the story one more time just to discover that the game is as good as I remember and it's still up there in my top of best games ever made.
Shadow of War is exactly what a sequel should look like, you get what people loved about the previous game (Shadow of Mordor) and you improve every single aspect of it. The story, even if it's non canon, it was greatly improved. While the first one felt more of a prologue and an introduction for Talion's adventure, this one has multiple storylines that make it great, including a great ending where our Ranger is not banished from death anymore. It has, by far, the best mechanics you can find in any RPG title, with a very generous skill tree that lets you tremendously improve the combat experience from the beginning to the end. The story expansion DLCs were also amazing, Blade of Galadriel and Desolation of Mordor introduce new gameplay elements that are just as good as the main campaign, a little bit too short, but a great experience. This game also has the most underrated system in all of the gaming history: the Nemesis system that has such a huge depth and allows you to encounter unique enemies with their own personality leading to infinite replayability. 
Just to briefly show the complexity of the Nemesis system, here is a story from my latest playthrough: I was trying to get the achievement ""Everything Is Permitted"" where you need to Shame an Assassin until he becomes Deranged. I found one in Núrnen, I beat the crap out of him and shamed him. Than I tracked him down and when we met again, he received the title ""The Unashamed"" continuously moking that he can not be shamed. I beat him, shamed him again and tracked him down to shame him for the third time. After that he became Deranged and I got my achievement. Shortly after, he ambushed me, not being able to speak words anymore and I ended his misery. I thought that was it, but after many quests, I returned to Núrnen just to be ambushed by him after cheating death. I killed him one more time, but he had the perk for BloodBrother with one of my Orc Followers, meaning I was betrayed, so I had to kill his brother too. Time passed and I got ambushed by him again as he cheated death the second time. I decided to not kill him now, so instead I made him my bodyguard. After taking the fortress, I made him the Overlord so he can't bother me anymore. After finishing the game I decided to make him fight for his life in Fighting Pits and he died. He returned from the death once again and this time I couldn't dominate him, because he remembers how he died, having the Iron Will to resist. I need to mention that every single encounter he adapted and learned from his previous lives so I had to use new tricks to kill him.
I really wish to see another title from Monolith Studios in the future. I recommend this game with all my heart!",1532204067,1708263528,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Imagine if they were able to make another game with this system, not a sequel necessarily. How could they add to the system, polish it, and just how much fun would it be? 
I was complaining how this would never happen but someone said that there was a Wonder Woman game announced, but looking into it, it was announced AND NOTHING ELSE. It's been quite a while too... but I'm not holding my breathe.


I replayed this game (first run was on my PS4 at release) and frankly, it's still amazing. I had a particularly rough start since I played on the hardest difficulty (not Brutal) and kept dying. Thankfully, I managed to get past the start and start dying less. 
I don't understand what people complain about the plot. It immediately starts setting up something but kinda vaguely. What ends up happening is that it is leading up to a plot twist and even though I knew it was coming, I was still at the edge of my seat when I got to it. 

If I have a major complaint, it would be that picking up artifacts/relics/whatever in this game -> has a voice over thing that you get to listen to. It is relevant to the relic and adds lore and stuff. Good stuff! What's the complaint? No subtitles; and if you back out, it stops. It doesn't play until it gets interrupted (that would make sense) or something... it just stops.

Something that happened to be me in my original PS4 run, and I'm remembering this very clearly, is that there was a certain captain with Iron Will. I killed this jerk over and over and over and over again, including decapitating him, but he would revive and revive and are you kidding me? I thought decapitating him permanently solves this problem? I got lucky that he was dazed with execution attacks, so he was an annoyance more than anything. I dubbed this as the ""Persistent Captain.""
Some time after I finished this game (original run), I saw other people's ""Persistent Captains"" and I was jelly because mine was kinda dumb and could only brag about how he is like Talion - with the ability to come back no matter how many times I killed him... also his weakness kinda ruined things. Someone else got a poet of sorts as their Persistent Captain and I was quite jelly of that one in particular. 
And... I didn't get a ""Persistent Captain"" in this run. Maybe it was the difficulty or something?


Anyway, in conclusion, I highly recommend this game and the prequel, Shadow of Mordor. You can get both for incredibly cheap price during the sale - including all the DLC - and I highly recommend both. With the exceptions of hating Lord of the Rings and/or Batman Arkham Style combat, everyone should enjoy these games very much.",1707787990,1707787990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros
THE NEMESIS SYSTEM is very good and gives near infinite replay value (random generated orcs with stories)

Very cuul finishers

The skills are actually interesting with interesting modifiers, you also get them in just the right ammount

Cons:

Enemies are randomly generated, meaning you can (rarely) get stuck on an orc because they don't have a weakness

You can easily forget what you were doing or get interrupted by an orc ambush (it can be fun at the start)

When you get killed by an orc they level up, meaning it's even harder to kill them next time, however this can allow you to level them on purpose

At first, I was hesitant, like a hobbit trying to leave the Shire, but once I started, I couldn't stop. It's like finding the One Ring of entertainment – addictive and precious.

The UI felt like trying to decipher Elvish at first, but once I got the hang of it, I was slaying orcs like a pro. Just remember, this ain't ""Shadow of Mordor,"" it's a whole new beast.

If you're a Tolkien fan, consider this game a second breakfast – you won't regret it. Just be prepared for some bugs that make Shelob's lair look like a picnic spot. And watch out for those pesky uruks – they're more hacked than Sauron's social media.

Graphics? Good. Gameplay? Good. Audio? Good, but be careful, you might end up deaf from all the orc screams. And let's not forget the PC requirements – it'll eat up more space than a Balrog in a hobbit hole.

As for difficulty, it's easier than making a hobbit-sized bed. And the grind? Well, let's just say you might need more than one life to finish it.

The story? Like a hobbit tale – good but not exactly epic. But who needs a story when you're building your own orc army?

Overall, it's a game worth playing, even if it means neglecting your responsibilities like a hobbit avoiding second breakfast. I'd give it an 8/10 – just watch out for those pesky bugs and hacked uruks!",1707735258,1707735258,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

The combat is basically just spam left click until it tells you to counter with a right click. Five hours in, and I still can't figure out what the story is actually about. The nemesis system is a cool idea and felt great with the first game, but, with this game, it's wildly annoying. It gives you unskippable, overlong cutscenes that interrupt the already non-engaging combat every three seconds to introduce yet another orc you'll forget five seconds later. Oh, and if that orc has an entourage, all those orcs get to rant and extend the cutscene, too.

The Nemesis System remains the game's crowning achievement, compelling me to return even after completing the main storyline. The endless battles of Act 4: Shadow Wars offer a infinite loop of randomly generated orcs to defeat. Each orc captain, with their unique blend of strengths and weaknesses, presents a fresh challenge that demands strategic consideration, significantly influencing the outcome of every encounter.

[b]Combat (9/10):[/b]
The combat system offers an unparalleled level of satisfying brutality. Execution animations are exquisitely designed, setting a high bar for action games. The variety of combat strategies enriches the gameplay experience; whether it's storming into battle atop a dragon, employing stealth to ambush your foe, poisoning enemy provisions, or unleashing monsters upon orc gatherings, the possibilities feel boundless. My sole critique lies in the health allocation on the brutality difficulty setting. Despite equipping level 80 legendary armor, certain orc captains possess the ability to defeat you with a single blow, but typically as long as you don't get hit then you'll be the one dealing serious damage to your foes.

[b]The Quests (6/10):[/b]
While the quests themselves are well-crafted, featuring engaging cutscenes and gameplay, my grievance lies with the portrayal of non-orc characters. Their selfishness and questionable decision-making have led to a disconnect, making me empathize more with the orcs—my intended adversaries—than with these allies. This irony detracts from the narrative's emotional engagement.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
Overall, the game stands out for its innovative Nemesis System, exhilarating combat mechanics, and a diverse approach to gameplay. While the combat experience is nearly flawless, offering a variety of thrilling ways to engage with the enemy, the difficulty balance on higher settings and the characterization of non-orc characters in the quests could be improved. Despite these minor setbacks, the game delivers a rich and immersive experience that keeps players engaged long after the main storyline concludes. It's a testament to the game's depth and the developers' creativity, making it a must-play for fans of the genre.",1706998867,1707023144,True,21,0,0.732126116752624512,0,True,False,False

Oyunun hikayesi ilk oyundan direkt sonrasında başlıyor. İlk oyundaki amacına ulaşan Talion'u daha büyük bir görev beklemektedir. Artık yenmesi gereken kişi Sauron'dur.  Hikayenin skalası yani en azından konu olarak ilk oyuna göre daha büyük ama sadece konu olarak. Bu konuyu oyunda iyi işlediklerini söyleyemem. Daha doğrusu diğer oyunlarla kıyaslarsak bunu söyleyebiliriz. İlk oyunla kıyaslarsak baya seviye atlamışlar. Hikayenin başı ortası ve sonu var en azından ufak tefek kırıkları olsa da. Bu seri için güzel gelişmeler olabilir ama ortalama bir oyunla kıyaslarsak vasat kalan bir taraf. Başlarda hikaye güzel açıldı. Baktım herhalde saracak bir şeyler yaptılar dedim. Sonra oyunun ikinci kısmı başladı ki bu oyunun yüzde seksenini kaplayan kısım. Oyundan bir anda koptum. Oyun aynı ilk oyun gibi açık dünya da şunu yaptan bunu yapa döndü. Bunun sebebi belirli bir ana hikaye çizgisi olmaması. Oyunda bir sürü ana görev çeşidi var ve istediğiniz zaman istediğnizi yapabiliyorsunuz. Bu da en sonunda ana hikayenin yarım hisettirmesini sağlıyor. Final ise şaşırtıcı. Kesinlikle beklemediğim bir finaldi. Öyle çok muhteşem olduğunu söyleyemem ama beni şaşırttığı için çok kötü de diyemiyorum.

[b] OYNANIŞ [/B]
Oynanış temel hatlarıyla ilk oyunla aynı. Savaşması ve gizli gitmesi hala eğlenceli. Vuruş hissiyatı çok çok daha iyi olmuş. Özellikle yeni bitiriş hareketleriyle çok güzel olmuş gerçekten. Arkham mekaniklerini kullanan dövüş sistemi akıcı ve güzel. Özellikle karakter geliştirmeyle açtığımız yeni yeni özellikler ile çok daha çeşitli ve eğlenceli oluyor. Sadece yakın savaş için değil ok ve gizlilik için de var rpg tarafında değineceğiz. Gizlilik ilk oyunla aynı. Güzel hoş. Öyle yine bir hitman dishonored değil ama zevk veriyor en azından. Canavar sürme seçenekleri arttırılmış. İlk oyundan bildiğimiz Caragorlar dışında ejderha falan gelmiş oyuna. Ki kontrolleri aşırı kötü. Bu kadar kötü hayvan sürme mekanikleri yapılamazdı. Sadece ejderha için değil genel anlamda bütün sürüş mekanikleri için. Parkur mekanikleri ise değişime uğraşmış. İlk oyuna göre çok daha akıcı ama bildiğin Assassin's Creed olmuş bu sefer. AC oyunlarının o insanı kanser eden parkur mekanikleri aynen var. Sağa basarsın sola atlar aniden damdan düşer falan. Akıcı olmakla beraber bu sinir bozucu kontrol saçmalıkları duruyor. Ancak en büyük eksi animasyonların aşırı robotik olması. Akıcılığı doğru düzgün animasyonlarla sağlamak yerine öylesine uğraşıp geçmişler. Normal şartlar altında yapamayacağınız zıplamaları karakter havayken bir anda kendine +20 Speed basmış gibi bir anda atlıyor. Bunu yedirememişler o kadar bariz zorlama olduğu gözüküyor ki baya batıyor. Şahsen daha hantal ama daha iyi gözüken ve hissettiren ilk oyunun parkur mekaniklerini tercih ederim. Kısacası Aksiyon tarafı daha iyi olmuş. Gizlilik aynı. Parkur kötü değil ama ilk oyunu tercih ederim.

[b] AÇIK DÜNYA [/B]
Açık dünya güzel değil. Aynı ilk oyun gibi. Oyunun ilk kısmında oyuna bir şehirde başlıyoruz. Dedim herhalde bu defa boş boş çayırda koşmak yerine daha doğru düzgün, açık dünyaya benzeyen bir açık dünyamız var diyordum. İkinci kısım başladı ve oyun yine çayır çimene döndü. Bu seferki harita çok büyük. Galiba bütün Mordor var. İşte karlı harita var ormanlı var çöl olan var bir sürü harita var. Bu gibi taraflar dışında hissiyat olarak hiçbir farkları yok. Hepsi birbirinin aynısı. Sadece kostüm değiştirmiş hali gibi hissettiriyor. Haritalar bu defa ilk oyuna göre daha dar olmuşlar. Saniye başı düşman görüyorsunuz. Bu sürekli bir top sesi bir savaş bağırma çağırma arkanızdan koşan 600 kişi demek oluyor. Sadece sizin olduğunuz yerde de değil. Uzaklardan da top sesi duyuyorsunuz. Yani bu insanı 40 saat boyunca aşırı yoruyor. Salında azıcık nefes alalım diyor insan. Tipik açık dünya elementleri bu oyunda da var. Çok tekrar ediyorlar. Görevler kısmında detaya gireceğim. Canlı da değil açık dünya. Oyun alanı gibi hissettirmeye devam ediyor. O görevden bu göreve koşup durduğumuz bir oyun havuzu. Genel hatlarıyla ilk oyunla aynı olan kötü bir açık dünya var ancak bir etken var ki çok iyi olan. Yine Nemesis sitemi. Nemesis sistemi ilk oyuna göre daha iyi olmuş. Daha detaylı, daha çok taktik içeren daha doğal bir sistem olmuş. Artık sadece siz gidip şefleri öldürmüyorsunuz. Onlar da size aniden saldırabiliyor, esir alabiliyor ya da size ihanet edebiliyorlar. Çok daha iyi olmuş ve bu beni baya eğlendirdi. 7-8 saat boyunca aralıksız bu nemesis sistemiyle uğraştığım günler oldu. Aslında ilk oyunla hemen hemen aynı şeyleri yazdım. Açık dünya kötü ve nemesis sistemi eğlenceli.

[b] GÖREVLER [/B]
Görevler kötü. Yine. İlk oyuna göre daha iyiler. Yani görevler iyi olduğu için değil verdiği ödüller yüzünden. 200-300 XP almak yerine legendary item alıyorsunuz ondan insanın hepsini yapası geliyor onun dışında vasatlar. Yan görevler dehşet derecede tekrar ediyorlar. İlk oyun kısa olduğu için baymıyordu ama 40 saat boyunca aynı şeyi yapmak o kadar baydı ki bir yerden sonra oyunu bir saat bile oynayamıyordum. Tek iyi yanları ödüllerinin çok daha iyi olması yoksa ilk oyuna aynılar. Ana görevler de aynı. Hiç güzel değiller. Yani arada farklı şeyler yaptıran görevler var ama onlar da öyle muhteşem değiller. Tek iyi olan ana görev içinde doğru düzgün bir boss savaşı barındıran görev. Oyundaki bosslar kötüler. İlk oyunla aynı ama orada çok batmamıştı. Burada baya battı. Doğru düzgün bir tane var. O da öyle çok muhteşem mi değil. Ama çeşitlilik açısından ve en azından bir tane boss savaşı var olması açısından iyi. Görevler yine ilk oyunla aynı derecede. Bir de oyuna bir kale ele geçirme ve savunma görevleri var. Yani ilk duyduğumda o kadar heyecanlandım ki. Kaleler kocamanlar çünkü. O kadar epik saldırma savunma görevleri yapılabilirdi ki... Yapamamışlar. Baya hayal kırıklığı oldu o kale ele geçirme görevleri. Oyunu yapanlar arasında hiç kimse Yüzüklerin Efendisi filmlerini izlememiş olsa gerek.

[b] RPG [/B]
Artık bu tarz oyunlara RPG deniyor. RPG tarafını konuşursak. Yani öyle sıradan bir RPG oyununa göre baya az RPG var aslında oyunda. Sadece karakter geliştirme ve armor setleri, item toplama falan var. Bir de orada burada bir şeylerin seviyesi var. Gelişim güzel ilk oyundan iyi. Itemlarda fena olmamışlar dediğim gibi görevleri yapma isteğini uyandırıyorlar. Ancak onun dışında bir pısırık kalıyor RPG tarafı. Dying Light bile bundan daha çok RPG olabilir.

[b] TEKNİK[/B]
Buglar mevcut. Çoğu grafiksel. Bir keresinde oyunumu kıran bir bug ortaya çıktı bütün bölümü baştan yapmak zorunda kaldım. Optimizasyon fena değil.

[b] SONUÇ[/B]
Oynanışın sağlam ve Nemesis Sistemi'nin oyunu dinamik tutması dışında oyunun hiçbir iyi tarafı yok. Hikaye , açık dünya tasarımı, hissiyatı, içeriği, ana ve yan görevler rezalet ötesi. Biraz da ilk oyunla çok benzemesi durumu var. Yani meh.

The major reasons:

-The game suffers from imprecise controls: this is incredibly important because most important attacks are directly targeted. Sometimes you might be trying to assassinate/dominate an important target and instead sprint 20 feet to drop off an edge or target an orc that is so far to the side they aren't even on your screen. 

-Unfair targeting/autofocus: The game has a lot of autofocus events, like when a captain of any allegiance dies. Enemy captains can target you during this autofocus, and while they can't damage you during the autofocus, they can hit you the exact moment you come out of it. This isn't typically an issue until late/post game, like during the shadow wars. Assassins have the no chance ability and can one-shot you in the late game, leading to incredibly frustrating and unfair deaths.

-Garbage AI in fight pits: This isn't really something that affects the main storyline until the shadow wars or postgame/online, but is frustrating nonetheless. You can pick the best counter to the enemy orc in the fight pits that's 20 levels higher, then be forced to watch helplessly as  he stands there doing literally nothing for a minute and a half until he dies, or he will miss every shot if ranged. It doesn't happen every fight, but it feels like a 50/50 after you've chosen the best possible counter. For a game that emphasizes picking your engagements based on strengths and weaknesses, it's pretty pathetic.

The biggest issue is that the regions in this game feel exactly the same just re-skinned and in shadow of war they are much harder to navigate since the layout of the open world regions are more poorly designed. another major issue is that the open world is mainly populated with orcs and trolls and there is no humans, dwarfs, elves, or even hobbits in the open world. also there is no additional save files even though this was a feature in the first game. also why isn't there a new game plus. I also hate that you can mind control orcs that are a higher level than you even though that was possible in the first game although orcs in the first game.  also the game kind of looks graphically worse than the first game.

The game is very fun & double the size of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, which for me,means double the play-time.
Although the game can be repetitive in some places, it's in no way tedious. You won't help but feel immersed in the story, even if it is a bit slow to start off with. 

The story itself is very long, and completing the main story (plus side quests/fortress defence/relic collection) has taken me 50+ hours. The game can also be absolutely hilarious at points, making me laugh when I least expected it.

Even if your not much of a fan of the Lord of the Rings films or books like me, this game is still very fun to play, but I do recommend playing the original Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor to get more of an understanding of the backstory for this game. 

100% Completionists will find this game to be a challenge, but in no way impossible, just very time consuming.
I do however think that the game lacks replayability, but that's just down to the slight repetitiveness of the game itself and shouldn't be looked at badly for it.

I had some fun with this because I'm weird, and -might- play the DLC's.  But I cannot in good faith recommend it to anyone. [I purchased this on sale for 7 dollars, paying full price is a rip off in my mind.]

So here we go, my time with Lord of the Jank: Shadow of Bloat

Bloated as hell. Not the good kind either, lots of quests are super repetitive and feel like zero thought was put into them. Three quests in a row in the Carnan storyline have you run around spamming E to destroy totems, just one of countless examples.

Worst keybind optimization I've seen in 20 years of gaming, you change one bind and it'll assign 6-7 other things to that keybind. Designed for a controller, mouse/keyboard is a complete afterthought.

Weird sounds, example: Elven rage, sometimes there is just no sound, bunch of weirdo ""swoooooosh"" animations that feel incredibly janky. When Caligrimbor is talking during gameplay it sounds like a whisper, can barely hear it even with my volume up to max then other times it's fine. Like, ???

Often times the game won't even react to the button you press at all.

Mechanics/skills given to you overwhelmingly fast with no time to master any of them. And of that endless list of skills, less than half of them feel actually fleshed out / useful.

Fight pits are a boring joke, you just watch two NPCs smack each other with underwhelming attacks.

Can't skip any dialogue in Orc encounters. [Trust me, after awhile you'll want to.]

Character frequently gets stuck trying to vault over tiny objects, or when you are in a sprint you will sometimes automatically latch onto a random wall.

Targeting executions is almost impossible during group fights, I cannot tell you how many times my character just killed a random NPC instead of the damage sponge I'm actually trying to kill

Difficulty has absolutely zero consistency.

I've seen a lot of praise about the Nemesis system but honestly the game throws so many of these npcs at you, you'll be hard pressed to recognize any of them much less actually like/hate them.

Story is all over the place, I'm no LOTR lore expert but I know a mess when I see it.

After 23 hours I safely assure you that the jank never goes away, it'll stay with you for the entire game.

At least the Balrog fight was fun.

Failure is too punishing. It feels like time spent failing is time wasted.
Success is easily undone and often seems impossible. The army system makes it seem like it's worth fighting captains, commanders, and war chiefs but they just keep coming back.

The gear is boring. There are no damage numbers and everything takes the same amount of work to kill regardless of what I seem to be wearing. 

But the main reason I cannot recommend it is the unskippable orc monologues. You can't get into a flow of combat because every 5 seconds some orc captain or commander somehow pauses the entire battle to give a 20 second speech. The story is pretty bland too. I really wanted to like it but after playing all day I feel like my character is weaker and the things I like doing (collecting things, fighting) are less relevant.",1705716064,1705716064,False,1,0,0.481713354587554932,0,True,False,False

You run into the same traits constantly and combat becomes a mind-numbingly boring affair. It boils down to 3 issues the fact that theres only 2 or three ways to play combat late in the game because of the ""adaptation"" system, horrible enemy targeting and the huge disparity between captain traits. 

Enemies can ""adapt"" to half the attacks in the game while the other half of attacks have no such stopping mechanic. So things like dodging by jumping over an enemy captain or stunning an enemy captain can suddenly become unusable mid-fight. Combine this with the fact that many of the counter-able attacks in the game are listed as the ONLY reliable method to deal with certain enemies (stunning for savages and jumping over them for shield captains) makes me feel like the devs are punishing you for learning and using the mechanics that THEY added to the game. Its frustrating, uninteractive, and should really have been a toggle-able feature because it kills diversity of playstyle.

On the captain disparity front it a matter of fun dialogue based captains often being worthless as opponents. The weakness traits can just completely ruin a captain as an opponent or as a follower. The terrified trait being the biggest one, and on the other side of the game captain fights, which are one of the primary replayability aspects of the game, usually boil down to who has a trait that only a player can trigger (mogwai flies, stealth, fear of higher level). 

The main thing this game has going for it is the incredible pokemon-like system of followers. I cannot emphasize enough what an incredible job the voice actors, art designers, and visual effects team have done for this game. Characters feel interesting and dynamic and the only issues with them (long, unskippable, repetitive monologues) are entirely on the shoulders of the gameplay design and coding team.

As is often the case with newer games from big companies it feels like the game design team is abysmal and makes such arbitrary lazy balance decisions while the art and story team have made an amazing product. Because of this the only way I can justify this game to someone is to buy it during a sale as its a triple A art title but a worse than overwatch balance title.",1703991035,1705372522,False,1,0,0.485074639320373535,0,True,False,False

Many enemies with various strenghts and weaknesess of warchiefs and captains lead you to create some tactical aproach. Stealth in game is amazing and combat system breathtaking. Even when you are surrounded by enemies you can fight through them. Skill tree is pretty good, when you choose/buy skill then you can buy some ""upgrade"", for each skill is 3 possible upgrades and pretty significant one. Armor sets you collect via gameplay, bonuses and change of player appearance from theese are big plus. Gems have basically same atribute from start, you can upgrade them for bigger bonuses but thats all. Where i spend many hours is arena, where you can pick one captain from your army to fight against some enemy captain(probably random generated). Even when you dont control this fight it is very funny watch theese. Conquering fortresses were great experience, amazing big battle that i can say is unique. For each fortress you have to capture few control points, which are guarded by few enemy captains and you cant face a warlord(owner of the fortress) until you dont defeat other enemy captains. I might describe it little confusing but it is really easy and enjoyable.
About story-i cant say a single bad word on it. It was absolutly amazing story line,  Maybe little long but i definetly enjoy it. Didnt play such a great storyline a loong time ago. They did amazing job.
About DLC:
Blade of Galadriel: story related short DLC, skill three is different from base game. It was fun, but base game with Tallion is simply best.
Desolation of Mordor: just bad dlc,story isnt bad but not great either, pain to play sometime. Torwin from 1st game=Shadow of Mordor, amazing hunter and great character is here empty and inventor some gadgets for you. If this dlc wouldnt be in game, it would be better experience for me.

The taunting, humiliation, or cutscenes of defeat or victory are enjoyable at first, but after a while they become somewhat tiresome. It would be ideal if there was either a menu option to permanently disable them (as some other people have suggested) or just a key to skip them -- the most sensible and common option. Unfortunately, neither exists at the moment of writing this review.

Bad: [b]Glitchy and intertwined run/jump/dodge mechanics[/b]. A sad side-effect of assigning multiple vital (normally discrete) actions to the same key (SPACE for keyboard players). I understand that this smooths out -- to a degree -- the learning curve for new or inexperienced players, but at the cost of granular player control and a more sophisticated gameplay.

Bad: [b]Poor targetting while fighting a mob[/b]. While targetting individual orcs for shadow striking or arrow shooting works like a charm and is super accurate, picking individual enemies to dominate or drain from a surrounding mob proves to be very problematic and usually you will end up picking the wrong target.

Good (or bad, depending on your OCD levels): There is a [b]multitude of collectibles[/b] that will excite hoarders and collectors alike.

Good: [b]Socketable gear[/b] and [b]upgradable gems[/b]. Your armor and weapons can be enhanced by inserting different types of gems into them, which drop randomly from enemies. Moreover, you can combine lesser gems into greater forms (Diablo-style).

Good: online vendettas where you take revenge for other players' deaths and gain treasure chests

Very Good: Allies that fight on your side and command them

Very Good: challenges on inventory items to unlock extra properties on them and make them more satisfying because you feed that you earned them rightfully.

Extremely Good: Multiple locations where you can unleash your killing sprees.

Extremely Good: Great variation of enemy traits, ranks, personalities, even clans.

All in all, a good purchase in general and a must-have during steam sales.

Sometimes you cant run up the walls which basically creates a death trap for you even though you can perfectly run up normally.

Enemy scaling is totally imbalanced. Nemesis and below, enemies hit and scale way too slow making it too easy; while gravewalker and brutal gives enemies basically one shots.

The game is trying to emulate the Assassin's Creed formula but it falls flat on a number of features. The main character is clunky as hell. He often gets stuck in the environment and has trouble locking onto an orc captain. I can't tell you how many times I've tried to stealth kill a captain but an orc grunt gets in the way to take the hit. The main character is flat out terrible at combat. The skills needed to fight are slow or take time to charge the might meter to actually use the attack. Often times, the orc captains are immune to many attacks so it's annoying to even fight them head on. The story is lackluster and the management system is interesting, but unrewarding for the time commitment to raise your orc army.

Regions are slightly diversified offering a nice change in landscape but overall its the same orc strongholds repasted into a different biome. The world is much prettier than the first game, it's enjoyable to run around freely in the world and having a nice backdrop no matter where you're at. Even with the expansion of the nemesis system and the world conquering stuff, it didn't lose what made the first game fun, which is the combat and the interactions with orcs and the world. You'll run through the areas you dont have markers at and streamline the quests and interesting parts. It's well balanced, sometimes you will feel overwhelmed against certain strongholds or bosses if you didnt take the time to plan out your assault earlier. You can still solo everything in the game by parkouring away into stealth and cheesing most of the time, but its alot easier to isolate targets in advance and craft a plan of action. Its good fun for a while but like the first game the story is a bit too long. It's worth a buy but the formula gets old after a while and the story is mediocre.

Area design is solid and each one feels distinct, at least visually. Story is serviceable.

[list]
    [*]You'll be screwed over constantly by the parkour system, examples:
		[list]
			[*]Talion will sometimes decide to randomly jump off buildings into groups of enemies, instead of the nearby beam you were aiming at.
			[*]Talion likes standing still in the middle of combat and temporarily ignoring player input every now and then.
			[*]Talion will sometimes keep running back up the wall you dropped down from when you're trying to run away from it, the only way to stop this is to wait for Talion to slowly turn away from the wall then hold space again.
			[*]Talion likes to climb up buildings when you're not even aiming at them, so archers can hit you easier, or so fleeing enemies can get away.
		[/list]
	[*]The combat is pretty broken too at times:
		[list]
			[*]You go to drain an enemy and the game refuses to do anything and they hit you.
			[*]Enraged captains travel 50m in one sword swing somehow and hit you.
			[*]A captain may have an unblockable and instantaneous special attack which is literally impossible to dodge.
			[*]You use Wraith Stun on a Captain and they completely ignore it and hit you.
			[*]You use Shoulder Tackle on a Captain and they completely ignore it and hit you (in this case the game will sometimes even outright ignore your key presses so you cant do the move).
			[*]You blow up a barrel next to a captain and go to ground takedown him, what does the game do? Targets the grunt orc thats like 20m away instead. Applies to executions sometimes too.
			[*]Ranged and melee attacks with zero prompt at all (no I wasnt stunned or poisoned), this is actually the most annoying for me since this issue was never in SoM at all (not that the other issues weren't, but SoM was so mind-numbingly easy I might've never noticed them if they were there).

I'd probably not recommend this game if it wasn't for the fact that both the Middle Earth and LotR series held a special place in my heart, me enjoying the story and the characters, and also for the fact that it gets exponentially more fun when you get the Domination ability (along with other future abilities). 

I'm currently writing this review with an agonising headache after spending the past 15 mins or so as Level 10 Talion using a stealth attack cheese tactic to kill level 60 a Machine orc (who got to that level thanks to his insta-kill axe throwing attack that is almost instantaneous with no dodge prompt) It took like 40 stealth attacks to kill him.

The game-play is so good I can sit here for hours just playing the conqueror mode or going through online vendettas slaying orcs and preying on their weaknesses (or lack of) It's just so good I can't recommend it enough! The only problem is that conqueror mode has kinda gone to shit. When it first came out you could sit there for hours slowly fighting harder and harder enemies, but now, you fight a fortress of level 20s, go up to 40s, then are straight to 60s and 80s meaning that unless you are max level you can't really fight past a certain point (without sacrificing basically your entire squad). Along with the fact that everyone just bought or cheated in the best people with as many immunites as they can and enraged 24/7 with nothing to prey on, kinda ruins the point of the game system.

I know the story wasn't well recieved by some, but I quite liked it. Plus, the storyline that game offers you is only half of the storytelling ability this game provides where the other half is made up from the various uruks you encounter in your travels. 

There is one particularly story that I will remember forever from my experience with this game. For some context, I played Shadow of Mordor before I even had Shadow of War, in that game there was this specific uruk with a shield and spear which had become my nemesis because I had no way to beat them since they countered my specific playstyle in every way and when I tried something new they would eventually adapt. At one point I gave up and left the area, deciding to just let them go thinking I wouldn't have to deal with them again.

Cut to my time with Shadow of War where I was dumbfounded to find, partway through my playthrough, that exact same uruk return in my game to rub it in my face one last time. Recounting how cowardly I was to not finish the job. Once again I was met with a roadblock, except this time I couldn't just go around because I had to defeat this uruk to progress the story. That fight felt like it took literal hours to beat, everytime I would fall this uruk would send me back to my last save with another batch of insults to rub salt into my already sore wounds. But when I did beat him, it was the one of the greatest triumphs I felt in a video game of all time. Absolutely unforgettable.

Highly recommend this game, who knows, perhaps you can discover your own story.",1703558253,1703558253,True,26,2,0.734265506267547607,0,True,False,False

It was very DISAPPOINTING !!!

Your character is reset and made slower then the character in the previous game.
Meanwhile the enemies bosses are made stronger.

 You can get it all back, but you get killed a lot before your character is back on his previous level.
This is more annoying when you know that you already lost and have to wait and listen to what the Orc has to say right before he kills you.
WB is a movie studio, and they will let you know that they are.
I guess it could b a ""fun"" game later on.




WB patented the ""Nemisis system"" in this game.
Because of that other game developers can not use this system without approvement of WB.
Even when making this system they used ideas from other game developers.
This will set back future game development !!!

Namco did this many years ago.
Play a simple mini game while waiting for a game to install.
Besides Ridge Racer I never saw this in any other game
https://youtu.be/GBy01xEaMy8
Thumbs down for that !!!

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

IT'S EVEN WORSE

besides your camera being locked when performing a action.
you cannot see what happens around you at that time.
enemies can attack you and you cannot preven it.

orcs now spawn in game ,,, directly Infront of you !!!

orcs that come between the character and the screen become translucent.
Sometimes invisible.

buildings that come between your character and the screen do NOT become translucent and keep blocking your sight

the parcour climbing wasn't great in the previous game,,, but somehow seems to be even worse here.

Game looks good with decent sound and music. Controls work fine, with a bit of getting used to. Combat is what you can expect from the 'Batman Arkham combat system': it's decent, not stellar.

Main attractor for me was the Lord of the Ring theming and the unique orc bosses you encounter. They have their quirks, lots of unique dialog and visual stuff. There were a couple that really grabbed my attention, while most in the end still were kind of forgettable in the end. But I like how events in the game, at times come back. 
Got defeated by an orc? He gots promoted. Encounter him again, and he'll rub his victory in your face. Defeated an orc? Maybe, like super hero villians they make a surprising return and scars to remeber you by.

The Orc special intro's happen so often they take away from the game and are beyond annoying. Having several appear in one battle can get you killed easily. These average from 5 seconds to nearly a minute in length. I can see why this game did not sell very well and years later the majority did not bother finishing the game. The betrayal system was unique, it then became annoying as captain after captain would betray me. Not due to damage or being bored, or killing a blood brother or demotion, they would sometimes betray me less than 10 minutes after I recruited them. the mechanic just boggles the mind, a totally random waste of time.

People used to say that Shadow of mordor gets repetitive after a while, I agreed with that but even though it got repetitive, SHADOW OF MORDOR NEVER GOT BORING, NEVER, While Shadow of War gets super repetitive and Super boring very fast and there is nothing you can do about it. And you can never run out of worst thing to say about the game because there are tons, I keep coming back to this review to keep adding new stuff again and again, like why don't we get any xp for killing regular orcs now? are they npcs? or are they not part of the game anymore? just fill the world with only captains then, why even bother to put regular orcs in the game if they serve no purpose and if they don't provide any xp then they serve no purpose at all.

**First of all, don't make the mistake I did when choosing your character - only start with Talion, the ranger. The game wasn't intended to be played otherwise.

Shadow of War takes the liberty to rewrite a bit of Silmarillion-ish history, having you actually recruit armies of Orcs and work toward the beginning of the eye of Sauron. If you don't mind the non-canon aspect of the game, I can likely recommend this game to you!

The gameplay is solid, building on the legacy Batman-style combat. Controls are solid. Enemies, though sometimes wordy, are varied quite a bit, including both combat style, strengths, weaknesses, and personality. You can more-or-less customize your character's play style using the likes of poison, fire, frost, etc. Online nemesis missions to avenge others who have died is pretty neat (as well as rewarding). Death in this game IS punishable (and sometimes comes quickly), though you are usually afforded some saving graces, which is also a really intuitive feature in this game. The struggle to live is really done well.

The voice acting is good, the story is (like I said)... original (it's not bad). Besides Celebrimbor's conversation volume being at around 15% normal often times, I experienced very few bugs. When the grind starts to hit you, the game is pretty easy to complete.

While the expansion(s) don't provide much, they are there to finish-out the story. You should enjoy this title!",1703118467,1703118467,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I could write volumes about my experience good and bad but I'll try (keyword, try) to keep it short and concise. Just for the record I did purposefully play on the hardest difficulty across all campaigns as I feel these games are quite easy by default so that could play in part to how bored I got as difficulty in a lot of these games just means more health for foes, less health for you. These games have great upfront presentation and once you get into the flow of combat it honestly feels amazing, the only problem is everything becomes extremely repetitive after that initial exposure, especially in this game where many upgrades force you into picking one or another so you never get a ""true"" variety of arsenal tricks without having to stop and reset your skills every other fight. Also a great deal of these skills are just augmenting the damage types of abilities or are clear no brain choices that are better than others. Because of this picky skill tree you can easily max out your character in the first quarter to half of your playtime because nothing else is appealing, and not worth the grind just for rare flexibility you probably will never use anyway. There are actually not very many segments in this game that make up the bulk of the ""story"" and that which is there usually are incredibly monotonous missions where you attack or defend a fort for the 12th time. The side content (aka majority of the game) is where most of your playtime will be spent if you care to explore. If you beeline the story you could probably finish the main game in the span of 10-15 hours maybe which goes to show just how much bloat there is on the sideline so unless you're dedicated and don't like to drop games halfway through like me, I would understand if you did completely, it is very warranted as there were many times during the many unskippable monologues where I begged for the end to come much sooner than it actually did.

Besides that, I would say the nemesis system, which in theory and practice has such amazing potential for story telling, also cripples itself with the problem of contradictions that should not be there in the first place. It is an honestly astounding thing to witness when it's doing it's thing, but it is completely miserable when you run into what I would like to call ""problematic orcs"". These are orcs that have no clear counter play because they rolled traits that completely remove any of their class weaknesses. My most infamous example would be a defender captain, they have a big shield and a polearm and are generally the most annoying enemy you will fight in this game. They are however generally weak to bows and stunned with your punch that freezes, however especially as the game goes on, captains get more and more abilities and you will run into situations where our example captain has resistance to frost and is arrow proof, and you can NEVER attack them without them being stunned or sometimes you can get behind them and attack a few times where you hope to get them into a stagger loop OR in absolutely dire cases (which happens more than it ever should in this game) you have to resort to running away while pulling the enemy across the map until you find explosives, animals, or various traps as there is no clear way to fight them otherwise. One fight like this took me 20 minutes because I was in the late game and the captain had so much HP it took at least a dozen fire barrels to defeat him (even with a vulnerability to fire, his only weakness). This and the completely demoralizing ""Death Defying"" trait that orcs get leads many combats to a coinflip chance of just being a miserable gameplay experience through and through which is really sad with how much narrative potential and unique experience the nemesis system adds to the game as a whole.

All and all my best summary of this game would be to simply follow what your art desires. I think this game is honestly extremely skippable minus the rare funny or amazing moments that come from the nemesis system when it's actually pulling off what it sets out to do. I also am not a giant Lord of the Rings fan however I do really like the story of Talion (the main character) and how it comes to an end, I just really dislike the bulk majority of the game in between those events sadly. Some closing remarks in regards to the expansions, the 1st dlc with the elf girl is completely skippable and felt like a waste of my time. However I highly enjoyed the last dlc with Baranor that lets you feel like in some extremely esoteric way that you're playing Mount and Blade: Warband for the 900th time even though it is nothing like that whatsoever (not sure what I meant by this). If it wasn't for his campaign I probably would have come off of this experience with a negative not recommended review, so thanks Baranor! 

Final Verdict: Unless you really are a completionist, don't mind lots of inane loot that does next to nothing outside of better stats, love unskippable cutscenes and extremely gimmicky challenges that make you replay them 20 times to get it right, really love Lord of the Rings, or just really, really love the feeling of eternal, unending war that pits you versus endless hordes of foes, than I would say this game is probably not worth your time unless you played it on an easy difficulty simply for the experience.

I wish I had only stuck with story missions so that I'd've had access to more of the features before I started just going after captains.

Stealth is forgiving and incredibly gratifying, the combat is visceral and brutal, and it is very easy to fight large groups of enemies and stay alive if you pay attention to the reaction prompts.

My one complaint is that, while there are additional skins, only the main character will show armor and cloak upgrades, the others only show new swords and daggers.  Also, the main character sometimes shows up in cinemas even if you're using an alternate skin, and even if your alternate skin does show up, the voiceover will be that of the main character.  Minor gripe, though.

If you loved the God of War franchise and something like Ghost Recon: Wildlands or the later Far Cry games, this is perfect for you.  And if you are simply a Lord of the Rings fan, the lore and story will be more than enough to keep you engaged.

Most fights just turn into watching cut scenes and listening to the enemy give speeches so the AI can reset the circumstances of the fight if you are winning.  Great concept as a game overall, but not well done.

Right before you kill your targets a cut scene will play that shows them running away.  These cut scenes always interrupt play and are not integrated into the fight, so it gives you less control and makes the game more rng based as it is constantly resetting the circumstances of the fights.  It's like trying to play a kid at chess that keeps moving the pieces around when he thinks you aren't looking.  If you try to chase them it is likely you will jump all over the walls or try climb any nearby pillars or obstacles as the sprint button is the same as the climb button.  Want to run down the hallway in front of you?  Too bad idiot, you're going to climb to the top of the tower behind you.  Want to climb up onto the ledge you are holding on to?  Sorry idiot, he will either refuse to climb up, hop around side to side, or launch himself down onto the ground.  The player has no control over this.  

Even if you get clear of any obstacles and get running in pursuit, it is also likely that another cut scene will play where you are forced to stop chasing again and watch another orc give a speech.  The constant cut scene breaks in the middle of fighting are followed up with immediately getting hit by any enemies that are around you.  The player has no control over this.  Even if you catch your target and get him down to 1% health and they aren't running, often an infinite block is engaged where you can no longer damage the enemy, until you are worn down by arrows or other orcs, or forced to run away.  Captains you get down to 0 health often suddenly reappear after a cutscene of them not actually dying, with full health in the place where you first found them.  There is no way for the player to control this.  rng.

Back to climbing, you have little control over where he goes but pressing the directional stick generally indicates where he might try to go.  You can have a clear path to stealth kill an enemy in sight, but you will be forced to climb to the top of the nearby obstacle instead, even if the obstacle is facing the opposite direction you are pressing.  Then even when you are trying to climb, he often jumps to a random ledge or rooftop that totally disregards the player's perspective or camera or what you are actually lined up with, or he completely stops climbing and refuses to move anymore, usually if you are getting shot at or making an escape.

The lack of control and constant unskippable cutscenes that give the enemy the advantage anytime the player starts to win ruin this game, and makes victories unsatisfying and deaths frustrating.",1702689663,1702753828,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first game, Shadow of Mordor, introduced us to the main character Talion, giving his backstory and motivation. This game took what the first game gave us and vastly improved it, including the characters. Talion is such a cool character; he's basically a really dark version of Aragorn. The side characters in this game are way more fleshed out in this game than the first. I loved his relationship to Celebrimbor, Ratbag (best character fr), Bruz, Baranor, and Idril. The world building is also fantastic, as the original only had two territories with brief story explanations, whereas this game has six territories with fun and unique stories to each one.

On top of the story being a vast improvement on Shadow of Mordor, the mechanics in Shadow of War are wayyy better. The ability to capture and defend fortresses/territories is brilliant, the traversal/exploration is better in literally every way (drakes, shadow sprint, climbing, etc.), and the combat mechanics are way more fluid, fun, and far less janky.

So yeah, it's Shadow of Mordor, but, like, way better.

Overall, a solid 8.5/10, would definitely recommend.

TL;DR - It's a Lord of the Rings dark fantasy RPG with fantastic traversal, world, and combat mechanics. You'll enjoy the story, the characters (both side and main), and the game as a whole. Give it a shot!",1702000148,1702000148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Middle-earth: Shadow of War stands as a testament to innovation in open-world gaming, notably thanks to its groundbreaking Nemesis system. This mechanic dynamically generates unique enemy characters with their own strengths, weaknesses, and personalities, creating a living ecosystem within the game. The Nemesis system adds a layer of unpredictability and personalization, as orc captains remember and react to your previous encounters, forging an ever-evolving narrative of rivalries and alliances.

One standout aspect is the game’s approach to the narrative, which, while not canon, masterfully weaves its own tale within J.R.R. Tolkien’s universe. The creative decision to focus on an unnamed Nazgûl as the protagonist is a stroke of genius. This choice not only delves into the lore of the Rings but also offers a unique perspective, allowing players to experience the transformation from a Gondorian ranger to a fearsome Ringwraith.

The progression of Talion’s story, interwoven with the intricacies of the Nemesis system, creates a dynamic and personalized experience. Each orc captain vanquished or dominated becomes a chapter in the player’s own saga, adding emotional weight to the conflicts within Mordor. The unpredictability of the system ensures that no two playthroughs are the same, enhancing the game’s replay value.

Graphically, Shadow of War delivers a stunning depiction of Mordor, capturing the grandeur and desolation of the land. The attention to detail in character design, animations, and the iconic locations from Tolkien’s works contributes to an immersive visual experience.

In conclusion, Middle-earth: Shadow of War successfully takes the innovative Nemesis system to new heights, creating an open-world dynamic that feels truly alive. The narrative, while non-canonical, cleverly utilizes the unnamed Nazgûl to provide a fresh perspective on the lore. This game stands as a remarkable testament to both technological innovation and creative storytelling within the vast and treasured universe of J.R.R.

Pros
1. Good/ok graphics with HD textures installed (8Gb video card memory required). Without them everything is wishy-washy
2. Batman-game style fighting

Cons
1. Advice when you start - ignore EVERYTHING, just do main missions. Attacked by a tracker/ambusher - ignore them and run away. Nemesis mission, army general, enemies attack the castle or allies - ignore them and run away. There is no tactics, your actions on the map do not matter. Run around from marker to marker, that's what this game is about. 
2. Killing enemy generals is pointless, they respawn at the same rate as you kill them. Therefore, collecting intel about them is pointless.
3. Enemies are infinite, they respawn after 3-5 minutes. Arrows / mounts are not respawnable, at least nowhere the same rate.
4. Enemies are only orcs. Really? You had such a huge universe, and chose to make only orcs the enemies
5. Controls are so laggy on PC. Cannot correctly target enemies to restore health from, constantly enters stealth instead of attacking downed enemies, killing mount and collecting loot is the same button (why would one ever need to kill a mount?) etc. 
6. Flying on the drake controls are horrible, especially during missions",1701592501,1701609825,False,1,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

Depending on your difficulty getting ambushed by captains can be a little overwhelming but once you get more skills you’ll be wishing you got ambushed more often. While I like this game, it can feel a bit repetitive at times as besides story missions and side quests you do the same thing in each region fighting bosses and recruiting them. I haven’t finished the game yet, but I’ve started to find it slightly dull as the captains aren’t really as interesting as they were in the first act when I died many times and faced captains that would constantly cheat death and that had unique dialogue. Now everything feels the same both dialogue and combat wise, not many unique interactions with enemy captains, and not much that’s really interesting. The overall combat and system of this game is enough to keep me wanting to play it, but I wish there was something more to make the late game fights against captains more interesting instead of it just being a copy and paste of early game just with higher level enemies.

The story, original design/intention of the nemesis system, the slower pace of combat and the world setting was much better designed in the first game. The sequel added more variety into the nemesis system but butchered and watered down everything else in order to push a Pay-To-Win system (Legendary, Epic and common orcs are a thing and a ranked system similar to predatory mobile games). The Middle Earth lore got ignored (Shelob the spider is now an attractive woman), the combat flow is faster (encouraging a reflex heavy gameplay instead of the methodical one from the previous game). These design choices dumbed down what made the Nemesis system great and 1 legendary orc can just overpower your playthrough. Although the lootboxes were removed, the game only patched it by reducing the grind; players can get legendaries easier and enjoy the single player content but the god tier legendaries still break the game balance and disregards the nemesis system.

Only play the sequel if you enjoyed and can fully take advantage of the nemesis system, something you can see in the first game. With it, you can make a randomly generated orc as deep and more complex than a boss fight you will encounter. You can create unique stories never done in a video game before. But all of this requires you to know how to play around the nemesis sytem and it has unique rules that differs from normal gameplay (You need to make enemies, not kill everyone you see. Dying a lot is part of the game and makes it more fun. You should get outnumbered and overwhelmed at times feeling frustrated and swearing revenge on the orcs that made you angry.) If you want an action game, there are better games out there. This game is about making frenemies with randomly generated orcs and once you can play around this gem, you will have a game like no other. WB knows they have a gem but wasted its potential patenting it and watering it down for a greedy microtransaction (that got patched but its remnants can still be felt.)",1701237148,1701237148,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The nemesis system could sell almost any game on its own. The ability to have enemies that are unique to every player adapt and morph across every interaction is one of the most thrilling elements in any game I have ever played and makes every run in with an orc exciting and tense, especially when two high level captains ambush you on what was supposed to be an easy assassination. Taking fortresses is also super fun and leads to high octane bursts of excitement that keep me on the edge of my seat from the first arrow fired. Not to mention as well the soundtrack which is very thematic and elevates the combat tension and atmosphere. 

The only complaints I would have with this game is that the world can feel a bit small, especially alongside other epic open world adventures. Additionally, while there are also a ton of unique traits and titles for orcs, some tend to pop up more commonly than feels appropriate, especially if you plan to primarily ignore the story and run around getting into as many nemesis events as possible.

The balance is often terrible, it has a pointless online integration, a bland and boring equipment system which results in forever trading out one set of numbers for a slightly better set of numbers which also defies the game's established narrative. Talion's (the protagonist) dagger is the broken sword of his murdered son, but this random knife I got off a dead ork is better so I guess that matters more than any kind of sentimental value. The previous game saw Talion inscribing his weapons with his great feats, but again they just suck so random trash off a corpse is what is used instead.

The game constantly breaks from the action with pointless long interactions with ork captains and such. When meeting them in battle either on their sudden spawning or the player's attack, when they flee or enrage or die or do just about anything the game stops so the ork can give you his fucking unskipable dissertation on why he's so cool and how much better he is than Talion. I've had fights with these orks take less time than their monologues do.

Overall just a frustrating broken game that mainly just wastes the player's time. If you want to play a fun game about killing orks and fighting evil though a nemesis system, just play Shadow of Mordor instead. While it still has some of the same issues, the game is much better and much more fun.

There's at least a lot of content to play through, though most of it is repetition.

So, this game kicks off pretty fun, but the excitement wears off quick. Unless you're super into mindless hack-and-slash, it's not a must-play.
The lore or story doesn't feel too tied to LoTR, at least not in my opinion. It's decent, but don't expect a deep connection.

This was the last thing I heard before being embraced by the sweet release of death.

It all started during my journey to capture the fort of Seregost. I was out journeying the snowy plains when all of a sudden, a blunt object had struck the back of my head. Gathering my bearings, I looked upon my assailant, it was an orc—an uruk to be precise. He had been hunting me for a while now, or so as he says. The uruk proclaims that he will move up the ranks once he has claimed my head.

Thinking to myself, ""such is the behavior of an uruk who wants to join the pile of dead uruks around me."" so I engaged in combat with the uruk, who proved to be a tough opponent than I expected. He has a pack of caragors awaiting at his command, he seems to relish in the pain of being burnt by my enchanted blade and, he also has savages who obey his every order. It seems I'm in for a fight.

And so our weapons clashed. With every uruk and caragor I slay, he summons more. Every opening I could find, every uruk and caragor I slay, I grow weary. Then, at the end. I have done it. It was over. His head, decapitated, his troops, fled, and his caragors? Dead.

I thought of it, he would've been a great captain for my army, but alas, his Iron Will made him loyal only to the Dark Lord himself. Regardless, I picked up my sword and my dagger, and immediately fled the scene, hoping to avoid further conflict as I feel my strength fading.

Then a familiar voice had called out...

""MANSWINE!!!""

How? How did this happen? I had clearly decapitated him, it was supposed to be over! Then, I saw his face... Sutures all over the neck, indicating that these uruks might be smarter than I initially thought. He exclaims once more that he will move up the ranks even more once he had known he survived our initial encounter as well as taking my head.

This. Was. Bad.

I was severely injured from our last encounter, was struggling to find any weak uruk I could dominate to regain my strength but, it was all for naught. A single strike from his mace and-

It was over. My body could no longer go on. Laying on the snowy fields, lifeless. Was my quest to stop the Dark Lord all in vain? It ended as It had started. With a death. It feels poetic in a way. A cycle perhaps, from death, to death.

It is a sequel to Shadow of Mordor, and it features an improved nemesis system that lets you forge rivalries and alliances with unique orcs. The combat is fast and fluid, and the game offers a variety of regions to explore and conquer.
However, Shadow of War also has flaws that may affect your enjoyment. The story is weak and inconsistent with the lore, and some of the characters are bland and uninteresting. The game also had microtransactions that allowed you to buy orcs and loot boxes, which was widely criticised by fans and critics alike. Although these were removed in a later update, they still left a wrong impression on many players.
Overall, Shadow of War is a fun game if you enjoy fighting orcs and building your own army, but it may disappoint you if you are looking for a faithful adaptation of Tolkien’s world or a compelling narrative. It is a game that shines in its gameplay, but not in its story. 9/10 for me!!!",1692733008,1700640044,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game, trust me, if you liked Shadow of Mordor, this one is even better, more customization, on skills, items, gems and Siege Upgrades.
The Legendary set bonus are super awesome, it encourages new playstyles, with testing n trying on different setup.
The Combat are Vicious as always, it's the best Hack n Slash game i had, i gotta give them this.

The only sad thing is they somehow remove the ""T"" skill, where what i often do in Shadow of Mordor is to ""Press R"", then look at the sexy slow mo, Blast them orcs, then Press T to Cleanse them. It's very satisfying to do that. Also, the Streak/ Combo means nothing now, back then when you score a crit, it's very helpful, since you can do execution depends on the combo number you had
Well, at least there's the ""Perfect Counter = Execution upgrades""

There are LOTS to do and everything is a LOT of fun to do.
Great game mechanics, mega epic battles leading your armies of dominated orcs, LOTS of weapons and different orcs to dominate and add to your fortress, timed challenges where you can earn loot, LOTS of fun dialog, etc, etc etc..
Two things annoyed me a bit, but far from putting me off: 
- Besides the dialog and acting are excellent, it's REALLY annoying having to listen to a long a** speech form an enemy in a middle of a battle when you just want to kill his a**. No skipping. why?
- The arrows. There are a few ways to recharge your arrows, the simplest and more effective is to pick them up. The map shows where they are (and sometimes there aren't any around) but they can be hiding right under or above you in a dodgy corner or behind a box. When you're in a hurry more than up to investigate, you'd love a skill that shows the arrows through the walls. That'd be nice and would make SO MUCH SENSE>

Picked up this game when it was on sale for 3.99€ after hearing good things about it and seeing some gameplay. It BLEW my expectations out of the water.

[i][b]I want to clarify that i have yet to finish the game, i'd say i'm 30% into the story, i'll update the review if there's anything interesting worth pointing out down the line.[/b][/i] 

[h1]COMBAT:[/h1]
So now,  let's start with the combat, fluid, fair, tough and challenging but not hard! what i liked about Assassin's Creed Unity's combat is how realistic and fair it is even though it felt VERY clunky at times. you're up against 2 enemmies? better be careful to not attack and leave your back open to an attack? you're against 3+ enemmies? you're probably going to get outnumbered and overwhelmed, so it's better to stealth your way to the target location, and either reduce the number  of guards stealthly and fight them at smaller numbers, or assassinate your main target and leave. 

It gave great importance to strategic approach so you can't just do whatever, you actually have to THINK before approaching a fight. Shadow of war adopts the same gameplay concept of AC: Unity and makes it better with the smooth gameplay, the fights against hordes of orcs while 3 captains are trying to mow you with their special moves is very challenging but not impossible! if you play well and utulise your abilities well you can win the fight, but most of the time it's too much with the Cougars (idk how it's spelled its the cat thing) and the orcs with the shields charging at you, the big guys trying to crush you and ESPECIALLY the archers. 

So you either have the option of playing stealth, mix stealth with all out combat, OR just play all out combat which could be difficult but as you acquire skill points you can adapt your build to your playstyle, i'll talk about the Abilities tree later. As for the actual combat, it's fluid smooth, and very fun, attacking, then parrying an attack just to jump over a charging enemy and execute them or use an ability to blow the enemies in the area up is cinematic, absolutely beautiful combat, i can't stress this enough.

Only downside is the fact that the only weapon you can actually fight with hordes of ennemies, is your Sword (i don't consider the Glaive a weapon it's basically an ability, and the bow has limited shots so..), which is unfortunate, i would absolutely love to mow through shit ton of orcs with a mace or an axe, but the game makes up for it with other amazing features.

[h1]ABILITIES:[/h1]
Shadow of War offers versitility in the way you play the game, you can put all your [b]skill points[/b] into the combat category and be an absolute beast in combat, or you can invest in stealth abilities to sneak around orcs and stealthily take them out, i don't know if the ""Necromancer"" build is that viable, but sometimes you are forced to enter combat, so i'd say the best way to enjoy the game is to max out combat and stealth categories then branch out slowly to the other abilities in the subcategories and choose the ones that look fun to play with, don't force yourself into playing a specific build.

As for the gameplay, the abilities are so fun play with, from upgrading the elven smash the ground thing to produce fire on the explosion to the chain stealth kills, the abilities are so well made and there's always something new to play with so you don't get bored with the same attacks/abilities from the start of the game. 

[b]The might bar:[/b] is very interesting, rewarding, and at the same time punishing, if you get hit you lose the might bar and you'll have a hard time charging it up and winning the fight, but if you pull it off the abilities do alot, and it gives you alot of options, you can either use an execution on a captain to try and kill him quickly, or use the elven smash the ground thing to clear out orcs and 1v1 the captain, or drain an enemy, heal and have him fight with you, the options are many and it's so hard to get bored when there is so much versitility and actual strategic planning in fights. 

As for [b]Elven Rage[/b] there is not much to say, once you stack it, it's so satisfying and fun to use, makes you feels so powerful, without being TOO broken.

[h1]ORCS:[/h1]
In Shadow of War, there are the normal orcs, orcs with a specific class (shield orc, archer exct), then there's [b]Captain orcs[/b], which are Orcs with a class on steroids with unique names, looks, abilites, and weaknesses.

Once an Enemy captain is broken, you can either [b]Dominate[/b] him or kill him, if you kill him, he drops loot depending on his class, level, and nemesis points, if you dominate the captain, you can either [b]Recruit him[/b], or [b]Shame him[/b], shaming him will decrease his level which will allow you to recruit him in the future if he's too high level, it also makes him weaker.

Other orcs that are not that important are [b]The treasure orcs[/b], they drop the ingame currency to buy army and gear upgrades, then there are the [b]Slave orcs[/b], which from my experience they don't do anything except for pissing their pants and running away when they spot you.

There is also another type of Orcs, [b]Worms[/b] which are Orcs with information on captains, once dominated, you can extract information on a certain captain to know his weaknesses and what his powers are, which makes them easier to fight as you know how to approach the fight.

What i find fascinating about captain orcs is how everyone of them is unique, be it their looks, voice, name, abilities, or personality, listening to the captains talk to you in a stand off when you engage them is always amusing cause everyone has something unique to say, and once recruited you can hear more voice lines from them.

And i haven't even TALKED about how an orc will remember you and make comments about it if they survive the fight with you or if they kill you and you come back, there's also the fact that These captains can ambush you at random times, be it at the start of a fight, when you're sneaking around, or when fighting other captains! I'll talk more about the Captain Behaviors in the Nemesis System section.

So much effort went into making the game not repetetive and making it feel like it's a dynamic non scripted experience which i greatly appreciate, not alot of games put so much emphasis on small details like this nowadays.

[h1]NEMESIS SYSTEM:[/h1]
In this game, Orc captains in different regions have different rankings, i'll list them in order there's the [b]Grunts[/b], the generic orcs, [b]Captains[/b], which can be found in their camps or fortresses, [b]Warchiefs[/b], they have to be baited out by killing a captain that is associated with the warchief, then you unlock a quest which gives you an objective to do to bait out the warchief, these missions take place in the fortress of the region, then theres the [b]Overlord's[/b], the highest ranking Orc that rules the region, he can be fought once you attack and raid the fortress after building your army.

There's also the fact that Captain orcs will be fighting/raiding/ambushing/assassinating eachother as a background event, the cool thing is you can join the fight and ambush them yourself. You can also send one of YOUR Captain orcs to kill an enemy orc and you can assist them in their task.

This system is so fun and allows for a more engaging experience by making the story as you go, Middle-earth is known for executing this system better than anyone else

[h1]QUESTS:[/h1]
You have the main story which mainly revolves around saving Gondor, then there's the sidequests which include random sidequests, return to the past quests, collectables quests, and Orc Captain quests.

Most of the quests are interesting but frankly i enjoyed the Orc Captain quests the most, but the other sidequests are okay, as for the story i don't want to rush it so i can't say much about it, but for now i've been enjoying it.",1700285804,1700289034,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Both agreed that the cost of henry viii's tyranny was most easily felt by the destruction of all Monestaries: man robbed of God, the poor robbed of help,  children robbed of learning, libraries burned to prevent Catholic History from being known, and all tales of Chivalry destroyed to prevent people from having Hope against the regime.  Both agreed a new fantasy would have to be created for young and old, to fill the void of wonder left by the absence of long-lost tales that protestants and freemasons burned for 500 years.  Both realized england was going to die any minute, and that a Truly Good series to inspire wonder (all while injecting Catholic Capital into civilization like hiding medicine from dogs with cheese) and give england at least 50 more years of life.

To this end, CS Lewis decided to make the ""Narnia"" series for children and the ""Space Trilogy"" for adults. 
 Tolkien, annoyed that his friend was being too obvious with his references, decided to make the ""The Lord Of The Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" series which basically give a scene-for-scene retelling of The Book Of Revelation hidden behind the terms and aesthetics of ""Beowulf"" and wagner's ""niebelung"" and ""twilight of the gods.""

With this in mind, ""middle earth: shadow of war"" is not a ""Lord Of The Rings"" game: it's your typical ""light vs dark"" gnostic claptrap with the same smattering of ""necromancy keeps 'the balanceᵀᴹ'"" that blizzard's ""diablo"" series has.  Vague uses of LOTR sounding names are used, but that's where the similarities end; you could make this a tie-in to every single media property in a high fantasy world over the past 30 years by just moving around some terms.  I honestly half-expected nazghul to name-drop arthas and the lich king from world of warcraft because this game's story takes its cues from blizzard more than it ever does Tolkien.

So if you are a hardcore LOTR fan or Christian, look elsewhere if you want a faithful adaptation of LOTR.  If you like Good stories and don't care about LOTR (shame on you), that's not here either.  This game's narrative starts nowhere and ends nowhere, simultaneously takes too long to tell you what it wants to say and speeds through it to the point it is always having to cut its thoughts short.  Characters reference motives that that were never shown, conflicts that did not occur until the very end, and reference scenes that either were never written or cut from the game.  Every inch of the game feels like a tutorial section for a bigger game that was not made.  I am not entirely sure anyone at monolith software is aware of the nature of any of the characters they name mention in the game, with the most egregious being the fact that they present sauron as just being an elf and present Galadriel as some kind of angry political leader instead of a reference to The Blessed Virgin Mary.

So the story is bad, even by game standards it's bad, even by student book reports would this story be bad.  The story wouldn't matter if you were not forced to do it to unlock basic abilities needed to enjoy the orc politics minigame.

So what about the gameplay?  There isn't much of it.  Talion (the player character) is constantly locked into cinematic sequences.  Every weapon hit, every jump, every animation is just a mini cutscene.  enemies constantly invalidate core parts of your kit.  enemies hit you from offscreen all day.  every difficulty but easy has you dying in seconds just to show off the game's inch-deep ""nemesis"" gimmick.

Want to do any of talions tricks?  Prepare to have every orc on screen zoom to your side and attack you.  Every action that might give even the slightest bit of enjoyment is immediately punished with a ""counter this enemy"" quicktime event.  The game does every single thing it can to have you rhythmically mash the attack button while hitting the counter button, and any attempt to be creative will have an enemy teleport to you so they can interrupt what you are doing.

This game might be a novelty if it could just get out of its own way.  If it had a lock on button with a combat system closer to the legend of zelda, it would be great just for the silliness of dismembering orcs.  Instead you must play the game as the developers want, when they want it, and you just feel DRAINED having wasted your time playing it.

Ironically, the final dlc added a ""roguelike"" mode that fixes a lot of the games problems by just removing most of the story and letting you run around a desert killing orcs with gadgets.  Still just a boring, ""cinematic"" mess though.",1700078306,1700078306,False,1,1,0.447274357080459595,9,True,False,False

Its a good game, but honestly, i hope it is the last of its kind.

That said, the nemesis system breaks immersion significantly when difficulty ramps up, as the game tends to do this by throwing more and more captains at you simultaneously; with more and more bodyguard captains as well. You get locked into captain intro and captain death cutscenes for about half the duration of combat. This obviously gets extremely obnoxious, while during the early game it's nice to get such custom attention to a captain you face one-to-one.

Also, the gearing system: I wish the entire game was gearing like the Baranor DLC Desolation of Mordor; it is so much better than the base game gearing system, by miles.

Embark on a thrilling odyssey through the lands of Middle-earth with the ""Middle-earth"" series, an action RPG that beckons gamers into a world of power, intrigue, and warfare.

The immersive experience begins with an enchanting blend of thrill and engagement, offering an adrenaline-fueled escapade. Despite the series' age, its graphics stand the test of time, enveloping players in a visual spectacle that complements the rich narrative.

""Middle-earth"" doesn't just promise fast-paced action; it delivers it in spades. Perfect for those who seek short bursts of gaming pleasure, it's a title that fits snugly into the interstices of a busy day. Imagine having 30 minutes to spare before catching a train—this series is the perfect companion for those moments.

At its core lies an intriguing storyline, a narrative tapestry that keeps players invested, drawing them deeper into the mythical world of Middle-earth. However, the journey through these lands is not without its challenges.

The series' crowning glory is the Nemesis system, a stroke of genius that sets it apart. This innovative system allows NPCs to dynamically adapt, learn, and evolve based on player interactions, resulting in memorable and personal adversaries. It’s a testament to the potential for unparalleled storytelling and character development in gaming.

However, it's unfortunate that this groundbreaking system is exclusive to the ""Middle-earth"" series due to copyright limitations. The missed opportunity for its integration into other games is a loss for the gaming community. It’s a reminder of how legal and financial complexities can hinder innovation that could revolutionize player-NPC interactions and storytelling in games.

Additionally, control system issues and AI frustrations slightly mar the experience, detracting from an otherwise captivating journey through Middle-earth.

Rating: 8/10

""A legendary journey through Middle-earth, marred by minor control issues and AI frustrations, but ultimately a thrilling experience for fans of this iconic universe.

Even though the loot boxes have been ripped out, the underlying punishing systems that entice the player to buy the now nonexistant loot boxes has not been rebalanced. If I were to rebalance this I would rip out the shaming system to change the pacing of the game progression predominantly; unfortunately there is no mod for that and most mods for the game have been lost to time or taken down. I also think that the leveling and grinding for weapons, armor, ring slots and all of your allies, especially on Easy mode (which I played on), was way too much. For those masochists that play games on higher difficulties I would think twice playing at a harder difficulty. Overall the gameplay up until you start building the army was great, but once you start having to interact with the borderline unfair game progression even on easy mode, which is not supposed to be this freakin' hard, makes me want to stop playing and never come back.

so here's the thing: what if assassin's creed but lord of the rings? It's a solid concept, it's a fair successor to the first game. You can parokour your little gondorian heart out, you can dominate greenskins like nobody's business, you can ride the shit out of wargs and trolls and dragons, you can upgrade your weapons, you can fast travel, you can stealth, you can freeze time and shoot a million arrows at everybody, you can be BFFs OR moral enemies with the weirdest uruks you can imagine...

... but somwhere between level 30 and 40, the game loses all novelty. You've seen all the game has to offer, but the game somehow still isn't over, and won't be over for hours yet. Oh, do you need to do *another* quest, that requires you to ""go to place, kill these guys under these conditions, fight these captains"" again? Do we have to dominate drakes this time? Do we have to kill THREE captains at once? Are there Nazghul in the mix this time? Done, done, and done. It's all been done before, and if you're like me, you're going to inevitably reach the point where you just don't care about any of it.

Skip the cutscene. Run to the place. Do the thing. Kill the guy. Do some inventory maitenence. Oh, you leveled up? Who gives a shit, you already have all the abilities, and all the ability mods, and XP basically means nothing now. What, you want to hunt down another orc captain? You want to raid another fortress? You want to do another ringwraith battle? Boring.

The game should have been half as long.

BUT.

For the first half of the game, you *will* be thoroughly enjoying yourself - and honestly, I think it's worth it for that alone. Just don't expect that joy to carry you all the way to the end, it certainly fell fair short for me.",1699427787,1699427787,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 2 DLCs of different characters makes the game a lot harder - this can either be good or bad depending on how ""easy"" you found the original game you will notice a lot of your followers will have buffs that make the fights bearable - my only tip I can give you if you are going to play the DLC is remember you don't ""have"" to fight every battle: your friendlies can fight as well.

Don't get too attached to your orcs as well: you are most likely going to kill one or two.

Shadow of War improves on Shadow of Mordor in a lot of ways: if they ever made a sequel: they should include some of the main characters and include a create your own character... if there was anything I could suggest: make it less like assassin's creed and more like Batman Arkham Knight.

Doubt it'll ever get made but here's hoping.

If I were to give it some criticism: the challenges are still a bit pointlessly done - you don't require the upgrades though most of the time it would have been nice to be given them rather than make us work for them as we have had to already march the Orcs up and down each fortress like it's some fairy tale kingdom.

For a lot of people wondering if they'll get to see a true ending: keep in mind that each DLC will give you different what if scenarios. So keep that in mind when you're playing these and don't worry about the spoilers (unless you play the elf's storyline in which case you will have some of the story spoilt for you - unfortunately)

One of these DLCs involve a more Batman-esk feel and makes you a lot more vulnerable (if you die you have to do the entire run again, yikes: story missions I was unsure of as I actually did become more like a commander in this one and just watched the AI do the work for me when I had the confidence they were probably as strong, if not stronger than me. Not saying you should - but It's strongly suggested to in this DLC specifically if you want to enjoy the start to end, which let's be frank is hard to do and honestly the ending is nothing much to write home about but you will probably feel like you just beat a very hard Dark Souls game because of the difficulty.

There are way more monsters in this version, though some of the Orcs are still missing I really wished they worked more on establishing factions of other civilisations beyond the black gate: maybe there's an Orc faction that is comprised of just minstels? maybe there's a faction of humans that are so bloodthirsty they've been accepted as Orcs? I don't know... it feels very much like the game could have those moments where it can branch out from just being strictly  Orcs I feel if they ever did make another game: they have those options to be more experimental with the content.

A lot of people will get annoyed that some of this cannot be cannon: and for that I can say - you are right, that shouldn't be cannon because the game is trying to be it's own thing while maintaining a connection to the original content. It would actually be better if it did branch off though in this case, as we know the Orcs themselves are not all serious when it comes to war.

The game needs to be able to step away from the Tolkein books if it is ever going to be able to make it's own mark but I do think there's a limitation here and that's causing the story to feel stiff and that's what I hope they would fix in the next game if they ever did.

I also wish to add that I did suffer a bit from burnout from playing the game as long as I did, this is one of those where you'll likely want to rush the content and sadly the game takes that away from you with the forts. There's a lot of random chance that can either be forgiving or really unfair I do think the difficulty is justified but for a lot of us: not many of us will be finishing this game sadly due to it's length and difficulty spikes.",1699183262,1699405174,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

From the very first step into Mordor, I was captivated by the sheer magnitude of the game world. The landscapes are breathtaking, from the towering fortresses to the serene Elven woods. It's a visual masterpiece that resonates with Tolkien's vision.

But it's not just eye candy. The story is an emotional rollercoaster, where you forge your own path as Talion, a Ranger seeking vengeance. The relationships you build with your Orc followers are surprisingly moving. It's not often that a game can make you feel empathy for creatures typically considered villains.

The Nemesis System is the game's crown jewel. The way your interactions with Orcs shape the game world and your own story is a work of genius. Every encounter is personal and emotional.

The combat, oh, the combat! It's visceral and satisfying, making you feel like a true ranger as you execute precision strikes and unleash supernatural powers.

""Middle-earth: Shadow of War"" is more than a game; it's a journey of emotions. It's a must-play for fans of Tolkien's world and action RPG lovers alike.

This game isn’t an open-world action game, it’s more like an open-region, you have 5 large regions to explore, every region is constructed like a massive stronghold or military base. Enemies are everywhere, there isn’t an area that you can chill out. If you expect an open-world, no, you look at the wrong game.
The main story missions are actually pretty weak, most missions are short and uninspiring. But it doesn’t matter, the selling point isn’t about the story mission, but taking control of orcs and building an army, and It’s really fun. 

You are basically a super human, the gameplay satisfies my power fantasy, it feels so good. It reminded me of Protagonists of Prototype, you are so powerful, you are like a god. Not many games make me feel like this.

There's orcs absolutely everywhere, but a whole lotta nothing else.

I was ambushed by one, killed him, ambushed by another, killed him, and then a third one came around the corner and I killed him too. No sense of difficulty or challenge, even if you're in a horde of enemies, just spam left click and right click when the icon comes up.

This time around I actually finished the main story and started working on the expansions. It's cool trying to figure out how to outdo the various enemies and exploit their weaknesses. Unfortunately that's also related to one grievance with the game. Some enemies have their traits setup in such a way that they cannot be easily beaten in a setting or some story missions. By that I mean that they only have maybe one weakness while being resistant to everything else and the means to use that weakness are not present where you have to fight them.,1698963099,1698963099,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I completed Shadow of Mordor only hours ago. This games combat feels so floaty compared to it.  Attacks have no weight. In mordor I could almost feel my sword going through an enemy.  More negatives include

-Having to relearn most of the skills you grinded for in the first game
-Boring characters
-repetitive in a non fun way. ( I play mmos like bdo btw)
- Enemies spawn right in front of you
-Low resolution cutscenes (2017 game) looks blurry on my 4k display.  This is not acceptable.  Andromeda, Breath of the wild, Batman, Tomb Raider 2013, Assassins creed origins, and many more game studios ""future proofed.""

Simply a dynamic and fluid world, story and gameplay beautifully tailored to give you endless experiences and challenges. 

Dominating Orcs and pitting them against one another and eventually building your own dominion of orcs is a game within a game also. Build diversity has been improved as well as the overall combat mechanics from the first game. More diverse enemy types and just a whole bunch of great online game modes to interact with other peoples creation of a twisted orc army.

Even just trying to fight useless grunts you can be interrupted by a random captain walking by. Simply trying to climb on a mount? Let's hear from Urgrak the Ruthless first on how you tried killing him and his blood brother last week. 

It's enjoyable the first 5 times but when you cannot skip introductions and have to sit through what feels like 10-15 seconds worth of blah blah to kill them faster than their monologue. It's the feeling you get when you're watching a movie and the bad guy gets away with his 5 minute monologue and is getting away with his plan when the protagonist could just shoot them.

Gear. Why are you giving me useless gear? 10% chance to poison an enemy after you head shot them. 25% more stealth damage after a stealth kill.

The game is fun for the most part. Story is a little lacking in the sense that it is it's own story disconnected from the books it was inspired by. The game is challenging for new beginners, and I recommend two play throughs to really get the full experience. 

First to just rush through the story, do all the side activities if you want, and learn how to play. If you do that -which most people do- then you will be under leveled with pretty meh orcs, but a lot of stories of fun encounters. No two orcs are the same, and as long as you actually have a difficult time in combat, you can have a load of fun with their nemesis system, which I really wish more games would do, or have. The fort capturing is fun at first, and can easily get you lost. 

Second play through do all side activities while doing story, do not finish the story without the actual side stuff done, it causes bugs in my experience.

Because with this outright horrendous control scheme and his, frankly, worrying fascination with gripping his little fingies on everything, ever, as stupidly as possible...it's all you can do in the game!
Props to the dev team for creating the worst controlling game I've seen in my life.  At least Superman does what you tell him in Superman 64.  Whomp-whooooooomp.

To clarify, the game itself?  Pretty good, especially with all the micro garbage yanked out.  The controls and the combat design, however, absolutely drag this down to 6/10 or lower territory purely on their own failures.  And even without the micros in the game...the toll they took on design is painfully easy to see.  WHY can I auto attack my allies?  Why does Talion insist on doing so at absolutely insane opportunities?  When I have 2 enemy captains and 4 enemy soldiers nearby, yes, I want to go right ahead and attack my own allied captain.  Holy shit the stupidity.  And this is just one painful combat design flaw of many.  If you've never played, don't bother, the controls and design pull the game down way too hard to genuinely recommend.  If you did before and want to come back like I did...expect pain.  Lots and lots of pain, from horrid controls and worse combat design choices.

All of the combat abilities from Shadow of Mordor are locked behind higher level skill trees, you only get mobility skills in the early game so your best option is literally to run away, all the captains start with very annoying traits and can instantly adapt to every kind of attack you can do, the enemies all instantaneously attack which is realistic but offers you very few counter options gameplay-wise, there are bugs including: high-low contrast coming out of wraith vision, getting stuck on tightropes, orcs ignoring environmental hazards and seemingly becoming invulnerable to them. 

The lack of invincibility frames when doing executions and the quickness of random orcs donkey-punching you makes combat extremely frustrating regardless of style. Melee is plagued with steroid-crazed zerkers who have a shopping list of traits which overcomes any natural weakness they have, ranged attacks can be spotted fifty miles away regardless of cover and also suffers from a lack of arrows as well as a focus meter which cannot be upgraded anymore (what were they thinking?), and stealth is arguably worse than useless because captains who are not immediately killed take very little damage so you've effectively traded a superior position for 5% damage. 

I uninstalled the game around Act 2 because the constant grind and poor gameplay choices made for a constant slew of ""HOW DID THAT HAPPEN"" or ""WHAT WAS THAT"" or just straight up swearing constantly. 

I've never seen a studio be so categorically anti-player to the point that they give the NPCs every advantage and lock out player options for a brazen disadvantage. The game never gets better despite my copium, and it doesn't hold a candle to the first game at all.

If you bought this game, refund it and play Shadow of Mordor instead.

The idea of revenge for other players is great, but would love it if friends would get prioritized in this features, so I can see this mission for them prior to other random players.

Second to that, the pit fights, there I would love if it could get changed or would add a mode, where you can maybe challenge a friend, send them like an invite for that and if they accept, both players will see the fight live and whichever side loses, loses his fighter for real. Not like in the mode where you can just random challenge the orcs of randoms and only if you lose, you lose your fighter forever (or not, if he is able to return maybe), but in this live challenge mode where both accept, both can potentially lose their orcs.

I never played the first game, Shadow of Mordor, but I didn’t really feel like I had to. The combat is smooth and intuitive with a surprisingly high skill ceiling. I was always learning something new or discovering unique interactions with my abilities and the environment. There’s also loads of different gear-sets all with unique bonuses to change up your build/playstyle dramatically. The gear-set impact on gameplay is really important because the gameplay loop is the same throughout the entire game: find orcs, kill orcs, recruit orcs, take fort, repeat in next zone with higher level orcs.

I think the main reason it never feels like a drag is because the combat is fantastic. I’ve heard great things about the Nemesis system, but in 40 hours of gameplay I have yet to experience it at it’s full potential. I played this game on the “Nemesis” difficulty, so I thought I would get a lot of interaction with Orcs who I’d previously encountered; unfortunately, that’s not the case. Still to this day I do not have one of the most common achievements in the game: Nemesis – encounter the same Orc 3 times. I think to be able to experience the Nemesis system fully in Shadow or War, you must intentionally lose over and over… that’s sort of unnatural for a video game and doesn’t feel super great imo.

Regardless this game looks and feels great for a 6-year-old title and is a fantastic combat sandbox. There’s lots of collectibles and stuff to do around the zones, I think I’m on track to 100% complete the game in about 60 hours and for $5 for the base game + all the DLC… it’s 100% worth it.",1697759395,1697759395,True,1,2,0.388281702995300293,0,True,False,False

I played this game the first time some 5 years back, and before I could beat the main story, I reached a point of frustration that it occurred to me that I simply wasn’t having fun with it.

Fast forward to now, where I was replaying games in my archives, remembering I disliked the game, but wanted to give it another chance to at least finish it.


Was perhaps 10 hours in before I fully remembered its flaws.

The story is fine for what it is.


There are characters that are memorable.


The voice acting and dialogue is truly great at times; though when you are in the middle of an intense fight, the interruptions for an Orc to introduce itself to you or invoke “I’m not dead yet” speech can be extra salt on the wound. 

The scenery and world you run around in is wonderful.  Though similar to an Assassin Creed game, when running around, it can become a battle over controlling your character when you want to drop down or climb up. The game is mostly on auto pilot and it becomes a bit clunky trying to take control back. 


—
The real bane of this game, as to why I personally know it's not for everyone, is its gameplay.
—



The game gives you abilities as you level up and spend points.  At first it feels empowering, as it gives you an assortment of tactics to keep the combat fresh.

Then it decides to take those away from you.  As the game continues to slap on immunities to the foes you face. Ultimately, it limits you to only damage them with 1 or 2 tactics.

It can make the later fights rather dull or agitating, just fumbling around to get damage in on some generic orc because their kit counters most attacks.   

Couple this with the fact that whenever multiple enemies are in one area, it quickly becomes a nightmare trying to maneuver around when that's not really the game's strong point.  You’ll notice in the middle of chaos that the game is quite ridged in controls and punishes you when you attempt to move around or flee in the heart of battle. 

Perhaps a counter point is this means you should be careful not to engage multiple enemies and to plan ahead and try to isolate the foe.

Yet going back to my previous point, when all you can do is 1 or 2 attacks to damage a foe, the combat in 1v1 is plain and loses appeal when many of your attacks simply don’t work.


Note that this is all accurate to EASY difficulty.  If you are a masochist, and try normal or higher, the enemies adapt to your attacks; I.E if you vault/leap over them too many times, they become immune to it and push you back.  So now those 1-2 attacks that work, get countered if you spam it too much on them.

Frankly, while elements to this game are fine to good outside of the gameplay; I can’t fathom why so many would hold this game fondly.   To each their own, but I caution anyone who is weary of my points on combat. Please hesitate to buy a game that may lead you to stress.  Games are to relax outside of work/school…not endure more headaches.

A lot of awful issues with graphics. I had to google search solutions to fix the blurry issues and the game still crashes. I'm not sure what the deal is. I don't know if the devs abandoned ship with updates for this game or not. But it could use some serious patching. It will be helpful to a lot of people especially if they play on releasing games in the future. Solving issues now can prevent other issues in the future.

Otherwise... This game is really well done and fun to play. I wish there was an auto camera adjust setting or something too though. Like I said.. This game plays differently than the first game. Like a different engine or something with bugs and issues. The first game. Shadow of Mordor ran just fine for me.",1697264221,1697264221,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor is a LOTR Assassins Creed simulacrum with no specific world identity or purpose than to pander to LOTR fans. 

The movement is clunky at best. I never know which way my character will leap after landing on a roof line or wall. This makes traversal a luck based process more than a skill based effort. This is such a shame as the verticality in combination with the level complexity would have made for some interesting pathing options. Instead, I am left with running around on the floor and climbing tall spires as the only certain options and hoping anything other climbs or jumps work the same way they did five minutes ago. 

Exploration is unrewarding because the map is prepopulated in the same way as other modern RPG trash heaps. Fill it up with generic samey items that give a little dopamine boost when interacted with and hope that is enough to keep the players coming back. Exploration should be about discovery and joy in finding new an unique items or areas. This game and many of its contemporaries make the fatal flaw of thinking exploration is deterministic. They believe for the player to want to explore they first must know what they will get out of it. In reality, knowing where you are going is not better than finding where the path leads. 

Finally, the story. What to say, its convoluted and difficult to parse. No I have not completed the game, but I do not care to know if the story eventually becomes more cohesive with clearer stakes.

The movement is godawful, pressing the button for jumping, even when prompted, will more often than not throw you in the complete opposite direction. Hitboxes for corners extend for yards past where they visually end, impeding your attempt to run past anything. Climbing is a matter of whether the game is in the mood to let you move, or would rather freeze you in place for half a minute and then yeet you in the direction of the orcs you're attempting to sneak up on or escape from. There are countless variants of a few very basic attacks, but only a handful of those will ever respond to you pressing the buttons and even less will ever actually be useful, meaning most of the time the rest of the controller and context sensitive commands are just a crowd of liabilities. Prompts are inconsistent in showing up and even less thorough about giving you accurate information.

May the Nemesis system be forever forgotten.

The major complaint I have about this game is the pacing. Before and after the obligated and removed grind for in-game purchases. I had to stop playing for years until this company could not milk the market no more so it could go back to ""normal"" game play.

Also, the story starts poorly removing everything you earned from the previous game.
Baldurs Gate, an even older game for the 90s managed to keep up with the story and not downgrading the main character, but I get it, you wanted more ""padding"" to extend the game and use the same copy/paste mechanics. Lame.

And the story also ends poorly, unsatisfying. Well a hard task to pull off, but it was going to be hard once the development team accepted to do it, so they failed.

Combat, I kind of feel they wanted to make a Batman kind of fighting game? It just doesn't feel right. By the end of the game, having everything unlocked the enemy ""adapts"" so they are pretty much invulnerable and boring. What the hell does the ring even do if you can't have true power?

I wish there was an option to reduce/eliminate enemy captain introductions which sometimes drags on too long which takes away from the fun.  This is fun at first, but if you're in a battle, you wind up sitting in curscenes listening to orc trash talk for several minutes if there are several accomplices around....

Recommendation for New Players:
I would highly recommend leveling up as much as possible and hoarding as many dominated captains (normal/epic/legendary) as you can prior to completing the final primary mission for the game.  Once you finish the last mission, all orc captains that you encounter will either have a lethal weakness (die if they encounter a specific enemy/ailment/circumstance or run in fear when they encounter it) or will have an ""Iron Will"" train preventing domination to add them to your army.  For ""Iron Will"" orc captains, you can choose to ""Shame"" them to remove the trait and reduce their level, but as the result, the majority will gain one or more unfavorable weakness traits which will make them weak/terrible additions to your overall orc army--orc captains within your control.",1696557304,1696557304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a huge Tolkien fan, read literally every published book, but still couldn't tolerate the constant pauses and interruptions while trying to play the game.

Edit: Funny how people started to harass me because I didn't recommend their favorite game or whatever. I don't care what you think of me, but I find it amusing that a community resorts to cyberbullying for one critic of a factual game mechanic. Must be a really supportive and wholesome community.

I only care about informing potential buyers of an aspect of the game that barely anyone spoke about on reviews I watched beforehand, and that surely would have stopped me from buying a game that I now regret having wasted money on, since it's literally unplayable for me. I am always stuck on unskippable cutscenes that happen ALL the time an captain orc appears, which is extremely often.

Now, I am sure I am not the only person in an 8 billion people world that thinks like that, as I have seen some other complains online while trying to search for solutions (there are none). So, I am just making my part in trying to give people all the information about actual game mechanics, so they can choose for themselves if they want to buy or not. If repetitive, non-story related unskippable cutscenes that take up a lot of gameplay time don't bother you, than be my guest, I am sure it is a great game otherwise.

The gameplay is an enhanced version of the original Shadow of Mordor which was already fun in it's own right. The Nemesis system is further built on to simulate a much more organic, delightfully random but overall consistent experience with your orc captains. Everything still gravitates towards taking over a fort, but they put in enough inbetween that it doesn't feel like decoration to the same gameplay, and rather enhancements to what worked. The additional moves added to combat and traversal really keep the experience fresh. Definitely a must get if you enjoyed the first game.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
The story was actually pretty great. At first it seemed a little contrived (probably cause… well it was but..) it turned out pretty well. There was a little redundancy with Celebrimbor reapting himself about the Palantir 10000 times, but I suppose that was to make sure to cement his motivations and make them absolutely clear.. that he wants the Palantir. They manage to improve on their emotional tones and really make sure to hit home that Talion's situation REALLY sucks. They also threw in a delicious plot twist that had me excitedly giddy till the end and a little sad there wasn't more.

[h1]The Visuals:[/h1]
The visuals take a dramatic step up from the previous entry's and that was nothing to sneeze at either. Most importantly, the armor and weapons that you don look incredibly good. So much so that the alternate skins you can wear for fun just are overshadowed' by the Shadow of Wardrobe Talion has. The various envoirments especially Minas Ithil are also a pleasure to look at, along with all the little tiny details that Tolkein would take 7 and half pages to write about on a door, and absolutely there.

[h1]The Sound:[/h1]
The voice acting was superb and fits with what has been already established within the LOTR universe. In fact this is probably the strongest point since the captain's and their shit talking of you would not be possible without this. And it is almost the entire reason to play the game in my opinion. The music sounds good and now properly hits the right tones to enhance the emotional scenes along with that prior voice acting that I mentioned that truly hit me hard. It was done incredibly well.


[h1]The Experience:[/h1]
Mileage may vary, but in a good way with this game. Everyone's experience will both be curated and unique when playing this game, and this is why I love it. I am glad that whatever P2W mess was originally staining this game is gone and that now you can just play the game as it should have been released. The whole thing left me satisfied until the very end which a lot of games struggle to do. It was perfectly balanced, and while there was extra content to do should I chose it, I never felt like I had to play it like some sort of carrot on stick that a lot of other games like to do now a days. This is certainly worth a play whether or not you are a Lord of the Rings fan. Hell it might get you to want to see the movies if you never have.

I decided to re-visit this review, since I gained more experience on how to actually review things and the old one is pretty tantrum-ish. I will try to best explain, why I think this game is good, but inferior to its predecessor. 

Some keywords:
SOM- Shadow of Mordor
SOW- Shadow of War
BOG- Blade of Galadriel
DOM- Desolation of Mordor

[h1] The Bright [/h1]
Lets start of with the positives. First of, the thing this franchise is known for. The Nemesis System. It has been improved a LOT. The main gripe with older iteration is, your Orcs didn't have much personality, once they became your allies. This has changed. Umug the Bollocks Puncher stays the way he is. The Bollocks Puncher but on your side and not an automaton. The orcs overall, are even more vocal you could say. But here is a problem. SOM was VERY addictive to me, for these interactions. They were a balance of meaningful, threatening, funny and the appropriate amount. SOW is the exact opposite. In my first iteration of review, I said this gets very repetitive. Now my opinion has changed once it has finally properly digested. Its not, that they are repetitive. There is too much uniqueness. Too much humor. Too... empty. The orcs seem to have gained personality, only to somehow feel shallow. I don't know, maybe I am just crazy, but that's how I feel about this. Orcs are still fun, but... not like they used to be. Its still a good system. But for me, it has lost its charm, while SOM still keeps surprising me with its interactions, this one... I don't know. Its quantity over quality issue in my opinion but I shall move onto my next point before I get depressed over this.

DOM is a very good DLC. Finally, GOOD CHARACTERS AND STORY (more on that later). Definitely try this DLC.

Sieges are pretty fun. Not much else to say.

The Combat in this game is amazing. Its one of the few things I prefer over the SOM. The build variety is GREAT. One time, you can be a poisoner, who chokes everyone. The next, you are Ice Warrior, shattering all in his path. This is genuinely, one of the most fun combat out there. It helps that the AI is now smarter and adapts to your tactics which keeps it fresh and on your toes. The problem with combat is in its targetting though. Sometimes, the game just decides to take you on a ride and instead of using execute on that captain, it somehow takes you 30 meters away from him and is like ""F this grunt in particular"". But its still, pretty good I suppose. But that's it for the positives I think. 

[h1] The Orky [/h1]
First of, we start with one of the most crucial aspects in all the games. The sound design. I can tell you, SOM had one of the best sound designs out there. The flurry, the sword slashes and clings. Everything was top. So how does SOW fare in this? Weeeeeeelll... it reuses lot of these assets but seems to ""remake"" them a bit. Which I am not sure how, but it makes them sound duller and generic. Don't get me wrong. Some of them are still there, but it seems to have lost its edge a bit in this. Honestly, besides the old reused ones, the only new ones I remember are the punches from the ground execution. That's it. Music doesn't fare that good either. Besides the sieges, couple orc tracks and Orc Slayer, nothing sticks out. Its once again, forgettable. 

When we first heard about tribes, everyone went ballistic. A new unique feature orcs can have? Sign us up! Until their iteration. They are good. But some are way more interesting than others. The mechs, glowies and kitchen nightmares have the best aesthetic AND abilities to fight against. But others? Those are either mediocre or seriously lacking. Warmongers and Terror being the most forgettable ones. Doesn't help that 2 tribes are behind a paywall. I can understand why, but... Why? I honestly think it was bad decision but what can you do.

The new maps and environments are forgettable. Seregost is pretty much the only map that is genuinely good.

The post ""first credits"" challenge is a...meh. Its not bad, but I also wouldn't recommend it. The grind was toned down a lot from its first iteration but its still a big waste of time for few cutscenes. Unless you are sucked into the game, I don't recommend doing it.

My last point in the mixed feelings are the graphics. They are a downgrade in my opinion compared to SOM. They can look good, but most of the time, look muddy or as if drought has hit Mordor. The character models are a hit or miss. 

[h1] The Dark [/h1]
BOG. DO NOT BUY THIS AS A ONE OF. ONLY IN PACKS. ONLY ORCS ARE GOOD IN THIS ONE.

Multiplayer Sieges were one of the most interesting ideas on the paper. Fight someone elses orcs and rank up in difficulty? Heeeell yeee. Until you realize, people are generally min-maxers that do not try to make challenge, but unbeatable and most unfun experience ever for the attacker to quit and give them score rating in the difficulty for their fortress. Doesn't help, people use cheat engines. Its even worse once you realize, you have to use your overlord to get you additional fortress slots in duels against tf2 sniper bots. He can try, can kill them, but most often than not, he will miss and get headshotted unless he is berserker or defender. You cant even really swap the overlords, or I advise against it for the hidden mechanic of loyalty points/betrayal is a fickle mistress. I don't blame this necessarily on devs, but it is in the game and it is genuinely bad. 

And finally, the story. I genuinely dislike this story and its characters besides orc related stuff. They are sooooo boring or just straight up ANNOYING(F THE BLOND BIMBO, HER DAD AND THAT ASS ON THE GRASS HAT ELF). Celebrimbor and Talion are also huge downgrade in my opinion. Celebrimbor is BUMBLING idiot who goes ""PALANTIRPALANTIRPALANTIR MAH RING TALION MAH RING"" and Talion is goody two shoes. Shelob is passable. If she was made into pure spider, it would have been waaaaaaaaaaay better but what can you do (SCREW YOU HORNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY). But the worst of all, the Nazgul which are your main enemies. Why worst? They are EXTREMELY boring. Nazgul. The guys who gave me the CHILLS everytime they appeared in both the book and movies. They are BORING.[spoiler] Honestly, one good thing I can say about the story, is Talion becoming Nazgul BUT WHATS THAT? SOFT RETCON BECAUSE MISSUS ELF NEEDS A BOSS?! HEEEEEEEEEELL YEEEEEEEE! [/spoiler]

The bosses. Hear me out now. Were they improved? Yes. Compared to QTE final boss in SOM. Definitely. But they do NOT hold candle to The Hammer, The Tower, Sauron and Legendary Graug in first game. Its not always about the challenge. Its about the presentation aswell. The feels. The SETUP. And the bosses in SOM certainly had all of it. They did not appear a lot (basically boiled down to one-two cutscene appearance and then fight) but they felt like they were there ALWAYS. Nameless Nazgul are boring. Named Nazgul, while challenging, are also boring. [spoiler] The Sauron boss fight is a big let down from the one in the Bright Lord DLC in SOM. Thematic? Sure. Its 2v1. But that does not mean its good. The Balrog can be boiled down to ""OH MY GOD IS THAT BALROG LIKE FROM MOVIES?!"" eye-candy. Cool, but not much else. The nazgul sisters from BOG dlc are annoying at best. I genuinely feel like only Dark Talion was good. Genuinely good boss. But its BOG dlc. So ye. Get butchered by ugly ASS ON THE GRASS HAT ELF. [/spoiler]

[h1] The Finale [/h1]
All in all, this is a good game, yes. But for me, its not. For me its personally a disappointment and one of the games which made me be aware of pre-purchase.

It expands greatly on the first game with more areas, more things to do, more mechanics, and a lot of other fun things. It also expands on the enemies, in particular, the captains. While overall enjoyable, I felt more frequently annoyed by the captains in Shadow of War than in Shadow of Mordor. I think a big factor in this is the adaptation that captains can do. On the surface it is a cool idea, forcing you to adapt as your enemies do and not spam certain things, however, as noted with defender captains in my Shadow of Mordor review, there is sometimes only one good way to damage a particular captain, and you will quickly find them gaining immunity to that thing, especially on nemesis difficulty. If the captains were more consistent in having multiple ways to tackle them, especially defenders, I wouldn't mind it so much.

A new addition, sieges, are interesting. There is one significant problem though. If you prepare well for the siege by installing your own warchiefs, you basically skip the whole siege as there is no resistance at all except in the final fight, which you essentially MUST over-prepare for by getting a lot of traitors in waiting guarding the overlord. This is because the overlord is usually full of all kinds of immunities and nasty abilities along with all kinds adds and you must fight him head on. There is no outsmarting here like hunting captains in the wild. You MUST use the combat directly which is annoying for a game in which you often have so many options, such as stealth and beasts. If you lose that fight, you could lose an hour of time reinstalling warchiefs and bodyguards. I frequently found myself sticking 6 traitors on the overlord just so I would be ABSOLUTELY sure I wouldn't lose progress by losing the annoying fight.

The fight pits are another sometimes frustrating mechanic wherein you essentially are left to the whims of RNG whether you can assign traitors or warchiefs. Eventually it stopped bothering me, and I'm not sure why, but I know it was frustrating to be almost ready to attack and complete a mission but you have three bad fights in a row and need to hunt captains for another hour.

The game is very long if you do all of the side content and felt a little boring at the end, but it took some time to get there.
The story is much better though it wasn't a high bar. It was at least interesting, but certainly nothing to write home about. Lots of the characters can be a little bland and its more of the plot that was interesting to me. The orcs, again, for some reason, have the best voice acting in the game, even when compared to the main characters and people you should care about.

As far as critiques go, I have the same beef with defenders in this game as the first game (see that review), and there are a few other types of captains and captain traits which are straight up annoying and tedious. Olog captains can be very tedious at times and in certain missions the game limits your choices more by intentionally throwing around a lot of immunities which makes this 'play your way' game a lot more 'find what one thing works well this time'. In general, however, things are fine.

Eltariel's campaign is short, but it couldn't be drawn out much longer without being boring.
Baranor's campaign is very interesting (though short), but also can be frustrating if you are used to getting many tries to do things as it is effectively a roguelike.

Overall, very good game, well worth the sale price.",1695600733,1695600733,True,26,0,0.754209280014038086,0,True,False,False

Monolith Productions has truly outdone themselves with this sequel, expanding upon the already rich lore of Tolkien's universe in a way that's both respectful and imaginative.

From the moment you step into the shoes of Talion and Celebrimbor, the depth of the world is apparent. The attention to detail in recreating Middle-earth is staggering; every nook and cranny feels like it's steeped in history and significance. The environments, from the fiery depths of Mount Doom to the lush forests of Nurnen, are not only breathtakingly beautiful but also immersive, making every step of the journey feel like a genuine exploration.

The Nemesis System, which was groundbreaking in the first game, has been refined to near perfection. The dynamic relationships with orc captains, the personal vendettas they hold against you, and the way they evolve and adapt to your actions are nothing short of astonishing. It adds a layer of unpredictability and depth that keeps you on your toes, creating truly memorable encounters with every foe you face.

One of the most noteworthy improvements in Shadow of War is the combat system. It's fluid, responsive, and incredibly satisfying. The addition of new abilities and the expanded skill tree allow for a level of customization that caters to various playstyles, making every battle a unique experience. Whether you prefer stealthy assassinations or charging headfirst into the fray, the game accommodates it all seamlessly.

Now, let's talk about the DLCs. They are a true testament to Monolith's commitment to their player community. The expansions, especially the Desolation of Mordor and Blade of Galadriel, not only add significant content but also manage to maintain the high quality and attention to detail found in the base game. They introduce new perspectives, characters, and gameplay mechanics that breathe fresh life into the experience.

Moreover, the story arcs in the DLCs feel like genuine extensions of the main narrative, seamlessly weaving into the overarching lore. They provide a deeper understanding of the world and its characters, offering a more comprehensive Middle-earth experience.

Finally, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a triumph in every sense. It's a testament to the dedication and passion of the developers at Monolith Productions. With its stunning visuals, refined gameplay, and the incredible depth brought forth by the Nemesis System, this game is a must-play for any fan of Tolkien's universe. The DLCs are not just add-ons; they're essential chapters that enhance an already remarkable journey. As a dedicated gamer, I can't recommend this title enough. It's an adventure that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",1695429254,1695429335,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The run button is also the jump button, so you EITHER walk away from combat at an impossible pace and die, OR you hit the 'run' button, but instead of running you vault over an opponents head, or sprint up the nearest wall. Either way, there is no key combo that will simply let you run away, so you jump around willy-nilly until you die. There is no target lock, instead the game just auto-targets whoever is closest to you, making it almost impossible to actually kill a single target as your character dashes around single-slashing every opponent in range.

The first 10-15hours playing it were amazing. I honestly cant remember the last time I had as much fun playing a game. 

But then the issues started getting to me – and started piling up. For the more mechanics the game throws at you, the more it breaks. 

But let me quickly go over the issues – and why I can’t endure more than the ten hours I have had with the game:

- Controls: The controls are… lackluster. 90% of the time, you do what you want to do, but the first time I encountered issues was during the prologue, where I could not get my character to jump through an insanely large hole in a whole I just jumped through. Took what seemed to be 10 attempts and pure luck. And I came very, very, very close to dying because the game really doesn’t like you jumping off walls or over ledges during combat. So you may see your character to ten rolls into a wall instead of jumping it, while enemies pile up on you. 

- Lack of control: It suffers from the same issue as many other games of this type with the game having its own will. Want to run op to an enemy and slash them – you might end up jumping overthem/vaulting them. Want to jump off a building mid combat, you might find yourself rolling on the edge with your character refusing to jump. 
The targeting system of the game is also awful. For example, if one orc attacks you, you can dominate it. Then another orc shows up behind it and you then try to dominate it, you will often target the one you just dominated. Or when fighting a horde of enemies, you might auto-target a character that will actively be impossible for you to damage at that moment, instead of the ten other guys you wanted to target. 


- Unfair and actually broken: This game is honestly fundamentally flawed. Some spots in the game, from what I experienced, are bound to spawn endless enemies. So much so that, and I am not shitting you, 30+ (maybe 50) archers spawned right on top of me. I took a screenshot as proof. This is how unfair the game is at time. 
It will also damage (and potentially kill you) the second a cutscene ends. So that is FUN! 
And this gets even worse when you can try to dominate captains, but they keep spawning enemies. Endlessly. Meaning that you just don’t get a chance to do so and have to finish them off instead. I spent 25 minutes trying to dominate a captain this way and it just didn’t happen. 

- Terrible story: The writing of this game is so bad it is at times funny. I do not care about anything or anyone in the game as it really gives you no reason to. The character development is bad and you are really given zero reason to get invested because the overall story – and writing of it – is, at best, one big cliché and at worst actually bad. 


So what does the game do well? 
- When the combat is fun, it is very, very, very, very fun. (It is mostly fun in the first 10-15 hours. Then it is partly broken by the above-mentioned issues. 

- The orcs are so well designed. They are very well written and acted and I loved encountering the various orcs the game throws at you. This is insanely good! 


But because of all the issues with the games mechanics, I just grew tired of it. I should also mention that once you can dominate orcs, you are told to dominate captains to lead a charge. I spent more than 3 hours trying to get the orcs necessary (think you need at least four) and I managed to get two. Too many of them were too high level and could not be recruited, while I could not recruit several others because of the issues mentioned above. 
That means that the game has you do the same kind of fighting again and again. Nothing new. Same thing. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. And that is another reason why the game gets VERY stale once you are ten hours into it. Some things do change such as you getting more powerful which is cool, but it is just not enough.",1695171104,1695171185,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This patented system ensures that players experience their own unique side story while building armies of orcs and conquering fortresses apart from the main game. Every interaction a player faces with enemies is truly unique and what's astounding is how the nemesis system enables you to form a bond with each orc based off your previous interactions with them. 

- Graphics are superb
- Main story is compelling and has a satisfying end to the duology
- Side quests are fun and repetition is voided somewhat thanks to the nemesis system
- If you've played Shadow of Mordor - then you'd certainly love this game. If you haven't, then this game is definitely worth a try just to get a glimpse of the capabilities of the nemesis system.

The nemesis system is back 20 times as great as it was in SoM, and I loved every hour of it. While the story is not the most innovative thing ever, and doesn't exactly delve deep into Tolkien's lore, it is engaging and the characters are interesting. As soon as I opened the game I fell in love with the soundtrack, the main theme hooked me immediately and I knew it was going to be a unique and epic experience.

The nemesis system is amazing and once again it is truly sad WB licensed it to never use it again, with it you can make your own stories and make your true nemesis immune to most of your attacks making you truly strategize a way to either kill or dominate to join your ranks, another upgrade I felt is that this time Orcs have more fleshed out personalities, which might make you want to keep a few of them forever, yet if you hate one for whatever reason you can just shame him and with some luck he'll stop bothering you.

I've read that when this game came out, it was plagued with micro transactions and long grinding, however, as it is now, I did not feel the need to grind anything to 100% the game, maybe online conquests but those are really fun so no problem there. Speaking of gameplay, feels very similar to SoM with tons of abilities and upgrades to mix and match any build you want, fast paced combat with satisfying finishers. 

A must buy along with Shadow of Mordor, and make sure to play it on at least Nemesis difficulty to experience the most of this masterpiece.",1692930686,1694967033,True,48,0,0.785470724105834961,0,True,False,False

Having thoroughly enjoyed the previous game on console, I was thrilled to dive into Middle-earth: Shadow of War. It felt like everything I loved from the previous title with some added benefits and extra content.

I vividly recall spending a solid two hours in the first area, relentlessly hunting down commanders – pure gaming bliss! I'd highly recommend picking it up, especially if you spot it on sale. Admittedly, it does lean on the expensive side, particularly for Australian users.

Before you make the plunge, consider watching a video or two (or maybe a hundred, your choice!) to ensure it's the game that truly resonates with you.

In my book, Middle-earth: Shadow of War earns a solid 7.5/10. It's a game where I happily sacrificed a giant dog to eliminate three commanders, and I'd do it all over again. :3",1573476453,1694359004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is like that job you never knew you wanted - becoming a professional Orc-slayer! Forget about resumes and interviews; you're armed with swords and bad puns, ready to conquer Mordor.

The game's protagonist, Talion, has one mission: making orcs extinct, one snarky comment at a time. He's like a grumpy gardener, but instead of pruning roses, he's pruning the orc population. He's got a lot of issues with these guys, and he's not afraid to share his feelings. ""Nice helmet, did you make it yourself?"" - a classic Talion roast.

Speaking of orcs, they have personalities as varied as a bag of mixed nuts. Some will threaten you with bodily harm; others will offer you career advice. It's like being in a job interview with a particularly aggressive HR department.

Then there's the Nemesis System. It's like a soap opera, but with more decapitations. Orcs remember every time you hurt them, and they come back stronger, angrier, and even more determined to make you their personal chew toy. It's like playing a never-ending game of Whack-a-Mole, but the moles are seven feet tall and want to disembowel you.

Don't even get me started on the wildlife. Caragors, graugs, and drakes - oh my! The animal kingdom in Middle-earth is like a mythical zoo gone rogue. You'll ride these beasts into battle, and when you're done, you'll feel like you've just auditioned for a 'Lord of the Rings' remake of 'Jumanji.'

In conclusion, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an epic journey filled with humor, chaos, and more orc-gore than you can shake a sword at. It's like a rollercoaster ride through Tolkien's wildest dreams, and you're the fearless conductor. So, grab your sword, prepare some clever comebacks, and get ready to slay, laugh, and conquer Mordor, one orc at a time!",1693971722,1693971722,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

They've added a deeper RPG-like influence to the weapon and skill upgrade systems, which is neat, but at least early-on in my game play is also kind of annoying because it's more detail than before. It's just change, and I'm already starting to get used to it. These types of level-up scenarios are always an issue within sequel games because you have to re-earn and sometimes re-learn abilities that you already earned in the first game—it's simply the nature of the beast. Complaint: At least as I'm starting, arrows are tough to come by, so hopefully there's some upgrades to, 1: carry more of them; 2: recharge them in other ways than finding arrow stores (i.e. draining life like the first game.)

The improvement of enemies is also double-edged: the captains are now more intelligent, have additional abilities like surprise attacks, poison disorientation, a sort of teleportation, ability to sweep you off your feet while prone, and are a bit more nuanced than, ""Here's another tank you need to beat up."" They also have a more robust combination of strengths and weaknesses, so instead of reading one or two traits, you have to spend more time studying and memorizing their attributes.

There is also an element of fighting along side of allied troops, and what appears to be a nemesis engine for your allies, too. I'm yet to see much of this in play, but I assume I'll need to protect them and help some of them rise in their ranks at some point.

I'm sure that I have a lot more to discover within this game and the revisions to the engine, but over-all, so far I'm enjoying the story, the visuals, the audio, and the game play.

This game was twice as long as Shadow of Mordor, and yet it became quite monotonous by the same 20hr mark as the first one. Except in Shadow of Mordor by the 20-ieth hour the game was almost over, and here it was not;

Like combat is sure has more stuff in it, and maybe there is some fun to be had by clearing endless camps while zoning out, but the only thing it did for me is made me think about how Dragons Dogma is a much better game and made me wish for a sequel;

And now that that sequel is real i am much more content with existence of this thing;

The lore is kind of thrown out the window, but I will let it pass for this game since the developers seemed to care more about player experience rather than lore accuracy.

Stuff like difficulty balancing and the gear system feel a little poorly designed, and the combat is rough when there's always 50 orcs on the screen doing random stuff. It honestly feels more jank than it should, and cheesing with stealth sometimes feels required.

There are also a fair amount of glitches that will probably just never get patched out. Some are fun like switching skins allowing you to fast travel in combat. Others are not so fun, like captain orcs just disappearing.or your missions just not registering as completed.

don't get fooled by my 3 hours of playtime, i genuinely tried giving this game a shot but i just couldn't get myself hooked to it. the repetitive button mashing combat with minimal reward is definitely the reason why i just couldn't engage myself in the game.
Every single encounter with orcs end up being an encounter with 100 orcs and 5 captains and every single captain is literally vulnerable to every trick in the game. it's not even the case of ""get good"", the game genuinely is a tedium.

The game is flawed from the root since the whole thing was developed around pay to win mechanics/lootboxes. This game was soo heavily monetised initially that despite removing stores and every other mechanism related to ig purchases, the game feels like an eternal grind. Shows how scummy their approach was initially. I believe this very reason why i just couldn't enjoy the game.

This system makes the game unique for everyone. What this system does is it makes every captain you will face in the game random in a wide variety of areas, such as names, skills, weaknesses, voice. Another thing that this system does that I love works somewhat like this. The character you play as is banished from death, meaning every time you die you come back, so any normal ork that kills you becomes a captain and will remember that he killed you and will point it out during your encounters. The game remembers if you run from a fight, if the captain runs from a fight, if the captain kills you, and if you kill the captain. Another thing that can happen is that a captain you killed can come back from death with a scar that relates to how you killed them such as cuts, burn marks, messed up skin from poison and so on. They will remember everything. Something else that you can do later on with captain is recruit them into your own army. This can make for some more interesting encounters such as being saved from death by a recruit or even being betrayed by a recruit. This game is truly awesome and stands as my favorite game of all time and I hope to see even more done with the nemesis system in the future.",1691946493,1691946493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love everything from the improved nemesis system that originated in Shadow of Mordor to the improved combat and skills system that can really make you feel like a total badass. I'll just say that I like the changes and improvements that they made here in this game, and compared to Shadow of Mordor's gameplay, it is like putting peanut butter on toasted bread. Though I wouldn't say that it is a balanced game, for me, I just think of it as part of why I feel like a badass playing as Talion. I did encounter some visual and graphical glitches in the base game (e.g., Talion's cape acting weird; Shadows just seems to flicker sometimes, especially on Seregost), but overall it is a good time.

For the story, I would say the beginning (Act I) is decent; it has its ups and downs and didn't really sell me the Gondorian storyline, but it did its job of setting up a foundation for the later acts. In my opinion, the story is much better in Act II, Act III, and Act IV because it introduces other characters, and that's where it picked up its momentum and became interesting (especially the Carnan, Shelob, and Bruz quests), though again, I didn't like the Gondorian quests because the story told is bland for my taste. The epilogue, though, is my favorite part of the story because it expanded, explained, and ended Talion's storyline. Overall, a decent story that gradually went from good to great

This is where I will say that if you have any interest in buying this game, then buy it at a discount because then you can get the bundle, which has Shadow of Mordor and War with all of its DLCs.

At the 21st hour of gameplay, my character is at level 26. Most of the time, I engaged in side quests and building my own Mordor while it was interesting.

The Nemesis system itself is quite interesting and diverse. The enemies have a wide variety of clothing, character traits, and, of course, voices. There are different orc families and initially, it's even engaging. You recruit captains, turn them into spies, conquer leaders, prepare sieges, and level up your commanders... then you repeat it all again. And then again.

As a result, I abandoned the game after capturing the second fortress.

The character level increased very slowly. There are various weapon upgrades and types, but after 10 hours, I rarely bothered to check my inventory to change anything. There is also rare legendary gear, but I came across something useless - to upgrade it, you had to capture an orc of level 40 from a specific tribe. And I realised that I wouldn't play this game for so long.

I can't say much about the whole plot, but the beginning turned out to be childish and disjointed. Some girl guardian, some relic that will help win the war. Spider madame! Most of the time, you're trying to figure out what relates to what. And this is considering that I'm somewhat familiar with the universe, and if needed, I read additional info with interest. But I didn't like the prologue with its naivety and fragmented storytelling.

So, among the positives, I would highlight:
- Still enjoyable combat system
- Captivating Nemesis system
- BRUZ
- A large number of activities

But they have their downsides:
- Ranged weapon enemies will irritate you
- Essentially, apart from invasions and captures, you can't do much else
- Which I've seen only about 7-8 times
- And you'll have to repetitively perform it

The question is only about how much you'll enjoy doing this [i](and spending your free time on it)[/i]

As with the previous game, the lore and story is an infuriating fanfiction mess written by an edgy teenager. I'm no Tolkien purist but it's insulting how the world and characters are treated; Shelob is a gothic edgy Galadriel, for some reason Sauron keeps going back to his elf form and it's stupid because why would he, giving all of the Nazgûl identities sort of ruins the point, and then there's the whole Celebrimbor/Sauron ship. Oh and the constant reminders that this is a Lord of the Rings game, how does it do that? By dropping random quotes from the books and movies, the writing itself thinks it's so clever but I only found myself dying inside each time, much like Aragorn Talion.
And that's not all of it, but outside of all of the trashy lore changes the gameplay is actually fun - to a point. Creating your own army, spreading chaos wherever you go keeps being addicting and fun, even sieges are enjoyable.
Then you get to the final part of the game, and guess what? You're at the opposite end of that siege and everything turns into a chaotic, poisonous, burning, exploding, no chance mess.
In all of it you might get four or so orcs going on about how they're going to kill you, and by the end of it, it's tiring because you can't skip any of their monologues. Even the ones that got nothing to say and just stare at you.

The gameplay loop is quite repetitive, and it gets stale after a little while. Right around the time you're completing what feels like the last story mission, there's the terrible realization that there's still an entire 10-12 hours of grinding left in order to get the actual ending of the game. By the time I reached this point, I was so burned out from the loop that I decided this was one I'd never finish. I think they should've wrapped up the game with the penultimate Act instead of hiding it behind war objectives more obscure than America's military objectives in Afghanistan. There is a bit of a shotgun blast of plot here that does satisfy, even if it is rushed and unpolished. The last ""endless"" section of the game is perfectly fine, but I really wanted a definitive completion of the game at what I felt was the proper finish line in its storytelling. It wasn't so much a period on a very long, grindy story with lots of distracting side missions and events, but more of a semicolon.

Overall, it's a great game for the money, and the voice acting is on par with the best in the business. All of the casting is perfect.",1690764697,1690764697,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[hr][/hr]

I played this game back in 2018 originally and I loved this game, has a fantastic story, great endgame loop and an enjoyable multiplayer experience with Conquests If you ever see this game on sale I would pick it up as its honestly a blast. I had recently gone back to the game as like i said i have pretty much always adored this game and going back through it and 100% it reminded me of why i loved it so much.

Without touching on the story too much in order to avoid too many spoilers but i can honestly say that its a fantastic continuation on both the original game and in general for the IP as this is a game that ill admit i had played without having really watched the movies allowing you to enjoy the game and it will tell you what you really need to know. And there are also a number of different collectables scattered around the game which also work to add some more story and general information about the world. And especially when you get into the final act and begin to unlock the new ability to [spoiler] raise the dead [/spoiler] it makes the game so much more awesome and enjoyable. The only flaw id maybe have is with the prologue where the story and the dialogue can be a bit mcguffiny ""we need to get this"" sort of stuff but that's honestly probably the lowest point of the game in my opinion.

[h1] The Nemesis System [/h1]
[hr][/hr]

Id be doing a bad job reviewing this if i didn't even mention the nemesis system which is single handed responsible for making the endgame as enjoyable as it is if you don't know this is a system which pretty much makes you unique enemies to fight in order to do this every captain has their own weaknesses and strengths which will cause you to change your strategies each time you go to fight one of them.

Like i said this system is pretty much entirely responsible for making the endgame fun as it allows you to be always be facing something new and different the only problem that i have with it is that as of writing this WB games has trademarked the system and haven't used it since.

[h1] The DLC's [/h1]
[hr][/hr]

There are 2 dlcs for this game [i]""Desolation of Mordor""[/i] and [i]""Blade of Galadriel""[/i] these are both dlcs which take place at different points of the game from characters which we dont see the end of throughout the campaign being [spoiler]Baranor[/spoiler] and [spoiler]Eltariel[/spoiler] these take place at different points with [i]""Blade of Galadriel""[/i] taking place first during the main campaign.

[h1] Blade of Galadriel [/h1]

I'll be completely honest i wasn't really a big fan of the dlc it kind of seems to play off like a diluted version of the main game where the nemesis system doesn't really exist and all your doing is these mission which are pretty much fest quest but for captains until you get a finale mission in each of the 4 regions. Although again without saying much for spoilers sake the ending i think is quite good and does make the main story even better as it explains what happened to her.

[h1] Desolation of Mordor [/h1]

Now on the other hand we have [spoiler]Baranor's[/spoiler] dlc which i had really enjoyed, essentially this is a bit of a time based challenge dlc whilst there is a story which i had quite enjoyed after you've done that you're then able to play it for time scores. Although there is something unique to this dlc and that is that he doesn't have a ring of power therefore making him a mortal so if he dies you start at the beginning whilst it may sound very daunting there isn't actually, you pretty much just have to take over 1 region.

But also unlike the previous one theres a number of different abilities as he doesnt get any powers from the ring which change up the ways you fight battles in the mode allowing you to be more creative with what you do. And to close i will mention the replacement for the nemesis system, you use mercenaries these guys look so cool and it also does break up the monotony of fighting with [spoiler]uruks[/spoiler] all of the time and they also look really cool.",1690763793,1690763920,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Is it a single combat game? Well sometimes it wants to be but again the mechanics are not quite there. Is it a hack and slash where you can kill hordes of enemys? Again, sometimes it wants to be but still isn't just that. Climbing? Yeah sure but not really controllable. Other games just show how to do all of it better. 

Also if you like to be able to be in control you our character and gameplay this game isn't for you. You want the stealth kill the hightlighted target? Well unfortunatly the game decides to jump on an orc outside your vision. You are in the middle of a battle and you're about to recuit a new captain? Well here comes a quick, unpromted, cutscene that resets everything. The gameplay aspect of this game is horrible. The game wants you to fail so the nemsis system makes any sense. While in dark souls you fail all the time but get better and start leaning into certain builds. 

The game mechanics are all over the place and the ""nemesis system"" is not so great that it can carry the whole thing. 
Story (so far) is also meh and not (quite coherent) *edit* not at all coherent.

-many regions to explore compared to the first game
-epic siege war against enemy's fortress
-very unique orcs dialogues, you will encounter each orc's captain with different personality
-beautiful graphics
-easy to learn, but hard to master combat mechanics
-you can have 3 different skill upgrade and can change it whichever the playstyle you like
-many post-game contents
-online contents, such as conquering other player's fort or battling your orc against other player's orc

cons:
-you can't have shortcut for skill upgrade such as setting skillset for different playstyle, so you have to do the ""pause and switch"" thing, prepare to be annoyed
-it's kinda boring at the start of the game but it gets interesting on act II
-the pit fight system

[*]Commented on my ability (or lack thereof) with things like stealth, archery, and poison
[*]Referred to other orcs by name
[*]Recalled their previous encounters with me
[*]Challenged me personally after I had destroyed grog or killed warbeasts
[*]Tracked me down from one edge of the world to the other
[*]Returned from defeat through various means, ready for a rematch

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an awe-inspiring continuation of the acclaimed Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, taking players on an epic adventure through the vast and captivating realm of J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary universe.

From the very beginning, it becomes evident that the developers have put immense effort into crafting a world that not only respects the source material but expands upon it in compelling ways. The attention to detail in the environments, character designs, and lore is commendable, and it's evident that this game was made with a profound love for Tolkien's works.

The story is well-crafted and engaging, offering a captivating narrative that feels like a natural extension of the events in the previous installment. Players assume the role of Talion, a ranger possessed by the elven wraith Celebrimbor, and the journey of their intertwined fates is filled with emotional depth and personal growth. The way the story weaves together with the larger events of Middle-earth is masterful, making players feel like they are an integral part of the grand saga.

The Nemesis system, a standout feature from the first game, is expanded and refined in Shadow of War. This dynamic mechanic creates an ever-changing world where the consequences of your actions ripple through the ranks of enemy forces. Building relationships and rivalries with the Orcs adds a unique layer of immersion, making every encounter feel personal and memorable.

The combat system is fluid and satisfying, offering a diverse range of abilities that can be combined to create impressive and stylish takedowns. As you progress, you gain access to various upgrades and skills that allow for deeper customization of your playstyle, enhancing the sense of empowerment as you become a formidable force in the fight against Sauron's armies.

The world of Middle-earth itself is an absolute joy to explore. Each region is distinct and filled with secrets, collectibles, and side quests that add hours of meaningful content to the game. The attention to detail in recreating iconic locations like Minas Ithil and Mount Doom is a testament to the developers' dedication to authenticity.

Performance-wise, the game runs smoothly, and the visuals are breathtaking. The attention to visual fidelity in capturing the essence of Middle-earth showcases the level of care and craftsmanship that went into making this game.

In conclusion, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a marvelous experience that transports players deep into the heart of Tolkien's world. It's a celebration of the beloved source material, masterfully executed with a captivating story, engaging gameplay, and stunning visuals. If you have a love for Middle-earth or simply enjoy action-adventure games with depth, this is an absolute must-play.",1690236616,1690236616,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Do note that I do not follow the LOTR story or series. The only reason I play this game is because it ""looks cool"" and people says that the ""nemesis"" system is good. This review is also written after my first playthrough with Talion on the highest difficulty setting (Gravewalker).

[h1]Story[/h1]
I think the plot is very good yet I think you do need to play Shadow of Mordor first to understand the story since this game is the sequel to Shadow of Mordor (I did not play Shadow of Mordor). The game tries to give a sort of role-play, where the game really tries it's best to immerse you into the world. From grunts talking about you, to enemy captains talking about how many times they've killed you. The nemesis system do gives a sort of role-play experience in a good way.

[h1]Mechanics / Gameplay[/h1]
The movement is a little bit clunky, it's not as fluid as other games but I guess it's good enough. Sometimes you may get scammed by the movement system, but I guess it's fine. 

For the combat mechanics I would say it's good but depends on how you perceive it. For starters there are no ""combos"", so you would only spam left click to attack which I guess due to the nature of the game (You vs the whole world) does fit perfectly. I dont think most people who are average par gameplay (read: has skill issues) would want to have like 12 attack combos against 12 different people with different mechanics. And you can counter infinite attacks from infinite enemies, though I've never had more than three enemies attack me simultaneously. So as long as you can counter the enemy''s attack you would be fine. 

The game mainly revolves through enemy mechanics, where you need to know how to counter different type of enemies. For example, tanks cannot be countered you can only dodge their attacks. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new moves for some or all types of enemies. So you would have multiple moves to deal damage to that type of enemy.

I also forgot to mention that the stealth mechanic is average, gameplay wise it's fine but if you are looking for that ""realism"" or ""role-play"" I guess it's a meh. Imagine running to the front of a grunt and he's just ""huh?"" and you slit his throat like Ezio from Assasin's Creed. Well I don't know about orc's anatomy but I dont think orcs are that blind to be honest. 

The only thing you would need to grind is probably the orcs. You must want to have an orc who does things exceptionally (read: bashes the brains out of other orcs faster than other orcs). I do spent a lot of times in terms of grinding out orcs since the game also let you fight other people's orcs. 

[h1]My Gameplay[/h1]
Since I am not your average person, I started the game on the Gravewalker difficulty which was the hardest difficulty according to google. At the first stages of the game, I die a lot which I thought was due to picking the hardest difficulty but I guess it was just me figuring the game out. In the mid-game of the story after you unlock some new moves / skills, the game becomes a lot easier. But later on near the end, I guess you will find enemies that are immune to almost everything ? I had a captain who was Immune to Fire, Poison, Curse, Frost, Arrows, Vaults. Had a crossbow that deals curse damage and had the sniper trait (They don't miss and can shoot at long range) and they keep one shotting me and my captains. Spent like 3 hours on the captain and just gave up, luckily it was an overlord of a fortress that I don't need to conquer.

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
It's a solid 8/10. Eventhough sometimes the mechanics are clunky, and sometimes the game's bugged a bit or even the orcs just literally said ""you will die"" due to me dying to the same orc about 12 times in a row the game is still pretty solid and I do think you should try the game out.",1690038405,1690040299,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

I consider this game in the leagues of Sleeping Dogs, RDR 2, Metro Exodus, Mafia Definitive Edition, etc. Extreme Rare Gem. Didn't even feel a moment of boredom on this 2nd play-through on Steam. In fact, I landed on Steam because of this game lol after finishing the game through unofficial means and finding out that this game was being sold so cheap!

Interactive Entertainment. It is the sequel to 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, both of which are based on J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.

The game received positive reviews from critics, who praised its gameplay, Nemesis system, and visuals. However, the game was also criticized for its microtransactions, which were later removed.

Here are some of the pros and cons of Middle-earth: Shadow of War:

Pros:

Excellent gameplay
Innovative Nemesis system
Stunning visuals
Great voice acting
Tons of content to explore

Cons:

Microtransactions (later removed)
Can be repetitive at times
The story is not as good as Shadow of Mordor

Overall, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an excellent game that is well worth playing. It is a visually stunning game with engaging gameplay and a great Nemesis system. However, the microtransactions were a bit of a letdown, and the story is not as good as Shadow of Mordor.

Here are some of the things that I liked about the game:

The gameplay is excellent. The game combines action, stealth, and RPG elements in a way that is both challenging and rewarding.

The Nemesis system is innovative. The system creates unique and memorable enemies that can rise through the ranks of Sauron's army.

The visuals are stunning. The game is one of the most visually impressive games I have ever played. The environments are beautifully rendered, and the character models are incredibly detailed.
The voice acting is great. The voice actors do a great job of bringing the characters to life.
There is tons of content to explore. The game world is large and there are many secrets to discover.
Here are some of the things that I didn't like about the game:

Microtransactions (later removed). The microtransactions were a bit of a letdown, as they allowed players to buy in-game currency that could be used to purchase items and upgrades.

Can be repetitive at times. The game can be a bit repetitive at times, especially the combat.

The story is not as good as Shadow of Mordor. The story in Shadow of War is not as good as the story in Shadow of Mordor. It is still enjoyable, but it is not as engaging.

Overall, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an excellent game that is well worth playing. It is a visually stunning game with engaging gameplay and a great Nemesis system.

The game features:

- high action combat

- many skill trees and abilities

- the ability to recruit orcs to your army or to be bodyguards

- large variety of quests and side quests to complete

- fortress raids that require you to use your army and recruited orcs to raid and end with a difficult boss battle, once completed you take control of them and place your own orc gerenerals inside to control it.

- the nemesis system keeps unique orc and orc general combat spicy. Giving each encountered general or special to have specific strengths and weaknesses. 

- enemies can adapt to overused tactics while fighting them, making them immune to said tactic. This provides a good challenge and is interesting to experience mid battle.

- multiple character skins to choose from if you have the dlc

- multiple areas and maps to explore

- encounters where two orc generals fight eachother

- occasionally orcs you killed will reappear stronger then before with a message saying they cheated death

- when an enemy kills you they gain levels and become stronger gradually

- orcs you recruit can be trained and given abilities or weapons using the garrison in your army menu

- there is an equipment system with a wide variety of items and legendary special equipment you can collect by completing challenges in each zone

Overall I would say the shadow games are the best in the LOTR franchise and I highly recommend them.

But after a couple of hours of playing you will get absolutely bored of it, because there are only around 5 animations for this attack. And lack of animations is not the biggest problem, the biggest problem is that every time you attempt to execute a downed enemy, you will almost certainly be interrupted by another nearby orc, which makes this attack absolutely useless in any fight that involves more than 1 enemy. Yes, there is a perk that allows you to block while executing an enemy, but this perk is locked by a considerable character level requirement, and it still has no effect against the ranged orcs who will just throw their shit at you from a 20m distance, without any visual cue.

While the first feels a little basic outside grinding the other orcs, the story gets a lot longer with more interesting mission ideas. I'd still say the first gives more context to the revenge plot and has some more likable characters (I don't mind Shelob as a character, but not like this) but they certainly expand it this time around. Biggest problems: the Nemesis system is expanded meaning you can get trapped grinding against a stronger orc with no weakness or forces you to coordinate with the AI to poke at them, also the microtransactions have since been removed for a better experience but might still feel grindy. It still forces you through a tutorial before you can really start up your own army, that's fine and all but especially after coming off of the prequel I think people might want to just start branding their own army. While there can be some fun orcs across the game it feels like you rarely see the very fun ones or they never spawn as legendary elites and can be short lived. So you might end up getting a nemesis with someone who just likes to skin people while the bard, skull armor design, or even the explosive crossbow type don't make as big an impact as you'd like unless you do brand them and slowly level them up to prevent losing them.

While the first felt half finished but had a really cool feature, this feels like it was working towards being a full game around that feature and making the most of everything else the player can do. The ranger fantasy is stronger as you unlock skills and get used to using almost everything you've got as orcs adapt more often, and there are a few homages to LotR as a series as well as a few interesting ideas the first didn't feature. Some have less heart, I still love the dwarf from the first game but he does feature in the DLC one life challenge run and there are still other interesting characters with the expanded story.

Five orcs in the area (including Ugol) drink it up and die horribly. i do a little jig on his corpse and go on with my day. Just as i'm about to execute a random orc captain, lo and behold Ugol arrives looking like a chewed up piece of bubblegum to ambush me. He laughs about cheating death and says many things that hurt my feelings. He also has poison attacks now but he is still allergic to poison... Luckily my bow has a chance to apply poison, so i gun that bastard down until he looked like Nickelodeon slime on the floor. I thought that was the end of his heroic tale until he shows up YET AGAIN to ambush me as i'm attacking another orc captain.

SOW is better than SOM in many terms except atmosphere and character design IMO (Talion in SOM looks WAYYY different than in SOW). The game is so UNIQUE and the feeling of being immortal half elf half man hybrid who can't die (obviously as i said ''immortal'') makes it really fun. You basically make your army ALONE by dominating orcs minds by making them on of your own and capture fortresses. However they can betray you and you can shame them (pretty cool option) which leads to making them weaker and in some cases crazy (literally). I forgot to say that the orcs have very funny personalities and every one of them is UNIQUE (Uniqueness is the thing that makes this game so good)
The DLCs are also fun especially the DESOLATION OF MORDOR DLC

The more unique uruks appear early in the games story so after an amount of time the captains get dull unfortunately. But the pit fights and fortress attack/defense are always a blast!

but at some point some bugs just crushed me and my will to play, like after conquering an fortress, at the load screen an vile orc introduced himself as usual prior to a fight, but he did that while my entire screen was all black with loading symbols and all, and i could literally do nothing but die, it just hit me once as i played brutal difficulty then i died (couldn't do the last chance as it was all black) and lost the fortress i had just conquered after failing like 3 times, this was traumatic to me, my best orcs that i was working days and days on them DIED and i completely lost all control i had within this map.

Basically Ubisoft open world with Assassin's creed style movement and Batman Arkham series combat without anything that makes that combat great. Tack on a 'number go up' RPG system and this is what you get. Funny considering both this and arkham were made by WB but then again no wonder MTX ridden, pointless cookie cutter crap was still making the cut given it's WB what with their recent Gotham S - h - i - t - e - s.

Quests are generic pointless kill dudes or kill dudes with special conditions like not breaking stealth, find dudes, cut and use dudes nut - sacks. Story that is part of this or otherwise is also pointless. Don't know what happened to half of the nut - jobs including Idril and Baranor. 'Twists' are not memorable and a minor footnote. The rest is just Kelly Bimbo wanting to kill Sauron and rule. Don't know what else there is to it. Side quests are just as bad. There is nothing to think about, nothing to chew on so it really doesn't have story going for it which would be fine if the rest didn't s - u - c - k.

Army building is a fine idea but the execution is just drawn out busy work with individually fighting and recruiting a bajillion dudes. Doesn't help that the nemesis system spits out dudes all too often that can be immune to everything but one tactic so you have to abuse it or cheese them some way else. More so if they have the 'attack sponge' trait. Made all the more worse in the 'epilogue' where every other orc is 10 levels higher. Again worsened if they 'adapt' and render your tool useless as well. Also doesn't help that in higher difficulties they can one or two shot you if they are the same or higher level. Thanks for so much grind and busy work.

Arkham works by not just giving one dude immunity to everything but giving a little bit of something to everyone and then mixing it up and stacking the odds just ever so slightly again and again so you have to form a strategy on how to take your enemies down. Same in good games like Doom/Doom Eternal. You learn the basics and then learn how to master your tools. Here every so often they'll give you a wall and tell you to break it with your teeth. 

The skills seemed cool and would have been fun to play around with. It just doesn't help that your guy will target whoever he pleases as opposed to who you want. That is one of the most obnoxious things about combat in this game. Some others I can remember is domination, you know the main thing you do against orcs, is just painfully useless in combat save for one perk allowing some use. Of course you give up being able to shoot arrows more than a few times for it. Also nothing has been done to help you navigate the cluster eff when there are like 50 orcs on screen back to back and you can't see which one next to you is moving to attack you let alone how many there are to begin with. Sure there is the indicator but I personally don't find that alone helpful especially in that visual noise. That also hurts the combat a lot.

The above is compounded by another favorite of the industry, 'number go up' RPG mechanics. It's all about reducing damage taken and maximizing damage dealt. You'll find lots of things you could use to strategize with cool effects only to realize you've outstripped it very soon. Get ready for more busy work to 'upgrade' it by finding 'currency'. And on top, you have to complete challenges if it's special gear like play 5 games of whack the orc captains that far exceed your level. No cool builds for you! You have to grind for it!

Speaking of currency, you require it for other things as well such as siege offense/defense. It isn't too bad until the epilogue where you'll be attacked by level 300 forces and to get your defenses there you'll have to spend all the 10 - 20 k on one defense that you might have spent your entire campaign building up. And this whole attack defense thing you will have to go over at least half a dozen times to complete the story. I don't care to find out beyond that. And just to be clear, this is done once you have built your army in each region to being your assault.

Collectathon also plagues this game with collectibles in every region. The rewards are nothing remarkable from what I've played. Just wood for the 'number go up' fire.

I think I've spoken enough about the main thing, the nemesis system but to add a little more, I don't think it really does much other than add more busy work by spitting out new dudes for you to kill. It does not really feel well implemented.

And that's all that I can think of. I hope you found this review helpful. I certainly believe the fun per unit time in this review is more than in the game and if nothing else, this review is certainly less of a time waste than the game.",1688272227,1688272227,False,2,1,0.446004778146743774,0,True,False,False

The in-game cutscenes were buggy and lacked any sort of consistency. The characters were all boring and flat aside from ratbag and Bruz. The controls were terrible, it felt like you could never jump to the spot you wanted, and sometimes would launch off a ledge. Too many re-used quests but in different areas. I could go on. 

Overall, it felt as though they innovated the nemesis system but fell short everywhere else. After the first couple hours, you've basically seen everything. I hope you enjoy doing the same ""save you men tied to a pole"" quests or ""follow some dumb character to an ambush"" mission.

I never watched Lord of the Rings...

But this game is honestly great, the whole Army/Nemesis concept is absolutely insane and I'm pretty sure I heard it was trademarked so we can't see it anywhere else but please let the developers work on a Star Wars game because that would be top tier gaming.

Long story short, I genuinely skip a lot of the dialogue, I mostly just drink while playing this game and I recruit orcs and make them fight each other while taking down kingdoms. It's fun as hell, shit I'm drunk rn writing this review. Fun game, lots to do, although it's a fairly repetitive system, it's randomly generated so there's many ways to go about killing your enemies and it doesn't get stale.

2 reasons. 1 important, 1 just an annoyance. 

The important one first. While they've certainly made some extensions and improvements since Shadow of Mordor, like variety and in captains etc, they've messed up something fundamental. Somehow, the quests and story don't flow at all. In SoM, while you were relatively free to wander around, do things at your pace, you still felt driven by a coherent story and things moving you forward. This one, however, has none of that. Actually, there's no flow at all. You can pick any quest, do any thing. but I didn't feel a driving level of coherence. It's hard to explain, but when you play it, you'll probably get it. This is just a lesser game where somehow you don't feel as invested in the character, the journey, it's somehow hollow. THAT'S the reason I don't recommend it.

As for the second thing, once again, lazy-ass companies not fixing their **** on PC is just getting annoying. This game was released 6 years before I write this review. 6 years. And the memory cut scenes with Shelob, for example, STILL don't work. Which means they never will. Do a search anywhere, you'll see just how long this problem has been flagged for. I refuse to believe this would have been that hard a bug to fix. But PC plays second-fiddle to consoles once again. And I struggle to see how that makes sense - PC gaming is far from dead, and is still and incredibly rich source of cash.

I decided to play this game because I watched a lot of Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies. I liked the game very much. Interesting storyline that tells of Talion's struggle with the forces of darkness in the vastness of Mordor. 

Quite interesting character progression with different skills and equipment. Possibility to fly a dragon, take over fortresses, recruit orcs of different classes and abilities, you can arrange orc fights in the fighting pits.

Good graphics for its years. The developers also introduce free DLC, which improves the textures and story clips in 4K.

Cool character voice acting. It was nice to listen to the English voiceover.

Cons:
1. intrusive dialogues that take place with orc captains. It was tiring and annoying more than anything else. At first it was interesting to listen to what the orc was saying and thinking about you, but in the process it starts to get boring. The problem here is that you can't skip these dialogues in any way and have to listen all the time. Maybe I haven't found how to turn it off.
2. After passing the game, it is unclear what happened to Idril next. If the story Baranor tell us in one of the DLC, with Idril is unclear.

In general, I really enjoyed the game and had a desire to pass it 100%. Very sad at the end for Talion and his fate. It took 105 hours (or 47 days) to get through 100% of the game, including the two DLC and all the achievements.",1687692077,1687692077,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Less noticeable on normal difficulty as you can recover most of the time or just replay the mission and be done with it, but when I restarted on high it really became apparent how much the game just screws you and how much you actually fight against the game instead of the enemies.

The Nemesis system is really one of the most radical innovative ideas in modern RPGs and guarantees engaging encounters during gameplay.

Imagine this, you've been stalking an enemy for a while and weakening him piece by piece. You've killed his captains, turned his commanders against him. And when you're about to finish him off...you get ambushed. By one...no, two...no, three powerful enemies and suddenly you're completely outgunned and outmatched. Would you hold a grudge against those collections of pixels and data who derailed your hours of planning and work? That's what the Nemesis system does to you as a player. Turns what would be just another enemy into a memorable character.

Just the other day, I killed a Captain...an Orc who had deathly fear of Morgai flies. But he didn't die. Instead, he returned. A half eaten but still alive corpse who had suffered such extreme PTSD (having been burrowed into by the objects of his biggest fear) that his mind broke. And now he embraced the flies. And preached that dying and rotting was the destiny of all.

Naturally, I killed him again!

But he survived. Once. Twice. A third time. The fourth time I was sure that was the end of poor Lord of The Flies.

Nope. Sure enough, he returned.

So here I am, decapitating an enemy I've killed four times before a fifth time. And I realize, that's exactly how the Orcs feel about ""Gravewalker"", the character we play. They may succeed in killing us once, twice, twenty times. But we always return with a vengeance. And that must give them sleepless nights.

At this point, I don't know if I'll see Lord of The Flies again...but I hope I do. I have...sort of...gotten attached to this enemy Orc who keeps coming back as a familiar face, more deranged each time.

As for the gameplay, well, you have your basic talion things, all in all the fighting is as to be expected. It is not hard, as most fights come down to reflexes, and pushing the right buttons that appear on the screen. But the AI is one of the most predictably annoying things there is:
while unlocking some skill, you will have e.g. the freeze ability. If an enemy is frozen, you can attacking him with high frequency and finish with a huge swing. During your attack, every orc around you will charge you and start attacking you -> you either stop attacking the frozen enemy and counter others or you get hit and staggered and stop attacking. This will happen multiple times as long as other orcs are around you. Same goes for taking over orcs, the enemy ai always tries to interrupt you no matter what.

This is also best played with mouse and keyboard. Most of the default key settings fit, but aiming with a controller (as you have to shoot with your bow quite often) is as expected very annoying and slow.

The worst part of this game by far is the story. I'm sure most people aren't even playing this game for the story and I don't blame them - it's total trash. There is not a single well-developed character or plot point throughout the entirety of what I have seen, with the only possible exception being the questline with the Mother Nature character. The Gondorians are very underwhelming, having no proper development, but still acting as if they are the most important characters in the game. Throughout their questline, the main character essentially spends half the time standing off to the side. Shelob is also meant to be an important character, but she purely exists to serve as a plot device and might as well not even be in the game at all. The questline with the female elf features her constantly degrading and talking down to the main character, even though she does little to contribute to the story, herself. All of this is combined with a general lack of direction - the main story is supposed to be about the main character taking down Sauron, and yet every quest feels like a sidequest, with little coherent focus on that primary objective. The best writing this game has to offer unironically comes from an orc who returns from the first game and has some genuinely enjoyable banter with the main character. However, the fact that this comic relief character has the best writing in the game just emphasizes how bad all of the serious writing is. I've heard that this game doesn't even have a good ending and I'm finding it difficult to motivate myself to see it all the way through.

However, like I said, this game does have some genuinely great elements to it - more specifically, the gameplay. Basic combat is similar to that of the ""Batman: Arkham"" games, but it works very well here. Aside from the game's auto-targeting sometimes causing you to attack the wrong enemy, combat feels very fluid and provides just enough challenge to keep you engaged. There are multiple ways to mix up your playstyle if you want, you can seamlessly transition back and forth between stealth and combat, and there are many ways to incorporate parkour and ranged attacks into your gameplay.  Furthermore, I think most people can agree that the main selling point of this game are the orcs and the conquest systems. It really is a lot of fun dominating orc captains, building your army, sabotaging enemy warchiefs, and slowly taking over regions of Mordor one at a time. Sometimes things go well and captains can be recruited easily, sometimes things go wrong and you get ambushed or a captain you killed comes back to life. Regardless, the game's ""Nemesis System"" does a good job of rewarding strategic planning while also throwing in some surprises to keep you on your toes.

Ultimately, if you played the first game and just want an excuse to fight and dominate more orcs, this game will definitely deliver. The gameplay is an absolute blast, but I am really fed up with the abysmal level of writing that this game consistently churns out.",1686722686,1686733893,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The power of this game comes from one of the most important aspects of any single-player, or even any game period. Which is the NPCs.

[b]Good -[/b] 
The Nemesis system can and will turn a simple quest into a ""skin of your teeth"" fight when more than one captains show up at the wrong time. This doesn't happen constantly, but is surprising when it does. 
The combat and movement is largely well done.
Castle takeovers are a fun and somewhat customizable for what they are. 
The music fits, not bombastic, but goes well with the atmosphere. 
The graphics are surprisingly good for being a little old.

[b]The Bad -[/b] 
There are a couple parts in the Life-Tree/Balrog questline that are obtuse and frustrating.
Your captains seem to have a slight tendency to betray you, which is fine, but it happens maybe a little too often, especially if they happen to get killed in an arena. 

Its honestly a fun game, that has some funny dialogue in it. Some parts actually have heart. Did not expect that from this game.

There's so much promise - huge open world, the nemesis system where orcs will come back and harass you later is brilliant. All the orcs chanting the name of the boss before you fight, then shrieking ""He's killed Grok the Skewerer!"" after you win, with seemingly endless permutations, is a gift that just keeps on giving. The story is well-woven and original and the voice acting is top-tier. Gameplay is fluid and fun, and gory and gorgeous.

BUT
There's not enough character progression after the midgame. The leveling system basically allows you to craft your character early on, and then you have to sacrifice a perk to take another. I'm happy with my character config, so now leveling up is a waste of time. The item system is decent, but it's not Diablo or Borderlands level of loot. So the story is the only reason to keep playing. It's an open-world game so the story is only a bonus, really - it's not worth grinding for.

The games are clearly intended to tie into Peter Jackson's film trilogy more so than Tolkien's books, as they use very familiar portrayals of certain locations/characters shown in the films.

Despite not being canon, the story serves as a fascinating ""What If"" scenario depicting if [spoiler]Celebrimbor survived as a spirit and launched a war on Sauron.[/spoiler] Most importantly, it feels like a Middle Earth story through the great use of Tolkien lore and source material.

Beyond the story, the Nemesis system elevates the game by turning what would be mundane and repetitive Orc enemies into interesting characters with unique stories. The world reacts to your actions in the game - if you run from battles, install a spy in enemy ranks, kill or recruit certain captains, other captains and even random orcs will comment and discuss these things dynamically in the world. Orcs can ambush you, betray you, cheat death and try to kill you, or your own followers can save you in a critical moment or betray their own warlords.

The game that's so incredibly good that even I, Mr Larson, the man who never replays games even played it again some years later after I initially finished around the release date. 

Obviously what carries this game through and through is the nemesis system and all the games various orcs. When game companies try to market their games as multiple choice and that it is YOUR own unique adventure, it usually just boils down to making a few choices here and there that's scripted, however here in shadow of war you truly make your own unscripted decisions ALL the time. You get your own personal stories and relationships with all these different types of orcs ( except for a few story scripted ones ). You hunt and roam the lands and try to find the best and coolest looking orcs that you like the most. You'll get rivals that manage to kill you and every time you fight them they talk about your latest battles, it is truly a great, living and immersive world. 

The combat is a bit like the Batman games, but I think it is way different enough here though. You truly feel like a god in this game at times, you are EXTREMELY powerful, however the orcs can be extremely powerful as well. You can kill thousands of orcs on your own, however, one single orc can kill you as well if you don't pay attention. I heavily recommend playing this game on BRUTAL difficulty. In this mode you won't meet a lot of bullet sponges ( i guess in this case sword sponges ) and you'll do a lot of damage, but you gotta remember that you can get two hit by a lot of orcs as well, even one hit at times, but you will automatically start with a perk that lets you survive one death, you can upgrade it later to being able to survive twice, however some orcs just say screw you and completely ignore that perk. (It's an in game feature.)



The story is really awesome as well, I have never really been super interested in the lord of the rings universe, I watched the movies as a kid but not much more, but I really think that the lore and world in this game is amazing and interesting. You play as Talion who's binded with an elven spirit, the bright lord who try to claim back Mordor from the dark lord. More then that I won't say but it's a great story which will keep you hooked. I also appreciate that you can get some cutscenes only by getting some collectibles, never have I seen better collectibles. Usually I feel like collectibles in games are always quite useless and are just there to push lore they were too lazy to include in the main story, however I do not think that applies here.

If they were to make another game I'd say there are some issues that they would have to fix. 


1. Online battles are pure jokes. All orcs you're going to fight from other bases or avenging are just going to be max leveled and all of them have been made in a lab (aka made in cheat engine) and you won't be able to best them, all of your orcs are probably just going to die in a battle. 

2. The meta with all orcs is just that you will have to try to make them immune to everything and have them get enraged to everything. I think there's way more interesting stuff that you could use for orcs to make them unique rather then just having them be completely resistant to fire for example even though that orc has NO armor on him and he is just naturally resistant to it which makes no sense.

3. There should be more voices on orcs and more variety. The more you play you will soon realize that there are about... I'd say maybe 15 different types of orcs who all just wear different kinds of armor. It's also extremely immersion breaking when you meet an orc and kill him for example, and then in the next fort you go to you find the exact same orc but under a different name. Same armor, same voice, same build, same everything but just a different voice. They should really add more of a variety factor on it.
 
4. The fact that Nazgul are WAY too easy. Nazgul in this game are supposed to be the controllers of orcs and shown to be extremely powerful in cutscenes and lore. However, when you fight them time literally slows down when you have to counter them, they're a damn joke in actual combat and it sucks because then it becomes this classical thing of actual gameplay being totally different to the cinematics. A random commander orc with a bow who has the right stats is more powerful then the dark lord himself which makes no damn sense and it's quite funny yet sad when you think about it.


All in all though even with those problems I think this is a super great game with a good story, combat, systems and general gameplay. 9/10.",1658514248,1685998333,True,23,0,0.738362252712249756,0,True,False,False

It starts out a little boring, since the only thing to do aside from the main story is killing orcs, but once you reach Act II, the game really picks up, since it allows you to have many interactions with the same orc captains, and form relationships with them.

The combat is fluid and fun enough to keep the typical person entertained through Act I, but it's not really what the core of the game is. The core of the game is the Nemesis System. Basically what the Nemesis System does is that when an enemy kills you, they get more powerful, but more than that, they remember that they killed you. Not to mention that your enemies can occasionally cheat death if you kill them, and they'll remember that you killed them, so they'll come back with a figurative axe to grind and a literal axe in their head. I feel like the best aspects of the Nemesis System could best be demonstrated through stories.

One of my late-game nemeses was Zoruk Runnybowels. Yes, his name referenced his diarrhea, trust me, he was more intimidating than he sounds. He was the bane of my existence throughout Gorgoroth, but eventually I got together a team of 3 of captains that worked for me, and sent them all to murder Zoruk dead. We succeeded! Then he cheated death almost immediately, and went right back to kicking my ass, except now it was personal for him.

He killed me, and that's when I discovered that he had killed me so many times he got promoted to Warchief. I could draw him out in a warchief mission, but instead I continued building my army. I eventually had an army whom's strength I trusted, and we went to capture the fortress. This was where I finally put an end to Zoruk Runnybowels. We captured the first of 4 victory points, guarded by Zoruk, and he began running to protect the next point. I would not allow this.

I shadow-strike pulled him back to me, and we participated in a 1v1 battle. I actually even killed some of the grunts who came to help me, because I felt that would be unfair to Zoruk, and I wanted him to know he lost. In a video game. I felt like I had something to prove to an NPC.

Since we'd already captured the victory point, no grunts came to help Zoruk either, and I managed to bring him down to zero health. He fell on his knee, and I was prepared for the coming QTE to land the finishing blow, when he started giving a speech. I don't recall exactly what he said here, but I'm just gonna say he quoted Thanos and said ""You should have gone for the head."" He got back up, revealing he had the Death Defying trait, and by now he had adapted to most of my different types of attacks, so he kicked my ass.

I tried a second attempt to capture the fortress, and things went similarly at first. We captured the victory point, I got a 1v1 duel with Zoruk, but instead of bringing him down to zero health, once he was broken I grabbed him. Since we were in Gorgoroth, there was a river of lava running right down the streets of the fortress, so I tossed Zoruk into the lava.

I went on to capture the fortress, and finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Zoruk was finally gone... Until he cheated death again, coming back as Zoruk the Flame of War. But that's a story for another day.",1685813953,1685813953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Buy game on Sale (I say $30 bucks max)

[h1]Summary[/h1]
My time with Shadow of war felt like a chore.  It features a highly repetive system that veterans from shadows of mordor, like myself,  hated from the first game.  At the time of writing this review I have pretty much done 100% of the game within 30 hours of gameplay.  I bought this game for $30 bucks so that traslates to $1 for every hour of semi-entertainment.  There is not enough content to buy at $60. DO NOT BUY IT AT $60!!!!!  

[h1]First lets talk about what I enjoyed,[/h1]

- Combat System makes your character look awesome (very assassin creed like)

- Had some cool lore

- The Nemesis System was improved upon from the previous title by adding new traits

- Fort sieges were really fun in the beginning of the game

- The addition of mounted drakes was awesome

- Implementing an online system so you can challenge other player's overlords, avenege 
them from a captain that killed them, and take over forts they own.

- Spoiler: [spoiler] Becoming a Ring Wraith was awesome in my opition. Being able to raise the dead and summon soldier wraiths was fun [/spoiler]

[h1]Now lets look at the many things that made me want to throw my chair out the window,[/h1]

- The targeting is absolute trash, the game defines where you want to go based on where your character is facing (like older assassin creeds) instead of where your character is looking (which made assassin creed origins so great). Many times I found my self doing a stealth attack on the wrong character or jumping off a tall building when I was trying to jump to another.  Parkor on a mount is even worse.  It will climb ANYTHING you walk near.

- if too many normal enemies surround you while fighting, it is very easy to get chain attacked and lose all health before you can do anything.

- It is very hard to form any attachment to any NPC.  Though I really want to,  I find it hard to love any of the characters in this game

- Once you got the combat system down the game was way to easy.  I found my self killing captain in about 20 seconds even if they were a much higher level than me.

- I didn't find pit fights very entertaining.  I just used it to kill off all the captains I did not want to spawn new ones

- Spoiler: [spoiler] Act IV is so lazy you literally go around upgrading you forts and defending them for hours on end with no real objective or story to it.  The game really ends on act 3 which I achieved around hour ten of my game time[/spoiler]

- Spoiler: [spoiler] the game ending was absolutely terrible.  You can tell the developers were in a time crunch and needed to end the series to make sale dates [/spoiler]

- Game was way to short in my opinion.  If you knew what you were doing you could finish missions in a couple of minutes

- Enemy Monologues can range from a few seconds to what feels like hours plus they are unskipable.  It gets worse when you engage more than one captain at a time. Just another way they try to cram there fancy system down the players throats. 

- I felt there was very little customization options in the game settings.

Endless replayable fun in one of the most engaging combat and war sandboxes in perhaps all of gaming. It's a unique experience you can't get from any other game, and there's a reason I've replayed the entire game from start to finish three separate times over the six years it's been released.

And to take this even further, it's also set in the world of The Lord of the Rings, which gives it an added edge in terms of lore and intrigue. While the main story itself is nothing special; it's closer to fan fiction than anything else, the game is self-aware and doesn't waste your time. It knows that the story is just a vehicle to contextualise the game play, and it does this excellently with many surprisingly compelling characters. This game just wouldn't be as fun if it tried to tell a long, serious, cinematic story.

My only criticisms of the game are:
The initially scummy microtransactions WB Games forced into the experience, along with some especially mediocre DLC, Fortunately, the microtransactions have been completely removed, and instead all the benefits you could have gotten from that system are given out with an in-game economy with plentiful currency, so you never feel like you have to grind even on the hardest difficulty.
The game definitely isn't balanced or designed around ""Gravewalker"" or ""Brutal"" levels of difficulty, with enemies often attacking you during animations such as the captain intros or captain ""fleeing/enraged"" cutaways, causing you to immediately take significant damage, and getting one shot by captains in this difficulty isn't unusual. This also happens often; sometimes you could be executing an enemy and another orc is swinging at you during the i-frames of the animation, and you get frame-trapped into taking a hit afterwards.
Gravewalker/Brutal also makes stealth more difficult, making some of the stealth challenges in-game nearly impossible. This clearly wasn't tested.
Enemies can also be bizarrely aggressive sometimes, in ways that can feel inconsistent. Some enemies will unnaturally leap and lock onto Talion from great distances while they're attacking, particularly if they're enraged. This doesn't match their steps, causing them to unnaturally float or leap towards you in a manner that looks janky, unnatural and always catches me off guard. Also, when approaching enemies in stealth, enemies are supposed to be briefly surprised, giving you a chance to perform a stealth attack in this brief reprieve window. For some reason, this just doesn't work if there seems to be an arbitrary number of orcs, like three or more, spotting you simultaneously, causing you to just stumble around like a goof because you can't attack from stealth- which I'm not a huge fan of, and takes some getting used to. 
Sometimes this brief surprise window doesn't happen at all, and the enemy instantly locks onto you with a quick attack that comes out in 0.1–0.2 seconds. This type of hit often gets me the most because even if it can be countered, it's so quick and unexpected that I can't react fast enough.

Overall, Brutal and Gravewalker difficulty are still fun; you just really have to go into it with the perspective that the game is actively not being fair, and you should absolutely not play fair either. This does create a problem where you're encouraged to cheese encounters and only use the absolute strongest methods like Shadow Strike Pull or summoning a Graug, especially when the stakes are high. Playing like this isn't necessarily the most fun, though, so I recommend your first playthrough be on Nemesis difficulty; it's definitely a much better balanced experience with less severe consequences for the game's janky moments.",1685616349,1685616384,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The game itself is very big, you will find yourself playing this for hours upon hours without the story so if you are looking for a game that you can pretty much indefinatly then this is for you as the online part of it is still running and that combined with the nemesis mechanic means you can play this for as along as you want.

This game is best played as it was intended to be played; to abuse the shit out of the Nemesis System.

First and foremost, yes the game is awesome. The combat is flashy and satisfying, the story is mediocre at best but enjoyable enough to have enough bright moments to keep you playing for a solid amount of time, and the Nemesis System gives you infinite replayability so you'll never get bored of the game.

The improvements over Shadow of Mordor are countless. Animations are smoother, the artstyle is arguably better to promote a more lasting effect, there's an overall bigger focus on lasting impact and player expression than the last game could ever manage, and the whole scale is just so much larger than the first one could ever manage.

The DLC is ok. 
Blade of Galadriel is terrible as far as story goes, but it's fun enough to be worthwhile on a heavy sale. 
The Gondorian DLC (can't be bothered to remember the name) is actually pretty fun with a unique take on the gameplay formula, but unfortunately ditches the Nemesis System that makes this game so fun in the first place.

Overall, a solid 9/10 game that has been carried extremely well by a system more games should be allowed to use.",1567966553,1685590145,True,21,2,0.716896116733551025,7,True,False,False

We have to talk about the obvious part though: This game was meant to be filled with microtransactions. Large stretches now feel weird because the microtransactions aren't there anymore. And those part you were supposed to spend money on are now hollow and lifeless.

----------------------------
Edit 1: Now that I've tried a bit more (till Epilogue), I'm 100% sure this was meant to be some sort of MMO(with VERY predatory transactions) but the idea probably got scrapped by the top executives at the last moment and the dev team hurriedly put together something with whatever they had. The best way to play this game, is to not play this game at all! Just spend in-game currency and, viola, you're done. Won't even have to press anything on the controller, game will play it-self for you.

Pros
1) Good performance and stable fps 
2) Lot of tools available to tackle the orcs you can use ranged,stealth,poison,beasts,combat, un dead orcs or mind-control other orcs.
3) The nemesis system gives a orc hierarcy you have to dismantle, and you can mind-control other orcs to essentially play politics used your pawns to assassinate, ambush, spy on other orcs to eventually reach the overlord.

Cons 
1) The game gets exponentially easier with each upgrade so in the beginning and the middles upgrades are more important than orcs so the focus shifts there but once you get them it gets boring.
2) After the story ends i.e after the end of shadow wars, there is not much to do except conquer forts you have already conquered and do repetitive nemesis missions which is boring .

The gameplay is solid with upgrades for each ability and this time you finally get to ride a drake which is a mini dragon. The conquering camps are replaced by conquering Castles which you put a siege on and take your army to fight against the defender and vice versa. You can put spies and minions as well which can help you take over them in a strategic manner. The game finally gives you to fight Balrog but the boss-battle would have been more epic if it was not just defeating him by giving him acupressure. I like how they changed Shelob to a goth lady from a spider and enriched the story with her. After you watch the first ending of the game, you bring Order to Mordor which is very tedious process of conquering and defending the castles over and over again until you finally get the true ending. The DLC is great as you play with minor characters which come in the main story but have their own weapon system and gadgets which make it fun.",1684956550,1684956550,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long version; its the same game, sure the spells have to be unlocked all over again, the story is new and there are more zones.
Its a grindfest
And has a single save slot
Wanna replay the story?
Too bad, all your grinding (and money from when lootboxes was a thing) is gone now.
It feels like shadow of mordor Reforged edition.
Not its own new game.
There are more zones, at the cost of each zone feeling way more shallow. You spend less time in each zone and through that you dont have the same connection as you had with zones in the first game. Or with that zones Uruks.
And (spoiler?) the endgame is a goddamn grind that only grinds down your uruks into nothingness.
The online PVP and Uruk vs Uruk AI fights all feel like they have a 75% chance of killing your uruk permanently with a very low (if you manage to win 10 times in a row) reward.
Oh and people hack, cheat and overall abuse the online elements.
Speaking of the Uruks, they are basically the same as the first game.
Same classes (normal, spear(throwing), spear(shield), crossbows or dual wield).
They come in Slim, Fat and Muscly.
Sure, there are Ologs now.
A single whole new class.
Where are the spellcasters (they exist in game but only in cutscenes and then its a guy with an axe)? uruks using both bow and sword (like talion)? uruks with two-handed weapons with telegraphed attacks that you must dodge or risk being split in half ?
Theres not like there is a limit to what could have been done.
Sure, they have Tribes now.
And that means they have a single ability tied to that.
Sometimes an almost unique dresscode.
Ferals dressed in leather and animal bone, Terror dressed in uruk bone, Mystic dressed in human bone, Outlaw dressed in bone, Slaughter dressed in bone and leather, Machine, Warmonger and Dark dressed in red, silver and black metal respectively. Oh and Marauders, dressed in gold, silk and scavenged human armor.
That it, those are the tribes.
The DLC ones are two of the bone ones, if you cant see which ones it is, i dont blame you (dont buy it)
Tribes dont affect their loyalties, its not easier to have a Feral infiltrate a Feral fort than to have an Undead Cannibal on fire do it.
Might as well have given them one of five hats and given them a unique ability based on that as well.
I remember my nemesis from the first game fondly.
He has immune to bows, swords, flame, poison, got angry from being damaged, regained health while angry, hit in an AOE, hit extra hard,hit extra fast.
Looked like a beast with his black skin, black armor, gargantuan sword and was nicknamed ""the executioner"".
He would have died instantly from a stealth attack.
But wheres the fun in that.
So i imported him to this game (which you cant do any longer???)
And he became Zorg the blue, a bard in golden armor and a lute as his weapon.
Still immune to everything except stealth.
And in the mission they appear you are locked in an arena with never ending spawning enemies.
I couldnt stealth.
Still more memorable than the nazgul endgame fights.
The zones in the game change marginally based on which tribe controls it.
By marginally i mean, if the Machine tribe controls it, there are furnaces scattered around that explode if you shoot them. If the feral tribe controls the same zone, the furnaces are replaced by Caragor cages...
That explode into furballs when you shoot them.
Different object, same effect.
The Machine wont start massive woodworking operations in the forest region, removing the trees.
The Dark and Terror tribes wont have a positive relation with Shelobs Spiders in Cirith ungol.
The Outlaw wont annihilate all other tribes.
The Marauder wont bring in human slaves.
The Slaughter wont remove all animals.
The Feral wont tame Graugs (and use against you)
The Warmonger wont have more troops than everyone else.
Sure, the story is new.
But where are all the people from Nurn? The Outcasts? The people i spent a whole game to save?
Oh its a new city full of people to save?
Led by a girl?
Who has a parent who leads the people?
Let me guess, they are actually mind controled by some evil force.
And the girl gets in trouble.
And Talion has to spend a very long escort mission saving them.
Fantastic.
And do we have to follow gollum around for a bit?
Nice
Torvin shows up?
Perfect
Extra content where we play as Celebrimbor in the past?
Super
Single life extra campaign?
Wicked
I didnt listen for parts of it but i hope they at least wrote a new script for the dialogue.
They didnt even bother to implement a third or fourth Team (there is in game, but you stay the same, you just have to start over).
There is no Saruman Team showing up to fight both you and Sauron for control of a region (which was hinted at in the first game).
No Green Team making an appearance in between the Sauron Red and Celebrimbor Blues.
The DLC has humans but they couldnt be bothered to make a human tribe DLC?
(coulda been fun if they restricted what actions the humans could take (cant really infiltrate a fort or become a warchiefs bodyguard when you arent an orc), making it an actual feat to have humans control a fortress).
Its all new.
But its not what it could have been.
The first game + celebrimbor mode + lord of the hunt are all on their own better than the best mode of Shadow of War.
Go play the first one.
Its the same game.",1684908253,1684908253,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Maybe it's just me but I never really heard too much about this game when it first released and after playing it I have no idea how this game didn't garner the type of attention games like Skyrim, Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed, etc got.

Think [i]Assassin's Creed[/i] movement with a hint of [i]Witcher 3[/i] style combat. Then add in the ability to recruit/build an army and take part in sieges for castles. Also one of the best and most unique enemy systems (its called the [b]Nemesis system[/b], tough to explain but its awesome). Finally, add in an incredible story that feels like they really did keep Tolkien's vision/lore in mind (unlike certain Amazon shows).

I played this game years ago on Xbox and I just picked it up while it was on sale for $5. Possibly the single best deal of all time. The game still holds up 6 years after its release. Super fun gameplay that you can mess around in the open world but also such a compelling story. I had forgotten how the nemesis system creates unique dialogue and enemies depending on your decisions. I mean it really is tough to explain in detail but an example is I killed an orc at the start of the game and waaay later on he shows up to ambush me saying he survived and he's back to avenge his defeat at my hands. I mean how cool is that!? 

I definitely recommend giving this game a shot. It's still worth it at full price if you miss the sale. 

P.S. At the time of writing, it seems like there is still a healthy online player base so you can still take advantage of the online components like Pit Fights and Besieging other players' castles.",1684576544,1684576544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The movement system is arbitrary and unpredictable, doing things that you don't want it to do every single time you try to do something. Believe it or not, binding EVERY SINGLE MOVEMENT ABILITY to ONE KEY is not a good idea. The moment when I realized I had absolutely no desire to continue playing this game was when I was chasing after an orc, holding down the sprint key and rather than sprinting, the game decided that what I really wanted to do was start jumping up a nearby tower. The game tries to automate everything about moving, and in the process, takes away all of your agency. The story just flat out sucks as the characters do what the plot demands of them. They are simply puppets to the great writers in the sky; they have no say in what they decide to do. The decisions are weird and make no sense. The wraith and Talion fight over the same thing without any progression in the argument, simply stating the same benign statements over and over and over again. 
Moving across the terrain is tedious, and you run into 18 different captains moving 1000 meters. Defeat one of the captains? His brother just comes to waste your time. Kill him? He comes back from the freaking dead to come and annoy you once more. This is just one aspect where it wastes your time. Don't forget that every captain you encounter has a 30 second intro speech AND a death speech. These are unskipable, and I could feel my brain cells melting away as they just droned on and on and on and on and on. The combat system was repetitive, tedious, and dull, as you just parried when the little icon popped up and spammed left click until you could do something else. This could last for any amount of time. It was just annoying to deal with. Combine that with the weird texturing, lackluster graphics, and abysmal shading, it was not a pleasant gaming experience. 
The one good thing I can say about this game was the only thing they advertised: the nemesis system, and even that has major flaws, such as RAISING THE FREAKING DEAD.
This game is a masterclass in wasting your time and insulting your intelligence. I could beat it if I really wanted to, but honestly, I just don't care anymore.
I came into this expecting to enjoy it, trying to enjoy it, but it just doesn't care about you, or the IP.

I first found out about this when my dad showed it on steam. He said there was a free demo. I downloaded the demo for this game at the very end of 2019, after the microtransactions were removed. When I started it up, I heard the main menu theme and I thought it was great. The soundtrack is amazing. I didn't even want to play the game yet because I wanted to listen to the music. As soon as I started the demo, I got a rundown of the story by the infamous Bruz the Chopper. He told me what Middle Earth Shadow of War is all about, and what happened in Shadow of Mordor. I never really saw a story like this; a ranger of the Black Gate who died and became possessed by an Elf spirit that helped create the Rings of Power. Neat!
After the cutscene, I jumped into the tutorial in Nurnen, and first dominated an orc commander named Bolg the War Bringer, part of the Warmonger tribe. It reminded me of Bolg from the Hobbit. I had a good feeling about this!

This is when things got really good. I made a new enemy: Grisha Ghul Hunter, he was a green colored feral marksman. Every time he saw me, he let out a screech, or howl, or some sort of scream some of the deranged captains make. Fun little character trait. He was my enemy I loved to hate. One day, I tried out a Power Struggle mission, which is basically when an Orc captain does something to increase their level, such as an animal hunt or fighting another captain. I didn't exactly win, he shot me a few times and I was downed. But it wasn't him that killed me. An orc grunt came up and hit me with his sword. Then he started going on about how his axe was thirsty for more blood despite the fact it was a sword. He was promoted to captain. Amug Blood Axe, a brown colored Slayer part of the Slaughter Tribe. This wasn't good...

I decided to go down to the docks and get my 2nd follower. I started another Power Struggle mission. When I finished, I didn't just make a new follower, I made a new friend! Zunn the Anvil, a tan colored Machine Slayer. I thought he was the best. The way he plowed through everyone! I wanted him in my army. After the mission, Bruz the Chopper came up behind me and told me that I needed a bodyguard. ""Anyone who wants to carve their way across Mordor will need a guard or two! I mean, I don't. Obviously. If there was ever a time when I needed help on the battlefield, I gut me own throat! But you, you should have some extra muscle. No shame in it!"" So I made Zunn my bodyguard. We decided to take a stroll at the burned area near the fort, murdering every orc grunt we see. I've found that a good way to improve your relationship with your followers is to do something like this. Take a stroll and get into fights. Sounds like something orcs would enjoy. Also, you can do power struggle missions that your followers are in to make them like you. The trailers weren’t wrong when they said you can forge friendships.

The time had come for me to get revenge on Amug. I tracked him down and found him in a camp. He said to me, ""Look upon the glory of the Blood Axe! It spoke to me, says it wants to taste your flesh and feel your blood flow!” He was off his rocker. More so than other orcs were. I fought him and his army for a while. I got downed three times. I didn't have any more chances. Another random grunt came up and was about to kill me. Here we go again. As soon as he was about to swing, Zunn the Anvil came up and killed the grunt! Then he said, ""Just doing my duty, boss."" Ah, he was so professional. It was me and him vs. Amug Blood Axe. We were duking it out, but then another Orc captain ambushed me: Grom the Bone Collector, a purple colored Feral (or maybe Marauder?) beastmaster with a (goat?) horns helmet. Then it was a 2v2. Zunn vs Grom and Me vs Amug. Amug won. His level increased.

As soon as I respawned, I decided to send Zunn on a mission to kill Grisha Ghul Hunter while I went to defeat Grom. Grom was at an outpost. I sneak attacked him! We fought for a while until I dominate him and brought him to my side. ""Join the army of the Bright Lord!"" I should mention that you can't recruit every orc you find. They need to be the same level as you or lower. I sent him away and set a waypoint on my map to try and take care of Amug once again. As soon as I exited my map, Grom came back around and ambushed me! He didn't want to be part of my army! We fought again and I tried to dominate him, but it didn't work. He now had an Iron Will, claiming that Sauron guarded his mind. So I shamed him. Then he had a hand mark burned on his face I then set out to fight Amug again. I caught him having a bash in honor of my defeat. In short, we fought. I died. He became epic and a Warchief. Oh, bother...

I was doing more missions, raising my level. Then Zunn was captured! He failed to kill Grisha. I had to save my friend! He was tied to a pole. They branded the eye of Sauron on his forehead. Orc slaves also had that mark. I jumped down from above and started slashing away at the orcs. I cut him free and dominated the captain. After that, Bruz approached me again and said that I can send one of my followers to spy on a warchief... and then I got an idea. It was time for Bolg the War Bringer to come into play. I sent him to the fight pits to become a ""bodyguard"" of Amug Blood Axe. He won the fight and became a spy. This was a great opportunity for me to defeat him more easily. Before I began, I figured that follower orcs can die just as easily as enemy captains. I was afraid of losing Zunn on my quest for vengeance, so I decided to take another orc captain for now. I was ready. I was going to finally SLAUGHTER Amug Blood Axe.

It was nighttime. Warchief missions involve you doing a task to draw out a fortress' warchief, such as destroying their grog supply or killing their men. I had to go to a pit at the 2nd level of the fort, where the door of the keep was, to spring a trap. I jumped around from building to building, dominating any orc grunt I came across. I even jumped down and dominated an orc on the ground without anyone noticing. That was fun. I finally made my way to the pit and sprung Amug's trap. He appeared from the right side of the keep. I heard orcs chanting in the background, ""Amug, Amug, Amug!"" The Blood Axe was guarded by two other captains; Grom the Bone Collector, and Bolg the War Bringer... well... at least until Bolg yelled, ""For the Bright lord!"", and stabbed Amug in the back. I ran up to assist him and decided to fight Grom. We fought each other for a bit, and then I decided to summon my bodyguard. As soon as I pressed 2, I heard, ""HEY!"" I was being ambushed by his Identical Blood Brother! I tried to roll out of the way of the fight, and summoned him again. He showed up and BETRAYED me, probably because he wanted to help his blood brother. As soon as that happened, Amug killed Bolg the War Bringer! Oh boy... I decided to blow a big stack of grog and set everyone on fire while I tried to make my getaway. I should've known this earlier, but Grom the Bone Collector was MORTALLY FLAMMABLE. The fire from the explosion killed him quickly. One less captain to worry about. I climbed up one of the towers in the wall so I could recover. Amug followed me up. Here we were... here we would end this for good. We dueled on the tower and I beat him. He went down on his knees and said,"" Can I at least say goodbye to the Blood Axe? Goodbye, Blood Axe!"" Then I finished him. I don't remember exactly how he was executed, but I did it, and ended our rivalry.

The nemesis system is able to make cool stories like that when you play this game. It would be cool if they had more games like this. I can see a Transformers game with the nemesis system being really fun. You might enjoy this as much as I enjoyed the demo. The rest of the story isn't the best in my opinion, but that may not matter too much.",1595690551,1684201083,True,0,2,0,0,True,False,False

The combat is fluid and varied allowing you to play in multiple different ways, the areas are beautiful and the nemesis system is fantastically fun.

Then you get flooded with the extra systems, online revenge missions, send your orcs to fight online, buy upgrades for your orcs, open loot boxes. The game has a grind to it as well, it feels daunting to get to a new area and get a start in it and killing orcs captains and war chiefs can become a chore. The game itself is great (mostly thanks to the combat) but it has too many systems in the game to prolong the games playtime. I would still recommend this game, especially when on sale.

This just feels like they took the final act of the first game and just copy pasted it four or five times on different maps. Combat is either a joke and you can just button mash or sprint past the encounters or it's a string of bullshit that one shots you while being immune to 90% of your arsenal. Controls are sloppy and suffer from the ""Only so many buttons on a controller"" problem. The space bar alone is bound to about 17 different functions (each listed individually in the binding menu) but try to rebind a single function to a different key to make it easier to dodge instead of vaulting? Nope. You must rebind the whole block to the same key.

The ""build an army"" aspect just feels like it was designed to waste your time. Every new map you enter you have to build a new army and capture new forts. But assigned captains can and, orcs being orcs, will betray you leaving a large hole in your army that you have to go find another captain to plug it. It's like if during the Elite Four in Pokemon part of your team would just.. run the hell off and you'd have to scavenge a replacement in some grass somewhere.

Speaking of wasting time the orc intros.. uff da the orc intros. Every orc captain you encounter has an intro and in some cases you can encounter upwards of 4 in a single mission. Some of them are rather quick taking only 10 or so seconds but others? Damn orcs are monologuing entire novels at you. There's no way to skip them either so I sure hope you like hearing about how some orc became a living hive of maggots and how he's going to pass their ""wriggling warmth"" on to you.",1684179651,1684179651,False,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0,True,False,False

Building upon its predecessor, Shadow of Mordor, this game takes the open-world action-adventure genre to new heights with its gripping story line, immersive game play mechanics, and breathtaking visuals.
One of the standout features of Shadow of War is its captivating narrative. Set in the expansive world of Middle-earth, the game puts you in the shoes of Talion, a ranger resurrected by a powerful Elven spirit. The story takes you on a thrilling journey as you forge alliances, battle hordes of orcs, and confront the formidable forces of Sauron. The writing is masterful, staying true to Tolkien's lore while offering an original and engrossing tale of its own.
The game play mechanics in Shadow of War are a sheer delight. The Nemesis System, which was introduced in Shadow of Mordor, has been expanded and improved upon, offering a dynamic and personalised experience. Each encounter with an orc captain or warlord feels unique, as they remember past encounters and evolve based on your interactions. The ability to recruit orcs to your cause, train them, and form your own army adds a layer of strategy to the game, making each conquest a tactical endeavour.
Combat in Shadow of War is fluid, brutal, and immensely satisfying. Talion's move set has been expanded, offering a wide array of acrobatic maneuvers, stealth take-downs, and devastating combos. The inclusion of powerful, wraith-like abilities further enhances the combat experience. Whether you prefer the finesse of stealth kills or the adrenaline of engaging in intense battles, the game caters to various play styles.
Visually, Shadow of War is a marvel. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and animations is remarkable. Exploring the vast regions of Mordor and other iconic locations from Middle-earth feels immersive and visually stunning. The game's lighting effects and atmospheric soundtrack further enhance the overall ambience, making it feel like you're truly part of this epic world.
I also want to commend the developers for their continuous support and improvement of the game. They have listened to the community's feedback and made meaningful updates, including the removal of controversial micro transactions, to ensure a more balanced and enjoyable experience.
In conclusion, Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™ is an absolute must-play for fans of the Lord of the Rings franchise and anyone who appreciates a well-crafted open-world adventure. With its enthralling story line, engaging game play mechanics, and breathtaking visuals, it's an experience that will keep you hooked from start to finish. Prepare to embark on an epic journey through Middle-earth like never before.",1684053224,1684053224,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My understanding was that there was an eventual reversal on the micro-transactions, but the core problems still remain. What was fun in the previous game has been made tedious, boring, repetitive. It's ok for the first few hours, but gets old quickly.

One of the worst parts is the gear score creep. You keep getting new weapons that the game tells you are ""better"", but they're decidedly not. +1 or +2 to the number on your currently equipped gear literally doesn't make a difference to how quickly you kill orcs. The only thing that matters is the ability tied to the equipment.

To add to this, the story is pretty bland. Where they first game fitted into lore pretty well, I'm left wondering why Tallion is even still here, and why they're shoehorning more characters from the series into the game.

Tolkien's Middle-earth. Developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, the game is a sequel to 2014's Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and was released in October 2017.

The game's story follows the adventures of Talion, a ranger of Gondor who has been possessed by the spirit of the elf lord Celebrimbor. Together, they seek to create a new Ring of Power to defeat the dark lord Sauron and his armies of orcs. Throughout the game, players must engage in battles with orcs, explore the vast open-world environments, and build an army of followers to help them conquer the enemy.

One of the standout features of Shadow of War is the Nemesis System, which is an advanced artificial intelligence system that creates unique enemies and allies for each player. This system allows players to build relationships with various characters and witness the consequences of their actions. The game also features an enhanced combat system that allows for more varied and dynamic combat sequences.

In terms of graphics and sound, Shadow of War does not disappoint. The game's environments are beautifully rendered, and the character animations are smooth and fluid. The soundtrack is also excellent, featuring a mix of original compositions and classic themes from the Lord of the Rings films.

However, the game is not without its flaws. Some players have criticized the game's inclusion of microtransactions, which allow players to purchase in-game currency with real money. Additionally, the game's story has been criticized for being too convoluted and for straying too far from Tolkien's original work.

Overall, Middle Earth: Shadow of War is an exciting and immersive game that will appeal to fans of the Lord of the Rings franchise and action-adventure games. Its advanced AI system and enhanced combat mechanics make for a unique and engaging experience, although its microtransactions and story may not be to everyone's liking.",1683952967,1683952967,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

• It's zones open world (which is better than open world since you get more variety in scenery similar how it's done in metro exodus).
• Combat and movement feels very good and satisfying, it's very close to Assasin's Creed but done way better.
• Nemesis system is just ( ˘ ³˘).
• There is insane amount of strategy involved (i would say even more than some strategy games have...).
• It took me literally 16h to complete tutorial
• 4 Years ago they got rid of the microtransactions so there is no p2w anymore👍.
• I have no clue about story since i skipped everything (not my type of settling).
• Kinda lame that if you wear a skin ""Eltariel"", the armor doesn't change with newer items, but only colour does.
• Online conquest is just a cherry on top.

LotR fans will no doubt be a little disappointed in the story but thats such a small part of the experience, it doesn't matter.

You've played the Shadow games before--be it in the form of Mad Max, the Batman Arkham games, etc, as its combat system is Rocksteady's highly recognizable freeflow system put into the context of a Tolkien character. the brilliance of the shadow games is the consequences of its combat. where in other games, the consequences of combat are story advancement, XP, and fun, Shadow adds on to that a unique story-generation aspect. Orcs will remember being defeated by you as well how, they each have a dynamic personality that effects them in combat but can also evolve over multiple bouts with the player, adapting to their strategies, developing new strengths, etc.

Graphically, its in the middle: Shadow Of War looks fine, great at times, but fails to really sell you on the believability of its worlds. they're too big to memorize but not big enough to provide meaningful exploration. the result is a world that you just pass through and pay no attention to, despite the world and lore of Middle Earth being super cool and interesting.

Characters, like the story, are weak. Theres little reason to not just skip most cutscenes and get back to the game, but the voice acting is universally good.

for 5 bucks as it is now, the shadow games, War in particular are a no brainer, you'll no doubt get more than five dollars of enjoyment out of these games, regardless of your connection to the series of books and films, but 50 bucks as it is normally is a bit of an ask, especially for games as old as these.

Terrible Batman Arkham style combat
button prompts for dodging often fail to read inputs or show at the correct time
Laughably boring, generic story and characters
Enemies at high levels are often immune to almost everything, so they can take over half an hour to beat in some cases

The online conquest component is almost fun. If not for the aforementioned awful combat, as well as there only being one format of siege, so each one plays out exactly the same. High level fortresses are also the exclusive domain of cheaters who hack in literally unbeatable orcs with custom traits

Also don't expect any interesting orcs. The cool ones are handmade and can't be captured. The rare occasion that a randomly generated orc that you want shows up the game detects it and goes out of its way to deny you. Five times I saw an orc I actually wanted, and each time the game suddenly threw an ambush or something similar that not only prevented me from getting them, but which also seemed perfectly calculated to kill them as quickly as possible before I could make a move.

Oh, and about 2/3rds of this game is just waiting for orcs to shut up. Every single time you meet a named orc he has a long intro (sometimes 2), which he just has to get out of the way (you cant skip them). And if you see an orc you like, they dont do anything once you bring them to your side, all they have is their intro after which they are entirely devoid of any kind of personality whatsoever.

To further illustrate how much time you will spend waiting for orcs to finish monologuing:
In online conquest, you get gold rating by finishing within 7 minutes. If the clock goes down by 4 minutes by the time you finish, you will have spent over 20 minutes of real time. This is because the clock pauses during orc monologues. For 4 minutes of gameplay you will have needed to sit through 16 minutes of orcs strutting about and boasting about how they'll kill you. And each and every one of these forgettable orcs will be dead by the end of it. This game is a massive waste of time.",1683712908,1683713858,False,46,13,0.493953555822372437,0,True,False,False

The mounted combat feels a lot better since the caragors no longer prioritize climbing on every single wall that you pass. The biggest one being, that you run an entire fortress and decide how you want to take them down.

There are fight pits where you can watch orcs fight one another and it makes for an amazing drinking game on who's gonna win. If you happen to lose one of your beloved followers in the fight pit, simply dominate the captain that killed yours and keep it rolling!

The story and world feel a lot better designed, especially the perk tree since you have a lot more options on how you want to play.

While I haven't finished this game, I'll still leave a review based on the time I spent on Shadow of Mordor and the time I've spent on this game. I'd hoped that this game was a somewhat improvement on Shadow of Mordor, but at best it's simply the same game with some added features. The game is very janky, especially the movement and targeting. Over time you get extremely frustrated by how Talion either skips across wast distances, or simply flops down on the ground directly below you even though there's something to jump at within reasonable distance. At the same time you get annoyed by how executions, drain/interrogation or grab targets enemies. The nemesis system is a great idea, but seems terribly executed if you ask me. Not to mention you get extremely tired by listening to the same cutscenes of captains introducing themselves, or your nemesis ambushing you at the worst times. The game loves to make you spend lots of time in non-skippable monologues about how these captains are going to kill/betray/take revenge upon you. How hard would it have been to add a option to skip previously seen/heard monologues? The developers seem to have intentionally made the choices that are annoying to the player. The game isn't really that hard, but you're likely going to die or get knocked down several times by bullshit that is out of your control. The difficulties are extremely superficial, simply giving enemies more health, making them more aggressive or giving captains more resistances to your attacks. It simply emphasises the problem of the game being repetetive.

I thought that the GTA games had poor sprint mechanics, but this game has a worse sprint. Not to mention that it does not feel like the sprint affects much in terms of speed, unless you're sneaking and even then it's still slow. The sprint boost you can get when vaulting/landing gives a significant boost, but you get bored by having to press a button to activate it. What I wouldn't give to have a skill upgrade that simply auto-activated it for me, whenever it was relevant.

The online mechanics that have been added to this game (which wasn't in Shadow of Mordor) are a fun feature the first few times you try any of them out, but become extremely repetetive over time. Now I'm playing this almost 6 years after launch, but some of the online conquests I've tried have been extremely unbalanced, to the point that the captains in their fortress is 30-40 levels above my level. Which means that I get almost one-shotted by their captains, while mine are severely underpowered in comparison.

If you've never played Shadow of Mordor, then this game might be a slightly more interesting version of that game. If you've played Shadow of Mordor and were extremely tired by it at the end of that game, then you're likely going to be feeling the same things I've written above within a short while of playing this. It is definitely not worth the full price, but at a sale and without any better games to play it can be an OK time sink. The gameloop is quite repetetive, but if that's your cup of tea, then go ahead, I won't judge you. I'd rather recommend getting one of the earlier Assasins Creed games or even MGSV The Phantom Pain. The game simply feels like an unpolished version of those games set in the LOTR universe. If it wasn't set in the LOTR universe it would probably not even be a somewhat notable game.",1683329890,1683329890,False,5,1,0.479463875293731689,0,True,False,False

Performance was great, after I realised that the dynamic resolution setting was making the game look like mud. After that, everything on Ultra and it ran smooth as. No noticeable dips in framerate. Graphically, it's showing its age a bit, but that's never my main reason for playing a game anyway. 

I had a bit of a love/hate relationship with this game. I'll go over the good, then the bad, and my final take on it.

The combat was very enjoyable and cathartic. Talion's abilities and skills were all very enjoyable. I'm always the stealth guy if I can help it, and indeed for most of the game that was my play style, though the times that I couldn't stealth, I still had plenty of other skills to use when swords had to clash. Having Celebrimbor along for the ride also gave you a ton of very flashy and powerful moves that were just a delight to use. 

I was very interested in all the lore hidden behind collectables. The LOTR world we all know was very much alive in this game. I'm no die-hard fan of LOTR, but from what I know of the series, it felt 'right'.

The story was good for the most part, if not predictable. What became of our Talion left a bit of a disappointed feeling in me, however.

Now, the whole fort/captain system in this game HAS some enjoyable elements to it. It takes a lot of work to convert a whole army of captains to take a fort, and then defend it. But once you've converted the entire map to your side, it feels good. But the frustration comes from the nemesis system, in particular when you get paired off fighting an orc that isn't only immune to fire, poison, arrows, executions and stealth, but also who regains full health after you somehow manage to get him to low health. Who also has a no last chance perk. Who dodges all of your attacks, or blocks them with a shield. In the middle of a seige, surrounded by other captains and grunts all trying to kill you. Individually, these immunities are easily worked around. Even with a few of these immunities, you still have enough of an arsenal to defeat your foe. But sometimes it really just feels like it was too punishing, and I was only playing on normal difficulty. It's particularly bad when you lose a fort because of one such enemy, and hours of your play time goes up in smoke. I shudder to think what the harder difficulties were like. So having taken forts, then having lost those forts, then taking them again...it all became rather repetitive, dull and frustrating. I really didn't enjoy the system by the end of the game, and after I had completed the final fort defense, I was so glad to be done with it. 

The DLC that focused on Eltariel was pretty average. It didn't really add anything meaningful to the game, and more often than not, I came across enemies that were immune to light; the core of Eltariel's move set. Again, the nemesis system felt over-tuned.

The DLC that focused on the other fellow....his name escapes me right now. But this DLC was far more interesting. Different moves, fighting styles and abilities, not to mention new gadgets and an interesting spin on the captain system all made for a much more enjoyable couple of hours.

So, looking back and summing up, there was enjoyment to be had, but my experience was ultimately soured by a disappointing story outcome and an overly punishing nemesis system. My recommendation is, if you're a fan of LOTR, give it a go, but maybe try it on easy.",1683116440,1683116440,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With improved mechanics and features that build upon its predecessor, Shadow of War delivers a fantastic experience that is both rewarding and enjoyable.

One of the most significant improvements in Shadow of War is the Nemesis System. This feature allows players to create and develop their army of followers, each with their unique strengths and weaknesses. The Nemesis System also introduces new enemies, including Orc Captains, who will remember and react to the player's actions throughout the game. This system adds an extra layer of depth and strategy to the gameplay, making every decision and action feel significant.

The combat in Shadow of War is also exceptional, with a wide variety of weapons, skills, and abilities to choose from. The game offers a range of different playstyles, from stealthy assassinations to all-out brawls. The ability to customize your gear and skill tree further enhances the gameplay experience, providing a sense of personalization that allows players to tailor their playstyle to their preferences.

The open-world of Middle Earth in Shadow of War is stunning, with breathtaking vistas, intricate dungeons, and a variety of landscapes to explore. The game's fast travel system and mount mechanics make it easy to traverse the world, making each area feel connected and part of a cohesive whole.

Darger spent the majority of his life writing and illustrating In the Realms of the Unreal, over 15 thousand pages of literature describing a massive conflagration between two diametrically opposed forces. Good is entirely good, evil is purely wicked - there is no ambiguity. The epic details chapters of this all-encompassing struggle with breathtaking heroism and unspeakable savagery, which only really ended because the author was dying of old age.

That is the reference that comes to mind most when playing Shadow of War. You are Talion, a ranger who, by all biological metrics, is very dead, but has bonded with elf wraith Celebrimbor to fight Sauron in the big baddie's quest to corrupt all of Middle-earth. The means to do this is a ring macguffin that will convert orcs fighting under Sauron's flag to yours. Yadda yadda.

You stealth and hack-and-slash through rather open strongholds leading to a fortress controlled by a hierarchy of orcs - outlined in this game's signature (and, like... patented??) Nemesis system. You can slay captains or convert them to your side. Each captain is named and titled, giving you a shortform biography of what ugliness they got up to before you got there. It may not be super deep, but it is effective in producing what feels like a land with history and activity - there are things going on without you. They also ""remember"" their last encounters with you - if you fled, if they retreated, if you failed to kill them. And by your undead nature, I feel the game wants you to treat your own death as part of an ongoing narrative. Orcs level up when they kill you. There exists a story where a lowly grunt takes on a name and title after clubbing your skull in, then moves up the orc corporate ladder.

You are given/can unlock many tools in stealth and combat and there are many possible ways to encounter orcs. These orcs are, like, busy. There are encounters - duels, camp raids, caragor hunts - that you can ambush, and those not involved wander in zones around the map. Only a select number of orcs - the Overlord, the Warchiefs, the Outpost Leaders - are really siloed, hiding behind walls of gameplay significance.

Depending on your view, the process of picking off orcs with sword, bow, or dagger, converting some to your side, leveling them by sending them on missions (or buying levels outright like the industrialist you are), and leading your army to a big setpiece confrontation with the Overlord might be very repetitive. A Strong Story this game... really does not have. It's big bad Sauron, all hope being lost, and timely intervention to rescue mankind from desolation. However, the game can also be a platform for your own story and experimentation.

I can understand why someone might play this game for hundreds of hours, and it's based on these horrible, ugly, petty orcs. Every orc presents the chance for a mini-epic to play out over hours. I was killed by an orc, he leveled up, I challenged him again, he taunted me for my lack of skill, he killed me again, he became a Warchief, I challenged him again, and he gave me one last insult for how long this took before I cleaved his head off. Thus ends the saga of Dush the Uncatchable. And that's one saga in a potentially never-ending story between you and these orcs, separate from the game lore entirely. Add in loot mechanics and instanced online play and you get a great bad case of the 'to-do's' - always something to collect, always something to level, always something to grind, always something to challenge.

Thus, I return to Darger. I won't claim to understand what in someone's imagination could continue to inspire until the longest manuscript in the English language was produced, but the feelings of it are in this game for me. Conflict never ends, there is always something bigger and nastier around the corner, always some insurmountable foe to... surmount. But I am a person who derives hours of entertainment checking the pockets and corners of games like Bioshock, Fallout 3, and Prey for my own personal narrative content outside of the Big Story. What that impulse is for environment in those games, it's more for character in Shadow of War. And that may not be appealing to some at all. But, I've got a sick orc named Ukbuk the Scorpion and I'm going to make him Overlord.",1681186019,1682477414,True,65,2,0.819071352481842041,5,True,False,False

The game transports you to the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, where you play as Talion, a Ranger of Gondor who is possessed by the spirit of Celebrimbor, the Elf Lord who forged the Rings of Power.

One of the standout features of this game is the Nemesis System, which creates a dynamic and unpredictable environment where your actions have consequences. This system allows for unique and memorable encounters with the game's various orc enemies, who have their own distinct personalities, strengths, and weaknesses. The orcs remember your previous battles with them, and can even rise through the ranks to become powerful captains and warlords who will challenge you in epic battles.

The combat in Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™ is also fantastic, with a variety of different moves, abilities, and weapons to use against your enemies. The game's open-world design also allows for plenty of exploration and side missions, which adds to the overall experience and makes the game feel even more expansive.

Overall, Middle-earth™: Shadow of War™ is a must-play for fans of the Tolkien universe and action RPGs. The Nemesis System is a game-changer, providing endless hours of gameplay and making each playthrough feel unique. The game's combat is satisfying and the world is rich with lore and detail.

Starting off with the graphics, this game looks so damn beautiful it's almost illegal. The world is like a painting, the details in the scenery and the atmosphere give the feeling of a living dead world which I love. This also shows a lot in the orcs you find and gear. The detail on the armor and swords really shows from the menu to when you impale an uruk's head with it.

The story continues where the last game left off. To fight Sauron's forces, Celebrimbor and Talion forge a New Ring, powerful and uncorrupted by Sauron. Unfortunately, Celebrimbor becomes prisoner of Shelob, the giant spider who's impressively hot. She offers Talion a choice. Give her the ring and get Celebrimbor back, or let fate finally slit his throat and die. He chooses to save the wraith, and now the ring is with Shelob. Then the first act begins and I have to say it doesn't disappoint. We eventually go to Minas Tirith to find the Palantir, finally seeing human faces in this desolate world and the direction the game takes from there is pretty good. I'm not gonna tell much, but believe me, the story is good. I love how they introduced Shelob in a natural way, she works great in the story of the game, kinda like a Chaotic Neutral character, she also plays a very important role in the game as she gives Talion visions of the future and because they actually made a giant spider the most attractive figure in the game. That's impressive. The characters are well-made and they make the experience all so much better, specially late-game Talion. He is one hell of a badass.

Gameplay has hugely improved from the last game. They made travelling and moving way easier with double jumping, fast climbing, combat is now way more fun and polished, and with the new gear system you can make some pretty cool sets that allow for crazy playstyles. The upgrade system has been completely reworked with new skill trees and more focus on sets of skills rather than just being strong as hell. Now you can buy a lot of different skills, which can contain 2-3 upgrades you can buy, but can only use one upgrade at a time. This is interesting because you can choose what playstyle you want and adapt more to the enemies and interact better with the Nemesis system, specially during the later parts of the game. Oh, did I mention you can ride a dragon?

But the real deal is in the Nemesis system. Back in Shadow of Mordor, all you could do was dominate some orcs, control their positions and make them fight. But here, there is a whole new depth to it. First of all, every orc is its own character. They all have unique things about them that make them stand out, instead of being just regular goons that you can either control or kill. They all have specific strenghts, attributes and weaknesses that you can explore. You can exploit their fears to take them down more easily, or focus on their strengths when they become your ally to make them stronger. And that's the beauty of the Nemesis system, the fact that it creates narratives outside of the main campaign. There's a guy on YT that made a video talking about it more extensively, but the Nemesis system creates stories. It gives you narratives outside of the main campaign, and since orcs are always being made, you will never run out of characters to give you fun and varied experiences. You can have a slave orc kill you so he becomes a respected unit in their region, dominate him, and with proper training, turn him into a Legendary Overlord that can firmly protect your fort. You could find an orc that just refuses to die, so everytime you meet he just becomes stronger and crazier than the last time. You can have one of your own Orcs betray you because you accidentaly killed his blood brother and have a whole turn of events during a mission because he chose to ambush you when you least expected. There is always a new orc to see, a fresh story to live, and new experiences to be had. It's honestly mesmerizing.

The DLCs are great, and I really wanna talk about them but I'm gonna do that in the DLC's steam page, so if you wanna know about Blade of Galadriel and Desolation of Mordor, go there.

I really love Shadow of War, if you're looking for an engaging open world experience with great combat, beautiful visuals and fun, fresh experiences with your enemies, you're looking at the perfect game.",1610823537,1681772151,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

+ good graphic (for its time)
+ fun to play
+ make your army of orc and conquer the middle earth 
+ can ride a dragon
+ enchanting equipment costumization
+ variation of skill to unlock and choose
+ epic final boss fight

cons:
- most of the scene using FMV not in game graphic
- not-so-good-enough stroryline, the prequel is better
- almost nothing new to the variation of skill, yes there is a new one but you can't use it to all-active at the same time (only 1 subskill allowed to active ) such a waste of potential.
- the true ending is very grindy and took some time to obtain.

From the moment you step into this world, you'll be transported to a place of awe-inspiring beauty and darkness. The game's graphics are truly stunning, with landscapes that are both vast and detailed, and a sense of atmosphere that is palpable. Every detail, from the way the light filters through the trees to the sound of the wind as it whips through the ruins, is crafted with care and attention to detail.

But Shadow of War is not just a feast for the eyes. The game's combat system is a thing of beauty, allowing you to unleash devastating attacks, dodge enemy strikes, and engage in epic battles against foes both great and small. You'll need to master a range of weapons, skills, and abilities to take on the game's many challenges, from brutal orc warlords to massive trolls and other supernatural creatures.

What truly sets Shadow of War apart, however, is its emphasis on strategy and conquest. You'll need to build your own army, recruit powerful allies, and take on the forces of darkness in a battle for supremacy. The game's Nemesis System, which allows you to interact with and influence the behavior of enemy characters, is one of the most innovative and thrilling features in any game to date.

As you journey deeper into the heart of Middle-Earth, you'll be accompanied by a cast of memorable characters, each with their own unique personalities and motivations. Whether you're forging alliances, exploring ruins, or taking on massive fortresses, there's never a dull moment in this epic adventure.

In conclusion, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War is a game that deserves a place among the greats. It's a triumph of storytelling, world-building, and gameplay, and a worthy successor to the legendary Lord of the Rings franchise. So don your armor, sharpen your blades, and embark on a journey that will take you to the very edge of the known world - for Middle-Earth awaits!",1672478383,1681218618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Couldn't shoot or pin him to get damage in or even interrupt his healing. Waves of adds wouldn't let get damage in on the rare occasions my weapon would light him on fire. I was grinding him down with executions and getting used to the timing on the adds that would sprint in, but then he adapted to executions. He didn't have anything he was afraid of, at all. My summoned minions wouldn't appear in the throne room. And he'd kneel down to heal every 30 seconds. And even if I interrupted him almost immediately, he'd still get about as much health back as I was dealing to him. I was even getting good at timing my efl-shot refills to take out adds and heal between his heals. But I just COULDN'T F_____ING DAMAGE HIM! And after half an hour of fighting him and him healing, I made enough mistakes that he killed me and the fortress invasion failed.
And that was after I had assassinated all of his fortress commanders over a four hour period. F___ this game. Maybe there’s some obscure mechanic I could have taken advantage of to consistently damage him. But I was down to perfect counters, getting a single attack in after rolling away from his uncounterable attacks, and trying to get off brutalizations without getting interrupted on the rare occasion I dazed him.
And you know what, that would have been enough if HE DIDN’T HEAL HIMSELF EVERY 30 SECONDS. HELL I COULD HAVE DEALT WITH THAT IF THE GAME WOULD LET ME SOLO HIM, BUT NO, A GROUP OF SEVEN MASOCHISTIC SHIT-WHITS KEPT DEMANDING HEADSHOTS EVERY 15 SECONDS.
I get that I’m fighting an entire army, but even armies have limits. Let me kill ALL THE ORCS. I promise you I can! After taking out 50-100 in the same area, JUST STOP SPAWNING THEM! They’re not a challenge, it’s no longer immersive, they’re just an annoyance that keeps my from soloing bosses. And I should be able to earn that solo if I kill enough of them. So, put spawn caps on areas that refresh when the area gets reloaded. Allow me to completely genocide a camp of orcs. That would feel so good! But no, they have to spawn infinitely. 
Also, I like the nemesis system, I really do, but does the game really need to completely stop and let every, single captain get in a 20 second monologue before I can shoot them in the forehead with an arrow? Is Tallion really that polite? I wouldn’t be if orcs killed my family! I’d be fine with it, but he also has to let them have last words before he cuts their heads off. Even that would be tolerable, but when I set up a warchief to be betrayed by his henchmen which I’ve converted, and then stop to let him shit-talk be, and then have to wait for the betrayal animation to play out, and then get ambushed myself, F___ING TWICE, by legenday orcs whom I’ve already killed -- one of them twice already in the same playthrough -- and I STILL F___ING HAVE TO LISTEN TO EACH OF THEM INTRODUCE THEMSELVES BEFORE I CAN KILL THE HALF-DEAD BASTARD JUST TO THE LEFT… That’s a bit much. That was 7 unskippable cutscenes in the middle of the same fight. (two for each captain I killed, and yes, I’m counting the betrayal animation).
I won that, by the way. Handily. I’m good at this game, when it doesn't MAKE ORCS IMMUNE TO F___ING EVERYTHING!
I wanted to like this game. I really did. But all if gave me to attach to was the combat and the nemesis system. The story is dogwater. Shelob arbitrarily being a hot woman is nonsense (should have been an eldritch horror, Tolkine hated him some spiders, but no, dev want boobies). The actual boss fights are boring or stupid (I also have issues with the ring wraith mechanics, but I’m not going to go there…) The core of the nemesis system is great, but we desperately need to be able to skip the captain introductions (At least give us a perk we can unlock that lets us Renegade Interrupt them mid monologue.), and certain combinations of abilities and resistances on the orcs are bullshit. At the very least, they healing mechanic needs a limit. Like, they can only do it 2-3 times in a single fight. If that was the only change that was made to this game, I wouldn’t be writing a thesis dunking on it. But that fight was a step too far for me. Instant uninstall.
And I never even interacted with the pseudo-multiplayer take over actual player’s fortresses shit. Maybe it’s good! Maybe it’s shit! Dunno! I just wanted to finish the campaign before I looked into it. Or any of the DLC. But now I’m not gonna. Because when I get this pissed off, I get stubborn, and I’m never reinstalling this game again. I’m going to try very hard to never think about it again.
0/10, almost fun but actually trash. Would be easy to fix, but they didn't and won't.

- Graphics are poor even on ultra.
- Contains probably the most frustrating, confusing, ugly UI I have used with random unexplained gauges littered everywhere on the screen, and menus containing an overwhelming amount of random buttons and text in spots where you would not expect buttons and text to be in. Menus within menus within menus is also a common occurrence.
- Horrible ubisoft-style semi open world design where you have countless symbols and markers littered on your map.
- Poorly balanced as the game expects you to grind XP to actually have a fighting chance against any of the captains/war chiefs. I heard online its best to just not interact with the Nemesis system in the early game and to instead grind through the uninspired story missions to get the XP you need to actually have fun with the system THAT THE GAME IS BUILT AROUND. 
- Speaking of the story, the only character that actually put effort in acting and making you feel for them is Bruz. This team managed to make the rest of the characters you are forced to interact with entirely boring and uninspired.

Yet I still put over 30 hours into the game. The nemesis system is such a unique mechanic that can't be found in any other game, as the publisher patented it. Makes it worth trudging through all the negatives I listed above just to experience it.

Leveling up and unlocking new skills feels significant to your power over the orcs and, hey, orc murder isn't just a hobby - it's a way of life. 
The gear addition is a nice touch and gives you some customization both in battle and in how your character looks. You're also able to level up your gear to keep your current look relevant if that's your jam.

Im level 34 atm I just got done recruiting orcs and setting my 2 provinces i captured the way i want them. Back to the storyline! well it just so happens the game doesnt tell you what skill points you need to level up to continue the game. at lvl 34 I now have to Grind 4 more levels in Riding to do my quest. I literally had fun for hours in game doing everything it had to offer, and when it come back to the story. I had to Grind more... Grind more... 4 more levels when The game did not tell me what to level up. I havnt logged back in and prob wont, I experienced the game, not the story though. Im not going to Grind and have fun for 22 Hours only to be told by the game i didnt put skill points required to do this quest. Nothing is mentioned about this, you just get to learn the hard way just like i did. Hopefully this review helps you not make that mistake.

[h1] Миссии[/h1]
Миссии у каждого квестодателя практически не отличаются.
Например, у одних освободи гондорцев убивая орков, а у других прерывай ритуал убивая орков.


[h1] Орки[/h1]
Болтовню орков, заставку перед осадой и т п вещи нельзя пропустить, а это спустя какое-то время начинает знатно бесить, так как отнимает время.
Например, врываешься в битву и приходят 3 капитана и каждый КАЖДЫЙ представляется по секунд 10... 

[h1] Сюжет[/h1]
Сюжет с небя звезд не берет и его ну очень мало. 
Так же, как и мало какой-либо интересной постановки.
90% заставок - это болтовня.

Молучу еще, что истиная концовка получается только в том случае, если задрочить всю карту.

[hr][/hr]

Я согласен, что какое-то удовольствие я получал первые несколько часов, но далее по прошествии часов 5 игра не дает какие-то новые интересные механики, которые делают игру веселее, а так же не балует красивыми ""мультиками"".

Изменения по сравнению с первой частью около 0-ые и разработчики зачем-то увеличили унылые локации в несколько раз.

That being said.  The game is a solid sequel to Shadows of Mordor with improved game play and mechanics.  Cleaning up the Rune/Equipment mechanics removed the frustrations in SOM.  

Story is decent, voice acting is top notch (though the Voices are so low, I have to turn everything else down to 25-50 and up the volume on my stereo speakers.  

With the whole deal being you raising an army I found it next to useless.  The AI on your troops is almost non existent.  

But if you like killing Orcs.  I whole heartedly recommend this game.  Just understand your side does not HELP.  In fact...they HInder (getting in your way, knocking things out of your attacks, taking hits meant for the enemy.)  I cannot say this enough.  No game I have ever played EVER Gives me HELP that HELPS.  

So frustrating at times.

Update:  DLC.  Really enjoyed both DLC and their storylines.  As opposed to Shadow of Mordor where I disliked both DLCs.  So kudos to the devs for making the Two story DLCs unique playthroughs on their own.

Honestly, this game is a complete upgrade from its predecessor, with a very big emphasis on the Nemesis system.

Let me just be straight: If you're looking at this game for a good story, maybe give the game a  pass. The story is [i]okay[/i] at best. Its not necessarily annoying or hard, its just very linear and predictable. The actual meat and bones of this game is the gameplay and the Nemesis system. Every action you make influences your enemies, and over time they will get used to your playstyle, causing you as a player to adapt to every scenario and find solutions to every encounter. 

Somebody pointed out in another review that you should increase the difficulty. I honestly have to agree here. The nemesis system REALLY shines on higher difficulties, and unlike most games, dying isn't really a setback here. If anything, its a part of the gameplay and it ends in some pretty fun interactions, like getting killed by a grunt that you then kill literally a million times afterwards because they won't stay dead. It still boggles me how many different personalities there are for enemies in this game, and how many unique lines of dialogue there is for each one. Every time I do a new playthrough, its almost completely different from my previous ones. 

For an example, my first playthrough of this game I was quite bad and kept dying to one particular captain over and over. This captain basically became my eternal nemesis; he followed me wherever I went, from one region to the next (yes, they can do that!) and was constantly a thorn in my side. Eventually, I ended up defeating him and dominating him to add him to my own army. I ended up using him in a siege on a fortress, and during that siege, he ended up betraying me and killing me AGAIN. After that, I had a vendetta versus this dude and fought him again, this time killing him. But guess what? HE SURVIVED AND KILLED ME AGAIN. This basically continued for the rest of that playthrough, and although at times it was frustrating, I don't think I've ever been this immersed in a game before. Even though it was frustrating, that need for revenge kept driving me forward and trying to confront this guy. Over and over. It got to a point where him intruding on things was almost expected, and I enjoyed every second of attempting to confront my eternal nemesis. I even began to enjoy his eccentric personality and weird quips he made after each unique encounter.

The TL;DR is if you want a game that forces you to think outside the box and has you constantly adapting, then this is your game. You'll enjoy every moment of it. 

Also as a slight recommendation, I do recommend using a controller. Keyboard and Mouse works perfectly well, but it can feel a bit clunky later in the game.

There are more locations and more quests. However, it is depressing that there is a large number of collectable items that we can collect. Yes, you can not do this, but why do those who created this game have put them in such large numbers? From 9-11 per location. Why do I need to know that some vase is an ancient artifact?

So what didn't I like and what did I like about it?

+: 

- The combat became more varied.

- The system of blood enemies became better (there are more events on the kill missions)

- There is an opportunity to become a fortress owner on which we will place our orcs

- The presence of charismatic orcs such as Gruz and Krysarius (for me this is a plus, because their lines diluted the humdrum)

-:

- The narration is spontaneous. First we take a task from one character, then another, because the previous one is unavailable.

- There are too many locations. Yes, I understand that it will stretch the gameplay and we learn more story about the world of Middle-earth, but it's pure routine, because without a high level in the locations after Nurn you are nobody.

- The game is too demanding for the level of the player. Why do we have to do a bunch of one-type quests to recruit orcs? We are a light lord with a ring of power.

8/10 from me.

[h1] Plot [/h1]
The plot continues from where the last game left off. Talion just crafted the ""new ring"" to combat Sauron, as thus he, Celebrimbor, Shelob, and a myriad of other characters go on your quest to conquer Middle-Earth from Sauron.

[h1] Game Aspects [/h1]
Game introduces several new systems in the main game alone. With the new ring Talion can ""dominate"" normal orcs, and high ranking captain orcs to have them serve him and assist him in his conquest of the several different regions. You can also train, upgrade, level up, and have your orcs engage in a variety of activities such as the pit-fight, or even have some of them be spies for you to backstab a Warchief for you to make it easier for you to finish them off. There's of course your usual skill tree this time a lot more versatile offering a lot of unique approaches to any situation. There's a fair bit more, but that's the rough idea.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I mean yeah, graphics are beautiful. Even now in 2023 the game still holds up and looks really good, genuinely beautiful and amazing. There are different regions that you end up exploring during Talion's quest for conquest, and each region looks unique and diverse with different weather.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Playing the game feels good, countering attacks and finishing enemies off in beautiful epic ways such as executions and a variety of special skills / attacks if you've unlocked them. The variety of approaches you can have due to all of your abilities to any situation makes the gameplay always feel unique and refreshing, especially as the high ranking orcs will adapt to your playstyle, so you have to constantly change your approach.

You can also dominate and ride a variety of mounts to even further change how the game is played. Although that all being said the game does have a few bugs. You can glitch into buildings or the terrain itself, however rare it does / did happen, so it's not a 100% perfectly polished game, but it is excusable due to the absolute size of this game's world and all of the content it has.

Mounted combat is better than some games I have played (although not when the orc/troll you want to kill is immune to beats and fire). I found the warg-like mounts particularly useful with stealth attacks, and drakes are obviously good for burning enemies. It is also fun to heal your mount be having them feed on orcs.

The story was fun, but you will spend much more of your time grinding gear and captains for your army than enjoying it.

Con:

You cannot play again to experience the whole story line without overwriting your existing save! With all the grinding you do that is real bad.

The overall experience does get brought down by combat mechanics that function poorly at times. Some orcs are resistant to almost all hard-hitting attacks.

Now that I have played an Assassin's Creed game I can see WB basically copied AC game mechanics for combat while patenting their own for Nemesis. It seems innovative game developers should create a ""pay it forward or pay royalty"" policy style of patenting to discourage that behavior. Either share your own, or pay to copy others in yours.

Overall:

For an action/adventure game Witcher III or Skyrim would be better choices for the money, and both have more RPG options. They also have much better balanced sword/ranged strikes that don't require a special attack to do real damage. While the story was fun, I don't feel like playing again due to the grinding required.",1601407323,1679970449,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The games easily worth its 60$ price point, and if it came out today and cost 80$, itd be one of the few games I'd agree is worth that pricepoint (Canadian dollars)

The campaign is fun, I barely know LOTR and I was still able to get hella enjoyment, the combat system reminds me highly of the Batman Arkham series, so if you've played that and enjoyed beating up guys, its a less complicated version that is also unique in its own ways. There were a lot of story beats and even just the characters drew me in, I have to play it to the end to know what happens, and if my favorite characters die or not!

The side missions are quite plentiful, and while they are kind of the same thing a lot, each encounter is different and will require a different strategy. Sometimes you have to fight 8 orc captains all higher level than you, so you will want to stealth around a bit, and take advantage of the campfires and explosive barrels found in the enviroment. Or pick off enemies from afar, or you can even just jump in there and slowly widdle down each and every healthbar with perfect counters, dodging, and executions. The base gameplay is very enjoyable for me, so all of the side content so far has been, and I plan to 100% my save.

The nemesis system, recruiting orcs, making them fight, infiltrate, and assist you on your quest for Mordor is one of the best parts of this game, and the main reason I bought it to be honest. And it doesn't disappoint, adds in tons of extra hours of enjoyment. I loved just spending hours in between missions going out and breaking the strongest captains and adding them to my ranks, anytime I was fighting a captain and they gave me a tough time, I would go out of my way to track them down and recruit. Even if it delayed my story progress a lot, it still was fun. And when my fortresses eventually got raided, it was easier than anything else, as my warchiefs are insanely OP from how often I did pit battles, and I havent even talked about them. I dont even want to spoil it for you if you've read this far, Pit fights and Orcs could've been a game on there own, filled with microtransactions and awful, but no. It exists here, and while it does feel ""Unfair"" at times, that unfairness can work in your favor occasionally, so dont take it too seriously.

Now, heres my literal one gripe from this game, and its something that's just made me Alt + f4 at least once. The movement system, now heres the problem with that, movement feels amazing in this game, especially out of combat. But when your fighting a large horde, and the captain your attacking puts you to 1 health from a single spear landing, you may want to retreat to get into stealth or go steal some health back. So youll go to run, well maybe youll dodge. thats fine, but then your climbing a tiny fence that you dont want to be, then your trying to double air jump over onto a wall that if climbed, would surely take you to safety.
However Tallion decides that it would instead be best to leap directly back into the horde. Leaving you surrounded by 20 orcs at 1 health, in a bad animation.

Seriously if the movement was refined just a bit to be smarter about jumping into things, and auto vaulting down hills and stuff. The game would be absolutely perfect, but this is frustrating, and you probably will notice it a few times. However it really doesn't take away from how good overall the game is, and if its on sale.

Carrying on from the fairly interesting Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War is much the same, but more. It's more nonsense, more weird fanservice, more clunkiness and more time wasted.

After nearly 20 hours I gave up, feeling it unlikely I'd ever bother to actually finish the game, and so: here's why.

You may have heard of a little book (or a series of movies) called The Lord of the Rings, which revolves around the One Ring of Power. This game steps up to craft the Second Ring of Power, which turns into the pivotal object around which the game revolves. It allows our undead protagonist, Talion, and his ghostly elf-friend Celebrimbor to forge hordes of unreliable orcs into an army to fight for control of Mordor itself.

There in lies the most interesting quirk of the game: encountering, studying, fighting, subjugating and commanding various orc characters with different traits. You essentially become an orc collector, which is a fine idea! Though the game quickly over-uses this fine idea, turning a fun concept into a slow, grindy and repetitive affair that reduces the orcs to short-lived collectables. Originally the game was released with an invasive onlinse store, which likely explains the above issue well: the game was designed to waste time and frustrate the player to coax them into purchasing ways to make the game more fun. Still, the underlying idea is kind of fun!

However, the game is badly let down in almost every other area, from general gameplay to story to even the basic cast of characters. While Talion is a fairly average protagonist, though the game does little to establish his character and leaves it up to the player to play the first game before this one, the other characters feel thing, one-dimensional and dull. Celebrimbor is an annyoing elf-ghost who does nothing but whine and berate. The giant spider Shelob turns into a milf Frodo and Sam would definitely have spent more time with had she appeared to them as she does to Talion. Ratbag the orc returns from the first game to provide some fairly inappropriate comedic relief. None of the characters really click, though, nor provide more than a reason to awkwardly smile sometimes.

Otherwise the gameplay takes most of its cues from the Assassin's Creed series, along with the Batman Arkham games. Stealth exists, but is almost entirely optional as there is no punishment for not using it. Combat against a single opponent feels dull and repetitive, and so the game opts to throw in dozens of enemies at a time to add challenge and spectacle. This idea works in theory, but the game's mechanics and controls fall apart here. You may have your opponent one swing away from death, but the automatic lock-on mechanic might decide you want to target an entirely different enemy in the next county over, and so the attack button sends Talion leaping off into the distance. Climbing and parkour movement also suffer of similar issues where the player simply lacks control over their movements and can end up leaping off in unpredictable ways, or just simply stuck for extended periods of time as Talion refuses to let go of a ledge. I died a few times when trying to evade an enemy by leaping off a rooftop as Talion would step up to the edge, but instead of jumping off she would roll against an invisible barrier while not moving away from the enemy, leading to endless frustration.

On a technical level the game may have been passable back when it came out, but it hasn't aged all that well. Many visuals were lackluster back in the day, seemingly not having evolved at all from the first game, and now, years later, the game comes off as downright ugly from time to time. Music feel forgettable, while trying to invoke some of the Lord of the Rings movie soudntrack sensations, but it's use is misguided (I hated the comedy music that plays out whenever Ratbag shows up) and it usually ends up drowned out by all the shouting going on.

With broken mechanics, frustrating grinding, endless repetition and a story premise best left to some third-rate Tolkien fanboy's fanfic collection, Shadow of War is impossible to recommend.

Get collectables, slaughter orcs, recruit captains, storm castle via a boss rush essentially, and repeat. Gear is SUUUPER grindy. Every map shows you where everything is hidden, just like a Ubisoft game. Combat is flashy and cool, but loses its charm after a little bit. The nemesis system is superficial at best and not very deep. Also, 13 hours in and im finding alot of bugs revolving around the nemesis system in where shaming Orcs (lowering their level to recruit them), there's a good chance they will just entirely regenerate there level, looks, and stats.

Won't win any lore accuracy awards. But the gameplay is really smooth and fun

Can play in various ways, stealth based, pure combat, ranged focused, or anything in between

But the real draw, is the Nemesis system. You can meet an Orc who is just a mere grunt, and while learning the controls, he kills you. Now, that grunt gets promoted to a Captain as Murk The Tark Slayer. So, because you're mildly salty, you hunt him down and kill him. Later, he returns after barely surviving his wounds as Murk The Survivor. So again, you hunt him down and kill him. Now you think he's gotta be dead for sure because you cleaved him in half. But then Murk The Machine shows up, rebuilt with metal. This goes on 7 more times, each time, he is less Orc, and more metal. Now, you finally decapitate him which is supposed to permanently kill. You relax. Hours of gameplay and days in real life later, you're doing some missions. You are fighting a necromancer enemy Orc, and he revives some of the captains you've killed, and guess who shows up? Murk, The Goddamn Machine. The very first Orc to kill you, following you deep into the game, never leaving, never dying, always there. So, this time, you purify him. Finally, he's gone. The Machine can rest

Middle Earth: Shadow of War does it's fan's affection justice by remaining true to the written information provided by J. R. R Tolkien whilst filling in any blanks with a fresh sense of creativity and fitting details that are both entertaining and make sense. In the grander scheme of things, this singleplayer masterpiece from Warner Brothers Entertainment makes for an excellent gameplay experience filled with emotional, well voiced cut-scenes and action filled gameplay. While the multiplayer experience does leave much to be desired, the Nemesis system adds so much depth to interactions with NPC's and enemies it has little to no rival in its playing field and truly helps to add to the total experience, making it a must-play game.

In most 3D brawlers even the small hits feel great to do, they will have a nice hit noise and animation so that it is fun to wail on people even when you aren't doing much damage. This game doesn't have that. Your attacks are mostly dull ""swing"" noises that the enemies recoil from gently. Even your heavy attack gives the impression that it is hitting the enemies with the wind from the swing rather than a big two handed weapon.

The above would be okay if they had gotten some good effect for when you pull off a stealth kill or a finisher, but the game disappoints there too. At best you get a bit more of a solid noise, but nothing like the visceral feedback of the Dark Souls backstab ""Dun... DUN"" or the Yakuza fight ending ""Woosh + Cash register"". Not to mention the awful parry noise in this game is an ear grating wood on wood sound(this might be different if the enemy has a different weapon, but it seems to be usually wood) as opposed to a nice crisp success ""ding"".

Now the above may seem minor but that combination of animation and sound (as well as hit effects which I haven't mentioned yet) is what makes combat in a game ""feel"" better or worse. In addition to that it also helps to communicate more efficiently to the player what is going on as they fight. Set up correctly those effects will even be able to give the player information about the relative damage of attacks, which they can use to better plan out their fights and how to dispatch enemies(when health and damage aren't explicitly stated).

I will briefly mention that the game does have a bunch of loud effects that cut in as you fight that are meant to signal different things, but they don't sync well with the animations (or any other clear effect marker) so you can barely tell what they are for. The game also uses slowmo during fights in very strange ways, I don't even know from playing if it is just for the window when you can parry or dodge or if they are using it for other things as in a hectic battle it will just kick in randomly sometimes with no indicators on screen.

The above is enough for me to say that the game is a hard pass, but if you do pick it up anyway I recommend spending time reading the in game guides or maybe even looking outside the game for explanations of mechanics as the tutorials are really bad. They waste a lot of time forcing you to learn what buttons to press for things that have frequent onscreen prompts but don't do any in game explanation of core game mechanics like stealth, wraith mode, crafting/items/loot, status effects, etc. beyond telling you what buttons they are.",1679253085,1679253085,False,2,0,0.480639219284057617,0,True,False,False

The artistic goal of the game was to make the orcs evolve around you, becoming the main villains and characters in the game. For this to work, you need to not just kill them immediately, so unless you have the difficulty turned up to the max, it does not work. In that event it becomes actually awesome! For the first 1 act. The problem is there are still story characters and story fights outside of that, which don't work on the hardest difficulty. You either get the artistic view (strong orcs) or the rest of the game, never both.

For the first act I had a super strong orc who killed me in a few different spots and became someone I dreaded and ran away from. He came back as an actual progression boss, and I could NOT kill him.

Shadow of Mordor had the benefit of being a UFO in the landscape of Lord of the Rings and, though not canonical, was also a fairly enjoyable Action RPG. I daresay the game felt quite intimate and thus of little significance of the LotR universe as it focused on Talion getting his revenge whilst exploring the uncharted lands of Mordor.

Shadow of War only builds on the Boromir/Arargon fantasy, the epic battles of the movies and making orcs ""cool"". Talion is now as powerful as the Witch King, leaps from building like Spiderman and raises armies in an instant. Orcs speak in a contemporary British accent, with expressions barely dating 50 years, turning interactions with them into slapstick comedy which has nothing to do in a LotR game.

You lose all sense of quest, journey, discovery and Homeric epiness from LotR (which to a certain extent Shadow of Mordor had clumsily managed to deliver on) - akin to most media based on LotR. The battle of good vs evil is non-existant, as the games blurs all lines on that front - something Tolkien always wanted to avoid.

Nevertheless most of you will enjoy your time with this game, but it is a far cry from Lord of the Rings and its pillars. Unsurprisingly it stands closer to the Arkham Asylum series which was (back then) in its prime.

The devs finally removed the store, which was filled with useless micro-transactions designed to pray on the fans of the franchise. They were totally unnecessary in a single-player action-RPG. It was a dick move from WB to milk every cent from this game. Aside from that, they raised the level cap, added another legendary set and most important, reduced the Shadow Wars grind at the end of the game. The ""real"" ending cut-scene was walled behind a 20 defensive siege missions gauntlet. A cheap move to pad the game's playtime. I remember, thats where I abandoned this game on my first playthrough in 2017. Now it's only 5 missions, if you lose one, then you have to play an offensive siege to retake the region.

Then, years later, I went back to play it, and, to be completely honest, I think this game is excellent. The nemesis system is entirely awesome. It was very well done by Monolith. The additional DLCs are worthwhile because they do introduce new game-play mechanics and styles which you must follow when playing the DLCs. There is a good narrative in this game. Loved the conclusions. You can always lower the difficulty if you find the game-play too challenging because the battles can be too chaotic and overwhelming at times. (but still game handles the chaos right). The game-play was fair when I was playing on the Nemesis level. Yes, if you've played Shadow of Mordor, this exceeds your hopes for a sequel, at least in my opinion. Every orc war-chief, commander, or overlord feels different. It can be completed in as little as 45–55 hours if you want to enjoy the story and expansions.

Don't trust the number of hours I played this game on Steam. Because I had chores to do, I occasionally had to pause the game and leave it there for hours. My actual playing time is between 60 and 70 hours.

The tricky part is that they mostly don't have sex, but you still gotta torture the innocent to death.

Story follows Talion, who's on the hunt for revenge after he's betrayed by his elf fiancée, and murdered by Orcs. So he has to kill every Orc with no sympathy left in him, even the wounded ones.
I must admit, it's tough, even though the aim is to re-kill every Orc you encounter and thus boost your score. And i'm not sure if that's the correct way to think of it.
Just because you take an Orc's life, doesn't mean that the rest of them will just leave you alone. Even if they are totally unconscious, some ornery bastard will just get up and kill you anyway.

Gameplay is brilliant, you must really stop to think that a sadistic psychopath likes shooting innocent defenseless Orcs while they lie on the ground trying to get back on their feet.
And if you want to be even more brutal, you can make their deaths a real spectacle with graphics so realistic they would give your wallet a major heart attack.
Every time an Orc is about to take his last breath, he'll suddenly jerk violently and flail his limbs in pain, only to suddenly die moments later.
Saddest part is that he's always right there for you to shoot at any time, but i guess you'd rather risk damaging your gear than kill a guy just to blow off some steam.

There's not much story to be told here, and if you really want to experience the whole spectrum of killing orcs, then you better go through the whole game to find out how it ends. I played this game for a few hours and i'm still playing it right now.

See, playing this game in 2023 shows how much respect and willing to be as Tolkinian as possible the writers tried to be in inventing a new story and trying to attaching it to the original lore. After that disaster of Ring of Powers, you can't appreciate enough how the story, even if not canonical, could absolutely become part of the original story and expand it without completely breaking what Tolkien wrote. 

Funny thing is that I've already played and got the platinum on Playstation when the game came out, but couldn't resist to playing it again in 2023, and still today the game holds well in every single aspect you can think of, from the graphic, storyline, combat system and the huge amount of things and side quests that you can take part on, especially cause they aren't just "" things to do "" to make it as long as possible, in a way or another they tie to some aspect of the original lore and expand it. 

Every single aspect that was good in the first game, has been perfectionated in this second chapter, everything polished and made it almost perfect, to the point where getting all the achievements isn't boring as the majority of the games out there. 

As a Tolkien fan I cannot recommend it more  to both Tolkien fans or normies, especially those who endured one entire season of that Amazon insult and they need a good story based on Mordor.

The nemesis system was awesome to work with, and it made encounters feel more unique and memorable. I do have a few gripes;

1: movement can be awkward, especially when you are trying to get somewhere quick in a busy environment. You don't always go where you want to go it seems
2: not much customization within the other two stories, Talion is really the only customizable character.

Pretty annoying to try to pick up upgrades when endless hordes of orcs keep interrupting you. Thankfully, there are exploding barrels to shave off some of these annoying characters. These orcs just sponge all the attack moves, makes the fights pretty boring. I'm overwhelmed with all the features, which the floating tutorial signs persistently tell me what button to mash. The intro monologues of each general/captain can't be skipped; I had 3-4 of them appear in one area. This really breaks the flow of the battle with all these distractions. 

Once you figure out the game mechanics, things begin to flow and become fun. That's when unexpected game crashes begin to occur.

This, is a love letter.

I'm asking one question to passionate gamers here: 
How many times did you came back to your most treasured entertainment software once completed ? You can boot up Super Mario Bros and enjoy your 100th run, you can start a skirmish on your preferred C&C and know you will enjoy its sand box strategy for the next hour, as if it was released yesterday. Examples are as numerous as there are players on this little planet.

What accomplished the nemesis system here ?
Shadow of Mordor was a beta version, just to refund on the development costs. Now, you made your first run of shadow of war on normal, discovered the mechanics, experienced some hard times, had some fun, but something happened, you HAD to restart it on higher difficulty. 

Why ? Hehe, I won't spill it there, but I think you already understand.

I stopped my second difficult playthrough halfway just to experience from scrath the gravewalker difficulty, the 'one shot' and 'no mistakes allowed' kind. Many complained about its unfairness, and they are right, but that's definitely where the game truly shines in my eyes.

Talion is a powerhouse, but frail. Orcs cannot be stopped, they will overwhelm you, whatever you do. But shadow is on your side. And cheese as well. So many tools are given to you, you always have several ways to face a captain, then kill him for fancy new gear and experience, or hire a devoted zealot who will back you up.

Oh boy, your first encounters will enrage you, but you will learn from every mistake, spy your foe, manage long range *astards, have the first blow, crowd control with nasty explosive grug barrels if necessary, flee and isolate your target if everything goes out of hand, and in the end, prevail.

It may be a painful journey, but every head rolling on the ground, every gem refined, every gear found is definitely rewarding. I remember so many orcs, from this dumb bard who humiliated me so many times, to this poor dude I burned to death four times and always came back, to finally become one of my finest bodyguards.

And then, there is the epiphany. 
I was just minding my daily business, looking for a sweet isolated target, then got ambushed by not one, not two, not three but four bloodthirsty captains. I was about to flee once again, but at this point of your journey, you are Neo in the subway, facing agent Smith. You don't run, you start to believe. In seconds, I called a drake and burned all of these sorry dudes. That was one of the most satisfying experience I had with this game. 

You can just even the unfair odds, just like in classic Xcom, but here, it is YOU who spank the RNG.  

That's shadow of war baby !",1677957812,1677957812,True,101,9,0.852021336555480957,7,True,False,False

when it comes to the story, it's great 7-8/10 i'd say. it has an interesting take, it's not canon, but it just adds more story telling in the middle earth franchise. it's like extra lore but it's something that you don't really need, but it's still interesting. on how it ""would"" affect the whole franchise.",1677770857,1677770857,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite all the options available and the different enemy and damage types, everything felt very samey in a very short amount of time. The first game overstayed its welcome by the end, but the core gameplay loop held on for most of it. This game offers very little new moment to moment despite the refinements to the Nemesis system.

The story here is told better, but to what end? The engine does a remarkable job with subtle facial expressions, and the voice actors are killing it, but all in service to a story that lacks anything resembling the stakes or cohesion I needed to overcome the plodding gameplay.

If you want a fun experience incrementally leveling up and finding better gear, there are umpteen ARPGs. If you want a good story, there are plenty to choose from.

however, each of those games has their 1 thing that differentiates them.  For Shadow of War, its the Nemesis system, which generates random orc enemies with random powers and weaknesses, and if you abuse the same technique against them multiple times they become immune to it permanently, eventually leading to orcs returning immune to just about everything you can do to them, making for truly ferocious nemesis'.

I've done 3 complete play throughs, so add another 40 hours to my current played time since one of those was on Ps4.  
The servers are shut down so you can't buy premium currency anymore, and the nemesis forge is shut down on Shadow of Mordor as well.  Still, I didnt even notice this because they werent needed anyway.  
You can also save your favorite orcs and bring them with you in a fresh play through (and weapons and gear) serving as a poor mans new game plus (But starting a new game with a full set of legendary level 60 gear and multiple legendary orcs to deploy into your army and help you conquer the world all over again is certainly a fun power trip, who doesnt like 1-shotting all the orcs who gave you trouble before? that is, if you can even find the same orcs since the nemesis system generates millions of possible orc combinations--- and by no means are these simple paint swaps.  Each orc can have one class, one tribe, one specialization, and multiple extra features including flags, probabilities, possible upgrades, multiply all that together and you have literaly millions of possible unique orcs, and the voice overs are so varied that you might not hear the same line twice.)

The gameplay is fine though. I like the challenge, I like how the captains encourage you to be smart because a one on one fight with the orcs is often a losing proposition. I like how the game is unfair, encouraging YOU to be smart and use weaknesses, making you feel smart when you take down a captain. But after a while it just becomes a slog. You take over a region, collect the collectibles, and that's fun. Then it tells you to do it for six or seven other regions and I just.. can't. I can't care. I can't engage.

Definitely skip Shadow of Mordor if you're wondering, there's enough here to satisfy.

Cinematics and characters are wonderful and have a lasting movie-level personality.

I recommend this game over its predecessor unless you want some precursory story to this one (which isn't too pertinent) as this game just iterates on what made the old one great. I'm a little late to use the Nemesis Forge (a way import previous games' data) but I'm glad I started fresh.

- More quests, and the Carnan storyline was extremely cool, did not expect something like that in this game
- The maps are better designed, and a couple regions are very stylistic
- I love mechanics for mobility, so + for drake mounting and + for improvement on the boost mechanic
- A few skill upgrades that make fighting/stealth more fun

Lots of missions are repetitive so maybe a big *no* for some, but I still found the missions fun. I just like slaying many-many orcs

I actually am not very familiar with LOTR so I'm not really immersed in the story. When watching the movies I was disgusted with the orcs designs, and still am, but with so many fun interactions with orcs in this game, I got used to it.

Combat can be going great until Talion gets stuck on something and fails to hit the orc he just slid 15 feet to attack. Prompts fail to appear too often. I've been playing on the highest difficulty and the game will just spawn mobs of orcs behind or around me, thinking I wouldn't notice them pop in on the mini-map. It gets really intense, which is great, but the dissatisfaction of seeing how artificial the challenge is at the high difficulties or dying to the weird combat inconsistencies can suck the fun out of a play session fast. The Orc Captain interactions happen too often and last too long, which really takes me out of the game. I found myself rolling my eyes and much of the dialogue and at the 3rd Captain that randomly spawns in and treats you to an unskippable cutscene after I just watched 2 other unskippable cutscenes from the first 2 Captains that randomly spawned in.
There are good aspects though. The expanded nemesis system is like a whole other game nested inside the storyline. I can see how people find it good enough to recommend the game, but I can't get over the inconsistencies of the game in general, so I can't immerse myself in the system.

I finished the game on Hard.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Nemesis System is ok. The mechanics of combat are not without problems, but marginally acceptable.

Everything else, most importantly controls - are ass.

Your enjoyment of this game depends solely on how much you find Nemesis engaging. To me it got old after around 15h and never became anything other that tiresome.

[h1]Description[/h1]
It's an action-adventure game. If you played any Ubisoft game - you played this, with one difference - Nemesis System.

Nemesis System governs your interactions with enemy leaders. It lets you kill them, but also provides options for recruiting some for your own army. You may recruit bodyguards of your enemy and then have them betray him for an easy kill. Enemies that kill you will grow stronger, but taking revenge will give you better rewards. You can stregthen your forces while weaking the enemy in many ways.

All that while doing typical open-world quest-questing, collectible-collecting and tower-... climbing. Outside the Nemesis System this is the most generic-by-the-numbers-soulless-open-world-action-adventure you've ever seen.

You play as Talion and you fight Sauron. That's all context you need.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ Nemesis system[/b]
It's ok and fun for the first 15h, which is about half of the playtime.

[b]+ Orcs[/b]
There are many of them. Lots of different kinds, different faces, classes, weaknesess and powers. They all even have their own personality, will react to your meddling and even have different reactions based on events during fighting them. Some may run from you when broken, some may even reappear after being killed. Some may lose their mind if you decide to spare them.

Interactions are not only fluff, but are integrated into the very mechanics of the Nemesis System. It was important for this part of the game to be good and holy fk - they managed it.

[b]+ RPG mechanics[/b]
Equipment is fully modelled on your character. Skills offer a lot of combat options.

[b]+ Last mission[/b]
Actually exciting despite making no sense. After all is done you can continue indulging in Nemesis System if you want and you get some new, cool powers to boot.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Freerunning/parkour[/b]
If you dare to try and sprint in any kind of environment that isn't a perfectly flat area with no clutter/walls/enemies around - your character will do EVERYTHING in his power to climb, vault over or grab onto every god-fking-damn piece of scenery and will bump into every single thing instead of doing what you'd want him to do. At some points I was convinced that the game was trolling me with how unpredictable parkour behaved.

[b]- General control fkery[/b]
Don't enable ""toggle stealth"", the game was not made with it in mind. You won't be able to enter stealth while sprinting for example, which is not a problem when using normal ""hold"" staealth.

Every time the game requires you to do anything in combat that requires precision (except shooting your bow, that works ok) - you may be sure that Talion will do anything but the thing you want him to. An orc in front of you that you want to just hit? You will instead target a berserker behind him, who counters normal hits. Want to dominate a broken doggo when a captain is near it? Your dominate will target the captain even though it cannot work on him until he himself is broken. There is no way to guarantee what target you will actually hit with any of your soft-auto-targetting abilities from basic attack to executions.

[b]- Dodging[/b]
There are some enemies that have attacks that cannot be avoided in certain distance. In a game designed around parrying and dodging attacks this is a bad thing. You are forced to either kill those enemies with your bow, restoring your limited ammo using pickups many times until you deal enough damage to kill, or you risk getting mashed by an undodgeable attack.

Then there's problems with dodging itself not working when you really need it. People lie that it doesn't have invincibility frames and you have to dodge out of an attack. That's untrue. Dodge makes you untargetable for an attack, but only when specific conditions are met and it's mechanics are inconsistent. Example - to dodge an arrow, you must press dodge as the arrow is being fired regardless of the distance and travel time of the attack. You will get hit if you try to dodge it by visuals - it will connect mid-rolling animation. On the other hand - many attacks with ""DODGE IT!"" have to be dodged entirely while the attack is in effect already. If you dodge at the moment when attack is beginning, like with arrows - you'll get hit mid-roll.

Most of the time it's ok to get hit a bit because of this, but when you are forced to fight Orcs that can 1-shot your entire HP (or suffer through hours of grind) - that's a problem.

[b]- Characters/Story[/b]
Nobody is intreresting and you will care about no character. In many ways the Orcs have more personality than all those people you are watching talk at you during cutscenes. The plot is predictable and shallow. There are 2 plotlines that make attempt to be interesting and end up not being total garbage, but nothing is ""good"".

Don't let me start on how little is has in common with Tolkien's world. Then again, this game clearly wanted us to have fun and didn't really care about the rest, which I can at least respect to some degree, unlike sht like ""Rings of Power"". That trash didn't care about Tolkien and certainly didn't care about fun.

[b]- Nemesis System not perfect[/b]
I have some gripes with it. For example I've had my Orcs participate in 1v1 combat trials and they often seem far too random. My high level Orc with resistance to arrows could die by getting slapped in the face by a low-level crossbow Orc 20 times in a row with same animation playing every time. My fighter could kill the crossbow guy in 2 hits, but I guess the crossbow slap thing was higher on game's priority list when checking for conditions of an attack, so it just looped forever until my Orc was dead. In fact, my Orcs seem to die to enemies that are weaker than them far too often for it to be a coincidence, there must be some fkery going on.

You can get vastly overwhelmed when trying to dominate an Orc, which leads to fishing for a stealth dominate or something. Coupled with bad controls it's infuriating.

[b]- Excessive immunities[/b]
Some Orcs are immune to arrows, basic attacks, freezing and a lot of other things. At some point it leads to you finding gimmick ways of dealing with them and it's just too much sometimes.

[b]- Grind[/b]
At some point you either keep forcing yourself to fight orcs that are 10+ levels above you and can kill you with 1 ranged hit while throwing multiple attacks in a row and having infinite reinforcements of berserkers and defenders, OR - you swallow the bitter pill of level grinding. It can take multiple hours to grind out 1 level once you have no more quests to do and rely only on the Nemesis System.

[b]- Quests[/b]
Most main story quests are boring. They follow typical ""follow NPC"" design, but dialogue and characters are bad so you don't care about most stuff that happens. Then you have slap-fights vs bosses, which take too long and are insultingly shallow.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
It's what it is. Nemesis System wrapped around a very generic open-world action-adventure game with poor controls, story and characters. If Nemesis was not in this game, then it would be a forgettable 4/10, mostly due to problems with lack of proper control over most of your actions.

But since Nemesis does lead to engaging gameplay elements, dynamic storytelling and is fun to experience overall - it elevates an otherwise mediocre game to a new standard. At least for a while.

I'd give Shadow of War a

I don't really remember much of the first game. I thought it was a cool diversion from the Assassin's Creed formula in a more chaotic, frantic way and I just like Lord of the Rings in general. Naturally, the nemesis system is the highlight of this and its prequel; the particular system patented in all of its legally-restricted glory that no other game can emulate for another 13 years (as of now the patents were extended to 2036).

But this game is very anti-player. It's very hard on the hands. I play on a gamepad because these types of games are just more enjoyable to me that way, much alike playing Elden Ring. But this game is the only game that manages to make my fingers hurt after 2 or 3 hours of play.

This is crazy to me. I've had 10 hour sessions in Elden Ring with very few breaks and I don't think my fingers have ever hurt this much from playing a game for 2 hours. The combat is genuinely so awful. I don't think mechanically it's bad, but the APM required to not die in any given fight or just to move around the environment just hurts my hands. Why do I have to hold the A button to run? Were they incapable of scaling movement off of how far you move the thumbstick?

I tried to play this game for two different sessions. I ragequit after my first one and again on my second attempt because I just wasn't having fun. This game started to bring up all the bad memories I had of the first game being much of the same way: mechanically a fun game, but functionally terrible for the player to enjoy. I was so gods-damned relieved I beat the first game after 15 or so hours. I actually tried to do a lot of the side content too.

There's stuff here and there to enjoy but the UI is awful, the gameplay is awful, my hands hurt, and I'm frankly not invested that much in the characters to care anymore.",1676625899,1676626412,False,0,0,0.494845330715179443,1,True,False,False

The appeal is the nemesis system where orcs are made to be interactive every time that you meet a captain, but it got annoying real quick. Their dialogue is all almost similar, the combat with them feels like you're just hacking at a bigger target with no strategy needed to kill most of them. At times its more irritating when they gain immunity's becuse then they just manhandle you when you accidentally try to jump over them. Despite that tho i thought the story was good and the atmosphere of the game was great those were the two things that made me want to keep on pushing through the story.

It's not a matter of hitting buttons on time, it's the fact that you get hit regardless and now you're a dummy for all other follow up attacks. The Commander Captain can summon reinforcements with no cool down while also giving an attack buff that spawns the banners, which he summons after each on is destroyed. Sure, clearing infinite normal Uruks is easy even with some Ologs mixed in, but one Commander spamming Reinforcement Call is testament to why I am giving this a negative review. Everything else is great and has some insane depth to the overall life of the game that I would love to list, but as I proceed through combat I am reminded why I waited to get this game for 75% off.

I destroyed the game on Nemesis, despite what people say online. You can ignore side missions and just obliterate every fort leveling you up fast. So I had the game on the run for 50 hours and was taking the last fort before doing the end game quest which for me was Lithlad, and was in the process of taking over all the lower Captains to make them spy on the War Chiefs. I'd already been screaming at the game the entire 50 hours for the janky climb mechanics and constant stop you mid fight captain speech interruptions, mind you, so I'm pretty angry at this point ready to beat the game and be done. I get the next spy broken, go to recruit him while I'm at full health and get tackled by a Caragor. Do the quicktime and press space bar to roll away aaaand there was another quick time. No damage no dazed none of that sh*t, just one hit you're dead bye bye. Yeah, bye bye game! Not even worth finishing with that cheap nonsense. I destroyed every enemy in the game up to that point and got killed in one hit by a quick time event. No thanks. I'll play shadow of Mordor see how hard that sucks. 
Absolute terrible garbage video game you spend 10 hours downloading to get to artificial difficulty BS. The only way to kill Captains is to repeatedly hide on the tallest tower and eventually you keep getting killed anyway because of cheap ass cheating animations they use to keep you from being able to get away from the mauling. Oh look the captain is enraged, now you have to sit through a mandatory animation that they will come out of swinging an axe at your head. One hit and you're dead oh boy what fun! Then the game created an unkillable enemy that just keeps popping up every five minutes after you kill them. Gee what fun! Less than 10 dollars I paid thank god what an absolute garbage system of gameplay. No manual saves just you trying to kill enemies that just keep popping up. May as well just go for the missions, because the enemies in this game are more stupid than Nemesis from Resident Evil. 10 rockets to the face, but you went to the next room so there he is(replace room with rooftop for this game).

Great idaea , crap execution .

[1] - (Fight) : The fighting (like in the first ME SoM) is actually new and interesting , sadly its broken , you get interpuded by the system , to tell you you just beheaded someone ,,, while the one he was suposed to fight is impalin you at the moment , and guess what ? Your block before the prompt didn`t stick ... ! Sometimes you get hit when you shouldn`t , your drain gets interpuded , God knows why , when there are more than 10 orcs around you it gets too meshy and you need to escape ,,, unless the ""boss"" around have ""siege breaker""   and u can`t jump over him .... and the game decides you need to ""space"" on him every time .

[2] - (Sneaaaky) : The stealth is like in the first game ... BUUUUT targeting is a joke , you can`t drain someone in the face 8/10 times , a lot of times u can`t just shank them (First mouse button) , even when they are dropping their torch to draw ... in the first game it was awesome , meybe too easy sneak , low detection radius , but targeting was better , execution was smooth , here its just a mesh .
[3] - (Srsly ? ) .. geting followers around before killing the tough boss sounds right , right ? But nooooooo you get half the base stamped(controlled) , than you have to fight someone in the corner , no more than 3-4 sec fight , and your WHOLE F**KING ARMY starts to fight ,, no you did not press (4) ,,, it just does ""help you"" , the alarm goes on , and bye bye 30 minutes of work to get the champ.. 
         I know if you don`t play on Brutal its prolly easy-er(ish) , but diein in 2 
hits and that amount of bugs and all just gets me pissed . I didn`t get to play the game before they removed the ""pay wall"" , but unless they fix-up the fighting mechaninc (atleast) i can`t reccomend it , for the best expiriance go play Shaodw of Mordor . much better.",1676169776,1676173265,False,1,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Shadow of War's patented Nemesis system awes the player with its impactful unpredictability, which makes every encounter thrilling and unique. You will get ambushed mid-mission, be saved when confronted by death, etc.

Revenge is an atrocious, primitive feeling. The directors know this, and implementing it into a game surpasses other games in the usual kill quests, or any other objectives. Finally executing an orc that has killed you multiple times is so satisfactory, until their necromancer blood-brother rushes in to the supposedly ended fight, only to resurrect my trophy kill and have them murder me again as undead. It makes the story feel highly personal and captivating at times.

Although, it is a shame no other game studios can replicate the Nemesis system as it is very promising for the gaming industry in creating procedurally-generated narratives.

Highly recommended, playing the first game is optional.

Yes, I liked the game... I had fun. However the story fell of at the end of act 3. I hated act 4, I didn't finish it. The true ending is well written, the grind to reach it is bs. I feel that the lack of resolution between Talion and Calibrimbor is very dissatisfying. Talion even mentions how he misses the ringmaker even though he betrayed him. The concept of Talion just fighting until he loses to the ring just feels like a painful ending. On another note, I'm glad the final fights weren't just quick time events as they were in the previous game. Overall, I just felt like the game left me wanting more and I hate that feeling. It's not a ""oh I want more because it's so fun"", it's a ""I need more because I feel let down"". 

Anyway, I like Eltariel though her betrayal felt way out of left field. There was almost no build-up to that. Her DLC was insanely fun, loved the NPCs. I wish we had more of those in the main game that were more reoccurring. 

I think my main issue with this game was game build up. I think that each area should have unlocked once you completed a fort and the main story there. I ended up jumping around a ton because I completed things in a poor order which semi-killed my interest in the game.

I use the term prey because you're essentially hunting down Orcs to add to your Bastion defenses. That isn't the story though, just a nice little game mechanic. You can challenge Orc leaders who have different traits, and once almost beaten you can break their will and have them work for you.

Verdict: 7/10
Act I is a chore; Act II ignites the fire.

Review:
Act I is brutally hard to complete; not because of it's difficulty, but because of it's boring, repetitive, A-B quests that have you shaking your head in frustration.  I refunded this title 3 other times before... all because of Act I.  Act II, is a whole different experience which leads me to recommend this title.

HUGE world with nothing to do... common in most ""open-world"" title of this age.  The story is vastly underwhelming.  It is not engrossing at all and you're not going to connect to any character. Bummer, because the first title of Middle-Earth was the exact opposite and the first carried you through the game.  That being said, ME: Shadow of War really shines in the gameplay starting in Act II.  In Act I you're literally running to opposite sides of the map to start quests and it's very linear.  Starting in Act II, you're able to ""control"" Orcs and other beasts to build your army.  Super cool! 

I spend most of my time building my army and finding the biggest, baddest, creepiest looking Orcs I can to fill the ranks.  I came across this one a**hole Orc who killed me three times (lol?) because he countered many of my takedowns and didn't allow me to have a ""second wind"".  I had to put my ego aside and recruit this f***er,  After adding him to my ranks (finally), he was assassinated by a rival Orc tribe.  Then, one of my bros attempted to assassinate me! The audacity!  

Sending death threats to captains and collecting gear is pretty fun.  I still have no idea what is going on with the story, but that's OK because the gameplay in Act II makes up for it.  Is it kinda repetitive? Yes.  Is it kinda empty? Yes.  Does the story absolutely suck? Yes.  If you can stomach Act I, then you won't be disappointed with title starting in Act II... trust me, I refunded this title 3 other times before and STEAM kindly accepted my refund request each time.

But, the gameplay makes up for the many negatives.",1676039240,1676039240,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Don't bother playing it in a higher difficulty than Normal or potentially Nenemis as the game is already challenging enough if you don't have any particular advantage over your enemy. Since the captains adapt to you combat style, they can easily become almost invisible if you take your time to kill them. But that’s why the nemesis system is awesome! Enemy adaption is really a great idea and is very well implemented in the game. You will have to face dozens of captains during your game and there is this feeling that all captains are unique. The redundancies start to occur after 30h of game, though.
The combats are also a great source of fun. It’s very similar to Shadow of Mordor, so similar to the Batman Arkham series. Fights against captains are hugely influenced by the strength and weakness traits of your enemy but there are enough of these traits to offer multiple combinations that will force you to adapt your style of game. Since each fight is different, it is very hard to get bored even after more than 30h.
On top of that there is the fortress system. You must capture them killing several though enemies while your army and their army are fighting. But when captured, you must defend your fortress so you become the defender and you loose, you will to capture it again.
The graphism is good for a game that will celebrate its 5th birthday this year. No issue to run it at 100+ FPS in 1440p full details with my 1080 Ti.
Only bad point in my opinion: the story. It is not linear so it’s easy to get lost. At the end, it’s just a story of conquest with some more or less memorable quests in the middle. It’s gets better toward the end. You might dislike the faith of your character because it’s probably incompatible with TLOTR lore but it is one of the two options the devs had, and I find it interesting.

The Nemesis System, which creates unique orc captains and allows you to build relationships (or rivalries) with them, is just plain cool.

Seeing the way that different captains react to your actions and remembering them from battle to battle is incredibly satisfying. It's like playing a game within a game, and I could spend hours just messing around with the orcs and seeing what happens.

Unfortunately, the rest of the game is a bit underwhelming. The story and characters are forgettable, and the gameplay can get repetitive. The graphics are nice, but not enough to carry the whole game.

Overall, I'd say that if you're a fan of the orc interactions and want to see more of the world of Middle-earth, then Shadow of War is worth checking out.

It helps to have a love of the Cinematic LOTR universe to truly love this game, and really adds to that I feel rather than just exploiting it, but at the same time it isn't core to the gameplay or fun if you're not bothered.

The Orc nemesis system is even better in this sequel, and for me the arrival of each war-chief remains the highlight of the game. The sheer amount of love and care that has obviously gone into each character I am in awe of, and I honestly barely noticed two warchiefs make the same introduction as another after almost 70 hours of play encountering literally hundreds of them - and still finding character types I hadn't seen before after that time. It's an amazing artistic aspect of the game. 

The combat system and default key bindings - whilst not necessarily where I'd have put them - become absolute second nature after a few hours play, and allow you move around the world using all the various methods, and fight, with both ease and comfort.

The game's biggest downside is only how similar it still is to the prequel. You may well be disappointed with this if you play them back to back, but after several years since the first game I was delighted to return, and there were enough new angles and challenges and story to make it all enticing. The counter-point to this, is that you won't really miss that much except a bit of back-story if you play this one first (or only).

If I had one other minor issue, it would be the constant influx of inventory gear - much of which is clearly useless as you progress - and the lack of a quick and consistent way to dispose and recycle them (some you can 'sell' with one key, others require a sub menu, for no obvious reason). There's also fundamental issues with the Legendary gear being almost universally worse than the best items of Epic and Rare throughout the game, at least until the end-game when you can don most of a full suit above level 60. But none of this affects what you're doing or why as they all just fall in your lap regardless as you progress - the inventory just could have been implemented a bit smoother.

I gather some aspects of the online stuff has been stripped from the game, but I honestly didn't notice what, and I was expecting to, given the warnings. It is of such credit to the devs that they tidied this game up for long-term viability and recognise where it needed this rather than leaving it to just break and be abandoned.

I probably wouldn't (and didn't) buy it at full list price after all this time, but for around just £5 that I paid in the Steam Sale for the Definitive edition, it was bargain of the Century.",1674945010,1674945413,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

So far so good, I am enjoying the pace. I have just come of RDR2 and this is like a breath of fresh air. 

SCORE: a Solid 7/10

GRIPE(s):
I have a few, but for the most part everything is as it should be.
1. The gear you have currently equipped will NOT show in any cut scene, or any alternative skin you obtained. 
2. If you have a female skin equipped the orcs still refers to you as he and him. Not very LBQGT. I am joking... Its just annoying.

COMBAT: 
The combat is entertaining interesting and just challenging enough to keep wanting more. The skill tree progresses nicely and keeps up with the elevation in difficulty. 

Stealth combat in this game is rewarding and not too slow, which often happens. Had that experience with AC Valhalla, where you could stealth infiltrate a base but ending up saying ""screw this"" and letting the proverbial guns blaze. Afterwards always asking, could that have been more rewarding if I stuck to stealth?

RELEVANCE: 
I have to keep reminding myself that this game is 7 years old (as far as I know) I have always liked the Tokien lore, this so far is very true to John's work. 

OTHER NOTES:
The games takes your hand, walks you into the front door, switches on the light in the entrance hall and leaves you there to find the rest out for yourself, but just as you are about to go into the wrong room it grabs your hand. I find this refreshing. You are free to explore at your own pace, fight one on one or do stealth, and like a concerned parent it guides you along the path.

I bought the basic game with no expansions.  

TLDR:  If you enjoy the LOTR universe, and you don't mind that the writers significantly expanded upon Tolkien's story, then I feel this game is worth your money and time.  The writing is good, and the LOTR style and flavor remains, despite it not being canon.

Certainly, if you enjoyed the first game, this one is bigger, better, and even more fun.  I found it addictive and very entertaining, giving it an 8 or 9 on my personal scale.  If you haven't played the first game, this one catches you up in the first 10 minutes, so no worries.

The basic game loop... exploring, combat (both stealth and head-on), revealing the map areas, leveling your character (and eventually, your ""hirelings""), adding powers, abilities, armor and weapons is a joy in this game.

Despite obviously being contrived, the story is still really good, with lots of exciting cut scenes and good acting.  Sauron and his more powerful minions are suitably scary... and while the constant banter of the orcs can be disgusting or even terrifying, it is more often hilarious.

If you choose to thoroughly scour each area before you move on, you'll see your character become unbelievably powerful... though it is possible to go very far (maybe even finish?) the game without focusing on min/maxing or grinding through much combat.  But why?  The grind in this game is SO MUCH FUN.

I enjoyed the combat so much that I kept putting off the story quests for a very long time... I just didn't want it to end!

I've had a handful of minor bugs, but no game-breaking ones.  The game feels very polished, in fact.

Lastly, I purchased this game because I knew it would be better than the first, but also because they removed the microtransactions.  If they hadn't, I simply wouldn't be playing it.  Hats off to WB for removing them!",1674270333,1674271776,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1]Gameplay (9/10)[/h1]
So it's an open world game. What makes it different?
[list]
[*] First of all: Nemesis/army systems. All generals are named, have personalities, strengths weakness guards and such, and YOU can exploit every single one of them by recruiting them, pitting them against each other, etc. 
It's not a complete sandbox experience, but other games only mimic in what this game achieved in gimmicky ways.
[*] Nicely balanced progression system. Progression includes levels, skill tree (unlocks/changes active abilities), equipment, gems and orcs themselves. Most of the game nicely lays out progression to trickle in and give you the feeling of growth.
[*] Action oriented combat. In some ways it's similar to Assassin's creed games, but it feels faster and more dynamic,
[*] Stealth that doesn't slow you down. Unlike in similar games I don't feel like I have to crawl everywhere to avoid getting spotted.
[*] Orcs commanders. They have 3 selling points.
[list]
[*] Orcs are proceduraly generated (?). Dialogs have personalities and don't repeat (at least not that I've seen). Dialogs are contextual, so a commander might talk about how how you failed to kill him with your headshot as he comes back.
[*] They have different combinations of traits, which keeps combat interesting. They can be of different classes, factions (which gives them skills), have relationships to other orcs, be strong or weak to specific things (including your moves).
[*] Stronger orcs serve as a great reward when you recruit them to your own army.
[/list]
[/list]

[b]What brought experience down was 2nd half grind[/b]
At first you collect your army and they are competent. Towards the end of the game you have to do it all again, and despite being the strongest troops you ever had they fold like wet paper. That means you you need re-recruit good chunks of your army several times. That last bit in particular is so drawn out and devoid of substance, I've grown to be tired of everything I loved about first half of the game.

It's not an overstatement to say that they are holding the entire industry back. almost every game would benefit from using the nemesis system. Who would be fairly forgettable enemies in other games.

Combat is like Batman games which I am fond of but a little less flashy, allthough the executions you can during are pretty cool. Nemesis system is also why this game is badass cause it makes things more interesting and has like a personal story that only you can experience. Unfortunately this will be the last good Middle Earth game cause they're making a shitty Golem game that NOBODY asked for. I heard rumors about a batman game that may have the nemesis system but unless its like the Arkham games, im not going to enjoy. and if it even is SLIGHTLY like Gotham knights im going declare WB a dead Franchise. You got rid of Henry Cavil so might as well get rid of the fun in Warner bros games. Dont know if the actual Warner Bros studio has any pull but if they do then this is definetly going to happen.

As for the story, I don't find the plot to be that interesting it does not ruin it for me though, there is just enough substance to make sense on why you're doing what you're doing.

I'd strongly advise playing Shadow of Mordor first if you haven't already just to get a better idea on what's going on, it's paced better so you can get some backstory and character building so you can be be more emotionally invested with the characters. Shadow of War didn't waste any time getting into a frenetic pace, other than introducing the new mechanics quickly and special ""new"" enemies the game wastes no time throwing you into the fray.

Something I noticed instantly, but makes perfect sense and i'll explain why: the enemies' sneak detection and line of sight being much more forgiving in comparsion to the previous game.

Really great design and beautiful graphics. I'm just getting into the LOTR franchise so this being slightly off canon (or completely off canon, idk maybe one day it will be adopted into canon, or not idrc) really only helps me understand the series alittle more, but it really grabs my interest into the lore of the universe.

- Really solid design
- Good Mechanics, awesome perk mechanics
- Nemesis engine 
- Really smooth higher fps

Slight Cons:
- The side quests do adapt from time to time, but they do get a bit repetitive if you keep bouncing around them

is this a good game... subjective
is this game worth buying at current price... depends the console you're playing it, and more importantly how you like to game.

This is a  very solid game, the graphics are to date, the story line and voice acting are fantastic. For those reasons alone, this is a fantastic game. Unfortunately, this is not a game that is cohesive for PC players.

I'll reduce it down to the good, the bad, the ugly.
The good:
-The story, very immersive
-Graphics are exceptional. Very good use of the engine.
-Voice acting is beyond acceptable keeping the story immersive {for the most part}
-Playability: {Oof} You'll get your money's worth out of this game
-Diversity, though most of the AI look the same, it is not a total copy/paste

The bad:
-Despite the creators' efforts of making the AI diverse, they muddy it to the point where you have to pay attention to see any diversity in artwork
-Despite their best efforts, everything becomes muddy and repetitive 
-I do understand and respect how they wanted to make every encounter unique and challenge players based on adaptability; however, most encounters are less about learning and skill and more about learning how to beat specific boss/general/chief/etc. whereas, unfortunately, it is more about learning specific sequences and then playing out repetitive motion.
-Boss/elite/legendary/chief structuring lacks in any kind of imagination, rather seem to absorb time with repetitive controls/moves
-General world AI: this game is massive; however, you can simply run past everything with no real impact or you can spend hundreds of hours fighting every single NPC, which is very immersion-breaking.

The ugly:
-Bosses that learn and leave you doing the same repetitive motion over and over again for what feels like hours 
-Learning bosses: seems like a really good idea until you have to fight one
-Controls: I'm a PC player and it's very obvious this was not created for PC. My space key is used for everything. Along the same line, the controls are janky and confusing with no option to edit {what game does not allow you to change your key binds these days?!?!} Something that is made further frustrating with the 'intelligent AI' that leads to very frustrating and tedious battles with little to no gain. {There are A LOT of these battles}.

In conclusion, I would recommend this game. It has a very immersive story, the controls suck for PC, and the developers missed the mark on intuitive AI. However, you will play this game for hours, as frustrating as they are. So I will both recommend and not recommend this game at the same time based on your gaming platform. In this game, controller is god.

The short of it is that microtransactions killed the potential of this game. Making orcs stronger means spending some time in menus and spending coins rather than training them or sending them on missions.

You're supposed to command an army but you pretty much HAVE to babysit your uruks one mission at a time. 
During a siege, SO MUCH time is spent on watching captains talk, it's unskippable. I usually would enjoy this, but literally in the middle of battle everything would stop so we can listen to them. A captain dies? cutscene. Your captain dies? cutscene. Someone farted? cutscene. It cuts the flow of battle so hard, why can't you let them talk while things are happening? Sure, gestures might be missed but the flow of the game would be 3x better.

Also, pit fights are unskippable. And infiltrating an uruk forces you to watch them... multiple times sometimes...

Yeah, I enjoyed my time, but I enjoyed it for the combat more than anything. This is a leap backwards from everything that Shadow of Mordor revolutionized and it's pathetic.

The only positive thing I have to say is that cheating death is more common, and captains will look for you. Also, double jump i neat.

Shadow of War is the sequel to Shadow of Mordor. While having similar systems and mechanics in place, such as the nemesis system, the combat, parkour, etc, Shadow of War vastly improves on all of them. 

The Gameplay.
Shadow of War has a combat system and parkour system that is very similar to the older Assassins Creed games. The combat flows very well and isn't very jank. You can tailor how you want to fight through the many different skills you can learn through the skill tree (which is vastly superior to Shadow of Mordor), and, while being simple, it's pretty difficult to master as you can easily get stomped by enemies if you don't know what you're doing. Stealth is very simple, not a core mechanic like in Assassins Creed, but its there, and it's fine. Nothing special. Parkour on the other hand is very nice. Again, nothing amazing when compared to Dying Light or Assassins creed which have a focus on parkour, but Shadow of War has a great sense of verticality and flow.

Story and Characters.
Compared to Shadow of Mordor, Shadow of War definitely puts more effort into the story as well as its characters. Its longer play time allows it to flesh out the larger cast of characters better this time (Although most of the characters are kinda sh*t), and explore the alternate version of Middle-Earth that follows Talion. I don't want to spoil the story as it is quite intriguing, but the highlight of the story is the relationship between Celebrimbor and Talion, which is constantly twisting and turning and eventually culminates into a nice climax. Story = 8/10.

The Nemesis System.
The Nemesis System is by far one of the best video game mechanics in any video game ever. What the Nemesis System does is make every small event that happens between the simple orc captains that you encounter throughout the game so much more meaningful. What you thought was a pointless orc captain you killed who had no relevance to you whatsoever, suddenly returns to life after his friends put him back together and is hunting you for revenge. Or how an orc captain taunts you after he encounters you again after defeating you the first time. Or how after to plant a spy in the enemy stronghold, some orc captains might tell you that they know you have a spy in their ranks, and will find him. It makes every encounter unique and never the same twice. 

In conclusion, Shadow of War is great game. Its characters is definitely not its strong suit, but the universe, the plot, the gameplay, the NEMESIS SYSTEM (Please put systems like it in other games) make it such a joy to play.

Pros:
- has good graphics;
- the story is good and entertaining;
- the game mechanics are interesting and engaging ;
- you have a bit of freedom of doing different questlines however you want;
Cons:
- it's very grindy and repetitive; you have to capture 4 fortresess in order to advance the main story; while it sounds easy enough keep in mind that you have to: dominate captains from the defending fortress, you have to level up yourself in order of having a chance of figthing against captains/warchiefs/overlords and you have to set up warchiefs (4) in the fortress so you can capture the assault points faster; all this while being ambushed by other captains or follower orcs who betray you; oh, I almost forgot to mention that you have to keep in mind what strengths/weaknesses the captains/warchiefs/overlords have in order to avoid enraging them;
- the capturing of the fortresses feels tedious and boring, because the amount of time you need to put in capturing them;
- the capturing of the fortresses is approximately 3/4 of the game;
- cartoonish jokes which felt that they didn't belonged in the game's settings; though this isn't such a big issues, I felt it needed to be said;

I honestly took a 1 month break, when I found out that I need to take 3 more fortresses to advance the story, but the captains/warchiefs/overlords were 15-20+ levels above me. 

Galadriel's blade storyline was somewhat entertaining and it provides a continuation of Talion's story. It was a bit awkward, with a mix of cartoonish orcs/jokes and modern feminist cliches. The end boss's background felt like it was written by the Rings of Powers writers.

The Desolation of Mordor is more of a standalone expansion, it's the story of Balanor after he and Talion part ways. It offers a fresh new skills, revigorating the combat system, since Baranor doesn't have a wraith/ring of power/light of Galadriel powers. Also, the capturing of the fortress felt more natural and less grinding.

Writing this review after the end of Act 3, very minor spoilers could be deducted, but trying to keep my keyboard shut. Haven't been in online conquests, haven't started lvl 80 grind yet, I had just finished the main story missions, I am lvl 49. All things considered, I think ideally the story should be finished between lvl 30 and 40. (of course this depends on your difficulty, playstyle, how challenging you want it, etc.)

I have two grudges against the game:
1) defenders and Ologs have some annoying, non-counterable (but in theory, dodgeable) attacks and sometimes there are just too many of them, and can get you in a stun-lock, which doesn't really play as fun
2) sometimes movement control and free-running is wonky, I got stuck in a tower, on a staircase, or little objects that should just be walkable.

These two combined could cause some frustration.

Otherwise, good game with quite a lot of content. Don't listen to those who berate the story, it's actually pretty good (nothing mind-blowingly amazing, but it is good). Orc captain personalities can result in pretty funny/epic/weird-in-a-positive-way moments. But after 20 hours, listening to every captain introducing themselves and taunting Talion after he conquered half of Mordor and slain armies... when player knows they will be 2-hit kill... it gets boring. There should be a level-difference like 15 or 20 when captains just keep their mouths shut.

Devs pulled off open-world pretty well, with separate regions, but collecting 3 different types of items/puzzles could have been a bit more motivating.

Back to the story, during Act 2, the personality of Celebrimbor starts soaking through, main characters' and most of the captains' voice acting, dialogs are good (some of these scratch awesomeness). However, multiple quest lines and separate freedom in leveling results in inconsistency. For example, fighting a battle that supposed to be epic and hard and a challenge, I found myself butchering captains 20 levels below me... You have to find a balance between leveling, free-roaming, sidequesting and doing main quests to maintain a sense of difficulty and variety, because the game won't hold your hands after act 1/lvl 20. There are some minor requirements, but only so much that keep the world consistent, or locked until you have a certain skill unlocked.

I only encountered one game-breaking bug, a specific captain always went to a ghul hunt, reward was +0 XP and when I decided to join him, the game entered a never-ending loading screen. Otherwise, the game is stable, load times are good. Auto-save is brilliant, never had to rollback any progress.",1673226954,1673226954,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I didn't touch the online stuff, just the story and really enjoyed taking fortresses, making ennemies out of certains orks, but farming stuff and leveling my warchiefs was not part of my objective.

The first problem is the inability to aim what you want to aim. To many times you get to hit something that you are not facing, even sometimes in your back. It's a real shame and demonstrate the low quality port of the game to PC, since it should be perfect with a mouse and keyboard. You cannot have a combo system with that kind of problem, you end up losing your hit streak and taking a hit because you wanted to hit a common ork and get countered against an ennemy that you are not allowed to hit in the front.

This issue was also pretty annoying with the parkour system, you would get to do stupid stuff. The worst is probably that some places were bugged and you couldn't climb them and you can't even jump horizontaly. I got stuck on small platforms which was pretty ridiculous.

Other problem: the cutscenes with ork captains taunting you at the beginning of a fight is pretty cool, but when you get to fight 3 or 4 of them, it's interrupts the action too much. Sometimes, at the end of the cutscene, you get some hits in your face because you didn't have control and sometimes you can even see the tooltips of ennemy attacks for you to counter. I have spent some fights with more than 2 minutes cutscenes again and again, 10 secondes fight, 15 seconds cutscene, and it goes on when a captain flees or get executed, so you potentialy get 10 cutscenes in a single 3 minutes fight, which was kind of annoying.

Last issue was with the camera: never fight close to a wall as you will not a thing and you won't even see ennemies attacking you. It's sad because it's a very common issue in games nowadays that should not exist in a AAA game.


I'm only highlighting the problems, but I had a good time overall. This game can be pretty unnerving sometimes, especially during the toughest fights.",1673176842,1673176842,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After the Shadow of Mordor, this game's story is child-play. That one was the first entrance to this glorious world with nice revenge plot that also gives you some different explanation on the rings' creation. The Shadow of War's story is almost non-existent when you compare it with that. Almost nothing to remember.

Initial reason to come to Shadow of Mordor was to taste the atmosphere of Middle-Earth. SoW has more of it. A lot more of it. To the degree of tediousness and repeating and grinding over and over. 

Nemesis System is really nice, still really nice. Maybe there are some upgrades from SoM, but it's been some time I played SoM, so not really sure about it. But it is really enjoyable for firts 1-2 forts. Then it turns into a chore. 

Listening to every single Orc Captain to talk is outright annoying. I don't care about any of them, why do I need to listen their insults without being able to skip it. I mean, Bright Lord, one who brings Mordor to its knees, is unable to shut the haters up and have to listen to their garbage. Unbelievable. 

And since there is so much of grinding, these kind of (normally) small annoyances, become big issues. Like when a Captain gets Enraged/Terrified you gotta focus on them and watch. Totally destroys the fluidity of the gameplay.

I loved the Fight Pits though. Each Captain with their own strengths/weaknesses and you just throw them in to fight with each other, yours win, they level up, enemy win, you just dominate them to have even better army. Tediousness aside, it was really fun to participate in them. Good management side-game. 

I think the collectible amount was just right, and most of them was somehow relevant, not too far from where you would go, and with a in-game mini-game to locate them easily.

I could(and tried!) to write a long review about why I love SOW but decided no one will read that and I should simplify it.

SOW is a better game that its predecessor, it improves on everything the original did and all of its ""new"" systems fit in perfectly and compliment what was already there, although SOM itself isn't a bad game and holds up decent SOW has simply improved in every way imaginable upon its systems.

Play both if you're able, but if you are somehow incapable of playing both then play SOW.",1672710129,1672710129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game definitely powered up in nemesis system, worlds, hierarchy, orcs personalities and war/defense system. Underrated games at the time that should be more bigger than it should.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+ A great upgrades from Shadow of Mordor in every aspect
+ Graphics isn't the best but not heavy enough for my PC so it can run 60fps in medium settings
+ Nemesis System upgraded greatly, more challenge, more scenarios, more personality, more consequences, more challenge
+ Armor upgrades while the looks mostly repetitive, the skills with it is different and sometimes its fun to mix & match certain items to kill a captain
+ Online Invasion of other players orcs sometimes annoying but challenging. My lvl 30 talion invaded with lvl 60 Ologs one time and I almost died multiple times. But the reward killing them is truly satisfying lol.
+ Online defense/Raid is also fun. Sometimes I imagined how bad My own fortress againts other player that clearly more skilled than me lol.
+ The DLC of Eltariel and Baranor is worth it. But I hoped it was longer and had much depths. They played differently than Talion especially Baranor. I feel like Batman lol

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The annoying Elves running that we must keep pressing spacebar and lost focus is annoying, why we can't have horse or truly owned Caragors? Don't forget this game isnt like Assassins Creed that certain boulder/walls/etc. Isn't climbable and suddenly stop you from running, no falling down or jumping to parkour back. Theres obvious gap between 2 boulders or craters that we can shoot or jump but the game just wont let you do it. The Parkour still pale againt's AC series capability lol.
- Those Wraith moves sometimes get you stuck on walls, halting us from progress killing warchiefs/captains/take over outposts. Thankfully you can escape with fast travel and can resume the attacks while not restarting the missions before.
- Sneak almost doesn't mean anything later in game, they dealt barely any damages except the captain is mortal/instant kill with it and many orcs valiant againts stealth. Almost entire orcs has it after I conquer 2nd city. So focusing on executions, wraith wrath, elemental supershot is better than stealth
- Bodyguard Orcs isn't useful at all except for Eltariel DLC. Bodyguards ended up death and makes me wasting my time upgrading them, especially in Baranor DLC human bodyguard is the worst. Don't bother invest in them except for guarding outpost or filling certain spots that seems dangerous.
- The captain upgrades in the game is either help them fight creatures, vs other captains, vs other captains in arena, or spend the upgrades coins in the ""former lootbox"" menu. The upgrades also annoying we must hold enter for 5 seconds and watching they gloried each time, such a long progress and annoying we can only upgrade 5 level each while we are in lvl 80 and visiting our 1st taken city with lvl 20 ish captains. 
- The only gears that matter to upgrade is the rare ones, the only good loking also the rare ones. Why bother upgrading and getting the epic/legendary? Except for coins only??
- This is personal, [spoiler]but I hated how the story ends. Like what happen in SoM and first half of SoW doesnt matter. Switching from Talion to Eltariel who is introduced shallowly in the story is a bad move, i hated Celebrimbor now. The end of Talion story he just turned evil and hollow as nazgul. The end he freed bcs of the hobbits. It felt ""Middle Earth Shadow of"" series doesnt matter at all. I know this isnt canon but I just felt sad to Talion.[/spoiler]

I hoped Nemesis system in this game return to other games, rumor said [strike]Gotham Knights[/strike] (Well they F*ck it up ladies and gentlemen) or Suicide Squads will implement this system. But I really hoped they don't botch it. Recommended game...",1642497937,1672687131,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Not just from the content, but also the press surrounding it, how it went in heavily on microtransactions and even has a Orc Merchant character who smirks and cheers whenever you spend money to get random Orcs in these lootboxes.

This has been changed and gutted, but it's clear that this game was built with that in mind from the very beginning as all Orcs and Equipment have a rarity value that plays exactly like mobile games and MMOs (Commons, rares, epics, legendaries being the highest) making it a fact that cannot be ignored as it permeates every part of this game. That said, let's talk about the gameplay.

All I really have to say about storyline and gameplay is that if you enjoyed the first game, then you'll certainly enjoy this one. Especially in it's current state and not how it used to be prevalent with micro-transaction filth. Now it's a far better game, though flaws have been cleaned up too. However you also still have things like daily challenges and ect that remind you of it's failed attempt to be a full-priced game that was lousy with Micro-transactions.

The story essentially continuing the fight and battle from the first game, but then getting wiped out by the Dark Lord and having to start over. Interesting idea, however the only issue I have with this is you don't start with the ability to dominate Orcs and we all know that's one of the most fun bits of this game is dominating and controlling legions of Orcs. There's even a mechanic later of bringing them back from the dead to be zombies that are under your control!

With many side-missions to keep you entertained for hours, one of the things I hated using was the fighting pit. You have no control over your Orc as they fight a different orc and even if yours is a Legendary that you've leveled up, improved their abilities and more, they can still be defeated by a Common at half it's level making you curse the fighting pits and just getting on with the far more interesting side-missions like collecting artefacts, uncovering the past or finding Shelob's fragments that are scattered throughout the world and give you a look in her role for the rise of the dark lord.

Shelob has the ability to turn into a sexy woman, because, it's not like that's been done a billion times before! Though I admit she did have the voice of the very sexy Claudia Black so I also would like to give it a pass too. You get an ability to summon spiders if you find all of them, but it's a shame that the spiders come in only one size catagory and you can't, for example, have a Caragor-sized spider to charge around on, but that's a minor thing and it's especially fun when you're hunting a captain who is terrified of spiders so you immediately break him.

Without giving spoilers, the ending is certainly an interesting one and gives you a reason to come back and keep playing it and in a way that fits the narrative of the story, even giving you new powers and abilities to try out.

The game currently comes on sale quite often so if you're interested in more Shadow of Mordor, then certainly go ahead. If you want a fun action game then this is certainly fun and worth the price it often is on sale. Especially if you can get all the DLC to mess with extra characters and stories.",1672461423,1672461423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Ironic for a game set in the magnificently written Lord of the Rings universe, the story is that of Gondorian football jock / family man Tallion and the elf equivalent of Walter White. That is all you need to know, or ever will care to know. 

Sometimes the spider lady with the voice of Reverb makes her jiggly appearance with very high cheekbones, to say something incomprehensible. You will also frequently be joined by Mean Girl Elf 1 and 2. They are indistinguishable. 

As long as you repeatedly make your best Calibrimbor voice impression of, ""Tallion, we need to cook,"" every time you respawn, the story is perfectly adequate to ignore as you wreck Orc lives.

And wreck Orc lives you will, because they are the most enjoyable part of this game. Nemesis System is cool as hell. 

Every time you get killed by one of these ugly knobs, they level up and remember you. Every fun thing you do in this game will revolve around this. Either capturing them as you endure the main quest to get the Domination ability, or roaring in annoyance that your Drain ability no longer gives you elf shot when you drain, making that awesome Shadow Whatever ability jump you across the map and up the ass of some archer to recharge the 2 elf shot this cool ninja elf bullshit uses to murder them all. If you cold use Drain and Dominate, all my complaints about this game would end there.

The powers are very fun used in combination with each other, and the weapons all have cool synergies as well. Getting a sword that does fire damage on crits, and a hood that  that doubles crits, and another armor that doubles fire damage, is awesome. 

It is a roaring good time, total entertainment, very fun gameplay. 

8/10 only because the story is ironically passable for such a legendary franchise from one of the 20th Century's greatest minds and a cultural treasure. The only lasting narrative legacy I will hold from this game is that Hammer Elf is selling Elf Meth in those Rings, and no one can take that from me. 

Also, fuck the Orc Hoggrief in particular. Motherfucker was level 50 when I was 30 and haunted me across Middle Earth like a disease. I had to beat him, barely, after dying half a dozen times, shaming him into total slobbering madness before he was finally able to be dominated. 

Hilarious, and I will never forget it. 10/10 just for that, would be Man Swine again.",1672254790,1672434074,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] One man army [/b]

I was dicking around in  Cirith Ungol, brutalizing orcs, blowing up barrels of grog, you know the fun stuff. It was going fine until I stumbled across a  trap mission for a warchief and I fully believed that I was capable enough to kill this warchief. So I  accepted it and went to kill Ghash the Merciful (mind you I did not gather Intel for this) I infiltrated his fort and went to activate the trap. It activated and we started to fight. It was a standard fight for me, until I start to  mess up my attacks. He was able to get the best of me and instead of  striking me down, he outright humiliated me. I got up and  continued to fight In the middle of this, I get ambushed by a Orc captain that I forgot the name of, so we will refer to him as Olaf. He kept diverting my attention to him as I tried to kill of Ghash. He,again, got the best of me and humiliated me.

I continued to fight Olaf and Ghash, when another Captain called Shaka the glory hunter ambushed me. These 3 were just  too much for me and for the last time I got bested. But not by a captain, but by a random grunt. This grunt was called Krakhorn, and after ending my life, he gives himself the nickname of Krakhorn the Tark Slayer and was promoted to captain. The other 3 also got leveled up and I truly wasn't going to let that slide. So I began hunting. But before I did that I got alot of intel from worms, even for unknown captains

[b] Confused Climbing [/b]

My first target was Olaf as he was the closest. He was situated in a high platform in some mining quarry and thought this would be a piece of cake.

It was not.

My blind ass just attempted to bullshit ways up to that high platform. I tried to jump my way across, I climbed  structures not even remotely connected to the high platform. Not to mention that I kept missing jumps and keep falling to the bottom.  On one of these climbs I found one of the random unknown captains I gained intel for, Flargo (that was not his name but i forgot it) the fire hawk. His attacks were fire based but weirdly was mortally wounded by fire attacks. I made short work of him and continued my climb. After many attempts , I finally made it all the way to the platform where I find Olaf. It was just me and him. 

A EPIC BATTLE THAT WIL- Nah I am just kidding I made quick work of him. I jumped all the way down and went to my next hunt.

[b] Payback [/b]

My next target was Krakhorn the Tark Slayer, the random grunt who killed me. He was meeting with another orc captain, Golm the inscrutable. I went to gain intel from a worm for Golm where I learn that he was mortally afraid by stealth attacks, so I was able to make him run away when I attack Krakhorn. I attack Golm, making him run away, leaving only me and Krakhorn. He was admittedly another easy fight, only taking a few minutes to fight. As I was leaving the area to fight Shaka, I get ambushed by a orc captain, Shag the gambler.

I already knew Shag, I sent a death threat to him and intended to deal with him later once I am finished. I guess he wanted to deal with me. He was a much harder fight than Krakhorn. As I almost got the best of him, he started to flee. I wasn't going to let him go now. I made chase after him. We rush through armies of orcs, each trying  to kill me as I elven ran towards him and was able to shoot him down, shagging shag with a arrow.

[b] DEJA VU [/b]

Shaka was situated in the same fort where I got killed at , so I know the area already. I was ready to end the Glory hunter...

...UNTIL I got ambushed by the weirdest captain I have met, Bagga the Bard. He introduced him with a SONG, A F#$%ING  SONG. I was not able to land hits due to him being a trickster type. So I skedaddled out of there and went to find a worm. Turns out I already had intel on this idiot. He was mortally wounded by stealth attacks, so thats what I did. I stealth killed him and got rid of my least favourite captain.

Anywho, I found Shaka in the middle of the same place the last I saw him and start to fight him. My fight against him was way easier due to the lack of captains. As I ended Shaka, I got ambushed by Maku the crazy, just like last time. Although Maku was relatively a low level to me, so I killed him easily.

Now time to find Ghash

[b] Last ditch attempt [/b]

I screwed up. 

I was in the search area when I truly got ambushed by a captain,Ur Lisak the Herald. No seriously, he just randomly attacked me before he introduced himself. He was a olog so I had a difficult time killing him. So I went to find a worm to find some intel. He was mortally wounded by stealth attacks, so I had to get out of enemy sight to silently kill him. While I was doing this, I got out of the mission area, which failed me, making Ghash nowhere to be found. I killed Ur Lisak and attempt to find Ghash in the area, which led to nothing. 

I had seemingly failed my revenge, until I notice the bodyguard system. With Ghash being a warchief, a orc captain was his bodyguard. Flak tasty (what kinda name is that!?). So I hunted him down, in hopes of finding Ghash when I found him. I did not find Ghash, I just killed a captain for nothing.

So in defeat, I did the unthinkable, I did a story quest. In this quest, I found out the actual function of the bodyguard system and was able to kill another captain, Koth the Chop. When I finished this mission, I got a new trap mission thinking that this will bring me to the warchief that Koth was protecting.

I read his name and it was....... GHASH THE MERCIFUL?

[b] The alpha [/b]

Blah blah, I got ambushed by a orc captain and I holocaust'd him.

As I went to activate the trap mission,  ANOTHER captain ambushed me, Ronk the fearless. I ran away from him, with the intent of locating a worm to find a weakness. He was heavily damaged by stealth, is what i gain from the intel. When I attacked him, I mistakenly started the trap mission, which brought Ghash out. So  now, I fought against a Orc warchief, a orc captain and was surrounded by multiple orcs. I caused Ronk to become enraged, which in turn made Ghash enrage as he was bloodlusted. With these two being enraged, they started to fight. And when I was just so close on killing Ghash, Ronk took my glory and stole my kill. He then shortly after that, killed me.

I was enraged, I wasted so long just to get my revenge for only a random orc captain to steal it from me and kill me.

I wasn't going to let that slide.

[b] Finale [/b]

I will cut to the chase.

I am pursuing Ronk through Cirith Ungol, where he led me to a attack. I called in reinforcements which led them to killing the enemies there, but also led to their demise. Leaving only me and Ronk to duke it out.
As I mentioned before, Ronk was a savage, a enemy I had difficulty dealing with, which only made the fight harder. He was also a tank, which made any hit less. But I was too determined to lose, and after 5 minutes, I was able to  get Ronk down, who in turn DEATH DEFY ME and we continue to fight. He was able to counter my vaults now, which only made the fight way harder.

But finally, as I land the final blow, he begs for death, he  yearns for me to kill him, and since I was in act one, that is what I gave him. I amputated his arms and pinned him down with my sword. My revenge, although incomplete, is fulfilled.

I've seen some people speak positively about them but personally I cannot fathom how you would get any enjoyment out of your game getting interrupted every 2 minutes to watch an orc dance back and forth for a full fucking minute. I'd almost find it less offensive if they just replaced it with ads because then at least someone would be making money off of it. As it stands right now it's literally just a waste of life. 

Even disregarding that, movement is super clunky and there's a huge delay between when you hit the W key and when your character moves even if you're running at 60 fps. Random terrain items will randomly block you and you can't jump over them. It's a decent game but there's a lot of very basic shit that would greatly improve the gameplay.

With that out of the way  can tell you if you like unique games as well as fighting games this might just be up your alley. Even if you're not familiar with LOTR and even if - like me - you didn't like the first entry. 
Actually the story isn't all that important. It's not boring or anything but you'll spend the most time raising an orc army by fighting orcs, shaming orcs, dominating orcs and listening to the unique dialogue of orcs. So while your protagonist is as serious as they come you will notice rather quickly that this game is a loveletter to lighthearted carnage. The combat doesn't get too repetitive because there's countless combinations of traits the orcs can possibly have and because each foe has unique attire and dialogue (at least the named ones which any single orc can become by killing you). You will meet familiar faces between playthroughs but during one run surprisingly little gets ever reused.

Playing on higher difficulty is incredibly frustrating because of how quirky the mechanics are. You might just die during a siege because the game has decided you wanted to jump over a grunt into a landmine...

Even though it's an RPG, it doesn't have many of the RPG elements you would expect from a game of this era. The elements it does have are shallow in comparison to it's competition. However, it shines as an action game. They give you an absolutely CHONKY tool belt with which you can obliterate every Uruk you see. This plays way more like Arkham Knight than it does The Witcher.

All of that makes for many fun hours of play with minimal grinding. Other reviews covered these positives better than I can, so I'll leave it at that. 

The only major negatives are (a) the controls and the tremendous lag that go with them and (b) many many crashes, some causing BSOD's on Win 10.

(a) Controls - I played on nemesis difficulty with KB+M and the controls were infuriatingly sluggish and muddled - sometimes Talion is just standing there and still takes a while to respond to inputs, IDK why. What's worse is the context-specific controls where the same key/button has different functions. So e.g. <SPACE> can be either jump, dodge, or run (instead of the default walk). Imagine trying to dodge/run near a wall and the game decides you meant to jump onto it. Or trying to jump onto a wall and the game decides you were trying to run/dodge into it. 🤦‍♂️ Now imagine all this happening hundreds, if not thousands of times over the course of the entire game during various fights. Plus the camera gets messed up near walls, it stays loosely focused from the wall behind Talion onto the enemies in front of him so you can't even see him while he's getting pummeled. Yeah, you get the idea. Not fun.

(b) Crashes - Long story short, verified game file integrity many times through the Steam app but it never showed any issues. I finally reduced the crashes to a manageable amount by turning down some graphics settings and closing all other background apps while playing the game. Though it doesn't make sense why higher graphics settings should cause Nvidia driver crashes (1080 Ti + Windows 10 22H2 + 10th Gen i5 + 32 GB RAM) and BSODs, at worst it should just reduce the frame rate. The reason why I think it's a game issue and not my system is the crashes/hangs always happened while loading the next level/area or cutscene. Never during actual gameplay. If it was an issue with my system, the game would've crashed while actually playing, during a graphics/CPU intensive scene. Also, nothing like this happened with any other game I've played on this system, some of those games being newer and//or more demanding.

Overall, I'd rate this game an 8/10. It's a pity, because it would have easily been a 9.5+ if it wasn't for the above and would've qualified as one of my favorite games of all time - the rest of the gameplay is a whole lot of fun.",1671661546,1671662445,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

edit: after the 104th hour I got a random online conquest that popped up with a necromancer. Still never seen one naturally through constant captain genocide

update
constant bugs & glitches make the game unplayable especially if youre actually trying to do, anything. Was in a defense war, they didnt even break the walls, 3rd wave came in i believe it was, one dude had no chance perk, keep this in mind, im fighting, on the other side of the fucking siege from him, and somehow, the units that were attacking me, which i dodged, did a 180, in their animation, and both hit me, killing me, yet, instead of them ""killing me"" and i just get out with my perks, the fucker from across the map with no chance gets me, when he was nowhere near me, or had any LOS.

Update, this ruined the game for me and I quit from 2017 to 2021.

Started playing regularly again in 2022 just doing side objectives to hit 100%, still random bugs & annoyances although when u stop caring & just kinda mess around it's enjoyable, pit fights especially. Ended up modding with cheat-engine for inf money & I took the (spoiler) quest necromancer orc as my own and set him up as an overlord for shits & giggles.

Haven't hit the ""true ending"" still as I don't really defend too much, especially after the last occurrence in 2017 though I plan on getting 100% and it will be the last thing I do, hopefully, to put this game to rest & off my mind.

The graphics are absolutely stunning, and the character movement is almost photographically lifelike. The ""Nemesis"" foe management process is interesting and adds an element of development for the opponents. Although it is a ""Middle Earth"" game, the association with the Lord of the Rings is very tenuous and feels almost gratuitous. So, even though Gollum does appear for a few scenes, don't be looking for your favorite LOTR references. But that's OK - the action of the game is snappy and the combat is not at all contrived or awkward. The ONLY shortcoming that I would mention is the lack of a story line with any depth. This results in the game ending with no real sense of glory at the denouement. But, do not despair. This is a hack-and-slash royale and, well, you get to kill some orcs. A LOT of orcs.

But once you get past that barrier, it's absolutely phenomenal. The old review outlines why, and it is still very difficult, but i have learned to accept it, and infact, love it.

old review: [strike] I'll start off by addressing the fact that they improved most systems across the board compared to the first game. Combat feels more lively, the healing system is better, the way you fight monsters is vastly improved, they added big orcs which are awesome to fight.

I feel like all of this is ruined by how the new nemesis system works. In some areas, it is way better, being overall more dynamic with them having more personalities and generally feeling much more interesting, but what really ruins it for me is the difficulty of some of them. 

They adapt to most of your moves over time, which can make some fights outright impossible (e.g defender getting immune to your stun + vault), and then i'd think ""Well let's try stealth"", but for some reason, they can wind up randomly disappearing, or i guess running away, but it never prompted that so i was just left confused and annoyed at the fact that i spent 5 minutes fighting someone, only for them to run away when i made a quick ""tactical retreat"". 

I am sure i just need to get better at the game, but i have had many, many moments where i thought ""Why did that happen? Why is this happening?"", a good example of that are ranged enemies, especially a ranged nemesis. they can do SO much damage, hit very accurately, and fire quite fast. Sure i could go in and fight them up close, but then there's some random orc that fires off a horn, and then i am absolutely surrounded by enemies, meaning i can only go around and hide, weirdly taking out the horde slowly, making it a tedious, slow fight.

Again, i could just suck, but i have had way too much frustration to warrant playing it any further, and so i also decided to leave this review. [/strike]",1671323833,1671471886,True,0,0,0.47999998927116394,0,True,False,False

The game is so boring that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Eighty percent of the missions are the same - go somewhere, kill the orcs, then kill the captain, the end. Over and over again. Everything repeats ad nausea. The mandatory siege missions are what broke me. Kill warlord, kill warlord, kill warlord, kill warlord, kill overlord, repeat five times. And after capturing all the fortresses, you have to go through about 20 defensive missions to reach the end. The grind is insane. The worst Ubisoft games don't compare to this.

They've added loot this time, and it's the most boring action RPG loot you can imagine. 95% of what you find is garbage. But you still have to go to the menus every 10 minutes and check and disassemble items.

Managing your army is another chore you have to do, and again it's just clicking through menus. Like a crappy football management simulator.

Even the leveling is broken. At 30% into the game I unlocked all the skills and perks I wanted and from then on it was just a matter of unlocking perks I didn't want to use (because each skill has multiple perks, but you can only have one active).

And the orc speeches. Oh god. They constantly interrupt the gameplay. You just want to fight, but the game is interrupted by every orc captain telling you their life story in an UNSKIPPABLE cutscene. They just talk and talk and never have anything interesting to say, it's just taunts and threats.

Once you reach a certain level in the ranks of online conquest, there's nothing but scumbag cheaters clogging the ranked fortresses with their cheated orcs.

I'm just throwing this up because its always very sad to see a dev completely neglect to remove obvious cheaters.

This review is only about the base game, expansion reviews I've written on the dedicated DLC pages

Overall this is a great all-round fun experience. That really shines through innovative gameplay and despite being an open world game a very focused gameplay vision. Where the devs manage to keep gameplay fresh and find new ways to freshen up the experience the deeper into the game you get so that it doesn't become a repetitive boring slog.

In terms of story, there is a solid story that definitely helps hold the experience together and give you reasons for what you are doing in the game. Perhaps the best part about the story are the flashback scenes which tell a bit more about the origins of the rings of power and how the different Nazgul came to acquire them and become Nazgul. What is particularly interesting here is if you contrast this with how the Amazon series shows the creation of the Rings of Power and the deception by Sauron vs how this game shows it in the flashbacks. This game does a much much better job of it. Neither are canon anyway so it is a fair comparison and this is substantially lower budget production than the billion dollar production of Amazon's Rings of Power. The writers on this game did a much better job telling the same exact story and just seeing glimpses of it makes me really sad to see what could have been had better writers done the Amazon series.

The Rings of Power flashbacks aside, in the Lord of the Rings movies the Nazgul beyond the Witch King all come across as one and the same. But in the game they've done well to make each Nazgul be unique, have their own identity and associated flashbacks to show their brief origin story so-to-speak. Additionally, it was also a great creative idea to make Shelob be such an important character and I actually prefer their creative vision about Shelob over the canon version of Shelob by Tolkien. That's no small achievement! Few writers can top canon.

Gameplay wise a lot of improvements have been made since the first Middle-Earth Shadow of Mordor game. There is a large skill tree with options to pick from to really make Talion fight in your preferred playstyle and if that's not enough you have legendary gear sets to find and acquire that give you unique new passive abilities to further focus on a unique playstyles that suits you. This is a great addition to the game and I wish more open world RPG's had these kind of stuff that build towards making your character a completely different beast towards the end-game. In my case I love to use beasts to kill orcs and thus I went for the the legendary gear set that combined with my skill tree selection lets me instantly tame any beast in the game even drakes!

Speaking of end-game gear sets.... Another brilliant thing this game does that I've actually never seen any other games do is despite being open world they use story acts that kind of change and evolve the world with the story as it progresses but also lets them change up the gameplay by having stuff happen to your character that then gives you new abilities or even swaps out entire ability sets. I won't spoil it but the end-game in this game is perhaps one of the best I've ever seen in any open world game.

The music is great, the sound design is visceral, the visuals are stunning with highly detailed high resolution graphics (especially thanks to the 4K free texture DLC pack). The game is well optimised and on my i9 9900K + RTX 2080 running the game maxed out at 1440p I had a smooth FPS ranging between 100 to 140 FPS with few to no dips under the 100 FPS.

Voice acting is very well done with professional A+++ tier voice actors who are famous for their other voice acting works across multiple games and animated series and movies. I can't even imagine how much voice acting was done for this game as with the nemesis system of the orcs I never once encountered the same voice or same voice line multiple times. Each orc captain has multiple voice lines all seemingly done by different voice actors (with some possibly done by the same voice actor but doing a different voice so you don't recognise it as the same voice actor).

The nemesis system continues to be a great innovation and I love how the system reacts to how you are playing it. I was hunting collectibles for a bit and kept running away from fights using elven speed. After running away from 3 captains I suddenly got ambushed while sprinting away by an captain who commented on the fact I love to run away from fights and he won't let me run away anymore. That was quite the surprise.

I've had similar things happen where I kept opening on orc Captains with stealth attacks (if they were vulnerable to it) and then while sneaking around an orc base I suddenly got ambushed by a captain commenting on the fact I love to sneak around.

Other ambushes seem to be more random based and just happen based on time or other triggers in the nemesis system, but overall this reaction to how you play is great. Especially when a captain adapts to you using the same combat abilities too much. Be it executions, counters, jumping over them etc.... Do that too much and they adapt and you can no longer do that to them.

The game gives you a fair fighting chance though through your powerful abilities combined with a summonable mount and bodyguard. If you manage to recruit a powerful orc captain and turn him in your bodyguard it can really make a big difference in the fights as unlike other games, in Shadow of War NPCs you recruit remain as powerful as they were when you fought them. I wish more games did this.

I should mention that the game does still have a few bugs left after all these years that were never patched out. One recurring issue I had is that nemesis missions kept bugging out on me. So if I entered the mission as soon as I would move the mission would automatically fail. Not game breaking but definitely a bit of a frustration. I had a few other bugs here and there.

While I've reviewed the two DLC on their appropriate Steam pages, I will say that the DLC are very good and very innovative offering completely different gameplay from what the base game offers. I thoroughly enjoyed the DLCs for this game.

Highly recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of games like Witcher, Assassin's Creed, God of War, etc... then you will probably love this game as well. I would say to play the first game first, Shadow of Mordor. But even if you haven't this game remains fun and enjoyable.

You will spend the majority of your time hunting down orcs to recruit, helping them level up, customizing them with training orders, growing your army, laying siege to fortresses and outposts, and eventually defending them. As you grow in power, you will become an unstoppable nightmare, and only the most stacked captains will provide a modicum of challenge. This definitely feels intentional. If you're like me, you'll enjoy collecting orcs like Pokemon and seeking captains with cool looks or strange/interesting/funny dialogue.

War feels like a coalescence of everything Mordor was trying to do. The combat is more satisfying, movement is freer, the world is much larger, and the nemesis system has more depth. There are plenty of challenges to complete, collectibles to gather, and abilities to experiment with.

the regions in this game are a lot better than the first ones. the first game had two regions and they both felt  gray, boring, and empty. the second game has five regions, plus one more that requires the Desolation of mordor dlc to play. the regions are more colorful, have more unique areas, and are generally better. 

the combat system is mostly the same as the first games one, and while there are some new abilities that improve the gameplay slightly, its nothing too huge  

this game implements lots of new mechanics, like seigeing fortresses, putting dominated orcs against enemies in the fight pits, and the nemesis system which is what the game is known for, has been improved upon. each interaction with an orc captain changes what will happen the next time you meet with them. if you kill a captain they could come back to life. if you dominate a captain, they could betray you. theres lots of possibilities. dont forget that theres a new enemy called olog hai, basically big trolls twice the size of normal uruk captains. 

the story is pretty good, and feels satisfying when you finally beat it. its pretty long, and in the epilogue at the end of the game, issues have been fixed. ive heard that the epilogue used to take hours of constant, boring grinding to beat, but now its reasonably quick and can be beaten in a few hours. 

the game has been fixed more than when it came out. ive looked at some reviews of this game when it first came out, and it appears a lot of issues that they had has been fixed. first of all, all microtransactions have been completely removed, which means you cant pay to get the best orcs and gear. i have not had any problems with bugs, so it seems that it has been mostly patched.  

onto the negatives. there really isnt that much that is bad about this game, except that sometimes it can feel like an absolute grind and get a little stale/boring/hard sometimes. also hunting down captains for your army, branding and dominating them, and repeating can get really boring sometimes. apart from that, theres not really anything else bad about this game",1670963004,1670963004,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]
Shadow of War nowadays is considered a [b] must [/b] have game for the diehard fans of the L.O.T.R. franchise. Even though it does not follow the story of the book, it describes an amazing adventure that can please even the most demanding players. Like its predecessor, Shadow of Mordor, the game is an epic story-driven action RPG game, where you utilize the power of the ring to its full potential. You fight and recruit armies of orcs that sometimes lead to epic battles, alliances and even betrayals. I enjoy the game in its highest difficulty since it adapts to the needs and the playstyle of the player.

[h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1]
[h3] Summary [/h3]
In Shadow of War, we are following Talion who is still infused with the ancient lord Celebrimbor, in their attempts to defeat the Dark Lord. This time, both travel to Mount Doom, where they forge a new Ring of Power, free of Sauron's corruption. Celebrimbor believes that the ring could be controlled, thus giving the wielder the ability to become the new King. Talion, who is not as interested in power, believes that Celebrimbor`s cause is just and they both decide to face Sauron and his Nazgul army in Mordor.

[h3] Development [/h3]
Shadow of War’s plot is a very delicate matter. As mentioned before, the game sometimes even completely breaks the lore, with the addition of characters like Shelob or the necromancer Zog etc… The fanbase was quite mad with some of the character progression, and the ending frustrated the hell out of the community as well. I agree with some statements, but not all of them are accurate for the reasons mentioned below. During your whole playthrough, the stronger emphasis is on the relation of Talion and Celembrimbor. Both begin to question their motives, as according to them, peace should be achieved differently. Celembrimbor’s opinion revolves around control, whereas Talion’s opinion around freedom. They both make valid points and force the player to question the morality of the cause, thus giving a neat touch to the interactive nature of the game.

[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]
The free-flow combat as well as its parkour aspect are both thrilling and mesmerizing at the same time. You can really ‘feel’ the power of the ring, as its combos and the surprising changes in certain ‘loved’ (by fans) abilities leave a special charm. The skill tree in my opinion is very well made and you can always switch playstyles to adapt to your different needs. Last but not least, the game revolves around repetition, grinding and careful planning, that’s why it takes time before Shadow of War reveals its true potential.

[h3] Progression [/h3]
I enjoyed the different unique personalities you encounter during your playthroughs, both by ncps and protagonists alike. The main cast express feelings that can be relatable to our own. Their interactions concerning death and defeat, approach those of the true world, thus making their conversation more memorable and appealing. Furthermore, their adventures are not l. The lore has been tweaked, depending on the needs of the game. Shelob, as we all know is not considered a valid character in the books. On the contrary, she is just a deadly spider. This is not the problem though. I personally welcome changes, as long as they are properly made. However, certain plot holes can not be unnoticed. For example, the ability to summon Balrogs by certain [b] special [/b] orcs was baffling to me. How the hell can an orc move a stick and at the same time revive a demon? At least explain the process. Overall, the plot is decent but I cannot compare it to its supreme [b] gameplay [/b] style.

[h3] Scaling [/h3]
Equipment is primarily obtained by defeating Orc Captains and completing missions in Shadow of War. More difficult Orcs with higher rarities will drop gear that matches their rarity. You can upgrade the gear in the future, to match your level by coins or by completing a given [b] challenge [/b]. Legendary armour sets provide bonus stats, making Talion a deadly machine. During your adventures, you will encounter orcs with different specialities and levels. The rarity varies from common to legendary. What rarity Orcs spawn at, is out of your hands, however, it is worth tracking them down and claiming them as your own. That's why, look carefully at the nemesis system, since some orcs are very rare to encounter! Most of the time, higher tier Orcs will have some immunities and strengths. You can exploit them to your advantage, by tracking down a [b] Worm. [/b] For example, some orcs are immune to arrows etc... [b] Fortress captains [/b] tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so be careful with that. Plan your ambush and get prepared before joining a fight.

[h3] Nemesis system [/h3]
Even though certain aspects remain the same like in the original, some tweaks make it more interactive and thus more enjoyable than the previous game. It is high risk - high reward play in other words, so choose your approach carefully.

[b] You can send death threats [/b] 
In that way, you upgrade the gear quality obtained by an enemy orc. On the downside, the targeted champion comes well prepared, setting a trap of his own. The encounter becomes harder and you risk defeat. 

[b] Orc development [/b]
It feels like magic how each orc evolves, depending on whether you make them an ally, shame them or simply cut them into pieces. I humiliated an orc so many times, that after some point he became obsessed with me! Your actions now have consequences, so do not be surprised if an enemy or ally champion cheats death, just so that he can serve you or even worse, kill you.

[b] You can send ambushes [/b]
Ally champions join the fight. Encounters become easier, but you are risking the life of your companion. With this strategy, you can also level up your orcs!

[b] You can send spies to infiltrate the enemy lines [/b]
Your champion needs to defeat an enemy captain in the [b] the arena [/b] to take the enemy's place. There are lots of benefits to this technique. However, there are also some risks. If your orc is defeated in the arena or for some reason is caught by the fortress master. Then, it is guaranteed you will bid him fair well, as he gonna meet his maker (forever ???). If he wins though, he may even become the personal bodyguard of [b] the Fortress Captain. [/b]

[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]
Microtransactions were among the core problems of the game back in the day. However, this has changed making it more approachable and thus more appealing for us the players. The Blade of Galadriel DLC for me was a nuisance. Of all the protagonists Eltariel is the least favourable, but that’s another story for another review. The developers expanded the universe without reason. They tried to milk the already beloved concept, without putting much thought into the consequences. That was a bad move and they paid it in the end dearly.

[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]
For the first time after so many years, we the L.O.T.R. nerds finally got a game that truly deserves our attention and respect! Came for the plot, stayed for the combat...

[b]NOTE:[/b] The storyline in this game is not canon - take that into account when reading this and/or playing the game.

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is the sequel to Shadow of Mordor (they really could have done better with the naming to avoid confusion) and carries on the story of Talion of Gondor. In true sequel style, it really is more of the first game: more abilities, more places to go, more things to see, more orcs to kill. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, some might find the similarity/familiarity a negative, although I would argue more of something good it not a bad thing when it is not overused. Due to the story not being canon, it can be jarring if you care about such things or are familiar with the universe, but this ultimately does not detract from enjoyment or ruin the experience. It is still a well designed game: the world/areas are amazingly varied and properly beautiful, from lush forests to snow to lava filled landscapes, incredibly well optimised to run smoothly and a well-managed ride through an original story (even if it is a little far-fetched at times). The voice acting and characterisation deserves special mention and praise: many of the lines will have you literally laughing and the banter is so well written - this is a game with very high production values and it shows at every turn.

The undoubted star of the show however is the Nemesis system. Introduced in Shadow of Mordor and perfected (as well as patented) here, the Nemesis system essentially adds a layer of persistent AI to each encounter. An enemy will remember if they have run from you or killed you, remark on it, adapt accordingly and keep you off balance. There is also every chance that an orc you kill will suddenly ambush you at some point in the future, miraculously resurrected and with a vengeance. This enhancement goes a very long way to keeping each encounter fresh and engaging, rather than just being a copy paste battle. Fortresses are the other major new feature: each has an overlord, with war chiefs underneath and the resulting captains. Conquering the fortress is key to progressing and needed to take control of territories in Mordor: while most are fairly similar (excepting the orcs manning them), it is still challenging enough if you just dive right in without any preparation beforehand.

There is an online (asynchronous) aspect as well to the game in the form of Conquests. Essentially, you are able to assault other players and their fortresses by downloading a copy of their setup and going up against it. While not in real time, this is an enjoyable way to pass a few hours and a good test to see how good your defense/offense is by attacking another person. Each conquest gets progressively tougher until they are virtually impossible. This can be avoided completely but it is a welcome addition to a game which already has a lot of different content in it. The DLC is also worthwhile, especially the Baranor campaign as it plays completely different from the rest of the game and comes as a welcome change of pace and gameplay, while still being entertaining.

The gameplay can get a little stale sometimes, but the Nemesis system does a superb job of keeping you hooked and entertained, while ensuring each encounter is a fresh challenge. In general, if you enjoyed the first title you can expect similar enjoyment from this. Conversely, if you did not enjoy the first game, you may find this is not to your liking either. Either way, I would highly recommend it to action game fans.

Played on Windows 11 Pro x64 without any issues.

Plenty of unique weapon and armor bonuses to boost your character and form your playstyle on top of the multiple combat techniques available in the skill tree. With these two elements combined you have the perfect recipe for a custom playstyle that you form. On top of that, you're rewarded for grinding in standard forms of xp and gear but on top of that, the nemesis system makes that grinding so much more enjoyable because you encounter so many different orcs (uruk if you prefer the lotr jargon) that have unique traits, with fun gimmicks, and of course you're 'punished' for dying by the orc who killed you getting stronger. But thats where the true game begins. see dying doesn't mean a loss of progress, it means a new story develops, your nemesis develops. Suddenly No'Ruk the young becomes No'Ruk the Black, he gets a new sword, its Dark from your blood. You encounter him on accident because he hunts you, using his new sword he poisons you, killing you again. and again. and now he's No'Ruk the Demon. You finally kill him, taking that sweet sweet revenge, and you gain your own new sword, a legendary set sword that has a chance to poison on hit and a higher crit chance against poisoned enemies. And this is just one of the many many orcs in your game and no 2 are the same. You'll spend hours making your way through a map clearing orcs, finishing objectives, leveling, gathering loot, collectibles, all the while fighting named orcs and before you know it you'll find yourself up at 4am on a tuesday morning when the hell the sun went down! And of course there's the story which you don't need to be a lord of the rings giganerd or anything as it happens to be an origin story that tells you who you are, why you're there and what you're doing. playing the first game isn't a requirement because it has a recap in the game for you. I owned this game on console before pc and have played through the game 3 times and on my 4th playthrough now. With combat similar to the batman arkham series and movement similar to the old school assassin's creed games, the game feels fluid to play and combat has plenty of depth, with how you approach orcs being different depending on their traits. 

And that's just the first part of the game.

see once you reach a certain part in the story you get a new power. I won't spoil it but trust me on this: you'll open up a whole new world. all of that time you spent in the first part was preparing you for the second, utilizing you're skills and the nemesis system you'll write a new chapter in your story and the enemy's story. the second part is truly where the game begins and where the fun truly awaits. and just when you think the game has shown you everything it has to offer

the 3rd part shows up. and this time its endless. I wont say anymore because it's truly a surprise worth playing for. 



Now if you're wondering where the bad is, there are certain trivial things like sometimes terrain is not climable but there once was a legitimate criticism of the games postgame. originally intended to be a primarily online mode, the endgame and certain elements throughout the game were the subject of controversy on launch. see you were able to buy advantages towards xp gain, weapons, armor, basically time savers. and other things but that would be spoiler. after such criticism, the developers went in and fixed everything by removing the microtransactions and instead making anything relevant to gameplay obtainable through gameplay, restoring the balance offset by bigger wallets and truly making an even playing field and the best part is you don't have to play online if you don't want too! you can ignore all of it (because while cool it isnt necassary to your enjoyment) and not feel like you're missing out.

It is very similar to batman (I played one batman title and if I am correct is was made by same devs?). It is kinda enjoyable when you standing surrounded by orc and you can kill them only by deadly perfect counters. Of course there are few more mechanics and many skills. 
Storyline... well there is some but it wasn't addictive for me. I love LotR and all locations and orcs in this game are really fun to play and good made (visually :)) Orcs all are dumb and easy to kill. Captains also aren't challening but some perks they have are pain. 
The biggest fun is when you have few captains and a lot of mobs around you. It could be a lot of fun to fight with them BUT developers who approve this orcs cutscenes and haven't made any skip option for it proved for me that they are halfbrain morons... I can't describe how annoying it is after some time. All the time I HAVE to hear this pointles and useless monologs. U see 4 captains at once? U can be sure the fight will stop and all 4 will talk to u EVERY #$!*$NG TIME one by one. ALWAYS!!!! I lost my patience to this game after some time.
There also second biggest annoying thing but fortunatelly I saw it only in castle defence. In this missions can be a lot of hostille captains. In one mission I had like 10 -15? One main captain went on the opposite part of castle and I didn't notice him. Meantime where I was all the time run new little waker captains :) And in this moment all the time when hostille captain died PASUE... U had to see that somewhere your ally killed a captain. Also annoying thing. This stupid and unnecessary pauses can cancel ur execution skills or you wanna dodge from some trap which is under ur feet and u may die beacuse u had low HP and ur dodge wan't trgger. Few buls#$t things that together may ruin ur good mood :)
There are few small things that could be improved but in trully they are not that annoying like those up. For instance: climbing is automatic and sometimes (usually in a fight) ur character don't wanna climb or he climb like a crazy when u really don't want to...
There also here two DLC's. One where u are playing Eltariel. She has generally same playstyle like Talion but with few more skills. Devs added few funny dialogues for ally orcs when you met them and well that all. Few mission and u will done.
Second with Baranor is really annoying. Both DLC are really short but here u have completely changed playstyle. For worse imo. If I could compare it to something I would say devs added Batman to Middle-earth but a really poor Batman. I hate this parachute... He also have few missions but in one location only.",1670179342,1670705013,False,1,0,0.492656081914901733,0,True,False,False

The game takes a story that was enjoyable and makes the characters idiots.  Every plot advancement (if you can call it those) relies on the main characters being smacked by a stupid stick.  It's very frustrating to take what was a good bond between the two main characters and throw it all out the window.  Characters constantly reinforce that Orcs cannot be trusted but are shocked that Orcs constantly betray them.  It's a very tiring experience.

The combat camera and controls are improved from Shadow of Mordor but then unnecessarily complicated by weird if not worthless combat upgrades and a weapon upgrade system that tries to be interesting but ultimately just gets ignored.  Taking castles is interesting the first one or two times but then just becomes exhausting to move the story forward (maybe not necessary but feels like it is.  Even then taking a castle doesn't establish complete control over an area).

Middle-earth: Shadow of War is an action role-playing game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It is the sequel to the highly-acclaimed game Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, and is set in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.

In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, players control Talion, a ranger of Gondor who is bonded with the wraith of the Elven lord Celebrimbor. Together, they must confront the dark lord Sauron and his armies, who seek to conquer Middle-earth. The game features a vast open-world environment, filled with iconic locations and characters from the world of Middle-earth.

One of the standout features of Middle-earth: Shadow of War is its combat system, which combines the fast-paced action of a hack-and-slash game with the strategic depth of a role-playing game. Players can use a wide range of abilities and weapons to defeat their enemies, and must carefully plan their attacks and defenses in order to emerge victorious. The game also features a number of powerful enemies known as ""Nemeses"", who have their own unique strengths and weaknesses and provide a challenging combat experience.

Another highlight of Middle-earth: Shadow of War is its ""Nemesis System"", which generates unique enemies for the player to face based on their actions and choices in the game. This means that no two playthroughs of the game are the same, and players must adapt to the changing landscape of Middle-earth in order to survive.

In addition to its single-player campaign, Middle-earth: Shadow of War also includes a multiplayer mode known as ""Shadow Wars"". In this mode, players must defend their fortresses against waves of enemy attackers, and can recruit powerful allies to help them in battle. This mode adds an additional layer of depth and replayability to the game, and provides a fun and challenging experience for players who want to test their skills against others.

One of the criticisms of Middle-earth: Shadow of War is its repetitive side quests, which often involve completing the same tasks over and over again in different locations. While these quests can be enjoyable at first, they can become tedious and boring after a while. Additionally, some players have criticized the game's use of microtransactions, which allow players to purchase in-game items and abilities with real money.

Despite these flaws, however, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is a solid action-RPG that offers a rich and immersive experience for fans of the genre. Its combat system is deep and engaging, and its open-world environment is filled with interesting characters and locations to explore. While it may not be as groundbreaking as its predecessor, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is still a must-play for fans of The Lord of the Rings and action-RPGs in general.",1670403605,1670403605,True,0,0,0.465116292238235474,0,True,False,False

The good:
Fighting and exploiting the weaknesses of Orcs is fun. No denying that.
Lots of options to approach encounters.
The Orcs have a lot of personality, and even dialogue is rarely reused.

The bad:
The story. I didn't really care for whatever Protagonist Guy wants to do, he's just a generic grizzled hero type.

The ugly:
The game and its mechanics outstay their welcome. I played half of the game back in late 2019 and finished it yesterday, late 2022. There was a big break in between and after finally finishing off the last bit of the story mode I remembered why. The orcs manipulation mechanics are fun, but the RNG involved in getting them where you want them to be are not. Sometimes they have rocks in their skulls - particularly when there's a friendly Olog gang present - and sometimes they just one-shot their opponents in the fight club.
Further, the last bit of the game has you defend conquered regions, which wouldn't be so bad if 1) friendly orcs didn't die like moths in an active volcano, 2) sieges occurred in any region that actually has defenses instead of the ones conquered in the early game and 3) if the orcs would continue fighting if you go down while you're trying to help allies get back up. After the nth time of a ""this orc somehow prevents you from getting back up when knocked down even though the story's boss does let you do that a few times"" making me go re-conquer a fortress I'd had enough and I'm glad I'm done with the game because at this stage I'm going to need another 3 years before I can consider going back for the postgame.",1669565754,1669565754,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is fairly easy to follow and there's not too much of it. However, it concludes really nicely.

But let's be honest, you buy this mainly for the gameplay, which is really solid and you can spend a ton of time just hanging around the open world enjoying the combat for the sake of it.

The only annoying thing about the game are the damn orc captain ""intros"" (where every named orc has something to say when you encounter them). It's a cool concept at first but after a while you just want to skip them because they interrupt the gameplay flow and there's no official setting for it, only some workarounds which may break things. Especially end-game, when you  face multiple, like 6+, captains at once and everyone has something to say, plus interrupts showing you that someone died, plus interrupts that someone got enraged and you can go grab yourself a drink because the mini cutscenes just keep going.",1669471742,1669471742,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Especially at its current, dirt cheap price (80% off as of the time of this writing until 30th November 2022) for both the standard and the Definitive Edition. Imagine paying less than a meal's worth for a Definitive Edition, now that's not very common nowadays with how companies are charging for their games, even with a sale.

I played this game before on my PS4 and finished it back then but decided to pick it up during this sale period for a nostalgic revisit plus, have I mentioned how stupidly cheap it is?? A personal bonus for me was not knowing that you can now change game audio language so I get to replay this game with a really good Japanese dub! A huge plus ontop of the revisit for a JRPG fan. I'm not a weeb I swear xd

Also, it needs to be mentioned that this is the most well optimized game I have ever played on PC. Like holy shit, my 1660s has 6GB of VRAM but it can still run this game at everything set to Ultra along with the High Resolution Texture Pack (Ultra settings for textures) without my frames eating crap for breakfast despite being 8k~GB/6GB.

It's really well made and contextualizes almost everything you see in this one. Also, this game's story doesn't really have legs and most characters are totally static, so you probably won't enjoy it if you haven't seen what comes before.

I finally beat this game, having previously made a few attempts to get into it that ultimately ended in boredom and frustration. It's not the smoothest experience, and it has many shortcomings (probably more than the first game), but I did have fun in the end and I don't regret spending the 40-ish hours it took me to beat the base game. Shadow of War is a continuation / expansion of Shadow of Mordor, and what was lost in charm and polish was gained in nuance and variety. I'll elaborate on what I mean about ""continuation / expansion"" because that's a little nebulous, and I'll keep coming back to the first game as a point of comparison because you should really play it if you want to play this one. 

The story picks up right where Shadow of Mordor left off, with a little bit of a recap cutscene in case you're an IDIOT and didn't play the first game before playing this one, which you should do if you haven't. Talion and Celebrimbor are back to the bickering and bitching they did lots of near the start of the previous game, and while I totally understand that since the pressure of their situation has let up a bit they might not feel the urge to work together as cleanly as they were doing, it still feels like the relationship they developed collapsed overnight, and this especially left me feeling disappointed. Shelob is a sexy lady now[spoiler] and totally not also a horrifying monstrosity[/spoiler], which is very sexy and cool and salvaged the start of the game in a way, since she has some motivations that aren't really elaborated upon until later and it makes for some interesting speculation and intrigue. After some plot stuff, Talion goes to Minas Ithil to make friends with other humans, and Celebrimbor is very upset about this because [spoiler]he's sorta toxic[/spoiler]. All of the side characters introduced here, aside from Shelob, are pretty 2-D and boring to interact with, and don't get any more interesting for the rest of the story. They're sort of like cardboard cutout versions of side characters in the previous game (have you played it yet? I sure hope so). Hopefully that summary helps to illustrate what I mean by SoW being a continuation of SoM. There's not as much new stuff happening as I would hope, and it's all concepts from the first game being stretched as far as possible. It feels like the writers were reluctant to make a plot happen and maybe they just wanted to write dialogue and not make a video game story at all, and it's very much not what I would like in a video game (to be clear: I want a video game story in my video game). Look: I get that a lot of stories write themselves, but counterpoint: have you ever played a JRPG? There is NO COASTING there, it is twists and turns all the way.

Talion controls pretty similarly, but this time he can double jump and sprint whenever he wants [spoiler]go white boy, go[/spoiler]. Stealth is even more trivial now that you can stay above the orcs at all times, but let's be honest, this isn't Metal Gear; Talion is hidden when he wants to be and seen when he wants to be, for the most part. The dodge roll is way more powerful in this game, and gives you a solid second's worth of i-frames, which is nice, but now dodge rolling is absolutely essential for a lot of fights and breaks up the flow of combat. I think it would be better if the dodge roll was a shorter animation requiring tighter timing, so that way you could at least get back to hitting things faster. There are a few extra abilities that didn't exist in the first game, and a lot of your previous ones are unlocked very early on, which is why you should play the first game, to learn how to use those abilities and work them into your muscle memory. The controls get pretty cluttered in this game, and I had to switch from a controller to keyboard and mouse because I couldn't handle all the weird funky multi-button inputs and kept making stupid mistakes because of it. Passive abilities are now presented as upgrades for your base kit that you spend skill points on, and only one passive can be used at a time per active ability. There's more strategy involved in leveling Talion up, and it's possible to screw yourself out of a victory because you chose crap abilities, which I appreciate and think lends more weight to the player's decisions. There are some disappointing passives, things like adding an elemental effect to certain moves, which I think is a little lazy; though it's useful in gameplay, it isn't very imaginative. Fewer abilities are unlocked by beating missions now, which I miss. The old rune system has been replaced with gear unlocks, which is definitely lamer, and their effects are far less interesting. There are some ""legendary"" sets of equipment that are meant to help you specialize, but most of their set bonuses suck girthy uruk-hai cock[spoiler] like a champ![/spoiler] and the only set I found interesting was the machine one, which blows up orcs that you kill, and sets you on fire, AND it lets you call in suicide bombers, which is fucking epic and I am a huge fan. Visually, all of these sets look pretty similar and don't really evoke the imagery of their respective origins in a compelling or thoughtful way. There are also these gems that you can affix for a totally bland upgrade like +16% damage or +10% lifesteal, which again, are very boring and make me sad. 

So if you are reading this and wondering, ""hey, why did this guy give Middle Earth: Shadow of War a positive review when all of his praise comes with criticism?"" here's your answer: THE ORCS. There is a reason that the soulless suit fucks at WB patented the nemesis system, and it is not a good one, but the nemesis system, and the content related to it, is excellent. For starters, there are so many different hair styles, skin tones, body types, tatoos, armors, injuries, weapons, eyes, etc., etc., ETC. orcs can have, and now even the grunts have a fair amount of variety. Honestly it puts The Sims to shame. Now a lot of these options look similar or are derivative of each other, but you'll never look at two orcs and think they look identical, regardless. My only criticism regarding how the orcs look is that I think there should be a handsome, pretty orc somewhere just to shake up the formula. There's a lot more variety in encounters, too; I've had a captain ambush me right after I got intel on him and comment on the fact that I learned his weaknesses, captains will have different dialogue each time you encounter them, rather than just playing the same lines on repeat encounters like the previous game (which you've played, right?), some captains will seek you out at every opportunity and try to become the bane of your existence. It's really staggering how much variety there is; this system that used to be cool but repetitive has finally come into its own, and is finally fun to engage with on every level. There are now ""advanced classes"" which show up independent of an orc's weapon type, so you can now get a Defender orc that's also a Berserker and charges into battle rather than hiding behind his shield and waddling around; on the other hand you can get a Savage that's also a Tank, who attacks infrequently but uses crowd control abilities to lock down the opposition while he heals. There's even an entire class of captain that will raise a posse and hunt you down if you're in the same region as them, which can be both very fun and nerve-wracking.

I'd love to keep going, but Steam has a character limit for reviews and I am very close to it now. 
TL;DR: Play Shadow of Mordor, and if you like the orcs, play Shadow of War as well.",1653004695,1669332797,True,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

My problem with the previous game was that combats are not very challenging so that you need not to take care of the Nemesis system and special abilities. They have improved it a lot. Being tough enough, orc armies try to defy your control in many different ways. Some uruk-hais even look semi-invincible at first glance. You need cunning. Also the story of SoW feels like being ""LotR"" while SoM was a bit simple (anti) hero story.

Two DLCs add unique and fun experiences to the base game though both felt short a little. Maybe that's just because I wanted to play MORE. My playtime is 40+ hrs for the base game without completing lots of weapon challenges. 40 hrs for two DLCs. It's enough, I guess.
Especially the 2nd expansion The Desolation of Mordor is pretty good. Which is parkour stealth TPaction with perma-death. I believe this style is so promising for the future.

If you've enjoyed Peter Jackson's LotR and (the assassin's creed style) quest-driven action RPGs, the game is worth trying. A note you should know is that you might not want to play it just after the previous one as the two games share many elements.",1668586173,1669321108,True,8,0,0.564552605152130127,0,True,False,False
