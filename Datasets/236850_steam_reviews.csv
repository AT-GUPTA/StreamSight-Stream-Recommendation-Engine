=======ANYTHING ELSE=======
Game focuses on the period from the Hundred Years' War to the Victorian era. When starting in 1444, Jeanne d'Arc had only passed away about a decade prior. However, recalling the Jeanne d'Arc campaign in Age of Empires II, with a depiction of medieval knights, longswords, and crossbowmen, it suddenly feels quite fantastical. But we all know that France had cannons towards the end of the War.

Personally, I believe EU4 is the easiest entry in Paradox Four (excluding Stellaris). Learning EU4 is actually quite simple. Choose any major European country, press the spacebar to release the pause, watch time pass by and deal with events as they come. After waiting for 200 years of history, you naturally learn the game and then want to start over. Continuously simulating the course of history is perhaps the most enjoyable aspect of Paradox games.

Although EU4 appears to have a multitude of adjustable and controllable parameters and variables, many things do not need to be meticulously detailed. They can be effectively resolved through the game's event handler.

I don't think this game will ever get old and I can't even imagine eu5 will come anywhere close to being this good. It's simply impossible. Theres a big learning curve for beginners, especially those who never played these types of complex grand strategy games (which was my experience) but it is well worth overcoming that curve because the game is so great.

Although I'm relatively new to Europa Universalis IV (EU4), I've been familiar with the game for some time. Having recently acquired it, I eagerly dove in. Initially, the learning curve felt steep, almost overwhelming. However, with each game, I've gained valuable insights from both triumphs and setbacks, navigating through success and near financial ruin.

As a history enthusiast, I can attest to the game's immersive historical elements. Whether you share this passion or not, EU4 provides endless entertainment. Multiplayer mode is particularly outstanding; playing with friends can easily lead to marathon sessions that stretch on for hours.

EU4 has firmly secured its place as one of my favorite strategy games, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking a rich and rewarding gaming experience.

I have almost a thousand hours on this game, on steam, I have seen it inside and outside, vanilla and modded. While I did have about 50 hours of fun on this game, the other 914.2 hours were insufferable and disheartening.

You can have fun with this game, you really can, but it isn't worth it. This is because:
It is a bad game. It just wastes your time coloring an ugly map(which only gets uglier) with one of many disgusting colors like pure puke green, It is built to be addicting and hurtful. This game is the definition of cocaine, so I have wasted 2 years + on this game, do NOT buy it. Do NOT be tempted by it or any of its siblings. The entire paradox grand-strategy genre is a waste of time & money. The game design is wonderful, the music exhilarating, this is a well designed game, but you should not play it, as it is designed to be good, but in practice, it is one of the worst experiences you can have with a game.

Natives and Colonization: natives are too op to be fair or historical, there should be some sort of event about the spread of smallpox that destroys your manpower reserves/stability as natives because that's what happened historically and could balance the game.

Pacific Island nations- i dont think the game should have these both for mechanical reasons as well as historical reasons, just have regular uncolonized. Now on or two sure, but nearly every island: NO.

Coalitions: I beat the same worldwide coalition 5 times in a row, utterly, like destroyed them and took basically no losses, and yet time and time again they will join back and fight me only to die. How is this realistic or a good game mechanic, who would willingly continue to join a coalition and march their entire economy, military, and nations to their death time and time again.All im saying is that it would fix a lot of these issues and make the game more realistic if there was maybe a option in the peace menue during coalition wars that was something along the lines of ""cant join a coalition for the next 20 years"".

Expanding Christianity: there needs to be some sort of mechanism to send missionaries to African and Asian nations, as was done historically and led to large scale christian movements in China,Japan,Africa, etc.",1402184500,1706847299,True,0,0,0.469924807548522949,0,True,False,False

Playing as Incans, reformed and same tier as Great Britain just recently. Been in a war for over 10 years, and in spite of winning over 50 engagements of army sizes at least 60k each, beating back waves constantly, lose two battles and get steam rolled while the countryside ends up rebelling and to ""have peace"" though similar in power in terms of tech and at least 60% of their manpower, I have to give up over half the country. Spanned the entire length of Western South America with at least 500 in total development and being in the same tech tree and same institutions. All 300 hours have been sunk in the Americas and Paradox has to heavily update them and or work on mission trees.  It is obvious that the Americas will be the hardest countries to play in the game but not at this level.



I would give this a 3.5 out of 5.  Have spent most of my time in the Americas and boi is that just a stress sandwhich. AI comes over from Europe and by 1550, if you have missed even a minute step, it's game over. Spain. Spain is broken in the AI department. Decided to jump over to play as Portugal to better understand the Trade Mechanics as I finally got to a point where naval is important in the Americas, and just Spain. The AI for Spain literally junior partied England and Argon( usual) and then proceeded to incorporate them and all of the Americas. Got to 1650 as Portugal and somehow the Spanish AI, in spite of taking over all of England's colonies and the Yukon down to Panama, has low liberty desire in all it's subjects. It's a bull taking a dump on you while playing 4D chess in it's brain.

Besides AI for Spain, game is enjoyable. Just, like, Nerf the AI Euro's for Spain and maybe England a bit. Include Portugal in there too.",1698944634,1706734605,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It retains many aspects of board games from its ""mana/power"" systems and includes hundreds of playable (and fun) nations. If you are not at least somewhat inclined to min-max, interested in history, or care about numbers, then this game may seem boring for you. This game kickstarted my love of history, and the countless hours that I put into it makes buying all of the DLC worthwhile. (Albeit on sale.)

It is incredibly replayable, if not due to the sheer number of nations, due to the dynamic historical events and RNG that is a part of the game. The game spans almost 400 years, a span that can even be lengthened to THOUSANDS with mods. 

The modding community is enormous for this game, which recently passed 10 years of age. I've dabbled in modding even myself, which is quite easy for someone that doesn't know how to code in Paradox's scripting language.

It takes about 30 hours of playtime to learn the game, but almost 1-2k hours to master it and figure out all of the inner workings and secrets of the game. I just learned at 2.5k hours that the ""improve relations modifier"" helps reduce aggressive expansion. I wish I knew that earlier! But learning these new strategies and secrets are what keep me coming back to the game.

Painting the map under your desired nation, whilst learning some history along the way too; that is a great combination. The game is quite deep too - you'd need atleast 2 hours or so minimun to get a grip of the interface alone. But I'd say it's well worth the trouble: who wouldn't want to change the course of history with your self insert ruler restoring the Roman Empire in year 1600 as Albania? Even if the history stuff doesn't appeal to you, it's still a very much stimulating game in it's own - managing the economy, diplomacy, armies, trade and steadily improving your nation - in hundreds of different countries. You kind of forget about the history stuff (not like the ai nations try being historical anyway). There's also mods - if you want to go through the successive or predecessive timelines that the game didn't offer you, or just alternate history scenarios. Awesome.

But I can't recommend EU4 however.
Because of:

1. The DLC (unsurprisingly).
Ultimate bundle is about eight times the cost of the game itself. It doesn't help either that... well, the dlc is just kind content yoinked from the game. I'm not exaggerating; vassal interactions, for example, is a dlc only feature. It exists in the game without dlc for some reason, but with a message overlaying that ""subject interactions is not available now"". Well what was the point of that, then??

You might think that 10 years worth of dlc packs makes a game with the already much gameplay variety even more overwhelming. And well, you're not wrong, but some dlc features should really have been essential from the beginning. For example, you cannot release vassals from lands you conquer; making world conquests about a hundred times slower and coalitions last forever. Most mods also expect you to have all the dlcs, so it's not like you can pick one either way.

2. The loading times. Unreasonably long, and once you start the game, you might aswell just go outside, meet a girl and start a family, because it's gotta be one of the worst loading times in any game. Ten minutes is the average for me, and if you have a chad thundercock space sex pc 42069 flex, then good for you I guess. You still have to wait though, and that applies if you go back to the menu while ingame. Europa Universalis 3 and Victoria 2 had some, about a minute of loading before coming to the menu. After that, there's essantially no loading screens at all. Unlike in this game, where the damned loading screen is resurrected for every time you want to go back to the menu. It's like you should be grateful for only having to wait 5 minutes less than before; because you clicked ""back"" in the countries' selection screen, to return to the menu. It's really frustrating. 

The only way to make the game run faster is by disabling, like, all graphics. The ocean goes black, hills become flat and armies invisible - only for a ducat worth of better performance. Yeah, I'm talking about performance now. Did I mention how the game runs like ass? No I didn't, but it takes 10(100) times longer to pass a year in eu4 when compared to eu3 - especially in the later stages of the game.

You come back to it in the same mindset of a tf2 player; finding yourself hitting your head on your desk over all the negatives that you decided to forgive in favor of the entertainment that was just sitting and waiting. Again, I'd be lying if I said that I don't recommend EU4, but it's flaws are pretty obvious. You could always play it the poor man's way, without the dlc, and endure the loading times. If you can keep that up for 835 hours, then props to you, sir, the game is yours. You owe me 300 euros though.

Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game anymore to anyone because of Paradox's infamous spaghetti code. They have updated and changed the game to the point that the game crashes to desktop for me all the time. Uninstalling the game completely and reinstalling the documents makes it works but I have to sacrifice my save files every time I do that and the game only works one time. The moment I close the game and try to open it again it crashes again. EU 4 is the only game in my library that does this.

EDIT: I managed to get it working by doing some bootleg to delete that god awful launcher Paradox insists on sticking on all their games

Its sad that it has come to this. I love these type of games to death. I use Paradox games to teach historical concepts in my classroom as well but unfortunately I believe Paradox has made that final change from passionate niche game studio to souless AAA game money factory.

Games that don't function consistently should not be allowed to be sold and I think its scummy that nothing is done to fix issues like the one I'm having because I invested hundreds of dollars into the game and the DLC for it.

The reason why I'm not recommending this game though isn't because I'm a casual or because the game is too complex, the issue is that the devs hide very important QOL changes behind very expensive DLC. Changes that you'd hope that the devs would just add to the main game, they push to DLC to help push sales. I played this game for around 8 hours without the DLC and the experience with the DLC as compared to without it is just night and day. 

If you buy this game, buy it when its **very cheap** and look up info on which DLC is important and pick those up too. Some are pretty shitty but there are a few that are basically mandatory.  Otherwise you'll probably get stuck paying $5/m for the DLC, which actually isn't bad, but the fact that this game is significantly worse without the dlc its much less of a choice than a demand.


edit: 6/20/21 I've dumped almost 1000 hours into the game on 1.30 and 1.31 added a bunch of cool new features through DLC. Don't buy EU4 anymore. This game is horribly unoptimized. They added too much stuff to the game and the performance suffers greatly because of it. The game just becomes unplayable after 1600 because the framerate even on lower speeds just gets wayyyy too choppy. 

It's time for EU5. I don't even really think this game is that worth it to play on older patches simply because of the lack of QOL that has been added throughout the years.

edit 2: 1/19/24. Quite a few years since my last update to this. It runs better than it did the last time I updated my review, quite a bit better in fact. Also the DLC they have added since has been pretty spectacular and added an insane amount of enjoyment to once boring nations.  DLC is VERY expensive though, so that almost makes me want to turn it back to no, but I believe paradox has helped the stability of this game a lot while also adding hundreds of hours in gameplay from basically every dlc they add, so that bumps it up  to yes for me :)",1592248848,1705710904,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, it's very complicated game they just keep shoving new programming on top and it somehow still works.  It's the one of the few PDX games where you can play anyone in the world if they were around in 1444.  Also because of when it came out, while the PC police were bad they hadn't ruined all of entertainment yet so you can actually colonize the new world, engage in slavery, battle in wars of religion, basically all things you literally cannot even discuss on PDX own forums (eat shit assholes).

Obviously they will be bought off by BlackRock and the DEI crowd so just like Vic 3 expect this to be the last faithful representation of the Renaissance and Enlightenment although you can tell even with their later DLCs they are already caving a little but they can't go full toxic SJW without breaking the game.

Game wise if you play CK or Imperator Rome it's basically just my stack beats your stack.  It's more about the enjoyment of not having to hang your head in shame about some of the most impressive feats of human history especially for Europeans and the Ottomans that definitely led to the modern world.   The game also certainly makes you realize why so many things that are now deemed ""bad"" occurred because well various nations refused to by wiped out by the other and as such everyone else in the way had to pick a side whether they wanted to or not. 

But at least it was actual progress and people actually benefited from it as a whole whereas now all you get is a new iphone that tracks you better and magically begins to have lots of bugs by the time you pay it off.

The entire execution of the concept is racist as shit and, AND: it's only really playable at all as one of the major European powers. I'm sorry, but that's not what I came here to play, I came to build a nation of Amazons in the amazon, but, yeah, that isn't particularly possible since most of the Amazon is ""Wasteland"", impassible, and uncolonizable which is unconscionable. 

Oh, and to add insult to injury; IMPERIAL CHINA, the last of the surviving O.G. civilizations, even then, cant build anything except forts because they lack the tech for it... 

WHAT?!?!? 

China was orderly, organized, self-sufficient, and playing with gunpowder as a TOY when the people of Northern Europe were still running around with stone knives and bear-skins. The only reason China was overcome by Europe in the end was they got COMPLACENT, not that Europe was superior in ANY way, shape, or form at _this_ period in history. (That would ultimately change, but not until the time-period of the NEXT game in the course of a ""Grand-Campaign""...)

No offense, but this game is so far behind the modern benchmarks you've set with CKIII and Victoria 3 that it's just unplayable, and needs a total from-the-ground rebuild similar to what CKII got a few years ago with the creation of CKIII: and Victoria II got more recently with Vic3.

You have scrimping and saving for all you life, this dream car that you have been wanting, youve never been known to be lucky, but you finally had the money, and today was the day, you are going to the dealer to get it. You pick up you daughter from school and are driver there now with the car full.
Your light turns green, you proceed to enter the intersection, and then BAAAM!
An 18 wheel just blows through the red light in a school zone going 110mph!
It all turns to black, you awake in a hospital to find that you wife and kids and dog have all been brutally killed in that accident, and that you are forever mangled to live as quad-amputee, and as you think it can get any worse? The doctor comes in to tell you have terminal cancer and dont have much longer to live.

Don't let that scare you away, tough! It's the most stream-lined grand strategy game from Paradox. Probably why it has the highest player count. It's not like HOI4 where you can literally pick individual parts of every individual warship to customize it. Mechanics are pretty simple, there's just a lot of interaction between them that you need to learn.

You have 400 years of human history to guide a random nation through. This being a sandbox game, you set your own goals to reach through a campaign. A good starting point are either easier achievements or trying to unite the home region of your starting nation.

That being said... the base game without the DLCs feels restrictive and limited. If you get hooked into this game, I recommend only getting the most important DLC centered around the nations you like to play as or plan to play as. 

On the other hand, Europa Universalis would probably be even more newb-unfriendly with all the additional mechanics from the DLCs. Think of the base game as a ""extensive demo"".

Between the insane learning curve, and all of the DLC which many are essential for the up to date version of the game to be playable its a tough sell. That being said its the deepest grand strategy game I've played by far.  

First, what could the game improve upon? The mana system (monarch points) is by far its weakest aspect and unfortunately tied to many aspects, such as development, technology, and many other aspects. You will need to learn it in order to master the game and learn to use it efficiently. I feel like imperator rome's  / victoria series population system would fit much better in this as it encourages a tall gameplay style. While playing tall has been improved upon, playing wide is almost always a better option, hence why many call EU4 a map painter game.

Second, the trade system should be dynamic. The fact that the trade mapmode is static and trade flows don't change during the entire game sessions is silly and is not realistic at all. I do like how trade works, if it changed back and forth given demand I feel like it would be perfect but what we have is honestly pretty good minus it not changing over time. 

Now for the good, diplomacy is amazing. I've never played a game where the diplomacy works this well. The wars you sometimes end up fighting due all of the diplomatic ties that everyone has can make the game very interesting and honestly drives a lot of what you end up doing. Allies, rivals and their interactions are fantastic. The sheer amount of options you have when interacting with another country is insane and no other game matches this complexity and interactivity. 

Warfare is also quite fun as the game is in real-time. This gives the timing of where armies go much more importance and micro-ing said armies to do quick hit and runs off of your enemies smaller stacks. Taking down forts, fortifying your own provinces and fighting through them are quite enjoyable.  The actual tactics once the armies clash leaves something to be desired as its all pre-determined before the fight starts and oftentimes can end up being whomever has the biggest army wins (though not always). Peace deals are also done the better than all of the other paradox games with a warscore system that go up and down based on your performance in the war along with what the actual stated wargoal is. My only wish was that there could be a plus and minus to the peace (as in I give you a province, but I'll take this province) etc. Otherwise its done very well. Aggressive expansion is a great mechanic that slows down the player mainly, I wish AI would sometimes risk it and have high AE as well. I have never been able to be in a coalition against an AI, ever. 

Multiplayer is also a great aspect that cannot be understated. You can even have friends join in your singleplayer sessions (assuming they aren't ironman) play as a nation for a bit and then keep playing afterwards. This is amazing and I wish more games did this. Ironman is fun, but the removal of the multiplayer aspect definitely steers me away from this mode which is unfortunate as its what you'll need to play to get achievements. 

There's much much more that I haven't covered but in all I can recommend EU4 but be warned of the DLC high pricetag, get the DLC on sale and absolutely buy the base game on sale.  If you have friends that play, only the host needs the DLC, which is something to keep in mind.

But the monetization model, followed by the lack of necessary changes to unfun game mechanics forces me to not recommend it. If you want to play a Paradox game, I recommend Hearts of Iron IV or Stellaris.

EU4's DLC policy is just a joke. This is a $40 interactive map made almost 11 years ago. Why is this still $40? Not only this, but the vanilla, no DLC experience of EU4 is laughable and shallow. Extremely important features, such as focusing monarch points, and transferring occupation to / from a vassal are completely locked behind updates with $5-$15 price walls. I understand the market for these kinds of games is small, but this honestly should be illegal, or not allowed on Steam. The purpose of a DLC is to expand the base experience, adding more to an already fun and completed product.

You simply cannot experience whether or not the game is for you or not if you have the DLC. Everything from flavor, mechanics, scripts, events, and playstyles depends entirely on owning the appropriate DLC. Which DLC do you need for X feature? Who knows! So, Paradox adds a seemingly good ""deal"" by allowing you to spend $5 a month via subscription to unlock all ""DLC."" This is a good deal in theory, but the fact that I am spending $5 on a game I spent $40 for is absurd, and should be illegal in an ideal World and market.

Let's talk changes. EU4 has changed so much, it's basically EU5. EU4 is nothing like it was 10-11 years ago, and a lot of that is definitely for the best. However, a lot of very annoying, tedious, unfun, and blatantly unfair mechanics have gone virtually untouched.

In terms of battles, mechanically, EU4 is pretty simple. Click your soldiers, move them to tile. So, of course there have to be mechanics to add difficulty, to avoid a braindead map color changer. This is not done so in any fair metric, however, as countries such as the Ottomans and Korea are so senselessly and unfairly broken just be hidden stat modifers, that you're essentially losing battle after battle to a braindead computer robot army, that has absolutely zero strategy or intelligence to it. The AI in EU4 is terrible, and instead of working on a good AI, Paradox just adds unfair modifiers and country-specific scripts to make the game artificially harder. This is not fun to play against.

Warscore makes zero sense. If you're an Asian country and you're having a war with European colonies, except a long, boring war of nothingness. Have full naval dominance, and your wargoal locked down? +3 warscore. Have the entirety of France occupied, and Paris burnt to the grown? +44 warscore. Have literally the entire Siberian frontier occupied? +12 warscore. [b]Battles do not win nearly enough warscore.[/b] There ARE mods that fix this, but they are not Ironman compatible. 

There is no real aspect of ""campaigning"" against the AI during war. For instance, if you and your neighbor go to war, the AI is much more likely to attempt and ""snake"" its armies around yours, just ""backdooring"" your provinces, wasting your time and playing a very annoying game of cat and mouse, instead of two colossal armies battling for glory. This is extremely obnoxious if you play as China, Russia, or any country with a lot of provinces. 

Colonization is extremely dull and boring. The AI has absolutely no idea how to guard its colonies, and the process is way too slow. Spain from 1492 to the mid 1500s had virtually all of Mesoamerica under its crown. Spain in game will maybe have the Caribbean and maybe half of Mexico.

Missions are annoying and overly scripted and just become overpowered. Playing a country with not missions is so sluggish and rugged compared to ones with them, creating a very clear game of favorite with Paradox. 

The game punishes you for doing well via Coalitions, which are completely untouched from their original conception 11 years ago. The Napoleonic Wars were literally coalition wars, where Napoleon divided and conquered each coalition member specifically. This is mechanically impossible in EU4, as you are unable to make separate peaces with coalition members. Coalitions force the player to sit idly, wasting finite time the game has to offer as the end date is 1821, with a braindead ""coalition"" that has virtually zero options to negotiate with or appease via diplomacy, other than just ""improving relations."" Boring boring boring.

RNG. Decisive, era-defining battles are often just decided by a literal die-roll. Yes, really. There's even a little picture of a game dice to symbolize this. RNG RNG RNG, RNG Emperor dies, RNG lose stability, RNG go into debt, RNG, lose umpteen thousand manpower, RNG regency council, forcing years of boring idleness. This does not simulate the turbulent, difficult nature of ruling a nation, but an annoying computer mechanic that feels more like a headache than a challenge.

All in all, EU4 is a great strategy game, but after about a thousand hours in it, I can't really recommend it. It's a terrible timesink that has extremely unfair and random-generated mechanics, followed by a seriously criminal DLC policy.",1472161904,1704434048,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

I'm not even going to complain about the price, because it's entirely possible to get most of it for 50 or even 75 percent off on sale. What deeply irritates me about the DLC is that the game is never complete. If I want to play the full, final, definitive version of a game like Civilization V, I only have to buy two DLCs. If I want to play the full, final, definitive version of Battlefield 1, I have to buy four DLCs, which is a little more expensive, but still doable. With this game, though, there will apparently never be an ""ultimate"" version of the game, since there is no end in sight for DLC releases. Playing a game that completely changes every 6 months is deeply frustrating, since I don't have unlimited time to learn every feature of every new release. I'm glad I own the game, but I can't recommend buying it for that reason.

Steam tells me I've played an additional 500 hours, so here's an update. The DLC situation has not improved. All the packs after Rights of Man have been either a) minor tweaks to countries that were already fully fleshed out, or b) absurd power fantasies that take the game even further away from an alternate history simulator. There were also a couple of catastrophically buggy releases, although at least those seem to have been fixed at this point.

A really good time waster. The game is entirely dependent on what you want to do as a player, that means that grinding and difficulty will largely depend on what you do, but overall I would say it is quite grindy and actually really difficult, its kinda embarrasing to admit but almost whenever I play I eventually use the console because my army sucks! And I'm bad at economics!

Should you buy? Yes! Its really fun and super detailed, its one big sandbox and you can play almost any nation in all of history since the 1400s.

It's still an awesome game, the publisher kind of addressed the DLC-issue but I still can't recommend in good faith that you buy this game.

First: DO NOT BUY THE BASE GAME alone. Except if it's for MP purposes to play in lobbys where somebody else has multiple or all expansions. The base game alone is NOT PLAYABLE in SP.

Second: I gave the starter pack a look. Sorry! Not worth the money. You essentially pay full price to get the game as it was multiple years ago.

Ultimate pack: 300 bucks for a game and it doesn't even include the last DLC. LOL.
You can buy and get so much more and better for 300 bucks.

The prestige pack. Well... I'm with this game since more then 10 years. I've spent hundreds of Euro's on this game over those years. If they don't feel that they can't just give me some unit sprites or some more music with the expansions I payed for, I won't buy them separately. And yes, as a good and reliable customer I'm VERY miffed about what feels like their try to nickel and dime me. My goodwill as a customer with this company is as good as gone. 

From experience I can say: the best way to start with EUIV are humblebundles. Wait for one of those. 

And... be well aware that this game is on its way out. EUV isn't announced, yet. But that's just a matter of time. Spending 300 bucks, or 80 bucks, or even 50 bucks on a game with a successor well on the horizon seems... unwise to me.
But you do you of course.

All in all: good to great game, but not worth the asking price... by a long shot. So NOT recommend.",1506267091,1702981277,False,14,0,0.547931015491485596,0,True,False,False

I just want to comment on the spectacular amount of DLCs.

The base game is going to give you a pretty good idea what the full DLC experience is, and if it is on sale, you can very cheaply try it out. There are some key Quality of Life improvements that are in DLC's, but they are not really needed at the beginning of the game - and games are very long, and I quite often restart.

The subscription is the best way to get an overview of what they offer (which I have). I might drop the subscription and cut back to a few core DLCs, most of which are in the Steam beginner bundle. If the bundle is on sale (and they have sales every couple months), the base game and those core DLCs are pretty cheap.

Luckily, there are graphical mods to fix the UI and then the ride begins. I then spent dozens of hours playing the game, restarting my campaign several times because of one dumb mistake after another... but hey, every time I play, my campaign takes longer and my nation is stronger. Right now it’s my seventh-or-so game and I am half-way through the campaign (in the mid 1600s). It feels like I am going to finish that 400-year span after all!
It's a very niche genre, probably not for casual gamers, but if you liked Civilization and preferred world maps to randomly generated worlds, if you like spreadsheets, if you like history and political geography… this game is definitely for you.

And this is the first game in which I had to launch a youtube tutorial just to finish the in-game tutorial.

Each expansion not only adds to the depth and complexity of the game but also enriches the overall gameplay experience in unique and meaningful ways.

The core game itself is a marvel of strategic depth, offering an unparalleled canvas for historical simulation. You can lead any nation from the late Middle Ages through the early modern period, shaping their political, diplomatic, and military course through centuries. The level of detail in nation-building, diplomacy, and warfare is astounding, providing a deeply immersive and intellectually stimulating experience.

What truly elevates the game, however, are the major DLCs. Each one brings new layers of strategy and historical detail. For instance, 'Art of War' greatly expands on the military aspect, allowing for more nuanced war strategies and peace negotiations. 'Common Sense' enhances the internal development of your nation, giving more control over subjects and provinces. 'Rights of Man' adds greater depth to the personalities of rulers and leaders, making the political landscape more dynamic.

The expansions also add a wealth of new content, from new nations and cultures to unique events and mechanics, making each playthrough feel fresh and exciting. The historical authenticity in each DLC is impressive, showing a dedication to not only entertaining but also educating players about different periods and aspects of world history.

Graphically, the game is clean and functional, with a user interface that, while complex, becomes intuitive over time. The in-game map is a work of art, and watching your nation grow and evolve over centuries is a visual treat.

In summary, ""Europa Universalis IV"" with its major DLCs is a must-play for anyone interested in history and strategy. The depth and breadth of content available make it a game that can be revisited time and time again, each playthrough offering a new and exciting journey through the annals of history. As a strategy game enthusiast, I can confidently say that it represents the pinnacle of the genre.",1702372147,1702372147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Overall, EU4 is disappointing and the only fun thing i can think of doing is skrewing around with custom nations.

Also Side-note: The lighthouse of Alexandria was fully destroyed in 1480. so why isn't it in the same state as the Parthenon and halicarnasos

While Europa Universalis IV may offer a rich and immersive gameplay experience, criticism arises from the fact that Paradox locks crucial mechanics behind paid DLCs. This decision restricts access to essential features, creating frustration and limiting the overall enjoyment for players who cannot afford or choose not to invest in additional content, detracting from the game's potential.
This business model of locking essential mechanics behind paid DLCs has been a point of contention within the gaming community, as it can create a perceived imbalance between players who have purchased the DLCs and those who haven't. Some argue that these mechanics should be included in the base game or made available through free updates to ensure a fair and cohesive gameplay experience for all players. Nonetheless, Europa Universalis IV continues to be a beloved game for many, despite the frustration caused by this monetization strategy.",1701387987,1702262244,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Did you think that other game companies wouldn't have thought to apply this DLC policy? If they want, they can apply this unreasonable DLC policy too you have applied. Of course they thought about it, but they knew very well that it would be pointless to spoil a sack of figs to make more money.

While you are more and more destabilizing the game, you also abused the goodwill of your customers. You will never be able to get back to those glorious old days, as you no longer deal with customers' requests, but rather deal with customers' wallets.

I'm already starting to miss the times I played HOI3, VIC 2 and EU3. There were still DLCs, but they were diamond-worthy DLCs that deserved every penny not for an abuse of goodwill, but for really giving a good service.
You deserve whatever happens to you...

I must say tho that Paradox and eu4 have had a really tough year in 2021. They established a new office in Barcelona called Paradox Tinto and they have alot of backlash for a troublesome release of the emperor DLC last year and the Leviathan DLC earlier this year, in the summer. Now with the release of Origins a little while back, I feel like the game runs better and plays better again. I hope they continue developing new content and keep updating the game.

It combines economic management, military tactics, diplomacy, and politics alongside pretty good opportunities to role-play for a strategy game. Now these mechanics are not as deep as compared to a game that specializes in it, but the combination always gives you something to tweak and look forward to.

The long term support is a double edged sword. This game has lasted over a decade, and has spawned many incredible mods like Extended Timeline, Anbennar, MEIOU and Taxes etc, but the DLC situation is confusing. Some DLC has core features (some of which has been integrated into the vanilla game), and the total cost of it is daunting.

The UI feels dated but is proficient at displaying what you need to see fairly easily, and the game provides tons of information if you know where to look. The mechanics are satisfying to learn. The unique situations many countries face are fun to play.

For new players looking to get DLC I'd suggest Art of War (ability to transfer occupied provinces in war to allies), Common Sense (to develop provinces, very much needed outside of Europe with institutions), Rights of Man (For consorts, great powers etc) and Mandate of Heaven (for age bonuses and leader traits). I'm starting to pick up the ones I don't care for too, like Mare Nostrum and the Cossacks when I have the money so I can eventually get the achievements for those DLC too.

My lack of playtime - *clears throat* - is a result of the bad side of EUIV. Currently, Paradox has a - to put in lighter terms - bad DLC policy. Old DLCs rarely get cheaper and at their launch, the game gets free updates which alter the game slightly. But in the end, you get a beast of horrendous formation which leaves a sour aftertaste. Truly, it's great that Paradox offers the free updates and most DLC are rich in content, and are what makes this 2013 game to still get so much love. So, what I mean is, most DLCs are a must, and starting the game without them means a very poor experience compared to what it should have been.


But the good side of the game is that it gives you so much fun. Be it just roleplaying as any nation in 1444 or creating an ahistorical catholic Ottoman Empire or a Chinese speaking New World. There is so much fun to be had by the little things. Each DLC, usually, brings so much flavor to a specific culture/region that you end up interested in playing Lithuania for the 10th time so you get everything right (you know, beat the Russians, remove the Turks from Europe and dismantle the Holy Roman Empire).



If you are in doubt, don't download the demo. It doesn't give you any useful insight. Go to YouTube and watch someone play. You probably like the game better doing it anyway.


2020-05-11 Update: This game will receive a huge DLC + free update within this year. It will be the biggest one yet and it seems it will be a very good one. However, if you have yet to buy the game, the amount of DLCs will scare you. Previously, I suggested a different set of DLCs, but recently, Paradox has merged some content into other DLCs and I feel like I should update what you should buy with the base game.

Art of War: Some time ago, Paradox merged transfer of control to base game (thankfully), making this DLC a little less valuable. However, it is still essential. It adds a lot of war related mechanics that makes your life easier and wars more enjoyable, and should I tell you, wars are where you will spend most of your time. It also makes the game a bit more dynamic with the league wars and spicing up the revolution.

Either Conquest of Paradise or El Dorado: There will be a time you will be playing a subject nation or maybe wanting to screw up your rival and help their subject on a quest for their independence (you know, divide and conquer) but the damned button for support of independence won't be there because you didn't buy one of these DLCs.


If you are not satisfied spending on the DLCs above or wanna buy more DLCs after playing for a while:

Common Sense: Before, it had the most valuable mechanic hidden behind this play wall, but thankfully Paradox merged Province Development into the base game, so it isn't as much of an important DLC as it once was. But, it still has a lot of good improvements and makes handling vassals such a breeze that you will start to use vassals to expand because it’s better then taking that Berber province yourself. Seriously.

Dharma: There is a caveat. It focuses on India. If you are interested in playing there, it will be great. It also adds a very cool system for government reforms. So enjoy it.

Cradle of Civilization: It adds some cool features such as army professionalism and trade policies while improving the Middle East. Cool stuff.



That's it. Don't rush DLCs. Buy after playing for a while and enjoy what you can. Eventually, if you, like me, play enough to not be a joke amongst the community by putting a few hours on the game, you will, for sure, buy them all. However, I feel obligated to remember you to only buy old stuff on sale. This game is old and Paradox expects you to pay more than GTA V at full price. Recently launched DLCs buy at your discretion, though.",1511498471,1700947768,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This put newcomer into an awkward position, to either shell out the whole sum at once, risking it all, hoping that you will like the game (which requires much more to lear than the 2 hours of game time the refund policy would allow), or buy just the base game and try to measure your interest based on an incomplete experience.

Now however, with the introduction of the subscription option (as contentious as the idea of games as a service may be), there is a third path that may be much more palatable of newcomers,  where for the price of 1/51 of that of all mechanic-related DLCs (subject to regional pricing, this particular calculation was made in rubles) the player can get to experience the full game for a month. This gives a much simpler entry point to the game and leave those who did not like the game less disappointed, and those who did like it with a choice, to either continue paying the subscription, or start buying the DLCs. And while from consumer’s point of view, I would have much preferred old DLCs to be slowly, but fully merged into the base game, from the business standpoint I perfectly understand the rationale and the compromise made.

You play as a country, and lead it to glory or defeat. But some nations start as far more powerful than others, and so while you can go on large conquering sprees with some nations, as others you need clever leadership and diplomacy just to survive.

It can be very satisfying bringing your nation to greatness, and some of the achievements present very interesting challenges.

Gameplay consists of you leading one of many different nations through 300+ years of history or 300+ years of alternate history.  The game is played in real time and can be paused, speed up, etc. You have a wealth of choices to manage your nation from they type of religion, your economy, buildings, what type of national idea groups you want to choose for your nation, government reforms, some nations have extensive mission trees depending on the DLC you have, and much much more. There is also a ton of events to keep you busy in between all the fighting and killing.

As of right now I have all the DLC with the exception of just a couple. I have played this game over 2000+ hours and plan on playing it even more as I like to go for different achievements and I like to play many different nations. I know many people do not like Paradox's current DLC policy/pricing is nonsensical, but most of the DLC do add a lot to the game. After buying the first few DLC full price, I have decided to just wait until there is a sale either on steam, greenman, or humble for the DLC. The way I approach the DLC from Paradox is that no matter what they bring out, it is guaranteed to be 50% or more then whatever they are asking. That is how I approach it and that satisfies me pretty well. It does not take long at all after release of their DLC when it goes on sale, especially from the sites I had mentioned earlier. 

If you love grand strategy games then this game is probably for you. If you are new to the game I would wait until there is a big mega sale to grab the base game and as many of the DLCs to get the biggest bang for your buck and watch plenty of youtube regarding the game before you decide to spend money on the game. The last and greatest thing about this game is the wealth of mods that the community has put out, some being complete overhauls, others smaller in scope. The mods alone can net you even more fun out of an already great game. This game is a highly recommend after all these years.",1443878027,1700742828,True,3,0,0.551282048225402832,0,True,False,False

It is quite overwhelming takes a bit to get into. I’d definitely recommend to watching a few  tutorial videos. Once you do though, this game is rich and rewarding.

The only negative thing about this game is that I feel it is incomplete without at least the Common Sense DLC. Being able to upgrade your provinces really seems like a basic function to me. Especially so since the AI seems to be able to do it even in the base game.

With EU IV you can relive the rise of your nation or, depending on your preferences, create your own legacy by forming a customized nation. 

Of course said rewriting needs its own strategy, which will require you to nail it down to the ground, otherwise you might run into Mother Russia or the Kebab hailing from the Bosporus who both will happily take care of you. That said, once you know your ways around certain (historically accurate) events you will eventually reign superior to any AI, but that's a long and possibly expensive way.

You might ask yourself why it should be expensive to train your skills in EU IV as you could just study a strategy by watching some informative clips on Youtube. I urge you to have a look at the long list of DLCs to this game. If you are no stranger to other Paradox Interactive games, i.e. Crusader Kings or Hearts of Iron, it won't surprise you that there are a bunch of core features or useful content only available via paying extra. 

Still, as you certainly noticed, I recommend this game, that's because the experience this game creates for you is fulfilling, imagine yourself as the emperor of the Holy Roman Empire as Austria with Bohemia and Hungary as your loyal subjects. Fighting your way up is the goal as it will always be. The game's challenge lies in mastering its many mechanics wanting to prevent you from ultimate success. At least some of the most painful ones only trigger if you've actively paid for them.

With that I wish you a pleasant journey aboard the sandbox that contains Europe and the Rest of the World.",1542881662,1700732969,True,0,1,0,3,True,False,False

I will seriously buy their grand strategy games until they either stop making them, or they Stronghold 3 them (which would be the saddest day ever :()

EDIT: 09/30/19

Took a long hiatus from EUIV while playing other Paradox games. Finally decided to get back into it, but with this crappy new launcher that is nigh impossible unless I just want to play vanilla EUIV. Nothing but problems when trying to use mods (which I want to use).

Maybe I will take another year or so break and they fix it by then.

EDIT: 02/25/23

""New"" launcher is still garbage, but manageable. They've been doing some good updates and the next one looks like it's gonna be a banger. If you like mods would recommend Anbennar or Third Odyssey.

EDIT: 11/22/23

They are doing good things with this. Still finding lots of fun, especially with mods. Wish Anbennar would update, but Third Odyssey is tiding me over.",1395375370,1700651196,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played 2774 hours, and finished many campaign as the top world power, which clearly states that I have had a good time in this game...but, there is always a 'but'

I hate to say it, but I am thoroughly done with it; I cannot put myself to playing another campaign.

The Whack-a-mole chasing after enemy armies, the besieging of forts (I take down one while the enemy takes down 4 in the same time), how useless allies are (Vassals work fine) and how fast nations like Portugal and Spain colonise have ruined it for me. The game has become unbelievably frustrating for me to play. 
I find it wrong that Castles prevent movement, which it doesn't do well anyway because enemies can siege down forts within 'weeks' and pour into your hinterlands anyway......In my opinion Castles should prevent occupation.

Despite the massive amount of hours I have invested in the game, I cannot say I am a 'pro'; never touched Iron Man, to much RNG going on (yes, I feel forced to savescum a lot), and I just about managed to play the game on 'Normal' (which oddly enough is easier than 'Easy')",1700587766,1700587766,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Because while it is a nice game, it is also the best example of Paradox's disgusting policy of turning elements that really should be in the original game into expensive dlc's that are released soon after the main game.

The game itself isn't worth its price, but including the DLC elements that really should be ingame (at the very least Art of War, Rights of Man, Common Sense and El Dorado) it would be. 

So, if possible get it at a 75% sale with the DLCs more relevant to your prefered play style (economic, sea-focused, administrative/diplomacy, etc). Otherwise, not worth the price.",1504916558,1700191657,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

As an avid strategy gamer, Europa Universalis IV (EU4) has undoubtedly become my go-to title for an immersive and intellectually stimulating gaming experience. Paradox Development Studio has crafted a masterpiece that stands as a testament to the grandeur of historical strategy gaming.

From the moment you delve into the rich tapestry of the 15th century, you are transported into a world where every decision has far-reaching consequences. The depth of gameplay is staggering, offering a level of complexity that allows for endless replayability. Whether you're leading a European powerhouse, a budding Asian dynasty, or a New World colonizer, the possibilities are as vast as the historical era itself.

The diplomatic system is a shining jewel in EU4's crown, providing a nuanced approach to alliances, rivalries, and negotiations. The intricate web of political relationships adds layers of complexity, making each game feel like a unique story unfolding before your eyes. The dynamic nature of the world keeps you on your toes, adapting to unforeseen challenges and opportunities.

The attention to detail in recreating historical events and the sheer accuracy of the map are commendable. The game's commitment to historical realism, coupled with the freedom it affords players to shape their own destinies, creates a perfect harmony between structured narrative and player agency.

The visual and auditory elements of EU4 are nothing short of exceptional. The map is beautifully rendered, and the attention to historical accuracy in unit design and cultural representation is evident. The soundtrack complements the gameplay seamlessly, enhancing the immersion and transporting players to different corners of the globe.

The extensive modding community adds an extra layer of longevity to the game. From total conversion mods to small tweaks, the modding community's creativity knows no bounds. This not only extends the game's lifespan but also ensures that each session can offer a new and exciting experience.

In conclusion, Europa Universalis IV is more than just a game; it's a journey through the annals of history, a canvas upon which players can paint their stories. Its combination of strategic depth, historical authenticity, and limitless possibilities make it a must-play for any fan of grand strategy games.

I begin to hate Paradox.

The amount of tini/effortless, but kind of necessary DLCs ist absurd. Just look at the list. Even in sale you are gonna spend more than EUR 100 to get what you want / what the game ist made for.

I own over a dozen of the most important DLCs which I bought over the years. Well OK to a point. But it never stops and it got worse and worse over time. The final straw was an ingame warning about some simplistic gameplay option, which I should use. But I just wasn't able to find the menu to use it. After reaserch I realized I had to get a DLC for EUR 20, so I can push a button, which would then upgrade my stupid trade port. 20 EUR for a BUTTON which changes basically nothing else. And if you don't buy it, the game keeps reminding you, that you dont't use the games full potential.

That's just so weak paradox what has bevome of you.
So no, I cannot recommend this game to new players anymore.",1699786058,1699786058,False,36,0,0.76748192310333252,0,True,False,False

The AI gets worse, the mechanics get worse and more cumbersome, the devs break the achievements making some now impossible to ever complete because you can never meet the starting conditions. Everything in this game is so over engineered that it completely breaks down if you don't play it in the most meta, and min/max way possible. I loathe the day they announce EU5, because based on the development of CK3, Imperator Rome, and Vic 3, the newer and newer paradox games get, the worse they become as well. 

Don't buy this game if you were a fan of it in the past, or if you enjoy other grand strategy games. It's not worth the thousands of hours of frustration and annoyance you can put into this game trying to make it work.

While it may have a steep learning curve that demands dozens of hours to master, don't let that discourage you. Once you dive into this historical grand strategy gem, you'll find it impossible to tear yourself away.

The initial moments of the game, whether you're leading the mighty Ottoman Empire or the modest Candar, set the stage for an addictive experience. It's not about constant frustration or getting your butt kicked every playthrough; it's more about the thrill of ""I made it X years, what went wrong, and how can I do better next time?"" And then, before you know it, ten hours have vanished, and you realize you should probably eat, call your parents, or let people know you're still alive.

Each victory and defeat becomes a part of your unique story, showcasing the sheer magnitude of this game's possibilities. Whether you're dealing with Leonardo Da Vinci or plotting total world domination from a remote island, the choices are endless. You can even trash-talk the world's strongest powers to their faces and somehow make their enemies love you and their allies adore you.

Europa Universalis IV's commitment to staying relevant with active DLCs over the years is commendable, even if the DLC policy could use some improvements. Despite any flaws, the game continues to evolve with a dedicated and passionate player base.

Playing this game will make you feel incredibly patriotic about some obscure, long-forgotten one-city nation that ceased to exist in 1445. You'll become a citizen of that nation in spirit, diving into Wikipedia rabbit holes to learn more about its history, all while loving every second of it.

If you enjoy dissecting complex systems, indulging in grand strategy, immersing yourself in history, flexing your problem-solving skills, and creating your own historical epics, then Europa Universalis IV is a must-play. It's worth every penny, and you'll find yourself lost in its immersive world for countless hours. Get ready to embark on a grand journey through history and craft your unique tales of conquest and diplomacy.",1699386749,1699386749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It is excellent to go to and from, now that I'm an 'older gamer', the achievements are diverse and there are sufficiently challenging and obscure ones to keep one occupied for long. I've manager to NEVER EVEN TRY the Ottoman yet, that's how much content there is!

TONS of things to do, lots of excellent content and flavour

Firstly the developers are bad at game design great at graphics.
How dare I say this? Well let's see.

Achievements only in Ironman. Its a game, do not see how neckbearing is so cool. Get a life.

Ironman as a feature with a terrible UX.
Yes the game is excel with graphics, except this excel forgets to tell you fundamental relationships and you need ot know where to find the developer interface, because it has the only way to enable basic functions.
Initially you may be thinking you are the one making the mistake, but eventually it turns out there is only 1-2 ways out of the pickle you are put in (HOI4 - France; EU4 - Sweden). Given you are put into a backwards situation, with a clearly ineffective initial setup, you will lose... and lose... and then win wars but not be allowed to claim any lands so you lose. So you have to restart... Oh wait... but there is no restart button. So you quit to menu pick same nation load back in, do the same 1st turn setup for 20th time, because it clearly is the best option... and then you get shafted by a random number generator... and so on.

So basically you have to save scum the game with intersting nations but save scumming is made longer, because the devs are bad at their jobs. Yes ironman needs a restart button, if you think quit restart is a good solution you probably love the Rings of Power as well. I.e. you are worng.

Favorite counter argument to the above ""but its realistic game bruv"". No it isnt, I never got beheaded IRL for rising against Denmark so it clearly has nothing to do with reality. It is a game, and a game should have a UX that serves the user experience instead of wasting their time.

Game is best played with either powerhouses or irrelevant nations. Neither will be very interesting but I guess people who want to play the Sims or Doom are the target audiences for the game, not chess players.",1699018224,1699018224,False,2,3,0.421462744474411011,0,True,False,False

With the AI retaining the ability to develop its provinces normally, only the player's country remains a medieval backwater, unless you pay for the privilege. 

After hundreds of hours already in the game, it left a sour feeling to be asked to pay money to retain features that had already been present. The level of chrome and updates the game has received since release are alright if you own the DLC, but largely to the detriment of players who own only the base game.

Edit: More than five years and hundreds of hours of game time later, it is no longer fair to keep the review at negative as the development problem with Common Sense was specifically removed, and the subscription system makes the (enormous amount of) DLC more accessible for someone who has only the base game. The base game itself remaining empty by comparison is probably still true, but at least you are no longer as actively penalized for not buying key DLC.",1483094454,1699001187,True,0,0,0.604580044746398926,3,True,False,False

I didn't play it much after release as like all Paradox games they are a bit boring for the first few years, they don't come into their own until they have been filled out with several years of dlc.

The gameplay does vary quite a bit depending on what country you pick, it's size, and cultural type etc. There is a lot of replayability. Yes the mechencics remain roughly the same but the missions and events will change from faction to faction. The main enjoyment comes from playing the different countries and cultures, and a lot of the depth comes from all the dlc. They flavour the game with music, units, missions, events and the like. It is an interesting semi-historical game, probably the best game Paradox have ever made. This game you get will last you years, providing endless historical strategy gameplay that is deep and fulfilling. 

The game revolves around developing your country and culture around the time of the Renaissance and usually expanding. Like all the Paradox games the fun comes from the interplay of factors. If you capture a new province for example you will get rebels rising. Because you have been in a war you might have no money to support an army, and your people might be displeased and your neighbours worried by your aggressive expansion. This will mean you have to take steps to placate the rebels, stabilise your country, whilst building up your money reserves, whilst also being aware you maybe weak to enemy attack. There are also religious factions to consider, not to mention estates in your country to keep balanced, diplomatic relations, navy and army, trade, province development and many many other elements to consider. It can take a long time to figure out the complexity of the game mechanics. 

The only thing you cannot really do with these Paradox games is play them without any dlc, because then they are very bland. If you are not prepared to outlay a lot of money for the dlc one way or another do not even consider getting this game. Unfortunately the dlc is expensive and numerous, because the game covers several centuries of world wide historical development.

You may be able to restrict your dlc purchasing to one culture or country type, for example a major like France, or an Arab nation etc. That would make a lot of sense. Buying the dlc gradually in sales will still be expensive costing £100s for the whole lot. Or use the subscription for a few months.

You might want to also look at Imperator Rome, Crusader Kings, Victoria and Hearts of Iron which all cover other parts of mankind's history. They all roughly follow the same principles but they also all vary slightly in the exact mechanics of gameplay. Some of those may appeal more or less than The Renaissance featured here. Although I think this game is the pinnacle of Paradox I do not think they will ever do a better game than this one. CK features more intrigue, HoI features combat far more heavily, IR features more families, whilst Vic concentrates on industry and population. This game concentrates most on making an empire.

EU4 is great, I love playing the game and I love painting the map my colour, but all of this is ruined by what the dev team considers ""balancing"", such as the unfair buffing of superpowers and the horrible AI mechanics.

To be more in depth about what I mean, the dev team have placed a system in EU4 called ""lucky nations"", which are given to giant superpowers like France, The Ottomans, Austria etc. This gives these nations unfair buffs to fighting in battles, their siege abilities and their siege defence, among other things.
This is supposedly implemented to maintain a balance of power in the game, but I think that's a ridiculous notion. It results in often all EU4 games ending up the same, with the same superpowers often triumphing over everyone else.
It forces players to play some form of meta so they can progress. some people are complicit with this saying it's necessary for there to be consistent superpowers, but even without lucky nations these same superpowers would still hold a considerable amount of power.
This isn't helped with the coupling of horrible AI mechanics which I feel are designed to target the player and generally make their experience unfun.

It feels like every game that AI superpowers are specifically going out of their way to hinder me for no realistic reason other than to make the game more difficult. Often will I see large superpowers allying with minor nations that are a part of my mission tree and therefore stunting my growth.
Allies will often make horrible decisions in wars for no particular reason, this has often been game ending, allies will also make horrible decisions outside of wars, choosing to ally nations that they know you have claims on.
Finally I often can't count on my superpower allies as for some reason, EU4 AI is completely incapable of handling their economies, I haven't seen a game where France isn't somehow 1000 ducats in debt or where The Ottomans isn't some grossly more ludicrous amount in debt.

If the price tag attached to this game isn't convincing enough that you probably don't want to get into this game, then this should be. Paradox manage to consistently create good games that fall short as a result of easily fixable issues.",1606266444,1698316208,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the DLCs and if there were 2 or 3 that would be fine, but every month or two they make you shell out ~$20 for stuff they should give for free. The only thing in DLC I could think of that should stay DLC is the random new world mechanic. I would recommend this game if they changed the way DLC worked, maybe half the price, or keep the price and release less often, because right now they give you half a patch and make you pay 1/3 of the original game to get the other half.

1/30/20 - Years later, same problems with DLC. Paradox has said they are working on a fix for massive DLC costs though. Still a good game nonetheless and a wonderful time sink as you can see. My 2300 hours in this game were all enjoyable.

10/25/23 - A few years later still and finally the community's voice has been heard. The move to a subscription model is beneficial to new players and to Paradox surely. Is it a perfect solution? No, but I'm glad that I can finally recommend the game to friends without also recommending they take out a personal loan. My only wish now is that they would make a new game with an updated engine that is more optimized, allow more graphical options, and allow quitting to menu without restarting the game, better fullscreen windowed.

There is a reason its my most played game. It's endlessly repayable, fun as hell, and satisfying to take some OPM to the greatest power in the world. But I would not call EU4 a masterpiece, there are several issues with it. First, I can't talk about the game without mentioning Paradox's shitty DLC policy (Even though I am a hypocrite cause I keep buying them). But in terms of game play there are some major frustrations. The A.I is often incompetent, and it can make certain strategies that rely on them impossible (Try using allies when there in 10K in debt). And the UI is truly magical in how much it sucks, it is impossible to find buttons if your new to the game. Combine that with the classic strategy of explaining nothing, and you have an experience that will bounce half of all new players right off your game. The learning curve of EU4 is a sheer wall of ice that you have to climb up with kitchen utensils. But once you are past the wall, it is the most fun you will have in a game, with a gameplay loop more addicting than fentanyl.

Although i am aware that the bigger countries are an easier experience, I have little interest in selecting one; for in agreement with others, i  enjoy starting small and expanding. 

From the perspective of playing as duchies the game is very slow. Aggressive expansion is a negative modifier that restricts your ability to expand, This maybe a useful mechanic for the bigger countries, in order to prevent you snow balling and thus quickly ending the game.  As it relates to the smaller countries though it drastically frustrates ones ability to play the game. I managed to take two provinces with Brittany by the reformation and by that point England and France had three times the troops i had. Their was little i could do but wait and hope for a opportunity to present itself in order to grow. Perhaps they should modify Aggresive Expansion so smaller duchies dont get so heavily effected by it. 

As such my game basically became a waiting one, whereby i increased the diplomatic reputation with England to protect me from a hungry looking France who wanted my lands. Sitting with the speed on full, until i could do something became very boring. 

When an opportunity did present itself to do something, for France had been at war so its army was reduced, unfortunately England hadn't yet gained 10 trust from me so i couldn't bring them into a potential war. So with nothing else to be done, more waiting ensued. Whilst i waited i was bombarded with decisions that never seemed to have any positive effect, always a lesser of two evils sort of choice. So after a long time waiting, and a constant stressful set of choices, do i reduce stability or loose prestige?, i found myself dazed from boredom and somewhat stressed.

Then when a war did start, the games entered supersonic mode,  the A.I with such speed headed straight for my units after presumably already calculating it would win, before i had a chance to react i was dead. I saved scummed as it is commonly refereed to,. raised my force maintenance and this time got crushed because i rolled 3 0's from dice rolls. So re loaded again. and again and actually it took me 5 loads to just win one battle. Meanwhile England sort of marched around my battles not often engaging in them. So i re loaded until the did... More and more stress. Eventually when i won, and got one province, i felt no enjoyment or satisfaction. Just very stressed. 

In peace time you can mess about with policies trying to stack the same buff to give you a slightly different play style from the last sandbox game, taking into consideration your countries unique ideas. I like this concept allot actually, and after completing two idea groups you unlock a special politicise only available to countries that unlocked thous two particular idea groups. synergistic. Non the less though, the game is ultimately allying with strong countries, waiting to take 1 or 2 provinces, waiting then for your peace to run out so you can attack again. Whilst stress fully trying to pick the least awful decision that pops up.  Just surviving should feel like an achievement, but really it doesnt and i didnt get much enjoyment out of the game.

Updates frequently add completely game breaking mechanics that then spend months being nerfed back down to reason. The game has changed so much since release it is almost unrecognisable. While this demonstrates the dev's commitment to the game, it also shows their lack of vision for the game's core mechanics. 

Something also has to be said regarding the game's euro-centric worldview. Why do all trade routes flow inexorably to either Genoa, Venice, or the English Channel? The devs have spent so much time making non-European nations unique to play as, and allowing interesting alt-history, why doesn't this extend to the realm of trade? Considering there were many mechanics like this upon release (technology groups, static province tax base, lack of new world nations, etc) that have since been amended, I'm forced to conclude that this is simply because they either haven't got around to trade yet, or the trade system is too complicated to fix while retaining the feel of the system. Furthermore, why is the printing press guaranteed to spawn in northern Germany? Why can't a Chinese, Indian, or American province develop it? While I understand part of this derives from an attempt to simulate ""real world"" history, it's at odds with the rest of the player-controlled alt history design philosophy the game has going. It also comes off as kind of racist. I'm not accusing anyone, but when an outsider looks in at the game's mechanics it's not a good look.

2020 Update:

This is still the greatest Grand Strategy game of all time.  Unfortunately, there's been so many DLCs that lock features by an expensive paywall, it's getting difficult to recommend to any new players.  I do, but my god this is now an expensive game if you want all the features.  Buying the base game + all the DLC is most definitely NOT worth it.

Really looking forward to EUV at this point.

While I'm sure this game is a dream come true for less than 1% of all gamers, this highly subjective review speaks to the nightmare. Set in the 1400's, E.U.IV is a Turn Based Conquest game, where nearly every potential form of global control or diplomacy come into play. In short, the world is divided, not into 25 or 100 territories, but more like 2000 and, moreover, this game will set users straight on what Micromanagement truly... truly... means. I have played my share of micro management games, and this curve is too involved to be fun to the vast majority of humans. Given the complexity (there's the word!) a tutorial where two Very Small countries go at it, would have been nice, with firm but gentle hand-holding. The beginning choices make this game akin to setting up a company as it's owner, then going to work as an employee, everyday, and not having a clue as to the consequences until God knows when. Or is it more like going to work, as an accountant, with no experience, for no pay? My guess is a he perfect YouTube vid for beginners would be best for getting one in the groove. UPSIDE: The game is colorful and artistically compelling. If you love intricate control and micromanagement beyond reason, look no further.  DOWNSIDE: Due to the complexity and work put in needed to ""play"", one must wonder if using ""Game"" to describe E.U.IV is an appropriate use of the word. --- THAT SAID: True, 81,000 have given their approval, but that's over a 10-year (2013) period. That reminded, I am still compelled by my first thought, it's a game appealing only to 1% of humanity. I'm sure they enjoy it, but an overall review must be geared to the many and not the one. Being intelligent or a well-rounded gamer isn't enough to enjoy this; more like patience, tolerance, and appreciation of pure scientific method (not to mention work ethic) are the characteristics needed for this game, so it's hard to recommend.

Rating: ★★★★ (4/5)

Europa Universalis IV (EU4) is a testament to the grandeur of strategic gaming, offering an unparalleled experience in the realm of historical simulation. Paradox Development Studio has crafted a masterpiece that seamlessly blends meticulous attention to detail with accessible gameplay, providing a captivating journey through the annals of human history.

One of EU4's most impressive feats is its historical accuracy. From the sprawling map, encompassing every corner of the globe, to the intricately designed nations, cultures, and religions, every facet of the game oozes authenticity. This meticulous world-building allows players to delve into various epochs, experiencing the rise and fall of empires, the Age of Exploration, and the tumultuous events that shaped the modern world.

The depth of gameplay mechanics is staggering, offering layers of complexity that cater to both newcomers and seasoned strategists. The diplomatic system, for instance, allows for intricate alliances, royal marriages, and delicate balancing acts of power. Economic management is equally engrossing, requiring astute decisions on trade, taxation, and infrastructure development. The military aspect, while daunting at first, rewards careful planning and tactical prowess, with battles that feel like true tests of strategy.

EU4 also excels in providing a sense of agency. Players can choose any nation, big or small, and guide its destiny through the centuries. Whether it's steering the Ottoman Empire to world dominance, nurturing a fledgling colonial power, or attempting to unify fractured states in Europe, the possibilities are as vast as the historical canvas itself. The open-ended nature of the game encourages creativity and fosters a deep connection between the player and their chosen nation.

The game's dynamic events and missions further enrich the experience, providing historical context and objectives that help guide players through the centuries. These events add an element of unpredictability, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever quite the same.

Moreover, EU4 boasts a dedicated modding community that has produced an array of user-generated content, extending the game's lifespan indefinitely. From total conversion mods to subtle tweaks, the sheer breadth of available content ensures that players can continually find new challenges and experiences.

While the learning curve may appear steep, the game's well-crafted tutorials and an active online community provide ample support for those willing to invest the time. Furthermore, the UI, though initially overwhelming, becomes intuitive with familiarity, allowing players to focus on the grand strategic decisions at hand.

In conclusion, Europa Universalis IV stands as a titan in the grand strategy genre, offering an immersive, educational, and endlessly replayable experience. Its attention to detail, historical accuracy, and deep gameplay mechanics make it a must-play for anyone with an interest in history or strategy games. For those willing to embark on this grand journey, the rewards are boundless",1694846095,1694846095,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I started playing back in April of 2015 (yikes), and there is no game that I (as of writing, but I doubt it'll ever change) have more hours in than EU4.  I still have fun, but the experience is so mired in complexity that I wouldn't recommend most try it out.

Coaching another person on how to play this game in summer 2022 gave me some perspective.  He had significant experience in other Paradox grand strategies.  Yet, in trying to teach the game, I realized just how horrifically confusing it is to newcomers.  If somebody who already had experience with HOI 4 and Stellaris had a hard time grasping the gameplay, who wouldn't?

Unless you're incredibly driven, and willing to watch guides and tutorials, only to play ~100 hours where you're awful, followed by another ~100 hours where you're mediocre, then don't bother.  I have over 1k hours, and I barely understand how trade works.  If I have to consult a third party to understand how a core mechanic in a game functions after 45 real-life days spent playing, something's up.

Does this game have a DLC approach that makes it difficult to get into and closer to subscription-based? Also yes.

But i come back to it over anything else, because there are plentiful goals, differing challenge levels, and most importantly, skill expression and mastery -- While my first four games struggled to make the powerhouse of Spain live up to its historical borders, subsequent runs had no problem converting that power into a world conquest, until eventually the systems mastery allowed me to (using the standard exploits) complete a world conquest as the tiny island of Ryukyu.  

Even now when I feel comfortable accomplishing any goal (with no meta-progression beyond my own aptitude) , the number of factors to consider en route to that goal makes me want to come back and solve the puzzle of how to accomplish a set of achievements quickly.  I have nearly 20000 hours in this game over the last ten years.  that's 22% of the maximum possible 87000.

This game has offered me countless hours of fun. Wether Im doing a relaxed modded play through or a iron man-achievement run.  This game has near endless replayability with the different styles of play to every run. Mods only help expand this.  While the game can be expensive for new players, it is without a doubt a must buy if you enjoy strategy. 
It only gets better when you play with a group of friends, adding some personality to how a nation acts, allowing to use their dlc, and overall just more interesting plays.  

This is not to say the game is without flaws. Plenty of problems that shouldve been fixed week 1, such as the game crashes when exiting the SP screen or being unable to join a MP session from the start screen. Or things like Random new world saves being compressed every time you save, forcing you to play longer or save less often as the save will get janky  later on.

First, let's talk about the tutorials. Or should I say lack thereof? Who needs a clear, concise introduction when you can just decipher hieroglyphics and learn through the magic of trial, error, and wishing upon a star? I mean, who doesn't want to dedicate hours to deciphering tooltips that sound like they're written in an alien language?

And don't even get me started on the user interface. It's like the designers thought, ""Hey, you know what would be fun? Let's throw all the information we can think of onto the screen and see how many players go cross-eyed trying to make sense of it."" Trying to navigate through menus feels like attempting to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded – while juggling.

Sure, you could argue that historical accuracy is important, but who needs history when you can spend your days meticulously managing your economy like a virtual accountant and wondering why your neighbors are plotting against you in a language only they and the AI can understand?

Want to wage war? Well, prepare for a delightful dance of diplomatic entanglements that even Shakespeare would find convoluted. Forming alliances feels like asking for a favor in a corporate bureaucracy, and deciphering the AI's logic for declaring war involves a degree in advanced alien psychology.

But hey, if you're into games that require the same level of dedication and time as a full-time job without the financial benefits, then EU4 might be your calling. Just remember, when your friends ask where you've been for weeks, you can proudly tell them, ""Oh, just trying to figure out how to maintain a positive stability rating while juggling the intricacies of religious conversion and trade power.""

If you were to buy the game and all of its functional-content DLC at full price, that would cost about $300. 50% off sales are common, however the most essential DLC tend to be the most expensive, and when I call these DLC essential, I'm not kidding.
Playable natives? Conquest of Paradise.
Getting money from trade without being coastal? Wealth of nations. (Not so fun fact: when this DLC released, the transfer trade peace treaty option would break your game if you didn't have this DLC)
Make money as a merchant republic? Res Publica.
Declare war for your subject's land? Art of War. (Not so fun fact: This DLC used to be required to be able to give land to others)
Custom nations and functional New World? El Dorado.
Give your vassal land? Common sense.
Functional hordes? Cossacks.
Great power mechanics? Rights of Man.
Functional China, and automated diplomats? Mandate of Heaven.
Functional Islam, all of the professionalism mechanics, and half of the development mechanic? Cradle of Civilization.
Functional India, and 1/4 of all the bonuses you can get? Dharma.
Viable HRE and more convenient rebels? Emperor.
Favors system, Monuments, and army automization? Leviathan.
Hotel? Trivago.

All of the above do more than stated, and are likely undersold. They are the 13 particularly essential ones other than Mare Nostrum, which mostly just makes your life worse, other than taking advantage of Condottieri in Multiplayer. They're about $230 together. Also, the subscription service, is an obvious money grab looking to take advantage of people who aren't financially savvy, or otherwise can't afford the DLC.",1497854172,1692988940,False,14,1,0.585555493831634521,0,True,False,False

The easiest way to sum up EU4 is ""When you're doing good, it's great! When you're doing bad, ughhhhh..""
This game has a steep learning curve, and the fact you are pretty much forced into buying the starter pack if you want mechanics that really should be in the base game already, makes the game frankly unenjoyable alot of the time. This issue is of course prevelant in all paradox games, but MAN it really shines trough in EU4! You get access to, what, 60% of mechanics trough DLC? You wanna play as a scandinavian state? Oh, well first you have to wait for a sale, and then cough up STILL 10 bucks for access to the content. I'll say that at least most of the DLC's in this game have content that justify the pricing (during sales), but it's still an idiotic, yet insanely profitable, way to sell a game.

I really want to enjoy this game, but even when I watch guides on how to play nations and copy their actions 1:1, I tend to simply lose because the guy making the guide had 10 more DLC's than me, so he has access to a bunch of mechanics I don't. I'm sure if I buy more DLC for this game I'll enjoy it more, but it's really a problem that you NEED to buy optional and extra content to enjoy the game at all.",1692958671,1692958671,False,2,0,0.547325074672698975,0,True,False,False

I have experience in other Paradox games, such as Hoi4 and so far ""only"" 15 hours in EU4. However, despite only having 15 hours, I consider that I have finally properly learned the game, with all its little intricacies and details you need to constantly pay attention to, and be able to have nice and enjoyable play throughs.

The role-playing element is fantastic, and so is the historical element. Overall, I find the game to deliver a really good and well made administration-simulation package which is very fun and addictive to play. However, as I said the rng ruins it. How can I be thrown in a game with one of the steepest learning curves of all big titles, and be punished for doing everything right?:

You can ensure that your kingdom is stable, everyone is loyal and happy, you have a good economy, and no war exhaustion, and all of a sudden, some randomly generated events trigger, a usurper shows up, and there are 4 separate armies ranging from 10-25k men all over your territory when you are low on manpower and have a standing army of 10k men. You fight them, go into so much debt that your country is sinking, so you start a new game: all of a sudden your neighbors have a completely different opinion of you, everyone has a different alliance and agreements, and you have a bunch of completely different rng events happening in the very same country you played with earlier.... 

Certain games, like Dark Souls, or Eldenring have very steep learning curves. But everything in the game pushes you to play in a better way, and constently rewards you for it. You are only ever punished for making mistakes. THAT is a GOOD game development. Throwing the player against a very long and steep learning curve, with a very inadequate tutorial, only for them to finally get a grip of the game after at least 10 hours only to punish them despite doing everything right is BAD game development.

The game Europe Universe 4 for Steam have ruin my life. Every day now I play 20hr Ottoman Ironman Campaign, and every night I am playing Greater Gotland into Prussia. I physically cannot stop myself from playing. Ever since I first ran EU4.exe my life has gotten objectively worse. I felt myself gain 250lbs immediately upon starting game. And I gain another 50lbs upon picking England. Even worse, I made Reddit account and became Discord moderater.

I am suffer many physical injury as a result of this game too. I am now have trigger finger from hitting Debase Currency button (thankfully I am still able to do so by slamming my chin into mouse) and the countless nights spend hunch over at desk have left me with scoliosis. I will be sue Sweden and Paradox Interactive for making this game that have ruined my life.

I still leave this game positive recommendation as playing Prussia was very fun and based and redpilled as my wife's son who I have not seen in weeks due to playing many EU4s said.

The whole DLC situation is ludicrous. The fact that you have to pay hundreds of dollars just to get core mechanics that could have 100% just been included in the base game is insane. Even on sale the DLCs are not really that worth it. While I understand the devs might have put in a lot of time to create, test, and debug these mechanics. There's nothing anyone can say to justify paying the hundreds of dollars ($300-500 depending on sale) for some of these mechanics.

Sure you can try to say that maybe they just didn't think of these mechanics during the original development. However, it has been a full decade since release, and they could have easily spent all these DLC dev time making EU5 and add these ""new"" mechanics to it. You can do a lot in 10 years, such as making a new engine that doesn't force you to restart the game  every time you have go back to the starting menu. But oh no that means they can only charge a one time $60 dollar fee when they can otherwise charge you $450. Oh no the poor executives at Paradox. Shucks.

In the end, it's about money. Creative Assembly does it with Total War. Paradox does it consistently with most of their newer RTS games. [b] YES [/b] the game itself is amazing but also [b] YES [/b] Paradox really wants you to spend $15-20 so you can press a cool new button in the army tab. There's not much we as individuals can do about it. Voting with your wallet only really works if everyone comes to a consensus.

What I would recommend is checking Humble Bundle occasionally to see if they bring back the EU4 bundle. Not only do you help charities but you also don't have to waste hundreds of dollars on products that really aren't worth that. Unfortunately. it is highly likely that these are only possible through partnerships with Paradox so it might or might not come back.",1692579347,1692579633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now to the point. The gameplay is very unique and if you like it, you will acquire gaming impotence for more than one year and will not be able to play anything but strategy paradoxes, however, the entry threshold is very unfriendly to the user, so you should expect that the first couple of games will be out of your control with random events, permanent rebellions and other nonsense. 

The main nuance is that (for me personally) the main part of the gameplay is the constant attempts to get arbitrary achievements within the game. Most of them involve not even a single attempt to get them before you get even a little bit close to them. This strategy game is unique for the reason that it provides a user experience souls like games in a completely unacceptable genre. 

The tragedy of this game is the financial policy of developers who believe that game patches can be sold as separate games, and having read most of them I can say that you should buy them very selectively, because they are unreasonably expensive, and some of them can only worsen the game experience.

The game by itself isn’t inherently bad without DLCs, there just isn’t any depth to the game however for example event chains or trees, and some mechanics are missing like that of moving troops across a ocean with a single click and ultimately I wouldn’t say there is anything wrong with that.

[h1]Gaming with DLCs[/h1]
When DLCs are added into the game, it feels like a good whole new game, but just a single DLC wouldn’t do much for especially for me. But when having a collective DLC of the [u]Essentials[/u] then it truly do feel like a different game, the the experience is outstanding, being able to role play as England, the Papal States, and so much more.

[h1]Downsides?[/h1]
Honestly, it’s too expensive. Having let’s say the most essential DLC to me [u]Art of War[/u] if there isn’t any discount it cost [b]19.99 USD[/b] which basically means that you can buy another game which has a more different experience. I myself can’t understand the reasoning for such high pricing but let me do some math for you.

Let’s say you want to have the essential DLCs right now, in my point of view (Full Price without collection):

I would almost recommend it as a visual resource for history teachers, but don't know if that violates copyrights or educational principles.  Personally, I have spent many hours between EU-IV maps and Wikipedia entries as I absorbed more of our planet's noisiest primates' dramatic history.

The mod community also adds richness and depth, particularly for earlier centuries.
Many of these mods serve as ""pro-bono history dioramas"" made possible by the delicious Clausewitz Engine.
 
But the DLC-milking is frankly egregious. Up to shameful proportions - better to charge more in less iterations.  We love the game and appreciate the development, but....

Other Paradox games are more reasonable in the way they fund continued development, Stellaris being a shining example, and if they get to be more like this 
(the Civ 6 model of ""buy every different idea in the deck as a 9.99 Pak"") 
then the entire franchise may die, but hopefully the Engine will remain.
It's just such a transparent ""nickel-and-dime""-ing of intelligent fans that it feels almost insulting.

That being said,

Thank you for the lovely game and the delicious engine.

Developed by Paradox Interactive, EU4 offers a deep and engaging experience for history enthusiasts and strategy aficionados alike. Here's a comprehensive review of the game:

Gameplay and Mechanics:
EU4's gameplay revolves around managing a nation's economy, military, diplomacy, and internal affairs. The level of detail and complexity in these mechanics is staggering, offering a realistic and dynamic representation of the era. Players can choose from a vast selection of historical countries, each with its unique strengths, challenges, and historical events. The gameplay's depth allows for diverse playstyles, from aggressive conquerors to peaceful trade empires.

Diplomacy and Warfare:
The diplomatic aspect is a highlight of EU4. Players must navigate a web of alliances, rivalries, trade agreements, and royal marriages to secure their nation's interests. Diplomacy often proves crucial for expansion without resorting to constant warfare. When war is inevitable, the military mechanics offer diverse strategies, with aspects like terrain, unit types, and generals playing significant roles.

Historical Accuracy and Events:
EU4 captures the essence of the historical era remarkably well. The game's events, decisions, and missions are based on historical occurrences, enabling players to relive significant moments. The ""National Ideas"" system allows nations to develop unique strengths and weaknesses based on their historical context, adding to the authenticity.

Learning Curve:
The game's complexity can be both a blessing and a challenge. While it offers an enriching experience, the learning curve can be steep for newcomers to the grand strategy genre. The game's interface and mechanics require dedication to fully understand, but the reward is an immersive and intellectually stimulating experience.

Modding and Community:
EU4 boasts an active modding community that creates an array of content, from alternate history scenarios to graphical enhancements. This extends the game's lifespan significantly, ensuring players can explore fresh experiences even after mastering the base game.

Graphics and Sound:
While the graphics are functional, they might not meet the standards of some modern games. However, the game's focus is on depth rather than graphical prowess. The sound design, including the music and ambient sounds, contributes to the immersive atmosphere.

Verdict:
Europa Universalis IV is a masterclass in grand strategy gaming, offering an unparalleled blend of historical accuracy, deep gameplay mechanics, and diplomatic intricacies. Its complexity might deter some newcomers, but those who invest time and effort will find an incredibly rewarding experience that can educate and entertain in equal measure. Whether you're a history buff or a strategy enthusiast, EU4 is a journey worth embarking on.",1641068148,1691085932,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This purported strategy masterpiece is a convoluted morass of befuddling mechanics and anachronistic gameplay that evokes naught but exasperation and a persistent yearning for respite.

From its onset, Europa Universalis IV inundates players with an overwhelming cascade of information, thrusting them into a baptism of confusion that leaves one gasping for a lifeline amidst a sea of inscrutable UI elements and indecipherable tooltips. The alleged ""strategy"" at the core of this wretched abomination becomes a futile endeavor, buried under layers of obfuscation that defy comprehension.

The purported scope and depth of the gameplay is a deceitful façade, for beneath the surface lies an unsettling lack of substance and variety. The laborious process of shaping a nation's destiny degenerates into a tedious cycle of repetitive actions bereft of any nuance or agency. Mundane decisions become mere arithmetic exercises, bereaving players of the semblance of meaningful impact on the world they purportedly rule.

Combat mechanics, ostensibly the cornerstone of any strategy game, are an exercise in frustration and tedium. Battles devolve into a farcical display of units mindlessly flailing at one another, bereft of any tactical depth or strategic acumen. This banal charade leaves the player as a hapless spectator to their own grand tragedy, devoid of any satisfaction that should arise from a well-fought victory.

The insidious design choices of Europa Universalis IV continue to afflict even the most basic interactions. Diplomacy, intended to be a realm of cunning negotiation and diplomatic prowess, devolves into a ceaseless parade of unconvincing demands and simplistic AI responses, rendering any attempt at meaningful statecraft a pitiable farce.

Moreover, the game's abhorrent AI only adds to the prevailing sentiment of exasperation. It oscillates between infuriating incompetence and blatant cheating, effortlessly swaying the balance of power with its inscrutable and irrational decisions. This unwavering inconsistency erodes any semblance of strategic challenge, leaving players to grapple with a farce of an opposition that negates the satisfaction of hard-earned victories.

The purported historical depth of Europa Universalis IV is a piteous farce, as the game turns a blind eye to the intricacies of the past, peddling a shameless revisionist history that betrays the essence of its purported premise. The depiction of cultures and civilizations is a regrettable caricature, rendering a disservice to the richness and complexity of human history.

In summation, Europa Universalis IV is an unmitigated disaster of epic proportions, suffused with an assemblage of misguided design choices and a paucity of meaningful gameplay. Its labyrinthine mechanics and disconcerting lack of coherence leave players grappling with a maelstrom of confusion and disappointment. Within its hapless embrace lies naught but the gnawing realization that one's time would be far better spent elsewhere. A shameful testament to the worst aspects of game design, Europa Universalis IV is a blight upon the annals of gaming history, evoking naught but contempt and dismay from those unfortunate enough to have borne witness to its lamentable existence.",1605567072,1690723660,True,4,0,0.581749081611633301,1,True,False,False

Now let's get with the review shall we? I'll avoid putting 20+ pros and cons as it's all arbitrary to any player both good and bad at playing at this game, so I'll just mention a couple of things both good and bad. 

I'll say, that the game is quite immersive and fun. It lets you take a look how was a world evolving after the period of Renaissance and during the Colonial era. What Paradox really took into a consideration was the sheer amount of provinces and made so clean looking borders that other strategy games can only wish to replicate. Nitpicking or giving attention to details to this map game? Up to you to decide. I am just happy being able to see almost perfectly accurate empire borders of the time. 
Map asside, talking about mechanics. Paradox did a great job at keeping an army composition fairly ""easy"" to put. Don't ask me how many infantry to artillery battalions have to be in that particular part of the game as I have no clue. But the ability to just spam 30+ infantry cannon fodde...I mean, conscripts is a nice simplified way to wage wars in the game. Wars are one of main focal points of the game so if you plan to build a prosperous and stable empire you would have to here and there invade a country or two. 

Some more mechanics that need to be considered as pros of this game are aggressive expansion and vassal strength. AE is a nice way to stop a country from becoming too powerful and big in a short spam of time and no matter how strong you think you are when you are invaded by the whole Europe is quite scary regardless of your status in the great powers list. Vassal strength is one of the, in my opinion overlooked mechanics of the game that Paradox really implemented it well. Just like in the actual history when a certain great power wanted to assert it's dominance over a certain region they did it best by dissolving and creating new nations of the existing people that settled the area *cough cough* Balkans.
The similar was done in EU4. Instead of having one big Great Britain as your puppet, why not disintegrate it into England, Scotland, Wales and why not Cornwall. Sure, you might be over your diplomatic limit but you will be able to easily control the new puppets now that they are weaker. Divide et impera, am I right? 

There are definitely some more things that could be addressed as the positives of this game but I am neither too skilled to name them all as I myself as still learning, however, we cannot dismiss the ""downsides"" of this game or the very least negatives.

Number one is the price. For a game that is going to be nearly 10 years old in I believe August of this year of writing this review, spending a full price of 40 euros, or dollars is a bit too much for a base games. I won't talk about how many in the community are talking about Paradox giving us a skeleton of the game and then having to make us pay for DLCs in order to have fun. Still for a base game 40 euros is too much. If some of the DLCs were included in the base game then I could see that being a logical decision, but I do agree that a lot of quality of life mechanics and some other features that you don't even know are actually a part of a DLC. I mean for having to do to a barrage while the province is under a siege you have to have Mandate of heaven DLC and if you wanted to do a naval barrage you have to have Golden century DLC, I believe. Two very simple stuff that could have been a free update are locked behind a paywall.

Secondly we have to address the manpower mechanic that I believe was badly implemented. The ability to recruit units means they need to be pulled out from somewhere, so that means fewer peasants, fewer artisans and so on and so on and the game in my opinion doesn't really represent that. You can suddenly recruit 100K troop in Spain without Madrid losing even one of the manpower development. Recruitment also doesn't affect production so those were some of the stuff that the game hasn't taken into a consideration fully or they just didn't want to bother us with it. 

Overall, to all of you who sticked to the end of this review, I can only say that this game is definitely fun and worth playing. The game is called Europa Universalis after all, so the main focus was done on Europe and especially great powers of the period, something that was definitely confirmed with the latest Domination DLC. That doesn't mean that you can't have fun playing outside of Europe, but if you ask me if you were to give me a cent for every nation outside of Europe I started my campaign as, well, you wouldn't need to worry about paying me, that's all I am going to say. I will avoid talking about some historical inaccuracies and they are some of them, both regarding existence of some cultures/nations at the starting date as well as the statuses of certain countries.

Definitely a must buy if you are a fan of Paradox games and therefore strategy games. I would always tell people to buy any game on a discount no matter the price and the same goes for this game. DLC wise buy some that you believe would make your playing more enjoyable, but having a base game won't make you any worse player than me...yeah the game is quite something to comprehend. So many percentages...

I hope you have fun with it. Games are meant to be fun no matter how you play them.

- Enemy armies wandering through areas with forts (yes, active forts, not mothballed). Kind of funny when you choose your ideas, edicts, etc. to improve your defense posture.
- Scenarios where your country included in a war as ""secondary"" participant, but soon the original countries jumping out with some money/prestige loss, but you are not able to do it until the end - and lose a big chunk of your country. As you are the player, you have to pay for your sins! :)
- Meanwhile, you are not able to call your allies who are rivals to your enemy, because you are not the ""primary"" target. Flawless logic!

This game has taught me an enormous amount of geography (and some history to boot) which I have used in my life.

You play as a nation state starting in any year from November 1444 to January of 1821 and play to the latter year, deciding policy, sending diplomats, declaring wars, trading, and what-have-you. Yes, you can continue to play past 1821 if you want to. You do not have to worry about your playthrough being limited to a couple hundred years. But all the historical events (such as institutions) and technologies stop advancing after 1821. You keep going with 1821 technology, institutions, and ""era"" forever. A huge part of the game's main mechanics are thus eliminated or trivialized after 1821.

This game can be extremely easy or extremely challenging depending on how you play, who you play, and what your objectives are. Playing as the ottomans with the goal of conquering Wien in Austria for instance might be relatively easy but trying to simply survive until 1600 as Byzantium may be almost impossible.

This is one of the best and most compelling strategy games I have ever played.

Make sure to find out which DLC you actually need to get the experience you want.

If you play to buy this game, look on the workshop and get Extended Timeline as it is easily the best mod for this game.

Wild Wasteland is also pretty good.

I'm also a fan of the ""Uber Custom Nations"" cheat mod which lets you make overpowered nations.

THE CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE:
Guiding principles:
1. It's not a sin unless it actually violates a biblical rule or principle that is relevant under the New Testament.
2. Anything can be a sin if you do it instead of what you're supposed to be doing.
With those guidelines set...

There are unavoidable dialog popups to which you can only reply ""Damn!"". You can wait and it will click itself or you can click to get rid of it. So there is unavoidable cursing, which I do not like. I wouldn't say ""Damn"".

However, as far as I know, there is no blasphemy in this game. 

You can play as pagan, muslim, hindu, catholic, hussite, coptic or what-have-you nations (with all the major religions having mechanics unique to them such as the coptic blessings) and convert provinces you conquer to that religion. Whatever religion you play as is called the ""One true faith"" in the in-game dialog and menus. You can also ""convert culture"" on provinces, which I'm pretty sure is a shady way to say ""systemic genocide"".

So the game lets you roleplay something which is evil. This is little different than Fallout for instance where you can play a character that murders everyone and steals everything without remorse or regret. 

Is such a christian thing to do? If it compels you to behave that way in real life or view that behavior as ""good"" then no. But if it's merely part of a fictional story or setting, then it's not a sin.",1685649218,1689384187,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But despite it's flaws, I cannot help but love this game which I have sunk an embarrassingly large proportion of my life into. 

At first, I found the game to be quite overwhelming, owing to its sheer complexity and the insane number game mechanics to grapple with, but once I jumped that first hurdle and gained a basic understanding for the game (aided by large amounts of YouTube content) - I was hooked. 

The core gameplay loop of building alliances, fighting wars, conquering new lands and developing your nation etc. is brilliant, (although it does get stale by the late-game when you usually find yourself far ahead of the AI). But in my mind, what makes EU4 such an incredible game is the sheer variety of content it offers. Depending on what nation you choose to start as your gameplay experience can differ enormously. Owing to differing regional mechanics and power-dynamics, along side a large number of unique and powerful mission trees; there is no end to the number of ways you can experience the game, giving it near infinite replayability. This means that the game still somehow manages to feel fresh almost 2500 hours in. 

If you have a large amount of time in your life (alongside quite a bit of money to shell out for overpriced DLC), which you are willing dedicate towards this heavily flawed but nevertheless endlessly captivating and highly addictive game, then I highly recommend that you play it. If you however feel that you have better, more important things to be doing than commanding virtual troops on a 2D map, then please stay away.

Tip: Paradox usually hosts a deal for EU4 and most of it's DLC on humblebundle for a fraction of it's usual price every year. If you are uncomfortable paying such a high price for the game and it's DLC, keep watch and see if you can grab it there",1689077896,1689077896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't know how to start this review, so I think I'm gonna go for a pros/cons review.

Pros:
-IMO the mot fun RTS game on the market
-A plethora of achievements and DLC to keep you occupied for 20x the amount of playtime I have on this game
-In-depth economy, government and army mechanics
-Fun and thrilling wars
-Not too easy, not too hard. The adjustable difficulty is a plus too
-Probably the biggest reason for why I know assloads of geography and historical borders/flags
-You can convert to Orthodox Christianity as the USA, become Italian culture, and colonize Australia, which is just an example of the absurd shit you can do in this game

Cons:
-ABSURDLY expensive, you have to buy the DLC on Instant Gaming or wait for one of those crazy bundles on HumbleBundle or else you're screwed, and the DLC is pretty much necessary too
-Probably the most complicated Paradox RTS, although it's not annoying to learn like CK3 or HOI4
-The enemy AI is like if you were spectating a chess match and they were Gary Kasparov and your allies' AI is an autistic toddler. The enemy AI also asks for as much as they can get in a peace deal the second they get 10% war score for some reason

Despite the fact that at the time of writing this review I have 550 hours on the game. I'd still be considered by many players to be somewhat of a newbie, and with good reason. The game has a tremendous amount of replay value and content. So much so that the game may even be just straight up overwhelming. 

[h1] Positive Aspects [/h1]
What do I think the game does well? Well, as previously said, the [u][b]massive amount of replay value and content to go through[/b][/u]. Furthermore however, the mechanics of the game are rather [u][b]well made and are fun to use[/b][/u]. The game has [u][b]in-depth and complex mechanics[/b][/u] regarding everything from: war, economy, religion, terrain and much more that I simply do not have enough time to write about. All of which give you the ability to take a nation into your hands and form its history in the early modern period in whichever way you envision. All in all [u][b]mechanics wise, and gameplay wise this game is incredibly good[/b][/u]. However.

[h1] Criticisms/Disclaimers [/h1]
As to criticisms of the game that I have. First of all you may have already seen it. [u][b]The atrocious amount of DLCs[/b][/u]. Now thankfully these DLCs are mainly just quality-of-life improvements, though not all unfortunately. It is not nearly as annoying as in Crusader Kings where entire sections of the game are unplayable without DLC. But it's still fairly annoying. 

Furthermore like I said at the beginning of the review. The game is [u][b]incredibly complex and requires a lot of time in order to play properly[/b][/u]. Let alone to master which takes an exorbitant amount of time to do. If you don't have the patience or time to learn an entire genre from scratch (which I could not blame you for), then this might not be the game for you.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
All in all though, despite its flaws. I still really love this game and would recommend it to people who enjoy playing strategy games and don't mind sinking time into one specific game to learn and master it. However, this game is not for everyone so I would highly suggest, especially considering how much this game costs. That if you are considering buying this game to [u][b]watch a couple of lengthier videos about the game and learn some of its mechanics beforehand, only then should you make an informed decision on whether or not you would like to purchase the game.[/b][/u]",1688661724,1688661812,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

As a new comer to this genre, you'll be overwhelmed by the interface and the sheer amount of information to digest. Lot's of things that you can do, but basically it will make you feel like a director who sits in front of a monitor trying to analyze corporate data in massive detail. Yes, that's how you would feel like if you have more than a decade experience as middle or top management in any company. Not much animation. Tons of buttons and tooltips. Just pawns on a giant map. Something like a sophisticated Excel with attractive numbers and icons. More like a corporate dashboard which gives you global information in the beginning, but then you can drill down to more detail information and make various decisions from those information.

But the game does not manage a company. It manage a country or a collection of region in kingdom era.

So it is a history simulator for the World like the Civilization series only much more realistic, without all the cheesiness. You can start in the mid 15th Century and try to make it take a turn. What if the Dutch tried to race the other European nations to the new world first? What if Ethiopia was more militant? That is where the fun in this game lies. Change history and see how things might react, or just try to recreate history.

It has a lot of Cons though. This game is not intuitive or user friendly. It has a lot of DLC, some of which seem almost essential and most of which seem to be rubbish. It partially depends on what region of the world you want to play. 

Europe, Asia and parts of Africa seem fairly well done. The Americas are essentially just there to be conquered and the game really fails to recognize the dififerent civilizations of the Americas and their historical power. The Aztec empire didn't fall because of a massive Spanish army but because of conflicts between tribes. North American civilizations weren't destroyed by colonialists so much as being utterly ravaged by disease and inter-tribal conflict.

Over the nearly 10 years since this game was released, the developers have released A LOT of additional content; some of which is absolutely essential to enjoying the game in it’s current state. This is because, unlike many other games/developers, Paradox has adopted a policy of free updates for everyone—alongside “optional” DLC. In theory this is good: it means players gets free patches and features, while payers get that extra depth and expanded gameplay...but in practice it doesn't always work this way. Many CRUCIAL gameplay features have been pay-walled behind DLC, and the accompanying free patches simply don’t always account for the lack of these features. This leads to a lot of gameplay balancing problems, and half-hearted implementations of features that either fall short or in some cases straight up break or make the game unplayable.

So, all of that being said, should you still buy EU4? If all you plan to buy is the base game, it’s a hard no. As an experienced player, the game simply isn’t worth playing without some of those fundamental DLCs. If, however, you plan to also pickup some of the DLC—which is a hard sell if you don’t already know you’re going to enjoy this type of game, I know—then yes, in my opinion it’s absolutely worth it.

At the end of the day, there’s simply nothing else out there like EU4: it has become an incredibly deep and satisfying grand strategy game, that’s brought hundreds if not thousands of hours of enjoyment to its fans. But...it’s bogged down by an unfocused DLC model, which hodgepodges features in often nonsensical packages and expects players to continue paying for said content, even when Paradox themselves admit to not meeting their own quality standards.

PDX has certainly lost a lot of goodwill and trust in the community over the last few years. Communication isn’t where it needs to be, valid criticisms of the DLC model hasn’t resulted in any change to the way they make or release content, and quality control has just seemed to slip farther and farther from what anyone would consider acceptable… It’s sad to see a game I love go this way, but there isn’t much I can do beyond telling you that in it’s current state, the base game EU4, is not worth buying. And the developers have a long way to go towards rebuilding their reputation and the trust they’ve lost as a result of taking community goodwill for granted.

In saying that, however, I have loved every minute of the few minutes I have played. I don't own all the DLCs, am not a fanboy and rarely play on Ironman anyway due to the awesome modding community. This game has provided me with endless enjoyment. If you don't want the DLCs talk to experienced players first, or don't buy them, there are several you don't need, believe me.

I enjoy watching others play this game as well as talking to people irl who enjoy this game.

I used to love this game and had a positive review for it. You can get thousands of hours replaying it over and over as different countries paving your own path and story exploring the game's rich strategic gameplay and mechanics. The base game however is missing lots of features, many of which are quality of life features that they instead sell back to you as DLCs. Paradox intentionally made the game unfinished so you can spend literal hundreds of dollars of DLC so you have easier access to things like the 'alliance button'. I am not shitting you it's THAT bad.

 The DLCs themselves are terrible, just all of them. They all cost way too much and boil down to cramming a few extra buttons into your already cluttered menus. Some of these buttons are absolutely integral to the core gameplay that you would otherwise miss out on, others are completely useless. The DLCs ALWAYS launch with a heaping pile of new bugs that rarely get fixed. Over time the bugs accumulate to such degrees, that the game is barely playable anymore.

Deep under the layers of garbage injected into the game is a fantastic game with a passionate community that, again, I once loved.

At this point however I can't stand by my positive review any more.

Here you can play as a Zaporozhian Cossack, who freed himself from the Turkish and Polish rule, and as an Indian civilization, where you will resist the colonization of America. Personally, I've had England and Spain combined twice from the Americas playing for the Amazon Valley Native Tribe. And I will say that in the end I was defeated, but the game itself showed that with proper government, where you sometimes take unnecessary risks or big investments, you get the same new experience and enjoyment of the challenge.

I highly recommend it to everyone!

Ещё одна игра от Paradox Interactive. В ней гораздо больше всего, что было в Crusader Kings 2 или в предыдущей Europa Universalis 3. Здесь ты можешь поиграть как за Запорожского казака, освободившегося от турецкого и польского владычества, так и за цивилизации индейцев, где будешь сопротивляться колонизации Америки. Лично я два раза откинул из Америки Англию и Испанию вместе взятых играя за коренное племя долины реки Амазонки. И скажу, что в конце концов меня победили, но сама игра показала, что при правильном управлении государством, где ты порой идёшь на неоправданный риск или большие вложения, получаешь тот самый новый опыт и наслаждение от пройденного испытания.

Pros
- Good mechanics, balanced trade and economic systems. 
-A peaceful ""tall"" run is possible as is a somewhat Rapid expansion across the globe (some paradox games lack this, they nailed it with EU4)
-Achievements, both Steam and personal, to keep you going until 1821
-Infinite replay-ability. Need difficulty? Play as an OPM in Asia or the New World. Had a good game and are nostalgic about it? Do it again.
Cons
-Game can be railroaded at times, but that's part of the difficulty to break the tracks, and keeps things somewhat historical (I don't know what to do when the PLC explodes and France looses the HYW, so that part is covered by the historical leans)
-AI is either braindead or 900 IQ, also it is allowed to break certain rules like Naval attrition and Zone Of Control, just as the player breaks rules with PUing and Inheritance
-DLC policy is atrocious, getting better. This is a theme with all Paradox games

Amazing game, incredibly detailed, a work of art. 

Unfortunately there is something wrong with it, some line of command that when you log in to play will suddenly disrupt your alliances and create coalitions (simultaneously) out of the blue (over 50 years peace no coalitions against you when you logged off) that will attack you at once, no matter how well you have been doing if you were in peace for over 50 years, not married to heirs of the top dogs to ensure they don't try to rule you, you log in and even if you decide to just forfeit the three coalitions the game will just keep throwing all neighbouring countries that will then proceed to attack you regardless. 

Tried many things, different ways, even following what big players teach by the book - but you log in and the software has a bad day and bye bye to your iron man game you played for a day building up and harmonizing. Happened more than thirty times so I just can't play this anymore. These situations are impossible in real life - impossible. 

No issues, overcame even the religious wars in Europe, all country my religion only, in good will with the neighbors, my allies are strong yet not married. Suddenly log in economy over 10 bushels + strong starts dwindling no reason given - then you know the three coalitions bug is inevitable. 

Because of that I could only finish the game a few times (over 2000 hours played). Usually at sixth to eight place so it's not because I want to be number one, it's because the game is really bugged.

because it must be a bug, unless in order for the AI to compensate the fact it is losing just throws even the kitchen sink at you to stop it, what would be really lame mechanics, as the game ceases to be fun if the software has to cheat to win.",1625277562,1686823756,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'm happy with the game when there were 5 major expansions to the game, after this the changes to the base game gotten to a point where I had to relearn everything once again after knowing how to play before the last expansion.

I can understand learning new mechanics can be fun but when the mechanics change to a large of a degree over the years, this makes it not only overwhelming to the player, its just not fun to relearn everything 5 different times to just see how to lower your AE as an example.

Someone out there in like 2-10 years from now, if you see this review, let me say this. Since this game has all the dlc released you now can play a complete game which to you would probably be a steal if this were on sale.

Though it might be a lot of fun to you and I'm glad I put my fair share into it. Still at that point, I would not buy all the dlc if it was greatly reduced because of the practices that Paradox has today. Hopefully they learn that yes it is okay to release dlc if we continue to pay for it, but what most people want is content that is ADDED onto the base game. NOT TAKING AWAY mechanics that made the game fun to play.

The concept itself is great, however the vanilla EU4 experience is dogwater even when you have all the DLCs.
Like most of the paradox games, the expansion packs for the base game itself are overpriced and bring nothing to the table, as most of the mods for EU4 offer more variety and flavor than any EU4 DLCs.

I've wasted quite a lot of time playing this game and from my experience, unless you are playing a very overpowered nation, the beginning of the game is almost 99% rng. You want to play Spain? Oh, you can't because France took 3 provinces in Catalonia, which prevents you from progressing your mission tree as Castille, and additionally you have two disasters, that can (with bad rng) game ruin you. The Mamluks at the start are one of the top 5 great powers, too bad they don't have any flavor. Ottomans sounds fun, too bad the game blocks you from expanding after 2–3 wars because of AE. 

When it comes to historical accuracy of EU4, it is no better. The game seems to be the least railroaded out of all the other paradox games, which definitely offers more variety and has more replayability value for the player. but at this point just make an alt history game set in the late medieval to early modern era's. To me, it makes the game worse and more frustrating, as the player has to deal with the most retarded AI ever created for a game. The AI is not coded to do what certain nations did historically and will often do random stuff, usually resulting in abominations like ""Danish Russia"" or ""French Brazil"" popping out. In short, EU4 is a sandbox game disguising itself as a historical game.

The war and combat part of EU4 sucks. If you want to make a historical game at least do the combat mechanics some justice. The total war genre did it quite well, where they have actual meaningful battles, where a skilled player can win by having a strategical advantage, despite being outnumbered and outgunned. In EU4, battles are pure maths and statistics, with no regard for realism and historical accuracy. For instance, during the Hundred Years War, in the famous battle of Crecy, an outnumbered but better trained English army, defeated the much larger French army, which comprised at the time of the best cavalry in Europe. Try replicating that in EU4.

Now, the map of EU4. The map is just not good. There are numerous historical inaccuracies, which I presume were done for balance or gameplay reasons. I understand, that making a historically accurate rendition of the HRE in 1444 will make anyone's PC burn, however there are plenty of mods for the game, for example Veritas et Fortitudo or Victorum Universalis, both of which had found a fine balance between historical accuracy and game stability. The EU4 vanilla map is simply too self limiting.

The mods are what saves the base game from being completely worthless. Whatever vanilla version of the mod does wrong, there is a mod that fixes it. It just shows how lazy PDX are with their games. All their games revolve around the same strategy of making a half finished product, releasing it and afterwards they proceed to create a billion DLC's for the game, and having the audacity of charging criminal prices for what should have been in the base game at launch.

TL;DR Base game sucks, historically inaccurate, stupid features, no flavor, overpriced dlc's, literally a mod for the game is better than vanilla.",1686311062,1686336921,False,3,1,0.503498554229736328,5,True,False,False

The idea is nice but the implementation once again only for generating money and less for fun!

If you like to play on hard there are no smarter moves of the AI but the AI gets cheats and extreme other advantages that make no sense (for example the ki gets much less expansion mali and then always expands to a huge empire where I think 30 years whether I can take a territory without getting a coalition and the diplomatic maliboni are a cheek) and it becomes pure harassment instead of a challenge.

Yes, capitalism Interactive, sorry, I mean Paradox Interactive, is also just window dressing and the horse has no teeth in its mouth!

So let me start off by saying I am in the USD pricing zone for Paradox games, and as such my prices have not increased as many other countries have, and considering I own almost all the DLCs (mins Mare Noestrum, by far the worst) this price increase does not affect me. That being said, I absolutely can not recommend this game to anyone based on this exploitive price increase, in combination with the ludicrous DLC policy. When GOTY Witcher 3 costs less than Vanilla EUIV in some countries such as Brazil or Russia, you know consumer manipulation has gone too far.

The game itself is fun, combining all Paradox games I have 2k+ hours in the short few years I've used steam, but I can't support a company that would outright exploit countries where purchasing power has decreased or stagnated. Nor can I support a company where their DLC policy is to publish DLCs with essential features for a price comparable to the base game itself. Mare Noestrum is a great example of this, in which you get very mediocre features and ""should be free"" GUI buffs for $20. The Mandate of Heaven also has a noticable teaser with the Ages banner at the top, and providing negative buffs like Devastation free but positive buffs like Prosperity that only come in the DLC, putting players with a smaller wallet at a significant disadvantage.

Until Paradox changes course and commits to changing course, don't buy this game unless it is on sale, and if you're really committed to pro-consumer advocacy I advise not buying paradox games period.

This game is great. One of the best Paradox has ever released and the best in recent memory. If EU5 maintains this game's DNA it'll be well worth playing. This is not. 

Paradox's strategy is pretty obvious at this point. Release a *mostly* complete game and then release expansion pack priced DLC that provides the solutions to the problems they create in ""Free Updates"". No game should have ""DLC required to have fun"" and this game does. They've attempted to mitigate this late in the game's life by releasing a subscription service. If you're the type that doesn't mind paying a subscription, especially for a game with multiplayer this poorly implemented, then by all means go ahead. Otherwise you're stuck paying hundreds for the DLC or trying to play the game with only a couple and slowly getting them. I was the latter and it made the experience very poor, I decided to try a month of the subscription and it's obvious they're paywalling enjoyment of the game. 

I'll be honest. I'm tried of paying $20-30 for something nobody wanted to solve problems they created. All the aesthetic changes would previously had been bolstered by mods but you're left hoping they update the mod after the update breaks it, and even then it might just not be compatible. Games like Rome: Total War had expansions priced similarly and they were nearly full new games. 


Ultimately, it's a great game with insane player freedom, and some of the best (and only) grand strategy out there but mirred by poor executive decisions.",1685910155,1685910155,False,5,0,0.561880350112915039,4,True,False,False

Don´t ask about trade , i don´t know or care :) Am I good at this game? NO! I like winning. So most of the time I play as Ottomans,Vijayanagar,Muscovy and so on. I should remember that if I had hours of fun and ""lose"" a war/game then it was worth it!

 I love geography. I love history. I love games with nearly infinite replayability! Sometimes I like playing just a peaceful colonial game as Spain or someone and then war interrupts everything. Part of the game. Is this a difficult game overall? I don´t know honestly. Depends so much which nation you take. I bought the original Europa Universalis (2000) on a cd back then.

The A.I is the worst i have ever seen even by paradox standards, with things like allied nations either taking over provinces in the middle of nowhere while their entire nation is being conquered, or ally nations never helping in any sort of offence, with them sitting defending their capital while the nation directly between them and the nation is under siege or having their 60K army siege down a province meanwhile in the adjacent province your army is losing a battle that if they reinforced you could win.

First some of the pros, I do sometimes enjoy EU4, even if it's situational.  Being able to play as different empires and rp your way to greatness is really cool, and the game is difficult, which means every victory feels incredibly satisfying.  You feel like the reincarnate of Caesar when you do well in this game.  The world is interesting and varied, with fleshed out nations in Asia, Europe, Africa and even the Americas (with DLCs).  Nations can form others, meaning you can create your favorite historical empires and kingdoms.  The combat in this game is not for everyone, and you move individual units to seige forts and kill other stacks of units, it's an interesting combat system but it can be jarring if you've only played games like HOI with a frontline system.  Economic systems in the game are pretty in depth with some good customization, however don't expect vic2 levels of economy depth.

EU4 is a cool, and potentially fun game, and while I do have fun expanding, it is quickly taken away.  Firstly, This game is very RNG dependent, and whether you get a good start or not is entirely random.  For proof you can just about go to any nation guide, and they always start off with ""If... then restart.""  That's not good game design, its not fun, its just tedious and monotonous, but that's the absolute best of it.  Mid to late game is when RNG really kicks your ass.  Random massive nations allying each other, your best generals dying at the worst possible moments, random events that spawn tens of thousands of ""pretender"" rebels when  you have no unrest, with absolutely no warning, not even letting you accept their demands.  I  can not count how many times I have wasted hours of my life and lost a game because a general randomly died or the nation I was at war with allied the most powerful country in the world.  And that's the absolute worse part of it, it's not bad enough that you have to restart and can't fix your dying nation, but it takes hours, potentially days to get to that point, and if you mess up once you can destroy all of that.

While it is better the more you play, and I am not incredibly experienced with 300 hours (which is ridiculous that that's ""inexperienced""}  Learning this game for the first time can be complete and utter garbage.  The game tutorial is useless, and your only guides are youtubers.  However, if you actually want to play the game you bought without combing through literal hours of youtube tutorials, you are violated by multiple UIs, buttons, and hidden features that you may not even learn until thousands of hours later.  Combat is simple enough, but different nations have ideas that either give them completely OP buffs to their armies, or none at all, making playng some nations out of the questions, same as attacking others.  It almost takes strategy out of the equation, where actually building up your country to a position you are powerful in is completely negated by the fact another nation could have an arbitrary +20% morale boost to their troops.  Combat can be unforgiving and relentless, and you can easily lose stacks of your army in a single battle, deleting tens of thousands of troops, making you have to scramble to re-recruit more.  The economy in this game is incredibly tough to crack, and can be a constant source of stress and pressure in the game, with you usually having to take out a ton of loans to stay afloat until late game.  Even then, to have a competent military with the other powers in the game you are going to need to use loans and experience a degrading economy.  Trade can be incredibly hard to learn for beginners as the interface is complicated and intimidating, Interest from loans can quickly pile up, putting you in a debt trap where your only option is to go bankrupt, potentially ruining your game and making your armies useless.  In all, the game can be brutal for beginners and can continue to be so later on, with little to no breathing room or possibility for experimentation as doing so could cost you time, money and even your whole run.

Lastly, the ai can be frsutrating to work with, and a lot of the time, you'll need to rely on it.  The ai in the game is.. inconsistent at best, with your allies sometimes wiping the enemy completely, or failing to win a single battle against them. 
 It always feels as if the enemy ai and their allies are always better than the ai of your allies.  I have had allies with three times the troop count and power as enemies completely fail to do anything useful, throwing the game and ruining it.  The enemy ai always deathstacks their troops and targets yours, and if your ai allies aren't nearby to help, they will wipe your army and split into dozens of tiny stacks to flood your land, preventing you from making more troops.  The ai in the game can be both incredibly infuriating to go against and work with, making you feel as if you're really the only one doing anything at all in the majority of your rounds.

As cool and potentially fun as EU4 is, there is so much room for disaster that could make your playtime not enjoyable, and cause you to waste hours of your life on a run that you didn't accomplish anything on.  The RNG, AI, and steep learning curve can make the game an infuriating mess.",1685321691,1685321691,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Used to be fun, not ruined. Do not buy.


Long Story: You used to rely on countries opinions of you which were determined by who you were allied to - allied to a countries rival? they'll not like you. You could cut off that alliance to change that, and if you improved your relations with the first country you could become their ally and they would likely help you in a war, depending on their finances and other varying circumstances - all of which made sense. 

Now you need ""10 favors"" to ask a country to come help you in a war.
All that other stuff is still there but now on top of that you need to have ""10 favors"" to ask anyone to come help you in a war, unless you want to make promises of giving them territory - which makes no sense and makes the point of the war essentially pointless. You aren't fighting to expand another country, you are fighting to expand your own.

How do you get favors? you wait, i presume. It was never explained. I lost interest with the game before i got to that point because i honestly cant be bothered to learn redundant game mechanics for games that prior to their addition, had no issues with said game mechanics...

It's like addind a new wood gathering mechanic to RUST where you'd be picking up individual pieces of wood off the ground. It might sound good on paper, but during the actual gameplay, it would be a redundant and useless mechanic that offered nothing but an annoying obstacle to what you were trying to accomplish prior to its addition. You can still technically do it, but it's going to take much longer.

That's what the problem with this addition is. I could TECHNICALLY still start an empire where the netherlands exists, during the HRE, but it would take me phenomenally longer and likewise be phenomenally less enjoyable.



Maybe try listening to the consumer and ask them what they want because no where in any forum, discussion board, reddit post or anything ever, have i ever seen anyone who plays EU4 say ""Hey, you know what would be cool? If we added this thing were instead of just agreeing to help allies as has been done since the dawn of history.. how about now - you can only get allies to help you in wars if you suck off... i mean if you get enough ""favors""... yeah -- we should have this whole ""favor"" system that would essentially slow down every bit of the game progression and keep people festering in unhealthy alliances or just not conquering anything, essentially forcing people to watch the game advance on the fastest speed without being able to logically do anything... that would be so cool""


As a gamer, you're probably reading this and having that same thought all of us are having where we say, ""who even thinks of this shit?"" no one wants this, no one asked for it. It helps nothing. It's so weird because all of us have these amazing ideas, none of which are usually shit ideas because we genuinely talk to other gamers during our brain storming sessions, typically. And we know that an idea like this would be purely unfun at a root level, and outright stupid at a base level... yet here we are in 2023 where games that are coming out are trash and the updates to the games we used to like basically break the fucking game.

I bought the Starter Pack for round about 40,-€ and now I had to buy several more DLCs to be able to successfully play the Portugues Nation and be able to use their advantage of exploring and colonization. Was starting with this nation as it is tagged as beginner friendly in the game. But without some of the further DLCs (like e.g. El Dorado) it is far away from beginner friendly. In total this game costed me 100,- € now and I am far from using all functions of the game.

Only major downside is the price - and the fact that it overlaps with others in the Paradox catalogue - which, while demonstrating the studio's commitment to their product, adds substantially to the cost of purchase.

The depth and the complexity of the game mechanics means that you will still be 'learning' the game hundreds of hours in - and you will likely never master it. Every nation feels unique in some way, and there are tons of unique interactions to discover while playing each of them. The AI has also gotten considerably better at playing the game, which means that there is a lot of challenge early on. However, like most GSGs, the difficulty falls off a cliff in the late-game once you've established yourself.

The game has become a bit of a meme over time due to the massive amount of DLC. Two points on this:
(1) You don't get 10+ years of active development and support on a game without some sort of ongoing income, in this case DLC. The DLC are the price you pay for Paradox to continue developing the game, and with this perspective its less egregious than it appears at first glance. 
(2) A lot of the DLC are no longer necessary due to Paradox removing features from the DLCs and putting them in the base game. There are still a few that are basically 100% required for the game to play correctly - Art of War, mainly - but for the most part the DLC features are additive. I would recommend locating a DLC tier list before buying any, and only buy them on sale or from 3rd party sellers.

Paradox could make great games but instead they charge full price for an alpha build of all of their games and release ""DLC"" which trickle in content. Then charge you even more for this ""DLC"" which, in reality, should already be in the game.

However i would love it more if it was historically and culturally accurate. For example the thing annoys me most is Anatolian Turks, or Oghuz Turks are considered a 'Levantine' culture together with Arabs. This is so stray from what the culture is. 

It should belong to one of the Turkic Culture groups. When i first played this game in 2016, it was in a western turkic group i dont remember the name of, together with Turkmenistan Turks and Azeri Turks which was quite accurate as those lineages all descend from the same Tribe of Turks called Oghuz Turks which takes its name from heroic leader Oghuz Kagan, in Oghuz Destanı. Which is thought to be Mete Han of the First Hunnic Empire in Mongolia - 200 BC.. These people's languages are the most similiar. It all makes more sense as the Turks that passed into west of Caspian Sea in bulks first and founded states there, were Oghuz Turks, from Turkmenistan Region and around Aral Sea. 

Also, it would be lovelier to add minor Oghuz Turkic provinces like Khorasan Turks and so on.

You'll have to manage your income (through trade, taxes and more), your warfare (manpower, armies, generals,...), your diplomacy (who are your allies and ennemies ? Your vassals ?) and your territory through roughly 400 years. You'll choose your difficulty (ie your beginning country) according to your liking and this game'll range from ""very easy"" to ""really challenging"".

Best of all, this game is entire in itself but the developper make new dlc twice to three times a year. You don't have to buy them to enjoy a full game, but even if you don't they always release free content at the same time of each new dlc. Just be aware that you'll have to wait for (roughly) a month or two before every bug is corrected each time they get a new DLC out.

Best parts of this game :
- a real diplomacy compared to most of strategy games
- a new game almost each time you play a new country
- up to 10's of hours of playing for each new starting country
- good in every mechanic
- regular free content",1480236191,1683651000,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend it as a learning tool to people who are either fascinated by geography and world history, or who have been completely bored by it in a classroom lecture setting. I also consider it to be a fun mental exercise up there with the best Total War and Civilisation titles, though EU4 is its own experience is certainly not for everyone.

I have been hesitant to make a proper review because the game is frequently changing, and may continue to change for some time. While I think the model of continuous growth can be compelling for dedicated players, it makes it very difficult for new players to find solid ground. This is on top of the paid expansion model, which I will discuss further on. All to say that I often feel a kind of incompleteness to EU4, neither fully good or bad, that is just part of the experience.

I have played in bursts over the past 5 years, and while I have felt finished at times, I still find myself coming back for one more nation's story, one more crack at taking the world. You get to know the big dogs in your corner of the world, and how to use them to jump from a minor local power into a looming superstate. If you ever get bored of that corner, start a new game somewhere else. Some of the achievements are downright painful, but the good ones offer a good hook to give you new ideas.

I should warn that there is a general instability to the game, with fixed bugs being replaced with new ones -- occasionally game-breaking ones -- each update. Still, the community is active and the devs listen, so a crash usually just means it's time to report and take a break for a few weeks and come back even stronger.

As for the paid expansions, I would recommend new players to mostly ignore them. I consider EU4 to be a hobbyist's game, like Warhammer tabletop or model railroading; you can watch guides to get exposure to some expansion material, and ideally play with others to feel out which expansions you might like. In the past, there have been some expansions that seemed ""necessary"" for play, but the devs have been good about transitioning those most valued mechanics into free updates for all. What remains are mainly flavour packs for certain regions or nations, which add richness if you really crave it. In any case, I neither approve nor oppose the paid expansion model, but would strongly encourage to wait for sales and bundles on expansions.

This game, along with other Paradox strategy titles, ignited a passion for understanding peoples of the world that I never knew I wanted. I recommend Europa Universalis 4 in the hope it will do the same for you.

If you're a history buff or just enjoy complex, in-depth games with a ton of replayability, then this is definitely worth checking out.

One of the best things about EU4 is the sheer amount of content it offers, including a wide range of nations to choose from, a variety of different start dates and scenarios, and complex gameplay mechanics that cover diplomacy, warfare, trade, and colonization. The game never gets stale because there's always a new challenge to take on, and it's incredibly rewarding to see your nation grow and thrive.

That being said, Europa Universalis 4 does have a lot of DLC, and it can add up in price. While some of the DLC is cosmetic, there are several expansions that add significant gameplay mechanics, such as new religions, governments, and regions. If you want to experience the game in its entirety, you'll need to invest in some of these expansions, which can be a bit pricey.

Despite the cost, I do think that the DLC is worth it if you're a serious fan of the game. The expansions add a lot of depth and variety to the gameplay, and they're generally well-done and add value to the base game. Plus, the developers continue to release new DLC regularly, which keeps the game fresh and exciting.

Overall, I can't recommend Europa Universalis 4 enough. It's a truly fantastic game that offers countless hours of entertainment and replayability. While the DLC can be a bit of a barrier to entry for new players, I think it's worth it if you're planning on sinking a lot of time into the game. And if you're not sure which DLC to get, there are plenty of guides and reviews out there that can help you make an informed decision.",1522564726,1683079454,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You think EA is bad? you have met these guys yet. The game is 5 years old and you have to spend more than $200 to enjoy the full version.

Edit: the situation has become much worse. Do not buy. the 1.31 patch and its DLC completely broke the game. Their solution to this broken mess was to start working on another ""immersion DLC"".  If you buy the subscription, over the course of a year or two you'll end up paying more than if you just bought everything.

The only real major game changing mechanics from EU3 is the change of the trade system. Several game aspects, such as navy, army supply, and governance are underdeveloped and for the majority unchanged this same decade. Sometimes I prefer EU3 over EU4. EU3 is a finished product where all aspects come into its own. EU4 feels like a broken product where new mechanics are perpetually added to justify ""fixing"" the game.

- Learning curve and excessive micromanagement is caused by the excessive feature creep. 
- Feature creep exists, because of the excessive amounts of DLCs. Some DLCs are mandatory to make the game playable. More recent DLC's focus on missions which add ""flavour"" which is also obtainable through the use of mods. That these DLCs see daylight is because they are what the consumer wants and on top of that low-risk, low-effort and high pay-off.
- Quality of DLCs and their associated patches are dubious of quality. This has led to a decrease in stability and performance. And while the former was fixed, the latter persists.
- Very slow game pace, especially mid-game when you have to fight the same war over and over again, because absolutism/ admin efficiency have not kicked in and the AI developed every province into infinity. 
- AI is in a terrible state while it has seen some improvements over time. In 1.35 the AI finally seems to realize it is a good idea to attack a stronger, but weakened rival. For years the AI was seen too stupid so their troops would not suffer from attrition. Currently, the AI is exempt from rules that do count for the player, but not for them, such as forming alliances while at war. 
- Diplomacy is broken and attempting to use it as intended is just frustrating. The AI's diplomatic decision making criteria are laughable, for example, when they ditch your alliance, when they join your wars, if they want an alliance with you or if they join a coalition against you. This is inherently related to the stupidity of the AI which is all too easily abused to do your dirty work. The state of diplomacy and AI is best described by the meme ""AE is just a number"".",1682509547,1682509547,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, I'm playing on a high end custom rig and it takes this game several minutes to become playable each time I log on. Second, the roughly 400 year time span of the game could be longer. Perhaps it could start a few hundred years earlier in time. Regardless, I have over a thousand hours of game play and will easily put that much more time into it.

You can choose literally any country in the world from 1444-1820 and play that nation and see it rise or fall. The game mechanics are simple enough to where a new player can have fun, but are deep enough to where you are always learning and adapting your strategies. The frequent updates keep the game fresh with new mechanics and aesthetics to learn and add to the depth of the game. Every time I play something new happens: no playthrough is the same.

However, this positive review is completely conditional on DLC. If you do not have the over $400 worth of DLC, this game is very shallow and lacks many quality of life additions, not to mention countless game mechanics. It is essentially an entirely different game without DLC. If you are able to pick up the DLC on sale, or subscribe to the expansion subscription to unlock them, then this game is completely different.

However, with or without DLC, the game is definitely showing its age at the time of writing. Certain mechanics and features you can definitely tell are from 10 years ago. Each new update seems to break as much as it adds, and it feels like the game is made up completely of spaghetti code at this point. You can also clearly tell that Paradox doesn't play test their new updates and some of their decisions are baffling (buffing the already overpowered Ottomans?). I wouldn't be surprised if an EU5 is announced soon to replace this game. 

But, you can still spend hours on a single campaign, and besides the fact that completely different events happen in each playthrough, your options and play styles are completely different depending on the country. I have nearly 1,000 hours at time of writing on this game, and I still have barely managed to scratch the surface, and that's with me primarily only playing in Europe and the Middle East.",1681815404,1681815404,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Got it on launch, stuck with it through the rough patches, and is by far and away my most played game of my entire life.  Recently it has been getting significantly worse.  First with the Leviathan patch and now with the 1.33 France patch it finally stopped being fun to play.  The change to the military battle calculations just stripped a number of play styles out and replaced it with a single dominant style that any deviation from turns any run radically sub optimal.  

I'll be the first to admit that these changes probably won't be noticed by new players, but over time as you play and master the game they add up to ruin the previously near endlessly diverse ways to play.  It's not a game with infinite repalyability anymore.  It's paint by numbers where you either follow the MP meta in SP and stomp the AI or you don't and your expansion slows to a crawl.  In short whatever they were trying to balance ruined the fun of the game and I've uninstalled it for the first time in over 8 years across 3 computers.

The Pope always said that Ottoman was weak and we should continue to form crusades to defeat him. However, Ottoman has been challenging Europe after defeating the Eastern Roman Empire. The Age of Discovery came, and Spain and Portugal were the pioneers, exploring and plundering the world. The Spanish Armada was even more frightening at the time, and then the rest of the Western European countries followed the pace of the times. Tsarist Russia and Poland in Eastern Europe are also rising and expanding. The Ming Dynasty in the east, as the strongest country in the world, was entrenched in the east, and many countries wanted to be his tributary state at that time. Later, pioneers appeared in Germany and religious reforms were carried out. This is a great thing and we have to admire it. Then, within a few hundred years, wars of all sizes occurred in Europe and even the world. France, Tsarist Russia was gradually becoming stronger, Britain was making great strides, and Manchuria in the east was trying to defeat the once glorious Ming Dynasty, but he succeeded in the end. It is true that God favored Europe, where pioneers of thought appeared, and then there was a great revolution in France that affected the world. A legend saw this opportunity. In the French coup, he was Napoleon Bonaparte, the emperor of the First French Empire. He led the French Revolution Going to the climax, his revolutionary sword is changing Europe, the ideas spread by the revolution are simply too terrifying, so that some countries in Europe have begun to form anti-French alliances, and have fought against him for more than 20 years. Maybe God doesn’t want this A legend won, and eventually the Battle of Waterloo ended him. He should never be forgotten in the long river of history, the ideas, tactics, and others he spread, some even affect today. Almost all wars in the American Revolutionary War and the world after the Great Revolution were related to independence, especially the impact of the Great Revolution. Napoleon is a legend and should not be forgotten. The United Kingdom started the first industrial revolution, and it is advancing at high speed. The North American and Russian plains are the British cornfields, Canada and the Baltic Sea are the British forest areas, Australia is the British pastures, Peru is the British silver mines, South Africa and Australia are the British Gold mines, India and China are British tea plantations, the East Indies are British sugar cane, coffee, and spice plantations, the southern United States is British cotton plantations, and Britain is gradually reaching its peak.

The Vanilla Game is totally borked.

Each new DLC means nerfing old ideas and introducing new ones to play well. And to play well you need to own that DLC.

And after all DLCs have been bought move into the subscription model. Yay! more money! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Playing the vanilla game or with not all the DLCs is like playing with one hand tied behind your back or like fighting a bunch of guys while being in a straight-jacket.

Also save yourself the pain. The iron mode is worth nothing. You would be sacrificing a lot of hours at the altar of the RNG (random number generator). What is an achievement anyways? Play normally. If the RNG is particularly unfair or punshing towards you, just reload from the last save. This would save you a lot of frustration and rage quits. Relax and enjoy history from many different nations perspectives.

Can't say about multiplayer. Never played it.

After 3.7k  hours I still don't know a lot of things. But you don't need to know everything to play the game. If you're willing to spend a day or two learning there is fun to be had. You start by picking one of the existing nations in the world. I haven't counted but I imagine there are hundreds of them. Then you manage your nation with the goal to be better than the others. Usually by making sure there are none left to compare with. There are several start dates but the earliest and I assume most common is 1444.

You will build armies and navies, manage the economy, make allies to make sure stronger nations don't eat you, use diplomacy to hopefully make your alliance eat parts of other alliances, discover and settle the new world, try to please the different groups of your nation (like the Nobility, Clergy and so on), manage new lands and core them so they become yours, try to figure out how to optimize trade, manage religions, I could go on but mostly you will be looking at numbers that describe your country and improve them through different actions and choices.

I mostly play as my own nation, Sweden. In 1444 you start by fighting an independence war against your overlord Denmark. Preferably with an ally or two, Every game has some randomness regarding who will like who so games are always a little different. You get a warscore depending on what the wargoal was and if you achieved that, battles fought, and lands taken among several other factors. Depending on how well you did in the war you can demand lands, money, diplomatic concessions and more. In this case independance and hopefully a few provinces if the war went well.

Then you will probably need some time to cool down. Especially if you took a lot of land. Your population absolutely HATES you taking land and will rebel if you grab too much of it. And your aggressive expansion score will eventually make other nations make coallitions against you if you go too fast. Also you are probably short of manpower for the forseable future.

But soon enough you will look elsewhere for more land. Usually some Novgorod provinces. Then you look for opportunities, does Livonia have strong allies or can we overcome them? Maybe my alliance is strong enough to attack Muscovy?Eventually the truce is up and you will go round #2 with Denmark. Soon you have teched up a bit and will have to choose what to focus on, stronger armies, better economy or perhaps settle the new world?

Your nation grows. You get stronger allies and more dangerous enemies. The diplomatic situation grows more complicated. The longer the game goes on the further away nations can trade and handle diplomacy. Suddenly if you attack a small nearby nation they might have strong allies across the world. Now to take just a small piece of land you might have to spend years getting your troops halfway across the globe. Is it even worth it? This is where the most fun part of the game ends and the more tedious part starts. You are strong enough to win against anyone head to head but if you don't pace yourself everyone in the world will team up against you. Problem is that you only have so much time. The game ends in 1821. So you either play non-ironman mode so you can continue past that date or learn to juggle coalitions against you and learn how to deal with one million rebels roaming your country complaining about how that new province in sibiria is making lives impossible for people in Paris. Because you know... reasons.

I do have all the expansions. While expensive, if you divide the cost by hours played I believe it has been more than worth it. I do recommend the game, with 3.7k hours it would be strange if I didn't.",1680952932,1680952932,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Edit EDIT: [i] I have become addicted to the game, yet I know how harmful it is to me. Like a coldharded abusive wife, I have let it run rampant as my getaway to such horrible ventures.

But like clockwork, time and time again my face is dragged into the mud and peat of the game's brutality. Having me almost taste those successes before taking it all away as quickly and swift like a farmer taking his scythe to the hey. I'm not saying this game is great for that, but I can't help but come back thinking ""Maybe if i do this instead next time, it'll turn out great"". [/i]

But where this game falls down is where most Paradox games fail.  The combat mechanics are simply terrible.  
    
Defeated enemy troops run from combat seemingly any direction, often can't be touched until they rally, and then start taking over provinces.  1k troops can control a 50 mile province AND THEN MOVE ON TO OTHERS.  1k troops would be hard pressed to hold a city of any size in that province let alone an entire province.  Your own defeated troops have to march a hundred miles to rally. Enemy nations might attack your invading forces, but more often than not, they don't defend at all and instead march for hundreds of miles to attack non-defended areas.  Not realistic at all.  
   
It's really a shame because combat really doesn't feel epic or realistic, and feels more like a chore.  There's few to little decisive battles and most of the time is spent herding those rabbit forces, moving towards your undefended areas while you are taking over their entire country without opposition.  

It's just damn strange that Paradox hasn't addressed this in any of their games.  I guess they are making too much money on the macro level DLCs to address this very core issue.

Like other Paradox historical grand strategy games, you control a country as you try to change history and guide your country through multiple different eras of history. One of the main appealing things of this game is how you can choose any country on the map. You can either play as the great powers, horde nations, Native American tribes, HRE princes, whatever you really want! The best part is that different nations in different parts of the world have unique mechanics to them, allowing for more replayability. The diversity in countries and the longer time period is why I prefer this game over Hearts of Iron IV.

One thing to account for, as always with Paradox games, is the DLC. EUIV has A LOT of DLC. Even if you only count the DLC that add major game mechanics to the game, they still cost more than the base game itself by quite a margin. I was lucky enough to get almost all of the DLC via the Humble Bundle a year ago for $20. However, all of the DLC right now is $400+. Also keep in mind when you see videos of this game, it will probably have most/all of the DLC. There is an option to buy a $5 monthly subscription for the DLC, which would probably be the best option if you have none of the DLC.

If you can look past the DLC issues, this game is amazing for anyone that is interested in history, especially during this time.",1680318961,1680318961,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It's a pretty big learning curve, something which can be helped a lot looking at tutorial video's on YT. If you would to start to play this game without getting some knowledge up front, the user interface will be overwhelming and might needlessly give you a wrong impression of the game. Once you get the hang of it, it becomes better and better and more fun to play. Even after you get the hang of it, you probably alt+tab regularly to google things, but this will improve you being an EU4 player.

To go all over the content is to much for a review here, but in a nutshell: You pick a nation you want, choose whatever is available on the map and play it. Control, manage and conquer land/provinces. Have diplomacy with other nations. Manage your economy. Advance in technology as time goes on. Deal with events and make decisions which always pop-up in a message box.

Note: I usually don't do mods, but for me, the governing capacity and the crown colonies are a game killer, so I do play with this combination: unlimited governing capacity mod + MAX_CROWN_COLONIES set to 500 (instead of 4) which you can find in folder: /EU4/common/defines.lua and edit with notepad.

Edit (3/29/2023): I have to make this a negative review, unfortunately. Recent events have led me to believe that PDX is manipulating its fan-base and pretending to be the good guy that utilizes good PR practices and works with modders. Turns out, some modders have had their IP stolen while being completely ignored by PDX for years. I understand that IP theft is technically not what you would call stealing the work of a modder, but moral theft is not okay, even if it is legal.

The DLC policy also has me furious. The blatant extortion as of late is too much for me to bear.

With this money you can have massive fun with drugs, protitutes, alcohol or mix it all together. It is just not worth it to spend it in an EXCEL simulator.

Unlike those DLCs offered by other companies, paradox DLCs add no extra campaigns, no extra factions.
Instead they had gameplay mechanics, buff a random part of the world and break the game for those that don't buy the most recent DLC. The core EU4 experience changes fundamentally after each expansion and factions which once were weak become now overpowered just because they were the theme of the new DLC. Except you don't own the DLC! 
Mechanics which were free are replaced and exist now behind a paywall, even quality of life short cuts are locked away inside some DLC you don't own.

If you want to play freestyle, you can assume control of any nation on earth in 1444 and go in any direction you want to try. However, I have issues with that type of game - I start feeling overwhelmed by all the possible choices and I struggle to choose. I usually don't feel engaged in that type of game because while I can crush my neighbors and paint the map my color, I start to feel like why should I? Just to see my numbers go up? EU4 offers something for me that other paradox games are sorely lacking: Missions. Paradox has added excellent mission trees to all of the most popular countries in the game. These missions fall into two categories: 1. Things that would be good for any country to do, like increasing your army size, your treasury, your ally relationships, or unifying all of the territory around you or 2. Completing goals that that country either historically DID do or that they WANTED to do. And if you complete the mission, you get some sort of reward to your country, be it more claims on more territory around you, buffs to income, buffs to public order etc. It creates challenges in the game that are fun to try and overcome. For example, starting as Muscovy you have stuff you need to take before you can form Russia. Once that is done you get claims on large swathes of land in Poland/Lithuania. Poland/Lithuania is formidable, so it is a challenge to build yourself up to a point where you can accomplish these goals. It's really far more engaging than other paradox games. I also really appreciate how the game is broken into early/mid/late game by world events. You start out in the age of discovery, when nations are going through the renaissance and nations like portugal and spain are discovering the new world and vying for colonies. Not everyone is in a position to colonize though, so there is a variety of experiences you can have in the early game. Then the age of reformation begins and suddenly there are protestant nations appearing all over europe, which will eventually pull a ton of europe into the religious league war. After that comes the age of absolutism, which sets the stage for the final age of the game, the age of revolutions: nations with super high absolutism may see the revolution appear in them and then the wave of the revolution can spread like fire across europe. All of these things will impact how you play. No two playthroughs of Eu4 are ever the same because of the huge amount of variables being modeled. I really can't praise this game enough. CK3 bores me because yes, I can kidnap and eat the pope, but why? It's funny once and then I just don't see the appeal. There's so few events and historical flavor in that game it really signaled the beginning of this new, seemingly bad era for paradox. Victoria 3 is shaping up to be the same. They claim it is an economic simulator, but really the economic simulation is extremely simple once you figure out how it works. I'm glad I still have Eu4 to come back to since they keep adding valuable content to it. I'm not optimistic for whatever Eu5 will be because surely the new leadership at paradox will make them strip all fun out of the game in order to maximize their profit.",1680012731,1680012731,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've done a bit of multiplayer, and the experience is vastly different. This review is up to 1.34 with all current DLC. I believe the EU4 experience can be broken into 3 separate stages.Stage 1 is learning the basics. EU4 is a difficult game to get into. There are many unexplained mechanics, the UI can be difficult at times, and there seems to be too much to keep track of. While this makes the game difficult to get into, it makes the mastery of those mechanics much more rewarding. There are plenty of guides online if you want to learn that way rather than trial and error.Stage 2 is learning how to plan out your moves. After you learn the mechanics, you'll start to learn strategies and goals. As Poland you'll want to form the Commonwealth, as Muscovy you'll form Russia, as England you'll form Great Britain and dominate north america. You'll learn what idea sets go best with those nations, how to efficiently use your resources to win against your rivals, and how to use and format your armies properly. The vast majority of players stop the learning here and then eventually start to lose interest, as nothing seems ""new"" anymore and all the playthroughs seem the same.The 3rd and final stage is to optimize your gameplay. Learning the small quirks of mechanics and how they may effect your country, and how to utilize them effectively. Throwing on ironman mode and achievement hunting. Doing Byzantium on ironman is probably the best example of this, as it's relatively easy compared to other hard starts but still provides a good challenge. Another good example is razing the world to the ground as a horde when you learn to do efficient conquests and balance truces to nullify aggressive expansion.If you think that taking your time and learning the mechanics of a game to challenge yourself is fun, you'll most likely get your money's worth from this game. I know I have. The game is flawed, don't get me wrong. There are areas of the game that are criminally underdeveloped, Persia being the best example. Other areas are just so poorly made that I can't bring myself to play any nation there, the Americas being the main culprit.TLDR: Git Gud, and game is Gud",1679721294,1679721294,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son recently started EU4 and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

You will get banned and your post deleted. Here is what got me banned when someone asked CK2 or CK3: ""CK2 - They took elements out of CK2 to resell to us in CK3. That laziness alone should encourage you to either look elsewere or buy the older complete game. They use the excuse that it was not up to their expectations, yet copy and pasted an older version of the CK2 map (mistakes and all) for the base CK3 map and positions. (Dukes, counties, cultures in wrong places, all things corrected in later patches of ck2, that they just took out of 3.) Reagents were in CK2 for example, and are now being sold back to us as a full price DLC in CK3.Even if it was not ""up to snuff"" they should have included the old mechanics, and either improved them or completely changed them later in CK3's life, instead of just taking them out all together leaving a massive hole where that content was. Because they were functionable, added a lot of roleplay and replayability. But instead, paradoxs policy is to completely remove, make it barren so that you have to buy the full price DLC ju TLDR: I would avoid Paradox games like they plague as they have one of the worst DLC and sequel policies in video games. But if you must pick one of the two, CK2 all the way. The ONLY thing 3 ""trumps"" 2 in, is visual appeal. But the UI sucks so much in 3, that it barely makes up for it. Even in a roleplay sense, CK2 trumps 3 any day of the week.""Calling work lazy is apparently offensive.

This is twice you have silenced criticism. Is it the word lazy? Saying something is lazy is offensive to you? That is insane. After rereading both of the times you have done this, you just have the fact people are people out you are reselling aspects you took out from the prequel and the fact I called that lazy. No personal attacks, no insults. Just pointing out. No one has this level of censorship, for calling work ""lazy."" That is pretty thin skinned, and petty.There were zero insults in my post, just calling work lazy. That is not insulting, that is pointing something out.

It offers a depth and complexity that is unparalleled in the strategy game market and allows me to experience history in a way that no other game can.

One of the things that I love about EU4 is the sheer scale of the game. The game spans from the late Middle Ages to the early modern period, and allows you to play as any of the nearly 500 different nations in the game. Each nation has its own unique attributes and challenges, making each playthrough a completely different experience.

Another standout feature of EU4 is its focus on historical accuracy. The game models everything from the political alliances of the time to the technological advancements of each nation, giving players a sense of immersion that is hard to match in any other game. I love how the game allows me to explore different historical what-if scenarios, such as what would happen if the Ottoman Empire conquered Europe or if France was never defeated in the Hundred Years' War.

The game also has a steep learning curve, which I see as a positive. It takes time and effort to master the intricacies of the game, but once you do, the sense of satisfaction is unparalleled. The game also has a robust multiplayer component, which allows me to play with friends or other players from around the world, making each playthrough a new and exciting experience.

Of course, like any game, EU4 has its flaws. The game's AI can sometimes be unpredictable, leading to frustrating situations where the player's best-laid plans fall apart due to unexpected actions from the AI. Additionally, the game's interface can be overwhelming for new players, and the sheer amount of information presented on the screen can be intimidating at first.

Overall, EU4 is a game that has captured my heart and mind like no other. Its depth and historical accuracy, combined with its challenging gameplay and multiplayer component, make it a must-play for anyone who loves strategy games and is interested in exploring the intricacies of history.",1679532103,1679532103,True,84,4,0.842666089534759521,7,True,False,False

Get this game if;
1) You're a raging strategy nerd who's dabbled in and largely completed more mainstream games (Civ, Total War, etc)
2) You have good friends who are raging strategy nerds, so you can spend countless hours strategy-sharing for future conquests, troubleshooting current conquests, and glorifying previous conquests
3) Are completely okay spending the first 20-50 hours finding new and inventive ways of spectacularly over-indexing in one area, and subsequently finding other nations mercilessly punishing you back into obscurity for it
4) Adore cultural diversity (increasingly represented in-game) but are willing to suspend such in the name of imperialism
5) Want a uniquely immersive way of developing an expansive knowledge of world geography and history, especially the obscure bits
6) Ideally, have better self-discipline than myself, or have better excuses than myself as to why you sometimes attend late for work/appointments/catch-ups.

Please do note that I have played the game up until version 1.34 with all DLCs on multiplayer, and up until version 1.30 with AoW, CS, RoM, MoH, ED, and RP on singleplayer. Also do note that, despite the voluminous size of this review, I am in no way trained or experienced in video game critique, and am simply putting forward and exploring my personal experiences with the game.

There used to be a paragraph here about how I struggled with whether to mark this review as positive or negative, ultimately landing on positive. I have since returned to EU4 after a break, and my experience was.... underwhelming. Now, to address all the people who say rating a game not recommended with 1000 hours in is hypocritical. Many points can be made against that argument, but I will say the following. That I have played a game for a long time does not mean it has to be a good game. It does not even have to mean I personally liked it on the merits of its design or gameplay. Maybe it just makes a convenient tool for killing time. Maybe it has a special place for a group of friends. That does not mean the hours drowned in it are thanks to the game's intrinsic qualities, and it all the more does not mean I am going to RECOMMEND it to other people. I think my original points still hold though, so the following review is unedited.

On account of its mechanical complexity, EU4 is well-known for having a high entry threshold. You might at some point find yourself 1500 hours in and still not knowing exactly how combat works. However, this example also speaks to the fact that you do not have to know all the mechanics meticulously to actually play the game meaningfully. You will still need a lot, mind you, and knowing more typically allows you to strategize more skilfully, but you do not *have* to know quite so much to play decently. This, however, is a double-edged sword. It means that a lot of the game's mechanics can feel somewhat redundant to the regular player, and thus not having their true potential utilized. This, in itself, is still not neccesarily a big problem for the usual player's experience, but it segways into a rather more noticeable problem with EU4's mechanical complexity.

A lot of the mechanics do not have a very real impact on the gameplay - they are not utilized to their full potential. There is a joke in the EU4 community that the game is pretty much just a map colouring simulator - and this comment is not unfounded. Despite the plethora of mechanics at the player's disposal, by far most EU4 games will follow the very same pattern, at least until mid to late game - build a spy network to justify war, declare war, take land gains, integrate conquered land into your country, crush rebels who do not like it, rinse and repeat. Of course, your game will be somewhat different whether you play a merchant republic or a feudal monarchy, whether you play an island nation or a landlocked one, etc. But some patterns are painfully repetitive. The game has virtually no support for ""tall"" play - developing a small, well-developed state, and protecting oneself using diplomacy, rather than preventive war and vast swaths of territory. Such a playstyle makes for both a boring experience and a vastly more difficult time being a power that actually matters than just expanding ceaselessly. Even as a merchant republic, which should by all accounts bloom as a small nation surrounded by trade partners, you will probably end up expanding to support your nation's development and protect yourself from invasion either way. This can make replayability and diversity of player experiences not that amazing, surprisingly, considering the theoretical scope and diversity of the game.

Another problem with making the experiences feel diversified is the way EU4 handles flavour, or rather the way it is diminished by other factors. The game clearly has a lot of work put into establishing flavour - from unique country ideas, to a plethora of localized events, to even individual unit types featuring in-depth descriptions of their historical background, that most players have probably never noticed. However, that last part is the problem - all the flavour will probably be hard for most players to notice and appreciate. I feel like that stems not from issues with the flavour itself, but the way the game handles UI. EU4 embraces a philosophy of laying all the modifiers and consequences of the player's actions out clearly right in front of them. This might be good for letting the player know what they are doing, allowing them to plan out their actions and predict the consequences in a system as mechanically complex as EU4's. However, you will quickly notice that all those modifiers seriously distract from flavour. Personally, even though I think I would genuinely appreciate flavour as one of the most important aspects of the game otherwise, I never read the actual content of events that pop up. I only found out about the meticulous unit descriptions when I started modding units. Because of all the modifiers you can see laid out in front of you, EU4 becomes almost solely a game of optimizing the numbers. When an event about a conspiracy pops up, you do not bother to appreciate that there is a story going on in the shadow of your throne - you start worrying about the number of admin power points it is going to take to prop your country's stability level back up. When a rebellion erupts in one of your provinces, you do not think about the societal factors behind the growing unrest - you mechanically send in an army to quash it. Even though the flavour technically provides a lot of opportunities for political roleplay - will your ruler flee the capital which is experiencing an epidemy of plague to preserve their life, or will they stay to inspire the inhabitants - when they actually come up, you worry more about whether you can handle the loss of a ruler or a growing unrest modifier in the capital better. Instead of varied political roleplay, of telling an interesting story spanning centuries of history, the game becomes strict realpolitik. And you do this absent-mindedly, even if you would rather roleplay a sociopolitical story than mundanely optimize your empire.

There is, admittedly, a certain silver lining to all of this. Some aspects of the game are big and flavourful enough decisions that they do not suffer from this problem, and I have always had the most fun with EU4 when those things are allowed to shine. There is simply nothing more entertaining than, say, converting Kamchatka to Hussitism as a federal empire you built from a city-state in the HRE. When you play around with such things as nations, cultures, religions, government types, or bizarre borders to create unholy alternate historical scenarios, the potential of the game's flavour really shines - typically in very hilarious ways. Although this also makes it somewhat more clear what all the small-scale flavour could have been had it been given the chance to stand out.

No review of a Paradox game can go without mentioning the heinous DLC policy. As with most Paradox games, base EU4 can be gotten at a reasonable price on sale, but without DLCs, the game is incredibly basic and underdeveloped - meaning you are effectively forced to spend really large amounts of money on a heap of DLCs if you want anything more than that. There is, however, a caveat. The game only requires the host to have a given DLC in multiplayer, so if you have friends who are willing to play, you only need one set of DLCs between you. I think multiplayer also really enhances the best parts of the game mentioned above.

The game is also incredibly easy to mod, as long as you are not looking into changing fundamental mechanics. The code built on top of the engine itself is easy to edit and (mostly) very clear, even to someone with zero coding experience (like me), meaning after a few short and easily available tutorials",1647008351,1679141697,False,1,0,0,6,True,False,False

Pros: 
Lots of stuff to do, lots of CRAZY achievements, from hardcore to easy peazy. You can create whatever monstrosity you have in mind, or re-enact history with (or without) your friends. Or something in between. Or both of them at the same time. It looks hard, it's actually easy once you do a campaign and reach 1650. Past 1650, just be sure to have a fast CPU and lots of RAM (Fast Universalis is your friend).

Cons:
After 1650 you can pretty much blob everything or explode. Or become revolutionary, which helps you blob at a faster rate...or explode at a faster rate. Or explode people, at a faster rate. Right, France? Lol.
LOTS of DLCs, but this is also a pro. Lots of content. But the thing is, they changed the game too much too many times, after a while it's hard to follow.

The interface and mechanics can be quite arcane.  And when I read about the mechanics online, it just becomes a task of optimizing the game's mechanics, which completely drops the illusion of some kind of world scale strategy, it just becomes a system optimization activity.

Then I read that in order to enjoy the game I just need to get one more DLC to fix some odd broken mechanic, or to make a particular nation fun to play.  Just one more DLC and it will be great.  I promise you'll have fun if you get that DLC!  But it doesn't.  Its just more spending for a game that doesn't feel ""fun"" in any way.  Oh well.  I guess it works for many, but the investment in learning curve and DLC is very high if you are first approaching the game.

The game appears interesting, and it is very well rated, but I am simply stunned by the lack of thought given to the GUI. It's bad... no... it's horrible. Little tiny buttons hidden behind other tabs, or with icons that are not clear or are too small to make sense, including some of the most imporant ones. As a result, things take 4-5 times longer than they should. It isn't even really a question of getting used to the layout; some of the locations simply do not and cannot make sense. Things like telling a ship to move and to where should be simple left click/right click, They're not. 

The game clearly has depth, and it is visually satisfactory, and I can see why so many players are enthusiastic for playing it. I want to like it, but with the GUI as it is now, I just can't bring myself to commit. Why should it be any harder to play than a Civ game? 

There's one other thing that annoys me, and that's the DLC. Rather than work on the next version for the franchise, they have posted up a bunch of content for sale. Most of it should probably have been included in the game itself. Seriously, there's more that $300 worth of DLC there. Talk about developers behaving badly...

I've uninstalled my copy, and while I did not ask for a refund, if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't have bought it. The same thing goes for every game by this developer. Sometimes in the future, I may give it another chance... lol... no TBH, that isn't going to happen.

03/07/2023 Update: Installed to see if I had changed my mind. Nope, the GUI is still horrible. Click on army. Find little tiny box to use ship, click on tiny box to unload army.

- My ally and friend for hundreds of year and with full trust suddendly and for no reason turn on me and ally with my ennemies (no overextension or negatif effect because I took too many proivinces during a war but I guess my ally was bored with me, the spark of our relationship stopped, this stuff happened I guess)
- My economy suddendly go to negative for no reason, I didn't go over my army or navy limit, my provinces have cathedral and stock exchange but still no good, and when I save and recharge my play boom back to positif... I mean come on
- Once you're too big the IA main objectif it to crush you as simply as that, and even country with just one province and 15 development magically and for no reason got an army of 40k !

Love the cheating IA, I think it had a touch of magic to the game...

Many features will feel incomplete, or just not function, without any DLC, or without the right DLC. Because PDX seems to think it's totally fine to cut them in half in major updates.

Take, for example, army templates. It's a system built so you can have standardized army built with a single click. Supposedly, if you have an existing army you want to adjust to a new template, you can do that too, detaching excess manpower (say, too many calvarymen) and training up what the army lacks, as long as you have the money and reserve manpower to do so.

Some of the buttons to use this exist at all time, but don't function AT ALL without the Art of War DLC (+$20). But if you do have the DLC, it still won't work completely. Training up a completely new army works. Shaving off that excess works. But new regiments won't train for an existing army that lacks part of a template you're wanting it to conform to. You can have infinite gold, infinite manpower, all technology, and it just won't. This problem exists for navy fleets as well.

EU4 is rife with these sorts of things. There echos of DLC features all over the place, and sometimes the buttons to use them will be there outright, and you may even be able to click them (to no effect). If you're too poor to spend hundreds of dollars on a game, you have the exclusive privilege of investigating how much of the game actually functions, and if you DO pay the money, it might still not work right.

There are other problems, of course - there's a shocking lack of content for anything outside of Europe (unless there actually is, and I just haven't bought the DLC for that), and the content in Europe feels clunky and artificial (again, probably fixed by $100 of DLC). In a lot of other PDX games, they're trying to accommodate people not fortunate enough for the privilege of having the DLC, but here they seem to expect everyone to be a Saudi Prince with no ability to discern quality.

Since a play through of this game often spans months or realtime, and since the game is still being updated/maintained, you NEED to turn off automatic updates if you want to not get angry with this game.


This game covers the time of early colonialism, and it can be frustratingly difficult to play a European power that wants to halt colonies from forming and destroying the native nations of the Americas. If you just take the foreign colonies over, your holdings will eventually become semi independent powers, and will wreak havoc across the Americas.  You have to actively try to sell holdings to the natives surrounding you to keep your holdings in america to become an autonomous power of its own. it is frustrating. 

The game IS a lot of fun, though there is definitely a steep learning curve for figuring out ideal army size/breakdown and timing for reinforcing battles to be able to stand up somewhat to the computer AI.

Set in a beautifully crafted world that simulates the rise and fall of nations, the game is packed with intricate mechanics and a vast array of modifiers that can affect everything from trade to warfare.

A major downside is the cost of the DLCs. With a total cost of over 400 euros without discounts, it's a steep price to pay for the full experience. While some of the DLCs are worth the investment, others are less essential and can be skipped. It's up to the player to decide how much they're willing to invest in the game.

One of the best things about Europa Universalis IV is the ongoing effort to improve and develop the game. The developers are constantly releasing new DLCs that add new content and mechanics, as well as fixing bugs and improving the overall gameplay experience. This level of support and dedication is impressive and keeps the game fresh and exciting.

Another standout feature of the game is its music. The soundtrack, composed by Andreas Waldetoft, captures the grandeur and drama of the historical period in which the game is set. From epic orchestral pieces to hauntingly beautiful solo performances, the music enhances the game's atmosphere and adds to the immersion.

Despite the high cost, Europa Universalis IV remains a top-tier grand strategy game that rewards players who take the time to learn its complex systems. From managing trade routes to engaging in diplomacy, there's always something new to discover and master.

- This is the definition of grand strategy.
- The depth of play is intense and well worth the steep learning curve.
- The constant updates and expansions continue to give you a new experience (for good or bad).
- The modding community is fantastic.
- The achievements span from unbelievably easy to impossible.

I prefer games with much, much more historical depth and realism than other games, (such as the well known Civilization). 

Many games are released, but a precious few have any depth under the hood to make the game truly enjoyable.

As someone who has been playing strategy games pretty much since the PC became a thing, (and as someone who has played each version of Europa Universalis as well as countless other games of the genre), I feel confident in my opinion that Europa Universalis IV is arguably one of the best strategic games ever made.

There is a learning curve to this game, -it is complex-but it is a ""learn as you go"" experience, - which makes even learning it enjoyable.

If I had to nit-pick, I would like the ability to customize our nations in a much more in depth way in terms of religion, builds, infrastructure and government.  I would also like to see a much greater depth of military strategy for combat (tactics, fortifications, terrain etc.). Lastly, I do wish that each nation had more features and complexity that made them feel-and play as unique nations. 

But overall, this game is extremely solid. It has an exceptionally high level of replayability-each game will be different and each game will last for weeks if not months of gameplay. Almost all of the additional content for the game is worth the purchase price and while the total cost of the game-(with all content is high), for me it is well worth it (as my number of hours played shows)

If you love history and in depth strategy games, I highly recommend this game.

The AI cheats horrendously and it can easily be proven.

Take a look at almost any European nation that you declare war on.

They will have 

Exponentially larger manpower then you
Exponentially better combat rolls then you
Exponentially more money then you
etc..

Yet, when you take over their land you discovered their regions are developed to the level of stone age.

So then this begs the question where do they get their manpower, money, tech, etc.. from?

There is most likely some script or hard code in the background that massively boosts the AI's resources.

The majority of the game is you looking at a map and making governmental decisions, like going to war, making allies, or developing your nation.
There are hundreds of unique ways to play, since almost every country plays differently. I havent even begun to explore all of the possibilities.

My biggest problem with this game is that the total cost of all the DLC is upwards of $350 and will only continue to increase as more DLC gets added. Paradox is notorious for this.
Even though I dont have any DLC, I still really enjoy the game. Though some aspects of the game feel like they are necessary, but are locked behind a DLC paywall.
However, there is a way to get around it. If a friend of yours has EU4 and all/some of the DLC, and sets up a multiplayer lobby, you then have access to the DLC that they own for that campaign.

I do think, at its core, its a very well made game, supported by the fact that its still getting content, albeit in DLC.

The game is marginally faster on speed five and starts to chug and drag horridly post 1600. They promised better AI and that was a half truth, which is another way to say a lie. The AI is more aggressive but only compared to more recent patches where combat is basically broken. It spends most its time walking from theater to theater melting away under attrition, and with the changes to manpower that makes every nation but the player perpetually low on manpower. Coalitions are a joke. Strong nations are a joke, allies are a joke. Naval landings are better but only because the AI unapologetically breaks the rules in terms of attrition, both on troops and boats. What is punishing for the player is done on a whim by the AI.

The only thing, and I mean the only thing PDX got right here is AI finally building buildings, and building the right ones. However this has always been possible, and was more of a tactic to limit the player's gains by not giving them provinces that are already complete. They are not to be applauded for doing what several mods over the years have implemented, this was always possible and easy.

It's just more crap, more bugs more busted features. Lions w/o Worth is disgustingly overpriced and honestly should have been free, I'm only grateful that it is so completely without value so I don't feel any compulsion whatsoever to pick it up. 

Some good new companies are coming up, should put some pressure to PDX to stop this dramatic slide in quality, but it probably wont. They have their whales and nothing will change that",1496475865,1676483521,False,0,0,0.473212778568267822,0,True,False,False

The game while not the prettiest to look at it and can be seen as boring to others, has this level of depth I have yet to find in another game. This is the game I have the second most amount of time on 1600 hours as right now. 

Complexity in this game really makes you feel like you are playing a ruler and having to make tough decisions everyday. For instance diplomacy in this game is very tricky. Most things you do like declare war, make allies with someone who doesnt like them, or even just bordering someone can make the game more dynamic. I find the diplomacy section the most enjoyable for myself. Whether its creating giant webs of alliances to make my country almost impossible to declare on. Or creating giant vassals and destroying my enemies without having to lift a finger. it feels good because the game will let you do that.

Biggest con I will give this game is its complexity. I will say it took my about 100 hours to grasp the concept of this game and actually start having fun. I believe this game should award you a college degree after about 400 hours because of how much complexity there is.

Overall this game has been a blast. This review isnt very good. But I will say this game is amazing once you put in the time to understand it.",1676403786,1676403786,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EU4 is a game with lots of complex mechanics and a complicated DLC setup that aims for well off people. If you want to start out, wait for a sale.

[h1] DLCs [/h1]
If you read the Reviews for the game and DLC´s the pricing is questionable and hardly anybody recommends to buy at full price. The next caveat is that the developers chose to include base functions in their DLC's.
[list]
[*] want to upgrade your provice -> DLC
[*] want to build Tradecompanies -> DLC
[*] want to upgrade a trade hub -> DLC
[/list]

Next they topic is that Quality of life improvements are behind a DLC e.g.
[list]
[*] Upgrading your navy -> DLC (land troops are fine)
[*] Recruit to army -> DLC (else you have to recruit by province and then give a move command)
[/list]
As the game is built around playing hundreds of hours, you will get nudged into buying the QoL improvement, as it saves you time and brainpower you can invest on something else.

Most functionality is spread around many DLCs. So there is no ""War"" DLC with all War options, Diplomacy DLC etc -- compared to e.g. Civ series where an expansion will have one focus on a theme. You can find yourself in the area where you research if you have access to a certain feature or how to unlock it.

[h1] the UI is a mess [/h1]
The game has lots of information and it hides the information in many tabs, submenues or changing tabs if you click an icon or text. So if you start out you have (F1)  country view -> (0) Stability. As a beginner I had a hard time finding cores, hidden under ""Manage"", that changes the lower pane of the selection. In Government the crown takes you to a new screen.

If you try to find out where your opponent has his colonies, it is a mess - if you mouse of a country you get a red outline - but if it is spread out and the country small the outline is hard to notice. You can use the Goods location screen in the ledger, but cannot limit the information to a certain country.

A clear design choice bevore release with a concept about how the UI will evolve in the future could help a lot.

[h1] Achievements locked behind ironman - Ironman only allows visual mods[/h1]
I do play singleplayer and I detest a developeer telling me how I like my game to play. I did actually base my buying decision on the mod support on steam  - only to relize later that mod support is restricted - and achievements locked behind Ironman - in other games at least the developers let you disable this using a mod. Not here.

[h1] for a 90 € or 280 € price tag the game has an abysmal tutorial[/h1]
It has an introduction like - recruit a unit, move unit - a basic list of steps, but it won´t allow you to test yourself and master each of these conecpts.

E.g. for combat a modern game would start out similar with - recruit a unit, move a unit, explain field of vission, terrain type and then continue to give a goal where you need to apply the skills - e.g. conquer an enemy nation.

Now EU4 is a millitary game, but it calls itself grand-strategy. So you need to know about other types, like espionage, choosing the right casus belli, actaully how to gain certain casus belli - how Aggressive Expansion works, Personal Unions, Gonvernment types, Terrain for combat and provice improvement, ...

(and other games also bring an in-game documentation about their concepts like civiliopedia in Civilisation).

This lack of polish on the developers side has lead to a pletora of online ressources - reddit, youtube tutorials explaining what the game fails to.

Columbus appealed to the King of Portugal in 1484 and asked for a ship to reach the East by sea from the West, but was refused. He had done extensive research for the voyage he was planning to embark on, but could not find a funder. On top of that, he entered the resin trading business to make a living.

When he could not find a ruler to finance his expedition in Europe, he applied to Bayezid the Second. According to rumors, he appeared in the presence of a priest accompanied by a priest, and asked for ships to be placed under his command ""in order to discover new countries on behalf of the Sultan"", but Bayezid the Second rejected the request, thinking that the sailor he met was a dreamer.

1. Play multiplayer with someone hosting who has all the DLC already, since you can then play that game with all the DLC too.

2. Use the subscription pass. $5 for all the DLC is worth it, even if you just want to try it out for a bit. If you find you don't like it, it will only be $5 spent instead of $200+.

OLD:

This is a hard review to give.

I love this game, I really do.  One of my top 10 games I've ever played.  It scratches an itch that most other games just can't scratch.  And even after all the hours I've spent playing the game, there are still thousands of hours of content left that I haven't delved into.

Having said all of that, I just cannot recommend it to someone who is looking to get this game for the first time.  The double-edged sword of constant updating by developers has led to the game being constantly refined at the expense of a massive amount of content being locked off by DLC.  Without exaggeration, a new user would have to spend hundreds of dollars to simply upgrade the base game without dlc to the fully-fledged game I play today.  That's not an expense I would recommend to anyone who lives on a somewhat normal income.

Until Paradox changes it's DLC policy to package many of the older DLC into a much cheaper deal for possible new or returning players, I cannot recommend this game.  You should not have to pay the price of multiple Triple-A titles for a single game.",1433604536,1675714994,True,0,0,0.502487540245056152,0,True,False,False

Review 9/10

I've probably played 600-800 hours all told with this game over the past 6 years. 200 or so here. You see people playing thousands of hours and there is a reason. It's. That. Good. It just is. So much added through expansion and mods that make it even more diverse (extended timeline is an outstanding mod). I could say what everyone else has said but I'll just be brief and say that if you enjoy, truly enjoy, grand strategy games, then you will enjoy this. It may take a play-through or two. You will definitely have to learn as you go (I'm still learning), but you won't regret your purchase!

The game itself is fine, but it's incredibly dull, and requires a lot of imagination and projection.   There's nothing to look at beyond a lifeless map, data, and a few other things.  Football Manager is a spreadsheet game, but even it manages to be much more visually stimulating, and waaaaay more intuitive than this jumbled mess.
There's tabs, sub menus and all kinds of nonsense hidden all over the screen.  Your fort menu blends in at the side of another menu so it can be easily missed.
Doing anything requires money, and money isn't easy to come by. 
To play this mind numbing map painter you essentially need to know the history, research the area and then set about putting a few things in motion.  After that it's a matter of managing how fast the game plays. 
Honestly, it's the least intuitive game I've ever played.  The DLC model is utterly laughable and honestly I pity anyone foolish enough to throw hundreds of pounds at such blatantly corrupt devs.  The DLC's don't add to the game like all of the map packs in ETS or ATS, instead they complete the game.  The subscription fee is also hilarious.

Honestly, if I had the choice I'd pick up Crusader Kings 3.   It's much more intuitive, it's visually stimulating, you're playing as people instead of a land mass, and it looks like it's a much more complete experience.  Even with the DLC's the price seems fair.  Then again, seeing what I've seen I have absolutely zero trust in PI.

Secondly those that require a set-up, like Colonists of Catan or Monopoly. And lastly there are games that require hours of preparation and strategizing. Europa Universalis IV is part of the latter.

The game is based on a real world board game. That real life version uses a variety of chips, cards and pieces. This translates perfectly into a game version. But that also means that the game can become way more complicated as it is possible to code and track multiple features in the background. This is no turn based game. A day passes every couple of seconds and you can adjust the speed. The game uses different forms of currency or mana, like ducats, 'monarch power', manpower, sailors etc. These get updated every month, according to how you build your state.

[i]Setting[/i]
In Europa Universalis 4 (Eu4) you choose a nation in the year 1444. It is possible to select an exact date between 1444 and 1821, but it is advised to start in 1444. In this time frame the world changed drastically and you have to guide your country in becoming a prosperous and strong state. The game uses a historical time frame, but after unpausing the game for the first time, the game is completely ahistoric. It is up to the player to decide what to do.

[i]Gameplay[/i]
A core mechanic in Eu4 is strategically using your 'mana'. Everything has a cost. Integrating vasals, coring new land, recruiting generals, developing your land etc. uses monarch power. (administrative, diplomatic and militairy) The amount of monarch power you gain depends mainly on your ruler's stats (0-0-0 to 6-6-6), your advisors and some other factors. There are more pools of mana like ducats and manpower. The gameplay loop is acquiring and using these pools. Becoming a good player means knowing how to balance your mana usage and how to get even more mana.

[i]DLC's[/i]
Eu4 has a lot of 'DLC's'. Some give flavour to a region or play style. Others add core mechanics and there are also skins and sound tracks available. As a new player it's difficult to grasp this insane list of add-ons. Eu4 gets an update every half-year to a year. There is a free part of the update and a DLC part. This is how Eu4 is monetized.
I advise that you [b]ONLY[/b] buy Eu4 on sale and try it out. Learn the core mechanics. Try a big country around Europe, like France, the Ottomans, England, Spain or Poland. Watch video's on YouTube, read stuff on the wiki and look at achievements and formeable nations. You will find an obstacle in the form of a missing DLC. Decide if it's worth to buy necessary DLC's (and wait for big sales, like on Instant Gaming). This requires a lot of strategizing, in game and when buying DLC's. At least if you want to think economically. Remember, Eu4 is the acquivalent of a Warhammer board game. You need to buy trinkets and extra's to play the game. 
--> Read the wiki for more information on DLC's, but here is a quick summary:

[i]DLC help[/i]
[i]Conquest of Paradise:[/i] If you want to play in the New World
[i]Wealth of Nations:[/i] Core mechanics for trade
[i]Res Publica:[/i] Core mechanics for republics and mana
[i]Art of War:[/i] Core mechanics for diplomacy like vassals (+ religion wars and Napoleonic wars)
[i]El Dorado:[/i] Better Conquest of Paradise, cool custom nation designer.
[i]Common Sense:[/i] Core mechanic for government, flavour for parliaments and some religions
[i]The Cossacks:[/i] Core mechanics for Hordes and cool features
[i]Mare Nostrum:[/i] Extra cool features, should be in base game
[i]Rights of Man:[/i] Lots of quality of life improvements
[i]Mandate of Heaven:[/i] Flavour for Eastern Asia (China, Japan) Quality of life + Cool extra's like Historical Ages
[i]Cradle of Civilization:[/i] Flavour for Middle East + Core mechanics that should be in base game
[i]Dharma:[/i] Flavour for India + Core mechanics that should be in base game (trade company, government reforms)
[i]Emperor:[/i] Flavour for Europe + extra's for late game
[i]Leviathan:[/i] Flavour for South-Eastern Asia and Oceania + Monuments (I bought this game only for the monuments)
[i]Third Rome:[/i] Flavour for Eastern Europe and mostly Russia
[i]Rule Britannia:[/i] Flavour for the English isles + core mechanics for the navy, innovation and Industrial Revolution
[i]Golden Century:[/i] Flavour for Iberian Peninsula and Northwest Africa + more naval stuff
[i]Origins:[/i] Flavour for Africa
[i]Lions of the North:[/i] Flavour for Northern Europe (New style of DLC with way a different approach to 'flavour')

[i]DLC controversy[/i]
Eu4 is monetized with DLC's. But a quick glance on the summary I gave shows the general disgust. Flavour for certain regions is nice, but a single or a couple of core mechanics are put behind a paywall. Sometimes you even need an older DLC to experience a newer DLC. Lions of the North adds more monuments. But you need Leviathan to unlock the monuments mechanic!
[i]Leviathan debacle[/i]
In 2020 1.30 Emperor was released. It was a buggy mess but the devs fixed it within a month. A year later 1.31 Leviathan released. This DLC and update broke the game and netted the worst reviewed DLC of all time on Steam. Lots of players quit or refused to play 1.31. I myself stayed on 1.30 untill 2022. After that a new team took over Eu4. They released 1.32 Origins. Which is a good flavour DLC without significant paywall mechanics. There was a very good free update 1.33 that made the AI actually competent and late 2022 they released the well received 1.34 Lions of the North, again without big core mechanics behind paywalls. Hopefully the trend continues. Eu4 is in a healthy position and can still offer a lot of fun. But there is a lot of potential in the form of mods. The Fantasy Total Conversion Mod: Anbennar might even be considered its own title as it's a complete different experience.


[i]TL;DR[/i]
[b]Style:[/b] Map painter, has cool models and flavour. Bit outdated compared to newer games, but is not a hinder to gameplay. 
[b]Gametime:[/b] Infinite (especially with mods, try Anbennar!)
[b]Difficulty:[/b] Easy to pick up, difficult to grasp
[b]Learning curve:[/b] Under 1000 hours is beginner level. After 2000 hours you can still learn a lot
[b]Multiplayer/Singleplayer:[/b] Both are fun but completely different games. Singleplayer is a great experience. Multiplayer should be played with friends, or look for a community organised game. Multiplayer can be very glitchy with more players.
[b]Price:[/b] ONLY buy on sale.
[b]Rating:[/b] 9/10
[b]Rating/DLC-policy[/b]: 5/10: too many small core mechanics are locked behind paywalls that should only be about flavour.",1673355252,1673994643,True,47,0,0.83098447322845459,1,True,False,False

Speaking of which, also unlike HOI4, the non-major countries have their own skills, like Venice has a powerful navy, the knights templar have professional soldiers, and even the natives can drive proud empires from their lands.

I see red and black, my blood flows Albanian
I live here more with tradition and Bajrak
by canon and by law, by tribe and by blood

and where the gun is fired when a boy is born in the inn
and where the table is laid, the pot starts to heat up
where the weakest point in morals is the sister
Red and black i dress eagle on my chest
It's good to be an ALBANIAN
Keep my head up high for that flag i die
Im proud to be an ALBANIAN
alive alive alive red and black blood flows through my veins alive
and in every living cell a bird with two prides
the place of our blessings, you can find them here
let's not talk about vices, even the stone is valid here
the old stone mountains full of barot
fields watered with tears up to the coast
with nobles and tribes with lutes and cifteli
with a great holy Albanian name

I breathe red and black, I believe red and black
I live where kanga is given as a dedication
as in the battlefield as a birth and burial
where the eagle sits and digs its nails into the ground
where the word has weight that cannot be measured by ok (measurement unit)
where the hand lines tell the same story
where the wrinkles on the forehead speak of trouble
I speak red and black, I hit red and black
I hear red and black, I mark red and black
a burning love for this tribe and this lighthouse

There can be more than 68 icons on the screen at the same time and the font used is quite hard to read. You can increase the font size in the game menu, but then it becomes blurry. Environment and units graphics aren't too good either. Regarding gameplay, most of the time you'll be looking at the map, reading text, clicking buttons and waiting; there's few interaction with other characters. Finally, there're a lot of DLC packs, but they're incredibly expensive (they cost 400 eur making a single payment or 60 eur per year paying a subscription fee; considering the basic game already costs 40 eur). If a new game is released I will pay close attention to it, because the general idea is quite good (manage production, trade, diplomacy and war with limited violence representation); but I can't recommend it in its actual state.

Sometimes the AI will completely ignore your forts, armies supposedly aren't able to move through areas with a fort and while this holds true for you, sometimes the AI will just completely ignore it and do whatever they want.
There's no way to tell your armies where to retreat to, so sometimes after losing a fight they'll just move over a single province and get completely annihilated, instead of moving past your own fort right next to it and giving you a chance to reinforce.

A $330 game including every major expansion and immersion pack when bought full price. Yet more if you want fun skins or extra music. A game sold so piecemeal they offer a $5 subscription just to lease the DLCs. It's a very niche sort of strategy game with lots of math and relatively simple visuals. There's a high barrier to entry and you'll easily spend 100 hours just figuring out foundational concepts. I think you'll either become addicted or simply not see the appeal, no middle ground. Just look at the amount of sickos in the reviews who have over 1000 hours in this game. I became one of them. You could be next.

[b] What else is this game? [/b]
A fun and intricate strategy game with so many layers and choices to make, rich in history and dripping with charm. A modding community which have personally easily added 300 hours to this game alone with the interesting and inventive creations on the workshop. Consistent updates that make the game better on a regular basis. Paradox is strange, but it does seem like they listen and acknowledge mistakes (Leviathan release, Emperor release, old estates). Multiplayer is alive and well, and lobbies exist for casuals and veterans alike. DLC policy also only applies to the host so only one person needs to experience financial ruin. Or, save the $5 you'd spend on a DLC subscription every month and you'll have everything major in 5.5 years. Diverse systems and unique viability of all playstyles mean you can play one country five ways and it feels different each time. Great for achievement hunting or alt history RP.

I would say I have a love-hate relationship with this game right here. I love it because it is one of the best strategy games out there (with a mix of politics and military). I hate it because of other reasons + how addicting it is.

Good sides:

Love the soundtrack, beautiful and I can hear it in my head. In terms of difficulty, I might say it is not complex yet challenging (for me). I am actually not that big of a fan of challenging games because I find solving problems a nuisance and my inner soul would kill me for solving problems outside of reality than IN reality. The modding community is impeccable and in my time around the community I've met and seen some very talented souls, the game is very moddable and some mods do spice things up.

Bad side is, it can run pretty bad when it reaches near the end game, and as for me, an Extended Timeline Player, It gets buggy and laggy if you play for long periods of time, i.e 500-1000 years. The DLCs are way too expensive and it just kills me that I have to pay upwards of hundreds of dollars just to get the full experience. I resorted to paying for the subscription anyway but I still think it is too expensive for a beginner and it's almost like you're collecting DLCs rather than getting them to enhance your experience.

All in all, I recommend this game for anyone that loves politics and strategy. Pay for the subscription and get the full experience and download mods for the best experience. 8/10 for me.",1671176511,1671176511,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

EUIV differs from other Paradox titles like HOI or Victoria in that it doesn't focus the experience to war or economy, but rather provides you with a host of simpler but still in-depth mechanics that touch most aspects of ""nation-building"".  It's the gamiest of the Paradox titles, and the emergent storytelling isn't of the level of CK, HOI, Victoria, but the gameplay itself - balancing war, economy, unrest, diplomacy - is snappy, satisfying, and paced very well.  If you know what you're doing, it's hard to ever find yourself in a CK2 style ""Well I own all of Iberia, guess I just need to chill and rule at speed 5 for 20 years"" situation - There is always more dirt to acquire, more small countries to absorb peacefully, more crises to avert.  It holds my attention through the full campaign in a way no other Grand Strategy game does.

The UI is pretty outdated, and in order to play the game the way it was meant to be played you'll probably have to watch some youtube. Or a lot of youtube.  If you are willing to put the time in to learn, this game will give back many many hours of super engaging nation building.",1670627020,1670627020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I get they wanted to give a use to the stuff from the CK series' monuments for mega campaigns, but they just feel like a waste and are better as a modifier, personally. Otherwise, the combat system is mostly fair, even if RNG can screw you hard. We all have experienced rolling a 0 several times in a row when we should have the stats to win.

I think cavalry could use a soft rework to improve their use, as currently they're awful in combat. They should be great as an early game shock unit that is expensive but is worth the cost. As it stands right now, only hordes (And some non-horde states) benefit from cavalry in any functioning capacity. Naval combat is definitely better than what it was when the game first came out, and the fort system is a significant improvement on EUIII's system.",1391488557,1670609164,True,0,0,0,2,True,False,False

There is only one complaint I wish to file. That is concerning the prices of certain 'Download-Able Contents'. I dare say they border on disgrace.

People who don't like Grand Strategy as a genre tell me they dislike micromanagement. If that describes you, I wouldn't recommend this game for you. Those looking to try one for the firs time, I think it's accessible and tutorial resources are online. My advice to navigating to learning all the mechanics quickly is to just play your first few games through even if you lose. Going down in flames instructs well in this regard. 

Many updates to the tools at the disposal of all countries are spread out amongst several DLC expansion. Typically they are bundled with immersion packs for a geographic region. Missions trees, historically accurate skins for the region being emphasised, regional idea groups, religious mechanics, trade mechanics to name some of the paired features you can expect. The ability to ""build tall"" mechanics were added in Leviathan but were bundled with immersion packs for a particular geographic region/s A. If you want to build tall in geographic region/s B, C and D, you would need to buy the other DLC that has the culturally relevant immersion packs. 

This isn't to say you aren't getting a fair deal on the DLC, the expansions deliver on the features they look to introduce and the cultural immersion packs are focused on a thematically appropriate region. I would say many expansions are not cheap but the value an individual places on the features and cosmetics is their judgement to make. This is what you can expect for the microtransaction system of this game generally but you could easily get hundreds of hours out of the base game which in my opinion is a lot of fun. 

Combat is prevalent but not a spectacle for those who enjoy some more fleshed out combat visuals. The depth of this game is in the logistics of managing your state and not the complexity of it's war system. It would be more accurate to say that all the elements of supporting an army are what is emphasised. The military take over of your neighbour was assured by your superior command of trade, politics, economics, industry, religion etc.

Ottoman had 17 million km2 in 1595 (Murad III) (Ottoman had borneu and Morroco and their vassals as protector) and 1683 Protector of Poland-Lit. Ottoman conqured all arabia in 1572 (middle of Arabia too). Ottoman almost always had a few soldiers against to EU crusaders and union and wining the battle on the lands and on the sea. it means Jannisaries was the strongest army in the world! Holy Roman Emperor accepted as King of everywhere even not known lands. And Sultan Suleiman the Magnicefent won the battle of Wien then deal with them as The emperor was equal with Grand vezir not the Sultan (Padişah) until Zigatvar. Ottoman ruled the lands with justice and tolarance until 19.centruy. it was powerful even power on Spain (Hasburg ) and Asia, Africa etc. When you see 19 - 20.century maps on Africa and world , EU had eveyhere. Even Sahara Desert was blue , green and red! France, italy and england. Why don't you show real Ottoman map? Ottoman had Sahara and under it . Nijer, Borneo and Morroco's vassals :)

Edit: Why did you limmited my account? Isn't  it ""freedom of speech""? If I said change of play to live  it was a suggestion on paradox forum Here;

It's totally wrong! Ottoman Empire was the best one for centuries! The closest one was spain/holy roman emperor(even he was accepted as unknown Emperor too) but, he was not equal to the Padişah and his rank was very lower around 100 years after battle of Vien I. With tec and develotment were very higher than them. Europa was waiting to be taken in their mind too until late of 16th century. Our ship cannon and normal cannon's ranges were very better than them and we were easily wining huge crowded crusader armies in the land and in the sea with a fewer soldiers. Jannisarries, Spahis, Akıncis, Great Bombard(Şahi Topu) etc. Suleiman the Magnicifent resqued French King Fransuva from Spain by only a letter. A threat. Holy Roman Emperor didn't come to war 2 times against the Padişah. And the Padişah said"" We are not here to fight pesants"" than returned. very High  tolarence of Religion and Culture and very best Empire for centuries! Please, fix it! Even we won wars in 1776 when we were alone and Russia and Holy Roman Emperor were allied. We never touched even Satanists (Yezids) if they are not revolting. Please, fix it and make it real historical. We had Khalifet, there were a lot of money coming when needed and a lot of soldiers coming. We had University for ruler families like Endonesia etc. Even Karnem Borneo joined Khalifet in late of 16th century.  We reached more than 24 million km2  (sametime 17 million km2) inculuding Sahara, All Arabia, all black sea, Part of India and helping Aceh Sultanet etc. We were the best empire for centuries not spain or france....",1507103945,1669989543,True,1,1,0.515928566455841064,0,True,False,False

Then why the negative review?

Because behind this heavenly game lies the devil: Paradox Games. They used to be  a small studio which made games for its own little fanbase. Today, they have a rather anti-consumer DLC policy. They have released unnecessary amounts of unnecessary DLCs, mostly for EU4. Mare Nostrum, Common Sense and the Cossacks are just a few of them. What is worse is that fundamental game mechanics are sold with these shallow DLCs. For example, if you don't own the Common Sense DLC, you cannot improve your provinces; thus the base tax, manpower and the amount of buildings you can build in a province stays the same for the entire 400 years you play in the game.

Like I said at the start, this game is incredible, but understand that it is a significant investment with all the DLCs. If you plan on playing it for a couple of months, you should consider the DLC subscription thingie they released.",1497300153,1669554859,False,10,0,0.555422484874725342,0,True,False,False

I also learn a lot. Every time a history-inspired event pops up, I go to Wikipedia. Every campaign, I learn some history I never would have known.

While rework of Iberia, Italy, France and so on managed, better or worse, to hold itself together, taking a look at Greece and rest of Balkans is suicide for your eyes. Seriously, you either have to go along starting borders or take half of region to make it look half-decent. To have a decent look, you take whole of it. Lusatia is another example, whichever province from a total of three you won't take, it would stick out like a sore thumb. Also, they reworked Stolp and it's still a goddamn triangle, but this time Poland's border with it is so broken, that even rustling emperor's ego with taking it just for sake of satisfying look on map won't save you from the beauty of Kolberg and this abomination that happens to emerge in place of Neumark. Now Poland by no means other than pushing germans to the other side of the Oder can have a border with them that doesn't compete with geometry of Habsburgs' chins.

If you get through the threshhold of the first 50-100 hours, which most need to grasp the game mechanics sufficiently, you will discover a game which keeps on giving. Even after 2000 hours, I have not tried every play style or region. The mission trees and events add so much flavor and guidance to each playthrough and I have not even begun to talk about mods or multiplayer. It is just a masterpiece of grand strategy. The only downside is the DLC-policy which becomes quite expensive, but there are guides to which are more important than others. I would not recommend the game without any DLC. Art of War or Common Sense deliver crucial game mechanics. Everyone who enjoys history, strategy or map painters will love this game.",1669292423,1669292423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many would complain about the DLC policy Paradox has, but it isn't that bad, every year or half a year they release a $20-$40 DLC which is cheaper than some AAA games, for 100+ hours worth of content and addition to the already infinite hours you can have on the game. I am willing to fork out that X amount to simply enjoy a game at my own pace knowing I am supporting a company who creates games to my flavour. I do think EU4 needs a sequel due to it being outdated but the DLC policy keeping it fresh will keep the community around till it drops. 10/10 would recommend to any history nerd.--",1624722303,1669284760,True,5,0,0.576515913009643555,0,True,False,False
