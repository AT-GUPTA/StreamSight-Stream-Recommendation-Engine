Now my problem with the game is this, and i want to give people a disclaimer here: if you play it casually and don't really care much about ranks and stuff, you will have fun. To a point that is.

Started playing this 2 days ago. Reached rank 8 with my modified starter deck. I made a decent mid range german deck with what i found and what i was given by the game + some crafting.

I reached a point where i fight only super duper decks, filled with elite cards (it's the equivalent of legendaries from hs) that you can have only one copy in your deck, and special cards, the ones you can have 2. And the rest full with decent limited and/or standard cards, ones you can have 3 and respectively 4 in your deck. There are decent limited and standard cards for any type of deck in any nation.

The problem is, i reached a level i cannot compete and i feel i can't do shit. Will change this review when devs limit the amount of ELITE and SPECIAL cards you can fit in your deck. 

Why negative review you ask? well, i'm competitive, and i like to be on an even footing with people. And as it stands, the gap will keep increasing to the point people will have 40/40 elite cards into their decks.  A new player will catch up in 2 years or so. Will be forever behind until they have reached the 40/40 elite cards cap. :))

You guys (devs) should put a limit on these cards, like Gwent guys did. Worked pretty good in that one, wouldn't be a problem in this either.

      Anyone that gets aroused from hearing a stuka or seeing a jap battleship smoking will find the beautifully crafted ""aged"" cards, that draw directly from wartime propoganda posters, gratifying.
      The card collecting is ethically transparent and yes, you will spend money, but if you can afford 40 bucks for pizza you can buy more cards or you're really only complaining but not a fan of the war of the ""greatest generation"" or you're in the wrong game genre section.
      The best part of this game is the fact that there are random occurrences upon certain card triggers! This means there will never be a ""magic the gathering god deck type thing happening"". Napoleon said he would always choose the luckiest general if given a choice between attributes. Eisenhower said it is a bad plan that cannot be altered.
