Resident evil 3, unlike the remakes of 1,2 and 4, which were direct remakes, is actually more of a reimagining, of resident evil 3 nemesis. It removes many areas of the game like the whole park and clock tower sections, and the gas station segment, but does add bits like the subway and new areas like a toy store. Jill no longer explores the RPD but instead Carlos does. The story has basically been ""arranged"". Think of it like a retelling or what if. I don't hate the game, because this version of Jill is pretty cool, and I like the city and the gameplay, and liked the story, but hated how they removed so much. Over 50% of resident evil 3 nemesis was removed in this remake. It's insane. Get it on sale.",1709054345,1709054345,True,1,0,0.509345769882202148,0,True,False,False

PROS: The city section was really fun and had a lot of good scares, I love how unpredictable Nemesis is compared to Mr. X in RE2. See he was something, but Nemesis here nearly made me shit my pants a couple times. / All of the written notes and documents were really interesting. I took lots of lore notes while playing this! / Didn't struggle to clear every room. / Carlos is incredible. / Had SO many ""EW wtf is that"" moments, more than most Resident Evil games for me. / Pissed me off many times. Gotta give em credit for that.
CONS: The zombies get unfathomably annoying on normal mode. / Nemesis being incredibly random is definitely frustrating for no-death runs. / The last Nemesis boss fight was incredibly anticlimactic and easy compared to the other two. / Putting me back in the RPD did not feel great. / The ONLY things I will compare to the original are the Hunter Gammas.

It really feels like there's little room for choice during gameplay. On repeat playthroughs, this linearity becomes very apparent, with many sequence feeling like a repetitive cycle of holding the W key, skipping cutscenes, and repeating this process.

The dodge mechanic feels underwhelming and almost useless outside of perfect dodges. It's often tough to time dodges for certain attacks, leading to unnecessary frustration and damage. Additionally, QTEs triggered when grabbed by zombies feel pointless, as you still take damage regardless of success, a clear step down from RE2's defensive items.

The treatment of Nemesis is disappointing. Compared to the presence of Mr. X in Resident Evil 2 Remake, Nemesis feels lackluster and scripted. The chase sequences, intended to instill fear and tension, fall flat as Nemesis's movements are hard to predict and lack the eerie audio cues that made Mr. X encounters so memorable. Instead of feeling like a relentless pursuer, Nemesis often comes across as a teleporting enemy that tentacle whips you.",1708777606,1708777714,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review:
If you've ever wanted to know what it's like to simultaneously sprint through a city overrun by zombies while also trying not to spill your coffee, Resident Evil 3 Remake has got you covered. Capcom's latest undead adventure is like a rollercoaster ride through Raccoon City, where the only thing scarier than the monsters lurking around every corner is the realization that you forgot to stock up on ammo.

Let's start with the protagonist, Jill Valentine. She's like the MacGyver of survival horror, turning every found item into a makeshift weapon with the finesse of a seasoned ninja. Seriously, forget about stocking up on rocket launchers – all you need is a trusty knife and a can-do attitude to take down those brain-hungry baddies.

And speaking of baddies, Nemesis deserves a special shoutout. This guy is like the Terminator on steroids, relentlessly pursuing you with all the determination of someone who just really wants a hug... or to rip your face off. Either way, it's hard not to admire his dedication to the art of zombie hunting.

But let's not forget about the real star of the show: Raccoon City itself. From the eerily quiet streets to the dimly lit alleyways, every corner of this urban nightmare is dripping with atmosphere. It's like a postcard from hell – if hell had a serious rat problem and a penchant for jump scares.

Of course, no Resident Evil game would be complete without its fair share of puzzles, and RE3 Remake doesn't disappoint. Whether you're deciphering cryptic codes or hunting down elusive keys, there's always something to keep your brain scratching while your trigger finger gets a workout.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a pulse-pounding thrill ride from start to finish. With its heart-stopping action, spine-tingling scares, and enough zombie guts to fill a swimming pool, it's a must-play for any survival horror fan. Just don't forget to pack your nerves of steel – you're gonna need 'em.

This is a good game; fun & exciting... but it is not a resident evil 3 remake at all. The locations contain elements which are nods to locations in RE3, but the layout of everything is different, the story is different, the characters act and have different roles. These changes might help the game be less cheesy than the original and it might even create a better story for the game but still, it is so different than the original RE3 that I can't help but see it as a different game with characters of the same name.

100% different, not a good remake, too short for $60.
I can't recommend it but because I don't want this type of ""remake"" to start trending, i'm giving it a thumbs down.",1586033360,1708154249,False,1,0,0.527777791023254395,0,True,False,False

[h1]Français :[/h1]
Heureusement que je n'ai pas payé pour avoir le jeu, j'ai beau m'être éclatée dessus, je le trouve quand même extrêmement court pour son prix... Je précise aussi que je n'ai jamais joué à l'original, donc je ne pourrais pas faire de comparatif avec en terme de gameplay.

[h3]Points positifs :[/h3]
- Comme pour les remakes de Resident Evil 2 et Resident Evil 4, les graphismes sont magnifiques, même en qualité lowest.
- Le jeu est bien optimisé, c'est même probablement le mieux optimisé de tous les remakes jusqu'à présent.
- On peut jouer à la manette, mais ceux qui utilisent une manette de PS4 devront passer par le gestionnaire de contrôleur Steam, étant donné que le jeu ne détecte que les manettes de Xbox. C'est un problème qui était déjà présent dans Resident Evil 2 et je sais pas pourquoi ça n'a toujours pas été patché.
- J'aime beaucoup les design des personnages, mais je trouve que Carlos est quand-même... très différent de son modèle original.
- Les esquives de Jill et les patates de forain de Carlos sont des mécaniques plutôt bien pensées. Elles sont difficiles à caler au début, mais ça devient amusant une fois qu'on a trouvé le bon timing.
- Le jeu est très (trop) généreux en terme de munitions, à tel point que je me suis rapidement retrouvée à saturer tellement j'en avais dans mon inventaire.
- Le doublage français est plutôt réussi.

[h3]Points négatifs :[/h3]
- La durée de vie est médiocre. J'ai pu terminer le jeu en à peine 7h alors que je me suis pourtant forcer à ne pas trop courir pour éviter d'être trop déçue. Et j'ai quand-même été déçue.
- Le jeu n'offre pas la possibilité de changer la bande sonore. Ce n'est pas quelque chose qui me dérange puisque l'audio du remake me convient, mais ça peut déplaire aux grands nostalgiques.
- Certaines animations sont inexistantes. Par exemple, Jill n'a pas d'animation pour allumer sa lampe de poche, ni pour utiliser les ascenseurs en end-game. Ça reste un point négatif mineur étant donné que ça n'a pas d'impact sur le gameplay, mais ça montre bien que le développement a été rushé à certains moments.
- Le boss de fin est assez décevant. Je vais éviter de spoiler mais c'est littéralement le plus simple du jeu alors que les trois premiers étaient assez chauds à faire.
- Un autre problème qui était déjà présent dans Resident Evil 2, c'est que les armes ne servent pas souvent à grand chose. Le fusil d'assaut est moins puissant qu'un pistolet, le lance-grenades / lance-mines est franchement anecdotique et le magnum ne s'obtient que 30 minutes avant la fin du jeu, donc on n'a même pas le temps d'en profiter et il est complètement inutile face au boss de fin.
- Le couteau n'a plus du tout de durabilité. Certains trouveront que ça fait un truc en moins à gérer par rapport à Resident Evil 2, mais je trouve que ça rend le jeu un peu plus ennuyeux étant donné qu'on peut juste foutre les zombies à terre et les achever au couteau.
- Comme pour Resident Evil 2, le système de sauvegardes automatiques est moins utile que les sauvegardes manuelles.
- Un jeu Resident Evil sans puzzle, c'est un crime.

J'ai vu beaucoup de gens se plaindre que le jeu n'était rien d'autre qu'un jeu d'action, mais je ne trouve pas que ça soit vraiment le cas. Après avoir éclaté la cervelle de tous les zombies, on peut se balader et explorer librement, exactement comme dans Resident Evil 2. Au final, les deux jeux ne sont pas non plus si différents que ça, même si ça se ressent que Capcom a voulu varier un peu le gameplay en offrant des mouvements spécifiques à chaque personnage (esquives / coups de poing) là où Leon n'en avait pas. Ce qui est dommage, c'est que ce genre de jeu a tendance à rapidement se transformer en jeu d'action sans laisser réellement de place à l'horreur et c'est quelque chose que je reproche aussi bien à ce jeu là qu'à Resident Evil 2 et Resident Evil 4. Enfin, ça reste un bon jeu et, même si je ne saurais pas dire ce qu'il vaut par rapport à l'original, je peux quand même affirmer qu'il est trop court pour son prix et je conseille d'attendre une période de promotion pour l'acheter.

[h1]English:[/h1]
Good thing I didn't pay to get the game, although I had a blast with it, I still find it extremely short for its price... I should also point out that I never played the original , so I can't make a comparison with it in terms of gameplay.

[h3]Positive points:[/h3]
- Just like with the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 4, the graphics are magnificent, even at lowest quality.
- The game is well optimized, it's probably the best optimized of all the remakes so far.
- You can play with a controller, but those using a PS4 controller will have to go through the Steam controller manager, since the game only detects Xbox controllers. This is a problem that was already present in Resident Evil 2 and I don't know why it hasn't been patched yet.
- I really like the character designs, but I think that Carlos is... a bit too different from his original model.
- Jill's dodges and Carlos's sucker punches are rather well thought out mechanics. They are difficult to time at first, but it becomes fun once you get the timing right.
- The game is very (too) generous with how much ammunition it gives you, so much so that I quickly found myself saturating with the ones I had in my inventory.

[h3]Negative points:[/h3]
- The game's lifespan is very short. I was able to complete the game in barely 7 hours even though I forced myself to not run too much to avoid being disappointed. And I was still disappointed.
- The game does not offer the possibility to change the audio. It's not something that bothers me since the audio of the remake suits me, but it may displease the most nostalgic fans.
- Some animations are non-existent. For example, Jill does not have an animation to turn on her flashlight, nor to use the elevators in the end-game. This remains a minor negative point given that it has no impact on the gameplay, but it shows that development was rushed at certain times.
- The end boss is quite disappointing. I'm not going to spoil it too much, but it's literally the easiest in the game while the first three were quite difficult to do.
- Another problem that was already present in Resident Evil 2 is that weapons are often not useful. The assault rifle is less powerful than a pistol, the grenade launcher/mine launcher is kinda anecdotal and the magnum is only obtained 30 minutes before the end of the game, so you don't even have time to have fun with it and it is completely useless against the end boss.
- The knife no longer has any durability. Some will think that it's one less thing to manage compared to Resident Evil 2, but I personally believe that it makes the game a little more boring since you can just knock the zombies to the ground and finish them off with the knife.
- As with Resident Evil 2, the automatic save system is less useful than manual saves.
- A Resident Evil game without any puzzle is a crime.

I've seen a lot of people complaining that the game is nothing more than an action game, but I think it's not really the case. After blowing out the brains of all the zombies, you can wander around and explore freely, exactly like in Resident Evil 2. Actually, both games are not that different either, even if it feels like Capcom wanted to vary the gameplay a little by offering specific movements to each character (dodges/punches) since Leon did not have any. What's a shame is that this type of game has a tendency to quickly turn into an action game without really leaving any room for horror and that's something I noticed for every Resident Evil remake so far. In the end, it remains a good game and, even if I cannot say what it is worth compared to the original, I can still confirm that it is too short for its price and I advise waiting for a promo to buy it.",1708044581,1708044581,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,True,False

Plus Points:
1. There are many new locations outside the RPD building in Uptown and Downtown that can be explored. The city feels vast and realistic, with the addition of shops like donut shops and drugstore that were not present in the PSX version.
2. The action and duels with Nemesis are plentiful and more challenging.
3. The antagonist character, Nicholai Ginovaef, is highlighted more in this remake, and the storyline is clearer compared to the PSX version.

Minus:
1. Many main story settings from the PSX version are eliminated in the Remake. Even if they are included, they are passed by quickly. For example, in the PSX version, there are stories in the Clock Tower and Raccoon City Park.
The sequence in PSX is : Uptown - RPD - Downtown - Clock Tower - Raccoon City Park - Hospital - Lab. 
But in the remake, it is : Uptown - RPD - Downtown - Hospital - Lab. 
The stories in the Clock Tower and Raccoon City Park are skipped and lost. The player only briefly passes in front of the Clock Tower and immediately fights Nemesis there without even entering Clock Tower at all. And there is no Racoon City Park at all like in PSX version.
2. The Live Selection feature (when encountering Nemesis and being able to choose the storyline path) is removed in this version. This feature was what made RE3 on PSX exciting, as the choices made determined different storylines.
3. Many exciting and difficult puzzles (such as the Base Vaccine puzzle in the PSX version's laboratory) are removed. The puzzles in the remake are not as challenging as in the PSX version.
4. Because Racoon City Park is not exist in this remake version, so you can't meet and fight with monster Grave Digger.

Firstly, the boss fights, worst part of this game by far, not enjoyable in the slightest and the Camera decides it wants to be an inch from your head rendering your sight useless, so you will likely be hit by any further attacks until this fixes itself. The Dodging, which is a welcome edition from the 2nd, is- iffy. It does work and it's nice, but it takes a bit of skill, and for something that seems quite vital (especially in the later boss fights) it's not always easy to time that, coming from someone who's completed all the SoulsBorne(Ring) games.

But aside from this, great characters as usual, voice actors are phenomenal and aside from the issues that I stated, great game. I finished it in just over 4 hours, felt a lot longer, in a good way and it seems they've accomplished that well with these games, not very lengthy playthroughs, but there's ALOT of content packed into those few hours and I love that.

...
In all seriousness, this game is the low point of Modern/Reboot RE games. Doesn't even remotely hold a candle to the original game. I could go on for paragraphs about why, but c'mon- You know why. And if you don't someone will inevitably tell you when you try to talk about this game. And you should listen to them, because they're right. 

This game is pretty fun, but there is almost nothing about it that resembles the original other than most of the cast, the monsters, and loosely the plot and locations. It's also absurdly short, linear in the bad way (complete with unskippable ""walking"" sections, playable cutscenes, essentially) and has absolutely no extra modes, not even the Mercenaries mode which the original game introduced to the series. A massive shame since RE3 Mercs is unlike every iteration after it, and I'm sure I'm not the only person who was sorta hoping to see if they would do a modern iteration of it. Also, the classic costumes (1999 costumes) are not unlockables the way they are in RE2R, they cost $2.99. My autistic ass bought em, but I certainly don't feel good about it. The game was notoriously rushed, like that shouldn't even be debatable anymore. It came out barely a year after RE2R, and consists of 80% assets recycled from that game. It's also like 3 hours long. So sadly, this is about as close to a cash grab as the series has come since it's renaissance with RE7. When people criticize this game, they do so because they wanted, and deserved, better. Capcom is capable of better, the 2 RE games released following this one are proof of that.

This is the perfect example of why Steam needs more than ""recommend"" and ""don't recommend"" as review types. This is a solid ""Decent game if you can get it on a massive sale."" The gameplay is a step down from RE2R in a lot of ways, but it's closer to action horror akin to RE4 than the original was anyway, albeit clunkier and sloppier than RE4 or it's remake. But regardless, if you snag this for like 10 bucks? Not a bad deal, it's a decent romp if you just wanna dodge and shoot, just try to ignore the story, and the dialogue, and basically everything that's happening, if you even remotely liked the plot and tone of the original game.",1707544519,1707544519,False,13,1,0.556758463382720947,0,True,False,False

the only bug i see in this game is far away enemies (zombies in particular) look like they are at a low frame rate.

one of my main concerns before playing this was nemesis was going to be around far too much, he isn't. part of me wants him to be around just a little but more than he is though. he doesn't chase you through areas back and fourth as much as he did in the original.

this remake is very much like resident evil 2 remake but more action packed.

all the monsters i remember from the original re3 and more in addition to those are present.

some of the areas from the original are cut from this, like the graveyard, the clock tower. you do see the clock tower but do not go in there at all. this isn't game breaking though. there are also new areas, and old areas are bigger with more to them, like the hospital, the police station, the sewers, the labs, etc etc

I know this game has been very controversial due to the remake being worse than the original game and how lazily done it is. However, I don't think it's right to call it bad. Sure, there were a lot of missed opportunities and disappointments. But you can't deny that it also had so much improvement. The graphics and music were just what I expected from a Capcom game, it was thrilling and just makes you feel like you are actually in that apocalypse. The story was quite well written. The map was well designed, especially the downtown and shops. The characters are definitely something that made the game more appealing. I mean, just look at Carlos.

Now onto the things that really disappoint me: Nemesis. I have played the RE2 remake just before this and I was absolutely terrified of Mr X. The way you heard his footsteps all over the map and didn't know where he was until he suddenly found you was terrifying. According to the lore, him and Nemesis are both tyrants and Nemesis is one of the strongest tyrians ever created. This character was supposed to be a creepy stalker that didn't leave you alone through out the game. However, he was so bad that even the zombies were scarier. The first and second encounter we had was pretty good, especially the way he can enter one of the safe rooms was so unexpected and scared me to death. But the other encounters were so bad. In his first and second boss fight, he just ran around like a monkey and you can to wait until he stopped so you can shoot him and get him down. Hell, Carlos was even there to tell you which barrel he was standing behind so you can aim there. And his last boss fight was even worse. That was a huge monstrous creator but he fainted like a pillow princess just by getting shot in those orange pops. In conclusion, Nemesis was such a joke.

Onto the second thing I really didn't like about the game is how easy it is. RE series is known for its survival horror and how you're supposed to survive with such low resource. As an example, RE2 Leon was a rookie cop who had his first day at his job. He had low resourse and wasn't that good at defending himself. Jill and Carlos however, they are completely over the top agents and you barely needed any resource. You could just press space and dodge attacks. The resource was also given a lot and they were so easy to find. It felt like a combat game than a horror game.

And the last thing I didn't like about the game was its play time. I play games very slowly and my first playthrough took around 6 hours. I really wish it was longer.

To sum it up, this game has its ups and downs but I still recommend playing it. I bought it when it had a discount and I think it's worth its price. Good work, Capcom.",1707237304,1707237304,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I may be 23 but I honestly don't think I've ever been disappointed by a game before until now.

Disappointment is the key word here and my disappointment is palpable...
RE3 was prime for a remake. Unfortunately, now that we have one it feels like we are going to have to wait for a remake of the remake which will either take 15/20 years or never happen.
Maybe it was rushed so they could get to doing RERE4, maybe it was because it was (or also was) outsourced but it's baffling to see RE3, a game that out of the original PS1 games had the most replay value or content have so little to do or see. Who cares if it cut something from the OG when it's also clearly cut most of it's own work too.
The nicest thing I can say about RERE3 is out of the box it perfectly supports 21:9.
That's it.
Turning a classic into mediocrity is impressive. My first run through was 2 hours and while I wasn't quite quick enough and it's too late for me to refund it it's not too late for me to tell you to skip this game for now. If not for trying to smell the roses and a stupid snafu where I missed a gray door on my map in the boring hospital my play time would be even shorter. 
They focused all their resources and energy on seemingly every single thing they shouldn't have and I am extremely confident that I am not exaggerating about that one bit. This wasn't a problem in the remake of RE2 which was done by a different team even though both were developed around the same time together. How can something developed for 3 years be this short,rushed and unfinished? More has been cut than added and in both regards not for the better and it's not as if what is now gone was replaced with something else. The good parts are short and the bad parts are long. The original RE3 had maybe one sewer the entire game but in RERE3 anytime you would have been entering an interesting place instead you'll find yourself entering a sewer which seems like a move done to stitch together the remaining non sewer locations. The filler is so hard to stomach, at a certain point there is filler for the filler once you've long passed the good stuff.

If the game was really and I mean really good in this instance or kept what was good in RE3 or good in RERE2 I wouldn't mind the length but this just isn't the case. It is absurdly short and I mean shorter than Jill's skorts (not a skirt) which for now you can only get if you pre ordered it. Game shouldn't even cost 35 dollars and I paid 60 but having played it I don't know if I would have parted with 20. If this was a DLC for RERE2 it still wouldn't work as RE3 as they've completely missed the appeal of Nemesis and even then RERE3 deserves/deserved better than this. So linear, so little content, so little tension, so little survival, so little horror, so little variety, so little unscripted Nemesis and so little care, effort or ambition. The original which I played WAY after it's prime was while old and coming close to being dared was still fun to play (my dis taste for tank controls aside) and apparently it was basically made in a single year. Other than the graphics (which have issues like zombies exploding to save performance or animating at a lower framerate) this is a remake that feels like a downgrade in almost every way. To reiterate, this is a remake that feels like it would need a remake. Something could and maybe should be done to improve the game and I just can't imagine Capcom is happy or satisfied with how it is in it's current state and I don't know how much they could afford to add or fix or if they would even be willing or bother to do so it's kind of hopeless.

The ending is also awful but I gotta wrap this up as my review threatens to be longer than the game. In conclusion it would be worth a play when the price is right to minimize discontent but you'd still risk being disappointed if you've played other games and besides being a bad remake it's quite meh. I desperately tried to squeeze my moneys worth out of it by at least getting all the achievements like I did for RERE2 but it took far less time and it really is short and not terribly replayable.
Oh and REsistance is so forgettable they had to make an announcement to remind people it was out and included:

As a fan of the original and the RE series, I eagerly dove into this reimagining by Capcom, and while it delivers on many fronts, a few aspects left me with mixed feelings. PLEASE BRING RE1 and RE CV REMAKE. I WANT TO BE PART OF RE FRANCHISE.

Pros:

Stunning Visuals and Atmosphere: The RE Engine once again shines, delivering a visually impressive rendition of Raccoon City. The environments are detailed, and the ominous atmosphere is palpable, enhancing the survival horror experience.

Intense Action and Nemesis: The relentless pursuit by Nemesis adds a level of tension that keeps you on your toes. The encounters with this bioengineered monstrosity are thrilling and nerve-wracking, contributing to the overall sense of urgency. Little to Dodge is smart move.

Streamlined Controls and Gameplay: The modernized controls and gameplay mechanics make the experience accessible to both veterans and newcomers. The responsive controls add to the fluidity of combat and exploration.

Engaging Set Pieces: The set pieces and scripted events are well-executed, adding cinematic flair to the game. Moments like the escape from the city are adrenaline-pumping and showcase the game's action-oriented focus.

Cons:

Shorter Campaign: The main campaign feels noticeably shorter compared to other entries in the series. While the intense pacing contributes to the urgency, it may leave some players wanting a more extended experience. But I like it tho. expensive but shorter isnt good. Added DLC would be smart move.

Limited Exploration: The game's focus on action sometimes limits exploration. Certain areas feel more confined, and the sense of openness found in the original RE3 is somewhat diminished.

Conclusion:

""Resident Evil 3"" is a visually striking and action-packed remake that successfully captures the essence of the original. While the shorter campaign and limited exploration may disappoint some fans, the intense encounters with Nemesis and the overall modernization of the classic make it a worthwhile experience.",1707043120,1707043120,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 3 is a survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is a remake of the 1999 game Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Players control former elite agent Jill Valentine and mercenary Carlos Oliveira as they attempt to find a vaccine and escape from a city during a viral outbreak. The game is played from a third-person perspective and requires the player to solve multiple puzzles and defeat monsters while being pursued by a creature called Nemesis.

        [td]💾Graphics[/td]
        [td]From the sequel of Resident Evil 2, the graphics have taken some improvements on this front. The image is overall sharper and crisp, but the UI is similar which to me is a plus. The facial animations are incredible and look realistic. The enemy design is haunting and looks so amazing, especially Nemesis.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎮Gameplay[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 3 is similar to its predecessor. With survival horror elements you must conserve ammo and make every shot count. You have different enemies to deal with, and they can be a true challenge for you. You will find fewer puzzles in this game, and they are extremely easy which some may not like (Myself included). This game is more action paced as well so the horror and tension feels less in my opinion. The Boss fights are extremely challenging though which I was not a big fan of. You will have to test your skills with ammo conservation since Nemesis absolutely tanks your hits, which in my opinion should have been balanced better. [/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]📜Story[/td]
        [td]Resident Evil 3 Remake’s story is one that is short lived in my opinion. Now I really did enjoy the story segment in this game. It’s action packed, the acting is incredible, and the characters felt really believable in this game. The story felt really linear compared to the other Resident Evil games. It’s really hard to explain how, I guess I'll just send you a list of things they changed or removed that were in the original.
[code][list]
[*]The entire clocktower and Raccoon City Park (including the Grave Digger mini Boss) area are missing. Dead Factory was replaced by the NEST 2 (Which looked pretty boring)
[*]The City itself is only half as big as before, alternative routes and small locations like the Press Building, Gas Station, Umbrella store etc. included.
[*]No randomized enemy and item locations.
[*]No live choices, which further changed the current playthrough in small ways.
[*]Much less encounters with Nemesis, which is also far less durable this time around. One grenade and he is down!
[*]No Brain Sucker, Crows, Giant Spiders and the small Grave Digger babies.
[/list][/code]
Yeah, that's a problem for me. I get that it’s a “remake” and they won’t add everything from the original, but pricing this game at $40 is just wrong in my opinion. I feel like this game was released way too quick. If they spent an extra year on this game, it could have been an incredible sequel to RE2, but it’s not. The story was great, but the game is just way too short and the replayability is small for me.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🕛Playtime[/td]
        [td]This game felt shorter than Resident Evil 2. My first playthrough was on Hardcore difficulty and it only took me like 4 hours to beat the game. You do have unlockables in this game (and plenty of them) so that can add good replayability. Sadly you don’t have any extra game modes or a randomizer mode to keep you interested for long.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🎧Sound[/td]
        [td]The sound design is haunting and incredible. You can hear gunshots in the distance and crisis in Raccoon City. It’s honestly really immersive and so well done. The zombies are still super terrifying and the music is really nice.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❗Bugs❗[/td]
        [td]If you look closely, zombies in the distance skip and the animations are stuttery for them, but it’s smooth when they are close. It is distracting I will say. Besides that, there are no bad, or game breaking bugs.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔅Performance[/td]
        [td]The performance is top tier for me. I have no issues on Ultra settings and it runs so smoothly. Pretty simple here, no problems for me and you should have great performance if you have similar specs (which will be in the bottom of the review).[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]✔️Pro’s[/td]
        [td][list]
[*]Haunting atomsphere
[*]Game is perfectly optimized
[*]Environments are beautiful (and scary)
[*]Nemesis is intimidating and well designed
[*]Many ingame unlockables and challenges
[*]Story was okay, but way too on rails in some sections
[/list]
[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]❌Con’s[/td]
        [td][list]
[*]Not many enemy types
[*]Little to no puzzles
[*]A ton of content stripped out from the Original
[*]Extremely linear even for a Resident Evil game
[*]Boss fights are extremely tough (way too spongy)
[*]Way too short of an experience and expensive (wait for sale)
[/list]
[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🏆Rating[/td]
        [td]5/10
I would wait for a 50% sale. This game does not feel like it’s worth its full price. Be patient and get the sale, you will thank me later.[/td]
    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td]🔗Conclusion[/td]
        [td]I wanted to like this game. I enjoyed the story, but I just felt like the developers rushed this game into oblivion. You are missing so much content from the original it’s ridiculous. The story and voice acting is great, but the enemy variety is so weak compared to the original and feels so linear. This was a real disappointment to me and just hope they learn from this game and take their time on the next remake.[/td]

But as someone who came to this game thirty minutes after beating the Resident Evil 2 main stories, I wont lie, I feel really disappointed with what this game is offering. This game tries to add some quality of life improvements over RE2, but in turn, the mechanics in question feel unnecessary, finicky, or just choppy.
     This game doesn't have much else to offer other than its main story line, which isn't a bad thing per se but i as the player could definitely feel that i felt bored of the game play loop quickly. The most satisfying part of the whole game is how the lore and the story of the previous game tie up really nicely, which is rewarding if you're playing through these games sequentially.
     Out of the action, survival, and horror genres that this game tries to balance, I definitely felt it being much more on the action side than the survival, and the horror still remains a staple of this game as much as the last game. The story was servicing, but nothing too special. The characters feel mostly flat with very little to some character development.
     Even with my criticisms, I would definitely recommend this game if you have played the previous game and you want to see the threads of the last game and where they lead to in this game. As a standalone game, Its a lot of fun on its own, But i don't feel satisfied finishing it, and its better to think of it as a package with the story of RE2, rather than its own standalone title.",1706609386,1706609386,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Oyuna bir kere girdikten sonra birdaha çıkmak istemiyor insan ve bu tür oyunlara bayılıyorum. Oyun size ağır gerilimli ve korkutucu sahnelerden sonra öyle huzurlu ve rahatlatıcı görsel, ışıklandırma ve müzikler veriyorki insanın bir daha güvenli alandan çıkası gelmiyor ama aynı zamanda bir sonraki sahneden neler olacağını çok merak ediyorsunuz. Bu hissiyat size oyunun ne kadar kaliteli olduğunu anlatıyor zaten. Karakterlerden bahsedecek olursak, oyunun ikinci dakikasından sonra Jill Valentine ye aşık oldum bu yüzden zombilerden falan hasar yememek için ekstra bir gayret gösterdim. Jill Valentine sahnelerinde bence bulmaca kısımları kolaydı fakat Nemesis ile olan kapışmalar inanılmaz adrenalin veriyordu ve aşırı heyecanlıydı. Bazı sahneleri tekrar tekrar denemek zorunda kaldım ama her farklı tercihim bile farklı bir eğlenceye kapı açıyordu. Carlos sahnelerinde gerilim son seviyelere kadar tırmanıyor zaten. Bulmaca kısımları Jill e kıyasla daha zorlayıcı ve oynanış açısından psikolojik olarak size daha da bir güven veriyor. o inanılmaz kurtarma görevindeki zombilerle çatışma sahnesi size korku, gerilim, heyecan, stress aynı zamanda merak, keyif, açıkgözlülük ve cesurluk duygularını yaşatıyor ve o kadar eğleniyorsunuz ki iki karakter arasında hangisinin sahneleri daha eğlenceli diye karar veremiyorsunuz. Oyunu bitirme süresi hikaye oyunlarına göre normal bir seviyede fakat keşke çok daha uzun olsaydı. Oyunun sonlarına yaklaştığımı farkedince bir süre sonra keşke oyun hiç bitmese diyordum kendime ve nihayetinde oyun bittiğinde bana anlık bir şok hissi verdi, kendimi bir süreliğine boşlukta hissettim ve cidden ne efsane oyundu ama dedim. Oyunda emeği geçen herkese teşekkürler. Gerçekten çok kaliteli oyun yapmışlar. Başta da söylediğim gibi Resident Evil 3 her zaman favorim olacak ve Resident Evil evreninde favori karakterim kesinlikle Jill Valentine!!!

A lot of reviews I see are critizing it for leaving a lot out; and rightfully so. But it's also more than that. Games in the past have cut content but still shaped up to be an admirable and worthwhile game.

Sadly, this is not one of them.

I played this directly after RE2R and knew it would be different, since technology changes. The graphics are nice. The guns feel sturdy. Progression is a bit shallow. My issues lie mainly with the story rather than the length or content of the game itself.

Instead of improving upon what they've already built with RE2R, Capcom just sort of made this a filler. 

As for the story, it feels very similar to the recent Call of Duty campaigns, where it's linear and predictable and quick. The story beats don't flow and it feels as if there are little to no stakes. I've played the RE1R after playing this and it's like they're two differnt characters. Yes, you can blame the tramua she endured and how it changed her, but it's just not written well. It feels so...empty. The story, too. Carlos was interesting; probably the best written in this game. It's just sad to see a good story be strung out for what seems to be filler.

The RE4R was fantastic. It's just so disappointing to see potential ruined. This very much plays and feels like a DLC; I'm almost certain Ada's DLC in the RE4R was either longer or more enjoyable.

Also DRM. Another gross tactic used by industries to excuse bad corporate decisions. 

The game is fun and enjoyable enough. It's a good mindnumbing campaign because once you know what to do it's like riding a bike. But don't go into it thinking it'll expand the characters or story. I feel like if I didn't play this game, I wouldn't notice  it's absence from the franchise. (If that makes sense.)",1706417121,1706417121,False,2,0,0.518459081649780273,0,True,False,False

About replayability. I feel I want to play again couple time Resident Evil 2. But this game part #3 I just want delete and not launch anymore.

RE2 Remake,  mantuvo la esencia de su originalidad a pesar de todos sus cambios , pero RE3 remake no fue así , esto se debió a que omitieron escenarios y momentos  claves visto en su entrega original ,  pero lo que más duele es que Nemesis en este juego no genera el terror ni la angustia que generaba originalmente, hasta el diseño causa más miedo en su version original , ósea hasta   Tyrant Mr. X visto en RE2 R , causa mucho más terror que Nemesis!!!!, los de capcom apostaron más por el espectáculo , por la  imponencia  de Nemesis,  que por el terror que este causaba originalmente, eso a los mas fans de la saga no les  gusto , las trasformaciones de Nemesis tampoco gustaron   , que no haya mas de un final , tampoco gusto , esto ocasiono que no fuera un buen remake de Re, pero eso no quiere decir que no sea un buen juego , por si es un muy buen juego, los gráficos, el diseño de personajes y acción vista en este juego es simplemente genial y por ello lo recomiendo.
En conclusión si eres fans de la saga, te va decepcionar pero no te va impedir disfrutar del juego,  y si no lo eres vas a gozar muchos. 8 /10 , recomendado.

They add intrusive MALWARE to your titles, drop support randomly with games, post games that barely work, take down titles and never fix them, and worst of all...accuse the modding community of being thieves. F this company. There are hundreds of thousands of games out there...you won't be missing out if you die not playing this one again.

This game is very short and very fun. I've been playing through the entire series recently and was expecting mixed feelings based on what others have said. What a mistake. This game is awesome. Instead of doing a normal review, I'm going to list some common complaints and blast them

1. Its too short. 

True. This game received the least amount of love among the original sequels. But guess what? We knew this since the 90s. Is this an excuse? No. Should you have known what you're getting? Yes. The game now goes on sale for less than $10. Its totally worth the 8 hours you'll get out of it. If you paid $40 or more when the game released and you're salty about it, you openly ignored well known knowledge that has been available for decades. Your fault you didn't wait for a sale. You're a typical gamer that doesn't vote with his wallet but opens it up immediately whenever you see a loot box, overpriced costume or other gimmick that separates you from common sense and you're a curse on this industry.

2. Dodge. So many complaining about how difficult it is to dodge Nemesis. Its not. And there is an easy mode that practically holds your hand through the entire experience. Safe rooms are everywhere. Its not that hard.

3. Backtracking. Yes, there is a lot of it in this game but it remains interesting and the environments are awesome. For an example of lame backtracking: See Resident Evil 0. This game is far from annoying in this category.

4. Its not RE2. 
  
No crap. Resident Evil 2 and 4 are legendary. This game isn't them but its a hell of a ride on a budget.

5. Blah blah...something something multiplayer. Yeah, we know...Capcom releases multiplayer gimmicks and abandons them. List this under common knowledge and don't expect anything of substance from them in the future.

Overall the game gets a solid 8 out of 10 from me. Be smart tho...don't buy from A HOLE companies.",1680511031,1706158119,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Well anyway if you want to get into this game I say you should play RE2 remake first and if you can buy it in a bundle when its on sale ( Comes with RE2 and RE3 remake) 

To understand the beginning segment with Jill you may want to play RE1 remake if your interested or you can watch a story recap video if it somewhere 

The combat in this game is fun, the music is aight, the story is alright as well. But it's pretty short, you also can't loop back to past area's like you could in the previous 2 games

EDIT

Resident Evil 3 Remake, unfortunately, falls short of expectations and fails to recapture the magic of the original. From lackluster gameplay to a disappointing narrative, this remake misses the mark on several fronts.

Gameplay mechanics in Resident Evil 3 Remake also leave a lot to be desired. The once tense and atmospheric experience of navigating Raccoon City is replaced with a more streamlined and less challenging approach. The game's pacing feels off, with encounters with Nemesis lacking the intensity and fear factor that made the original Resident Evil 3 a classic.

the inclusion of Resident Evil Resistance, a 1 vs 4 online multiplayer game, seems more like an attempt to compensate for the shortcomings of the main game rather than a well-thought-out addition. Honestly they should have just remade RE outbreak. ..

resident evil 3 remake is a lackluster attempt to recreate the magic of the original game. From a forgettable storyline to subpar gameplay mechanics, it fails to deliver the gripping horror experience that fans were anticipating.

Warning: Capcom is adding unfamiliar DRM to their back catalogue of games. This corp has repeatedly shown their stance towards mods in their games as well and seem to be taking action. I would caution you against purchasing any capcom product that contains this DRM as it’s unfamiliar, and untrustworthy. For now, if you really want this game, or any capcom game, I would stress that you watch and observe to see what happens in the near-ish future. 

Please note that there is a lot of misinfo circulating about with regards to this situation. Please do your due diligence and research everything and even fact check myself before making a final judgement. I am doing the best I can to sift through the false info and properly inform myself and will update this review accordingly.

DRM is not always a bad thing, if used correctly, it protects initial sales. Then good publishers will remove it later on allowing for better experiences. I am upset when DRM harms performance, which it often does (like Jedi Survivor). I find that inexcusable, poor performance that screws over the paying customer should always be frowned upon. Recently, denuvo was removed from RE8, which is good. But, when it was first added the game suffered many problems which modders had to remedy until its removal. Enigma seems to be capcom’s replacement for denuvo.

Earlier this month, RE Rev was updated and performance was harmed. Shortly after, capcom reversed the update. This is concerning because REV was released almost 11 years ago and the game’s already been cracked (both the pc and 3ds version), as with most older games. This update to add DRM to an old game is incredibly fishy, especially with how it came with no announcement from the publishers themselves. Almost as if somebody was trying to hide it.
Denuvo a very good DRM, since there’s few who know how to crack it, even then it’s tough. Denuvo itself costs ~$5,000 per month for the license, ~$60,000 a year. A game’s sales can’t keep up with the fee forever, and the DRM has to be removed/replaced to salvage income. 

Enigma is $59,920 cheaper. It costs about $400 for initial purchase, and $80 annually for upkeep. Enigma was checked with a virus scanner, and got 34 positive flags, ~%50 of what Virus Total checks for. Scanners can have false positives. The REV .exe will show 1 positive flag (at least for me). This one is easily written off as a false positive. Generally low single digits are fine. When you are getting into double digits, there’s problem. The dev for Enigma has been purported to have a fake address in the US, and the domain name’s been alleged to be bought through a Moscow front (fact check me). This DRM is incredibly sneaky, and according to others, is capable of quietly worming its way through your PC. These factors, even if partially false, are concerning, keep this away from your pc.

On October 25 of 2023, there was a capcom R&D presentation.
“RE:2023 Anti-cheat and Anti-Piracy Measures in PC Games Recommendations for In-House Production”
14:00 – 16:00 ish. The pres states that all mods, unless officially supported, are no different than cheating. Yes, with regards to DRM, all foreign code is considered tampering. But, they go further, and say that mods tarnish the product’s (and corp’s) image as they may be mistaken for legitimate parts of said product. Earlier last July, a tournament competitor in a SF6 match forgot to disable his Chun-Li n*de mod. This is likely what capcom is referencing. But, they’ve taken things further.

Capcom is no newb to “nuking” youtube creators’ channels. They’ve removed content and channels for discussing info that the corp themselves leaked. Capcom has taken action against MH creators, most notably speedrunners. This was because their videos featured mods, some as harmless as to simply aid with running or slightly modify the experience (skins/costumes/fov). Capcom has tried to take down modders’ work as well. Yes, these modders were making n*de mods, but never the less they came after a modder, who’s to stop them from taking things further and coming for everyone else?

Considering the corp’s past and recent actions and statements, it’s safe to say that they are/will be coming after modders. People like to add that Enigma was added to RE5 last year and that no one has had any problems. Even so, ghost updates are sketchy, since there’s no point in copy protecting a long-cracked game. For now, I advise customers to watch, listen, and wait to see what the corp does. We can choose to make it apparent to them that mods are an inevitable factor of PC gaming. I know where my stance is, if I can’t make Nemesis into Shrek, then I’ll happily take my money elsewhere.

Thank you if you read this far, I’d be happy if you had any info (legit that is) or comments you’d like to share.

Warning: Pseudo-rant ahead
I have one more speculation (not an allegation or accusation, simply a theory coming straight outa my rear end). I think that modders are beginning to pose a business threat to companies like capcom. 

This corp is known to have a lot of stinker dlcs.
Example:
REV has dlc, 2 fun characters, and 4 more that suck. There’s 2 shoddy weapon reskins and 2 parts packs that boost damage. All of these things are already in the purchased game. This leads to my theory, capcom is scared of modders. We can simply repaint the base G18 and make it look like jessica’s, and have a better gun too. The same goes for parker’s gun dlc. Whip out CE and give yourself the gun parts. For one customer, the corp has lost out of possibly $4. Apply that to a large portion of the consumer base, even more money lost out.

Another, Street Fighter 6. Its dlc has one year character pass costs $30. You get 4 characters..and character colors. Not outfits, colors; and in game currency…which you can earn for free. The same goes for the $50 ultimate dlc, it just adds 2 backgrounds (stages) and some costume colors with a little extra in game currency. You can get so much more for this amount, just look at the steam reviews.

We also see modders making far better outfits for free. The recent Yor update was bad too, just a worthless reskin. So, modders will fix it and make it look better. Both of these scenarios DO harm the their image, it just shows that some dudes in blender can do so much better than a multi-billion dollar corp. 

Their claims about “public order”, I believe, are total bs. I believe this corp recognizes that it churns out dumpster fire (ignoring the rare cases like Separate Ways, which is only $10) and are too afraid to admit that they want money. At least EA is obvious abt it.

The same goes for so many other capcom dlcs.

I love these games, I am a big fan of RE, DD, MH and more. Yes, your writers often suck, but I still love the stories in these games. I love to play them, I have so many happy memories of these wonderful little gems from my childhood. I WANT to support the talented, skillful, and passionate people behind these pieces of digital-art. No not the suits, I mean the programmers, artists, musicians, voice actors, mocap dudes, sound guys etc. But, unfortunately, these people work for a corp who is rapidly growing greedier, and at a scary pace. Soon, they’ll be just another EA, a money vacuum that cares about microtransactions more than making a great experience that keeps people comin back to that game and for more in the future.

Whoever is currently in charge (in my opinion) is out of touch with what customers actually want and will support. I have blacklisted this corp from my steam page, and it will be sometime, if ever, I consider purchasing their products ever again given their recent statements, actions, practices, and routine behavior.

""Oh, no, Ada isn't wearing clothes!
""Devs, why did you put this in the game?""

Devs:
""Uh, it's not us, Twit-sama!""
""Yeah, it's modders, Twit-sama!""

Twit:
""Ban all mods!""

Don't buy anymore games from Capcom until they revoke this abysmal decision. Mods help to extend the life of a game and can keep it popular for decades. Just ask Bethesda why the TES or Fallout series has been so popular for so long.",1705445224,1705445224,False,5,0,0.51181107759475708,0,True,False,False

Mods nunca atrapalharam em nada (nenhum jogo), pelo contrario, eles sempre ajudaram os jogos a nunca serem esquecidos, por exemplo, Skyrim ta ai para mostrar; outro bom exemplo, olha o que CD Projekt RED faz com seus jogos (a comunidade de Moders de Cyberpunk 2077 e The Witcher 3 é incrivel).

That she's not exactly housewife of the year ceases to matter just as her suite is vandalized by a strange monster with supernatural powers. As if it wasn't enough that the zombie apocalypse is currently raging outside the windows.

The story of Resident Evil 3 takes place even before the escape of Leon and Claire, later concurrently with it. Jill, a former soldier and member of the elite unit S.T.A.R.S., has her hands full in a matter of moments, collecting survivors and putting them on the subway out of the city.
Everything gets complicated when he meets the strike force of the evil corporation Umbrella, which is responsible for releasing the T-Virus.
The original RE3 was no screenwriting gold, but Capcom tries here to reflect the changes in social discourse, a little unfortunately. So Jill is no longer mowing down zombies in a miniskirt and strapless top: her 2020 version bears a striking resemblance to another rejuvenated hero of our time, Lara Croft. And actually also by behavior.

Policewoman Jill Valentine is a regular on the charts of iconic gaming heroes, and for over 20 years she's been determined to show everyone that she's not in the senior category.

It is a ""prequel"" to Resident Evil 2 so realistically you play this one first before RE2. The game is great from start to finish but... it is WAY to short and WAY to expensive for its own good. Please, PLEASE do not get me wrong, RE3 is amazing itself with its graphics, gunplay, the new RE engine and modding but that's all that is really good about it. I may have an ""unpopular opinion"" with what I am about to say but it is my opinion. Below I will state WHY I sadly cannot recommend this game.

[h1][b] Why I cannot recommend RE3/Cons [/b][/h1] 
⚫Lets get this started, shall we. First of all, I have NEVER played RE3 in my life. So, I was going in blind. I decided that I would play the game on Hardcore first. The game was WAY to easy on hardcore. I mean... I got a B rank but I completed the game in under 3 hours. So what I am saying is, the game is WAY to short. £32.99 for 3 hours of my time (its actually 2h 40m ish).
https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/2047503411645156010/E2C5F77213CF08CE2C8F8C19F703E933BA74A8C4/?imw=5000&imh=5000&ima=fit&impolicy=Letterbox&imcolor=%23000000&letterbox=false
⚫Hardcore felt like Standard difficulty. The game was a bore fest with the ""Zombies"". The only thing that EVER came close to killing me on Hardcore was myself with my grenades.
⚫I have seen a few reviews stating that the game offers no replay ability... I can see somewhat what they mean. So, If it took me 3 hours for one run, B rank. Another run for S rank will be faster as I have done the game (Infinite ammo guns unlocked now) then 1 more run on Inferno difficulty and thats the game 100% more or less. So I reckon It would take me.... 8 hours to 100% this game and that is multiple runs.

EDIT: As of 14/01/24 I decided to play the game on inferno mode to earn my last 5 achievements. I was expecting this to take me forever and offer a REAL challenge... it only took me 1 hour 48 minutes and 12 seconds to do the game with an S rank. 6 hours of playtime. I am absolutely appalled. 

[h1][b] Pros [/b][/h1] 
⚫Its running on the new RE engine so if you have seen RE2, RE7, RE Village then you know what your in for.
⚫Graphics are stunning yet again. What do we expect? Its the new RE engine.
⚫The mods for the game can go out of their way and give you a good laugh or in general make the game much better.

[h1][b] My Verdict [/b][/h1] 
As a new player to RE 3 I feel cheated out of my money. I paid £49.99 for less than 3 hours of gameplay and for that I sadly cannot recommend RE 3. I wish I could leave a NEUTRAL review for this game as I loved it but its WAY to expensive for what you get.

The PC community is very angry and has noticed the implementation of your product. It is being mentioned in a ton of negative steam reviews.

You should be aware that there is likely a huge negative PR storm coming your way and possibly offer Capcom advice on how to implement your product properly as you've angered a lot of people.

What is our guilt you think?

The start of the game has you take it slow, it builds tension with what is to come and then Nemesis busts into Jill's flat and you brace yourself for a fun game.
But what you get is linear chase after linear chase until you get outside and then the game sums up the entire 1 hour of the original classic RE3 in about 5 minutes.

You get to the train and then you are allowed to explore the city and you think ok rocky start but hey its ok I can't wait to explore the city.
Nope what you get it to O shapes connected by a line and that is about the map variety of this game when it is forcing you into Nemesis action runs sections or forced boss fights.
While Jill was exploring the dying city, the police station and a clock tower in RE3 classic. In this game you explore a small section of the city, a sewer, another sewer and another small section of the city while being chased again by the Nemesis who I must point out only shows up in this pre-scripted sections.

Nemesis is not even scary, he is more annoying than anything since if you don't perfect dodge (Basically bullet time) he will hit you and stun lock you to almost death which is not fun or scary its just stupid. He also does not have his grab insta-kill move anymore he just punches you or whip grabs your before awkwardly standing over you doing nothing which is sad since he used to actually pick you up and try and go for an insta-kill.
The game is also badly downgraded for RE2 Remake in that they removed so much of the gibbing, gore and dismemberment which in my honest opinion was done because they packaged their horrible multiplayer game.

Hey Capcom if you want to make an actually fun multiplayer game that to this day people actually play then remake RE: Outbreak.
Finally the game has problems in menu navigation on PC in that you cannot use your mouse to make selection and have to use the space bar. This confirms that console was the main focus and PC was an afterthought.
If you like linear action games maybe give this a game a go but if you wanted survival horror and Resident Evil then look elsewhere.

With 23 hours invested in this survival horror masterpiece, I can confidently say that Resident Evil 3 offers an adrenaline-pumping journey filled with intense action, clever puzzles, and a compelling storyline.

The gameplay mechanics shine, with tight controls and responsive movements that enhance the overall immersive experience. As Jill, I found the ability to dodge incoming attacks at close range to be a game-changer, adding a layer of strategy to the combat. The inclusion of Carlos Oliveira as a playable character in certain sections brought diversity to the gameplay, keeping the overall experience dynamic and engaging.

The visuals are stunning, showcasing the capabilities of the RE Engine. Raccoon City is brought to life with meticulous detail, and the character models, especially that of Nemesis, are both terrifying and impressive. The atmospheric sound design contributes significantly to the game's suspense, making every step through the desolate streets and eerie environments a nerve-wracking experience.

The primary antagonist, Nemesis, is a formidable foe that evolves throughout the game, creating a sense of constant dread and tension. The encounters with Nemesis are adrenaline-fueled, requiring quick thinking and precise shooting to survive. The variety of weapons, including customizable firearms and combat knives, adds depth to the combat system, making each encounter a strategic challenge.

The inclusion of additional difficulty modes and an item shop upon completion provides excellent replay value. Unlocking new weapons and items through completing challenges adds an extra layer of satisfaction to the overall gaming experience. The decision to tie the narratives of Resident Evil 2 and 3 more closely together enhances the sense of continuity within the Resident Evil universe.

While some locations from the original game were omitted, the rearranged storytelling and expanded dialogue contribute to a more cohesive narrative. The removal of multiple endings in favor of a focused story streamlines the experience, ensuring a more consistent and impactful narrative.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 is a stellar remake that successfully captures the essence of the original while delivering a fresh and thrilling experience for both long-time fans and newcomers to the series. With its intense action, atmospheric setting, and well-executed gameplay mechanics, Resident Evil 3 is a must-play for survival horror enthusiasts.

Passable, but clearly a rushed DLC for REmake 2 with a full $60 price tag. This game is not trying to bring the original back to life. It's trying to be Resident Evil 6 Part 2. Content is cut, not improved. The extra modes from REmake 2 are not here, and you don't get to spend time exploring the city with Nemesis lurking around every corner like in the original. You get ONE area of the game where he stalks you, and then he's just a big morphing monster creature for the rest of the game, chasing you down linear set pieces. Kinda like Simmons from Resi 6. This game is truly a let down. It needs FREE content updates to make purchasing this $60 DLC worth it.

All that said normally I would give this remake a 8/10 but ONLY buy it at 75% sale cause this ""remake""
cut out extreme amounts of content compared to the Original 1999 version including mercenaries mode.
But remake has a hacked filled dead on arrival MP mode noone plays noone asked for......(seperate install no need to install)....


As a remake this game is 1/10 cause its more like lets rush it out for the shareholder meeting after RE2R success cuting out almost everything made OG unique.

Eg.Live selection which changed paths you take,including multi endings,Nemesis who chased you almost all the game but could be killed for loot including new weapons.
Multiple game locations,enemies were cut out.
Stuff like Clock tower was iconic in OG in remake it is a glofiried scripted boss fight background lasting 2-3 mins.


""Thankfully"" Remake removed all that and you have a 4-6 hour game........
Almost fully linear,Nemesis barely chases you and is mostly a glorified boss fight you meet serveral times.

..But don't buy this full price like I did [It's atrocious that this game is still listed full price when none of it's post-game content is supported by Capcom anymore]

Wait for a sale.

This game can be completed in two hours (there's an achievement for it) and it doesn't have any multiple endings like in the original. This is basically a watered down version of the original game with none of the extra post-game content to keep it alive [WHERE IS MERCENARIES?!!!!! Thank god for RE4 remake] (for comparison I have almost double the hours in RE1R and RE2R).

(Side note: RE: Resistance SUCKS, there's not even an actual store page listing on steam unless you actually own RE 3R cause Capcom knew it was gonna flop, as of May 21, 2021, the reviews for it are MOSTLY NEGATIVE for it's lack of dedicated servers and cheat prevention.) 

There are some good things about this game, you get updated visuals and the game runs amazing on the REengine  (RE7's engine) and you can play Carlos Oliveira's side of the story and experience the horror of big nose nemesis chasing your butt around. There are multiple difficulties to play on where some [Inferno] changes the enemy and item placement but unless you're a hardcore RE fan or you're a masochist for pain you'll only play through the game once for the story.

I can say that as a fan of RE, I love and support the games but when I went back to original RE3, the amount of content stripped out from this version compared to the original just doesn't justify the full price buy of this game especially when RE4 remake is out. This game suffers from the same issues of RE2 Remake but has even LESS post-game content than it's predecessor.

[h3] But this game has a good engine behind the game, the graphics are good, this game is very well optimized to run on PC and has a large set of options to configure in the options menu if you want so. The music, terror and sound effects are good, not awesome.

But like I said in the beginning, this game feels that have been rushed in their development. Feels small. For example, we have and achievement that you need to complete this game in under 2 hours and in my opinion is not too hard to achieve that for what I experience in my first playthrough. This game had everything to be a masterpiece like RE 3 was in the past, but the story isn't there, the choices isn't there. It's missing the core ingredients of the franchise.

There are three main differences Between this and RE2R

1. Minimal back tracking. There's only one area you'll back track to and its very small
2. Minimal Puzzles in that area you back track in the puzzles are more basic than RE2
3. The Tyrant is the whole game focus. Take Mister X and the Tyrant and running from and defeating them is the whole game aka Nemesis.

They reused so many assets from RE2 you could just call this RE2: Nemesis instead of RE3 but this was also true of the original RE3

Melee is pointless more so then RE2 like not once in the whole first run did i use melee except when i wanted to see how the Hot Dogger works but instead of melee when your in melee range enemies just in cinematic grab you so melee is impossible unless your knee capping.

The best parts of this game are the boss encounters, the throwbacks to RE2,  Jill's fluid movement and the dodge button.

unfortunately unlike RE2 the replay value in RE3 is very low. There is no Alt story as it is built into the main campaign and the lack of DLC missions like RE2's 4th survivor means after you beat the game you can go for the sub 2 hour achievement and that's about it for replay value.

The only reason RE3R feels significantly shorter than RE2R is because RE2R has more puzzles and allows you to back track when in reality RE2R can be finished in at least 2H30M and RE3R can be finished in 1H40M

Overall This is just the second half of RE2 with some new locations

Got high expectation for Village.

Overall i would recommend to play all resident evil games not only because they are interesting enough, but from psychological side - all of them has something different and it helps to understand yourself what your body prefer in games and same about your friends.

For example - Resident evil 3 may be not the best for many players, but for me and my wife personally it was more immersive and more intense because of Nemesis with than Resident evil 2 , but we like it too. Another reason is changing areas, which means we don't need to walk in the same building for 10hours.

That's where this game rightfully deserves a ""Mixed"" rating if it were possible so while I will ultimately recommend it, I think how you rate it should be through those lens.

Compared to the other remakes, this game is absolutely atrocious. It cuts a large amount of content and expects you to just forgive and it disrupts the pace of the story as well. It fumbles its depiction of Nemesis which really sucks when the previous game had the terrifying Mr. X. It recycles a decent handful of assets from RE2R and while on it's own seems fine, it's much more obvious when you've played the other game. Gunplay and Physics are incredibly downgraded compared to the previous title, dismemberment being removed entirely and all zombies having no collision and a fixed death animation. The story length is even outdone by the recently released RE4R Separate Ways DLC. There's zero replayability unlike the other remakes which had separate game modes and reasons to replay the story, RE3R possessing nothing of that sort. Why RE3R got shafted in it's overall development will forever remain a mystery to me.

Now as a standalone title, RE3R is a very serviceable title. For starters, the game looks REALLY good, there's absolutely no debate about that. The combat is okay, in relation to my earlier statement, it's not quite the same level of greatness of the other two but it's okay enough to have fun with. The dodge mechanic may suck compared to Leon's parry of RE4 but I mean I guess it's there if you want it. Overall, this whole game operates more like a DLC for the 2nd Remake and if you take that into consideration, you'll enjoy this very short experience. 

Just mind this, buy this on a VERY deep sale. I paid about $9 for it in the most recent Winter Sale and that's about the most fitting price for this game as a package.",1704323584,1704323584,True,1,0,0.513513505458831787,0,True,False,False

There's only one campaign this time, but after you beat the game you unlock special features that allow you to buy exclusive weapons and other such toys to make the game spicy again. I didn't really play with any of those things since it's still playing the same map over again at the end of the day, but i'm sure others will appreciate the option.

I have a few nitpicks with some of the enemy designs having instant kill moves in confined spaces / spaces with multiple enemies, as the resulting deaths felt cheap rather than fair and my mistake, but it only happens in about three areas so it's not super prevalent or anything. 

Another slight issue is that perfect dodges / perfect punches weren't referenced anywhere where I could see them and I had to look up how they worked online rather than ingame, which is a little annoyingly obtuse for a feature that provided the dopamine peaks for my experience.

Really would've liked a Carlos mode since decking lickers out of the air was awesome and Jill's a lot more boring in comparison when you have to play as her again, but apparently RE4 remake has more of that perfect-counter goodness so i'm looking forward to that.",1704321533,1704321645,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The hospital is reduced to some action-sequence chaos. Even the best dialogue of original game is used in some nobody-cares escape scene.

Sometimes remakes don't need to be faithful to be good games. If they're too faithful, especially if the original had very dated game design, then you end up with shit like RE1R (which honestly felt more like the Twin Snakes of RE1 than a remake. It was bad.)

Simply enough, it's a remake of 3 with RE2R's engine. If you liked the UI and gameplay of RE2, then you'll enjoy RE3R just fine.

The only real complaints I have is that this game should've had the default executable be the DX11 beta and not the DX12 update. DX12 would do nothing but crash the game, especially when I tried to first start it. The main drawback is ray tracing, and it wouldn't even impact the experience to be honest. Another complaint is that one of the best lines was used way too early, and you'd know exactly which one it is if you've seen the game.

Also, Capcom said f*** it this time and decided to cut short the campaing by sharing it with both characters, which might have been the reason why people took it as a shorter game. They also packaged it with Resistance, which I still haven't played but haven't really heard many good things about it and I couldn't care less. Just give me one player content damn it!

An okay remake of the original PS1 Resident Evil 3, with similar story and gameplay, but with updated graphics. The game retains the ""arcadey"" feel of the original which is something to look forward to. However, a lot of content were removed and changed till you can barely compare to the original game. The game itself is exceptionally short and has way too many scripted events, feeling as if you're playing a visual novel game, rather than an action oriented game.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It is a remake of the classic arcade game and generally a survival horror third-person shooter game where you play as Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveira. Players must explore the environment to open doors and locks in order to proceed and/or upgrade equipment. Puzzles are required to be solved to gain access to areas and unlock equipment, since equipment and storage is scarce, players need to constantly manage their inventories.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The graphics is extremely good and light, an obvious upgrade from the original PS1 game.

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Music and audio is relatively good, especially when using THX Surround.

[h1]Controls[/h1]
Controls are realatively easy and fine tuned both for Controller and on Keyboard+Mouse

[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]
1. Animation and movement is very janky as it will make you wonder, why would any character move like that?
2. Your ""Sprinting"" feels extremely slow, more like a slow jog, killing the mood of the entire game due to no sense of urgency
3. No bugs for the game found so far

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Overall an okay game, the only reason to get this game is nostalgia, as even re-playing the game feels more of a chore as it is too short with limited rewards. Players can actually finish the game less than 2 hours which is saying something (even some Demo games are longer, that is saying something), get this game only when on sale.",1703965807,1703965807,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend this game to virtually everyone who likes Survival Horror and Action Adventures - if you don't mind the horror aspect. There are some nasty and gruesome scenes in this game. The presentation is virtually flawless. And I think that is what matters here: The developers had a clear vision of how to modernize this game that has become absolutely unplayable on modern platforms. They cut some content, and they changed the atmosphere a bit to bring RE3 in line with RE0-RE6 which you can play now in a single uninterrupted line of game experiences.
What has been lost in terms of old charm and appeal is compensated by throwing out the cheesiness and silliness of the original dialogue, cutscenes and plot elements as well. Nothing shows this better than a comparison to the remake of 'Resident Evil 4' which definitely suffers from tacked-on action-sequences (the cave-segment is the worst offender) and the pirate-themed playground areas. I wished they had just cut those segments, bringing it to the same level as the remade RE3.
'Resident Evil 3' is inferior to the remake of part 2, because that title just offers more gameplay and a unique double perspective on the plot (Leon/Claire). But in my book it is superior to the remake of part 4, because it is more cohesive, more coherent and scarier most of all. I have only one complaint: It is a little too short.

It's mechanics are mostly similar but has some improved mechanics such as a ""dodge"", which makes for more interesting enemy encounters and boss fights.

Is it as good as the second one?  No, from a story perspective it's probably a notch down (it's not bad though), but it was a lot of fun! I liked switching from protagonist to protagonist and that they both played slightly differently, and it was great that they had you on do more boss fights, holdouts, and running away sections.

Many state that the remake is not up to par with the old game , like Nemesis having far less random encounters and being more scripted , which is true. Some game locations are not included but some are expanded. Either way that does not make this game a bad remake.

Lets start with the multiple choices, there's none of it here, clocktower, that has been downgraded to a boss arena and then Nemesis. He's the worst offender of Capcom's downgrading, he was turned from a scary treat that chases you throughout the game to a arena boss. There is a small part in the beginning where he would chases you but that is short lived as he then goes back to a arena boss. Even Mr X from RE2 Remake was more of a threat than him, why couldn't they just build off him. This game is a tragedy, rather play the original on a emulator than this.

This is not by any means a terrible or a broken game. Couple of reasons why this got so much hate was because of all the cut content from the original game, the campaign here was also incredibly short in comparison to RE:2 and the multiplayer included I think as a consolation was pretty much DOA, very bare bones, abandoned and plagued with cheaters.
This absolutely sucks balls, because the gameplay here is pretty much just RE:2 all over again, which isn't a bad thing because that game played very, very well - hell, this comes with a few new mechanics, like actual dodging, with a risk-reward system for you to also time your doges perfectly which takes a little to get used to and learn the timing of. That, plus your knife becomes more of a tool here than a last resort line of defence.
There's a lot of cool weapons here, crafting and looting is pretty much all the same here, and the map is a little more spaced despite being (obviously) linear, which works great for the gameplay and the new dodging mechanic, however it doesn't have the same horror charm to it as the cramped spaces and corridors of the RPD, not a massive problem for me, but definitely a notable change.
Did I mention how fu****g short the campaign here is? I have played the previous remake a good few times for leisure and I acquired a little over 40h just replaying that game like maybe 3.5 times, with some additional ""fu****g around time"" yet here in RE:3 I played that game through I think twice, and boom - a little over 7h xD 
Again, why play this extremely inferior version of RE:2 when you can just play RE:2 instead? Probably for the same or less money too. 
The most heartbreaking thing for me was the Nemesis, which on paper sounds so much scarier and overpowered than Mr. X could ever dream to be, buuut... He only really appears in some scripted events, to otherwise just hang around the same areas. He technically has a lot of tools in his arsenal, like the tentacle which he can use to not only slow you down but also travel extremely fast himself, in addition to being able to run and use some crazy weapons like a fricking bazooka or a flamethrower, like DAMN! Except, again - the weapons are either mostly scripted events or strictly boss fights, and you can counter all of it with your new dodge ability, sounds cool AF, but it gets really easy once you learn how to use it, and suddenly the Nemesis becomes so much less intimidating than Mr. X :/

In conclusion, it's RE:2 with a few new additions, mostly unchanged core, uninteresting campaign and for the same amount of money. Don't Play Resident Evil: 3 just stick to the 2",1703600739,1703600739,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 2 and 4's remake do everything this game tried to do but better in every way, and that really just makes me sad. For example, Mr. X in 2's remake is a much better enemy as he quietly appears around the area you're in, pursuing you and usually catching you in a tight space forcing you to react. He's also usually lingering around the place where you last saw him, staying as a quiet threat the entire time. In this game, Nemesis has a big flashy cutscene or event every time he shows up, and it's usually in a wide open area- and if it isn't, you can just use the dodge mechanic to avoid a melee attack. He's hardly a threat in my opinion, and just doesn't capture the anxiety and pressure you felt with X. You can explore most areas in Resident Evil 4 remake's big, interconnected map to get some extra items, usually health or ammo- but you just don't really get that in this game, as it's sort of thrown right where you need to be going anyways, and nothing really feels connected like the other two remakes. The cutting of the exploration of the city, certain decisions, entire areas, and random encounters with Nemesis hurt the experience so much, and I wish this game was handled with more care. It's not all negative though! I do really like the new designs that the characters were given in the remake, the new enemies in this game that aren't in the previous remake were great to see (minus those bugs in that maze section, I really wanna know who needed that in the game), the combat is more dynamic over the previous remake, and Jill and Carlos play off of each other very nicely! I truly hope though that there is something going on behind the scenes for a big update to this game to fix a lot of its problems, but I'm doubtful.

Além de ser extremamente linear, e com uma história contada com a rapidez de um espirro, o único sentimento que fica após zerar é frustração. Era um remake com um potencial absurdo mas que deixou a impressão de ser uma demonstração.

Só estou deixando o like porque sou um fanboy lelé que ama o RE3 original, e o pouco que esse remake consegue fazer de bem feito, me faz ter uma faísca de felicidade.
Com certeza a Capcom errou nesse, mas se você gosta muito do clássico e quer ver cenas dele com gráficos e gameplay lindos, ou só quer um jogo divertido pra passar a tarde jogando, vai na fé, porque sem levar o antigo em consideração, RE3 acaba sendo somente um jogo de ação bonito e não memorável.",1703387223,1703387223,True,0,0,0.492125988006591797,0,True,False,False

While it's an amazing game engine, RE Engine feels a little clunky here (especially when compared to RE:4 remake). However it's got all the core gameplay mechanics that make the reboot so fun: excellent shooting, rewards for exploration, and horror.

My only real complaint was Nemesis' behavior. I understand that they wanted to make him unique instead of just another ""Mr. X"" but his mechanics felt unfair. When chasing you he can close massive distances instantly and there's almost no way to see it coming. All of the sudden he's behind you, blocking your camera and smacking the hell out of you. In true RE fashion, taking damage like this results in a stun which adds to the cumbersome feel of the game. It's not overly obstructive in the grand scheme of things, but it was needlessly stressful in a not-fun way - compared to other stalker enemies that keep pressure on you constantly but fairly.

That's still up for debate. Most of the complaints for this game were the contents which are cut from the original, I can't have a say on that as I never played the original before so this review will be solely based on my experience in on the Resident Evil 3 Remake.

Starting off, the graphic is absolutely stunning and easily able to hold in own even in today's standard. The best part is it's well optimized and throughout my entire gameplay, I did not once encountered any stutters. The RE Engine is a work of wonder for sure. Similar to it's predecessor RE2R, the gameplay is linear and overall gameplay doesn't change must from previous game with the exclusion of few new in-game weapons and mechanics remains largely the same. There's few new types of enemies for sure but the concept are roughly the same. I'm not sure if it's just me but I felt that the gameplay for RE3R is much more refine and even the combat and dodges are more fluid than the previous game. The game's action sequences and boss fights are also more engaging than previous one and Nemesis is definitely a heck lot stronger than Mr. Stalker. Everything about this game for me as a whole is really fun but the story however could've been expanded more as it felt quite short and some plot points could've been utilized better. The game focuses more on action and less on horror elements. This isn't the case for RE2R as you might get chased around by Mr. X. In this game however, if you are to get chase. Usually it'll end up with a boss fight.

Another Improvement over the initial remake is that it's soundtrack and music are much better tailor for it's environment now. I really like the safe room music and when shit hits the fan, the music changes too. This gives a much more tense feeling compare to previous game. Some other minor changes include how knife works. Now you don't need to collect them anymore as it'll be included in your inventory and won't be broken like previous game. This works well especially if you're on harder difficulty where bullets are really limited. However, the knife does deal less damage when compared to previous game. The graphics of the surrounding environment is also one of the highlights of the game. The entire hospital gameplay is really enjoyable.

Overall I definitely enjoyed this game despite it's minor flaws. However I do believe you can get this game when it's on discount because it'll be more worth that way as the gameplay hours and replayability doesn't really justify it's pricing. There's however the optional multiplayer game mode but let's be honest, ain't no way anyone is buying this game for that. I would give this game a solid [b]7.5/10[/b]. The puzzles and action element of the game is definitely the highlight and overall a good remake from Capcom.",1702887989,1702890724,True,14,0,0.674403369426727295,0,True,False,False

Dodging and sprinting removes any stress from enemy encounters; there is no horror. Ammo us abundant. Puzzles are non existent. Too many save points. The boss fights are repetitive. Some cool enemy designs but you just pepper them with bullets until they die. Also the gore and weapon sound effects are toned down massively, which is ironic since this game is more action focused.

it's way too linear compared to the RE 2 police station which connects to every other part of the map. The police station was itself a big puzzle that you solved. In this game all you get are huge empty outdoor areas with a couple of places to explore.

It's a more ""casual"" and digestible experience but offers nothing innovative or interesting while removing parts of gameplay that made RE 2 remake fun. It's essentially a Resident Evil game on rails. Kinda like an Uncharted game, heavily scripted and cinematic, while having mediocre gameplay.

[u]First off, credits where credits are due[/u]:
- The Opening Live intro cinematic is phenomenal! Seeing this while being hyped about the game really gets you in a great mood but also immediately raises the expectations you have for the game.
Meaning: Sadly you'll be kind of let down afterwards.

- The way unlockables like infinite Weapons are earned is amazingly executed and feels like the most satisfying reward system any RE has ever had. Thanks for giving me a way to get my overpowered weapons before having to speedrun the game on the hardest diffulty. Adds a lot of fun to the game overall.

- Also gotta give props to the dialogue/voice acting thoughout the game. Every Resident Evil suffers from the same cringe, dumb and ridiculous over the top self-confidence dialogue and I'm very happy to say that this one reduced it  A LOT. 
So this Category was way better handled than in the RE2Remake last year. 
Overall I really enjoyed the Voice actors I truly think they did a great job here.

Is it a good game? Well definitely. 
Is it a good Remake? Not in the slightest.

For me personally seeing things from the original being cut didn't have too much effect on me since I've never played the original RE3. I have seen multiple playthroughs though so I'm familiar with the old game.
Overall I don't see any dumb changes when it comes to the Story, however [spoiler] ""killing"" Nicholai or leaving him to die after the missile is about to hit RC doesn't really make sense considering he's still very alive and kicking in RE:ORC. But it's like whatever [/spoiler].

[u]Now to the bad part[/u].

- Clearly what this Remake lacks is content. I really do think that it's a great and fun game overall but it sure does suffer from the lack of content. Even while playing it for the very first time (started on Hardcore) I've felt like things were rushed for no reason. From the beginning where Sh*t went down in like about 5 minutes (yes Jill was asleep but still) up to the point where [spoiler] Jill gets infected by the Nemesis and just lays bleeding and unconcious on the cold ground for almsot a Day? What? Every sane Person would have died right there on the Spot that really was immersion breaking for me [/spoiler].

- But the biggest flaw of this game is that I genuinely felt like the Devs didn't play/know the OG RE3 all too well. Many things were changed for no reason like [spoiler] Brad not being killed by the Nemesis. I think that scene was iconic! I mean yea he already got introduced in the first 5 minutes but seeing him kill Brad like he did in the original game would have been astonishing for me! [/spoiler]
Many things were simply cut like the Gravedigger (Worm) or RE's famous puzzles (which many agree on RE3 having the most difficult puzzles in the whole Franchise).

- Another point that really bugs me is  Resident Evil: Resistance. While it is indeed a fun and interesting Game set in RE universe it simply doesnt justify RE3 being this short and having a price tag of 60€.
Also what's important for me here is: The original RE3 introduced everyone to the famous 'Mercenaries' mode which many fans of the Franchise loved over the past decades being in many RE titles. Clearly fans stated that they'd wished for it's return for this Remake but instead we got RE:sistance which nobody really asked for.
Sadly feels like the Devs don't care about what their fans and supporters really want... :(
You cannot even by RE3 and RE:sistance seperately. That's just the most greedy thing for me. Even if I Like Resistance.

- When it comes to graphical design yes it is a little bit of a downgrade when compared to RE2 (2019) but due to this game being  way faster paced and way more action oriented (which I don't mind at all because it makes sense with the whole Nemesis thing going on) it didn't really bother me at all especially because the things that are mainly focused are still top notch.

Those are just a few points why - even if I really want to - cannot give this game a thumbs up. However, If I were to give this game a rating out of 10, it would be a solid 7/10 for me.

Yes
IS IT A TRUE REMAKE?
No
SHOULD YOU BUY THIS GAME?
Only if you like resident evil 2 remake and only if its on sale.

I think this game is more of an add on to what was already there in re2. The thing that i enjoyed the most is seeing what went down a few moments before resident evil 2. This is an ok game but its not a ""wow this game is a masterpiece"".

In regards to the game play and performance.

It's crispy, in fact i get more fps and feel a lot smoother when playing. The combat is re2 but with just enough of a twist to keep you engaged as to not bore you with the same bs. Jill's dodging is fun to pull off and there are a few ergonomic tweaks to make the game even more of a smooth experience like for example the fact that you can hold the shooting button to shoot more than one bullet instead of spamming it like most games. Its fun to explore and uncover secrets for the first 5 hours, as well as getting to see a different side of raccoon city and the shop addition to put things in your itembox is pretty interesting. 

Is it as scary as re 2?

Nope, unless youre a new generation re virgin, this game wont get to you as much as re2 got to us. Resident evil 3 is more action based than horror in comparison re2 in my opinion.

Constantly felt myself having zero inventory space while simultaneously having no resources, and the frequent back tracking to pool resources in my box was quite annoying.

!! Spoilers below !!

Boss fights were hit and miss. The first encounter with Nemesis was fun, if a little too scripted for my liking, and when he chases you around the city he can be a bit brutal especially considering the lack of healing items. Later on when he gets a flamethrower and torches the skyscraper he somehow becomes less powerful but much more fun to fight on the roof of said skyscraper, 

Nemesis' rocket launcher was a fun, albeit shortlived segment that I enjoyed, but the next time we encounter him I wanted to tear my brain out of my skull. What the hell was that fight by the at the fountains where he climbs the clocktower?? Jill's voice lines made me assume I had to shoot him off the clocktower, but in actuality he just... sits there? I used a dozen grenade rounds, thirty or more shotgun rounds and fifty or so handgun bullets before he went down, and by that point it was just dull.

The Nemesis fight near the acid tanks was much better though. Carlos helping me out and the constant waves of regular zombies made a simple circular arena into an interesting ara to navigate. Final Nemesis fight with the rail gun was awful though. He had zero powerful attacks and it felt very short lived.

Carlos and Jill were great protagonists though, and the focus on their combat training via the dodge mechanic made me feel much more adept at fighting large groups of enemies. The re-use of many Resident Evil 2 assets both makes sense and feels like a disappointment at the same time. Did we really have to navigate the RPD again? How about the sewers and the same streets? 

It felt far too contained within the same area as Resident Evil 2, and honestly felt more like DLC than a standalone game, especially given its short run time.

Still, it has some standout levels like the burning skyscraper, the hospital and the acid tank bossfight with Nemesis, along with more tuned combat than most other Resident Evil games.",1701802506,1701802506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

RE3 plays more like an action movie and it rubbed me the wrong way the first time off the heels of the slow puzzle masterpiece RE2 was but this title works perfectly if you let it be its own thing and ultimately all the remakes compliment each other nicely.

The early titles, especially Resident Evil 0 through 3, hold a special, nostalgic place in my heart. With the remastered series, Capcom has truly outdone themselves, exceeding expectations and rekindling the magic of these classic games.

The Resident Evil 3 Remastered is a shining example of how to breathe new life into a beloved classic. The game preserves the essence and atmosphere that made the original a legend while updating it with stunning modern graphics, refined gameplay mechanics, and immersive audio design. Every minute spent playing this remastered version feels like a thrilling trip down memory lane, but with the polish and sophistication of contemporary gaming standards.

Capcom's attention to detail in the remaster is commendable. The reimagined Raccoon City is more vibrant and terrifying than ever, filled with meticulously rendered environments that enhance the game's tense and eerie atmosphere. The updated character models, particularly of the protagonist Jill Valentine, are impressively realistic, adding depth to the narrative and engagement in the gameplay.

Moreover, the game's pacing and action have been expertly tweaked to suit modern gaming sensibilities. The balance between horror, action, and puzzle-solving remains as compelling as ever, ensuring that both longtime fans and newcomers to the series find the experience exhilarating. Resident Evil 3 Remastered is not just a remake; it's a masterful reimagining that pays homage to its roots while standing tall as a modern-day classic in its own right.",1701668285,1701668285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Updated graphics, but cut content. Really short game (4 Hours upon completion). 
No point in buying unless in Winter sale. Even then, it's not exactly thrilling like Resident Evil 2 Remake. It looks so obvious that it's a rushed product, and unlike RE2, there is no replayability value. Seems like you can't strike Gold twice with RE Remakes.

- - - Annoying Tid Bits - - -

* Priced at £32.99 full price (At Reviewers Date), and a playtime of 4 hours, that's £8.20 per hour of ""fun"". Think about that.
* The replayability that I suppose is in the game is a stupid shop menu that allows you to buy some buffs and infinite weapons for your next pointless playthrough. How original...
* I haven't played RE2 Remake in some time, but I am 99% sure that a great deal of assets used in RE3 have been taken from RE2. From a AAA game company, I would expect better than some cookie cutter nonsense.
* Chucking in another team deathmatch game to add as filler is just about all the proof you need in this company's confidence in this product. There is none!

- - - How To Fix This (Hindsight) - - -

* Scrap the team deathmatch game, and instead add a Mercenaries mode in the base game. +Adds replayability, possible multiplayer interaction, and a chance to introduce a faster paced gamemode for those particular players into that kind of thing.
* Adding new content on top of the original remake. A few more levels, including the original game's missing levels. +Adds surprise to those diehard original fans that know every inch of the original game with these new levels. It also fills up the game's runtime, and fixes the atrocious pacing between the final boss battles.
* Adding more puzzles. I thought RE was a mix of action and puzzle solving, but I didn't find it here. +Adds runtime and engaging player experience.
* New assets. Simple as that. I expect a few assets from previous games of course, but not this many.",1701612879,1701612879,False,15,0,0.597205460071563721,0,True,False,False

That's it. And the rewards you get from ""killing"" him are not even that good. You'd probably get a couple grenade launcher rounds and thats it. And even then, I never really found myself using the grenade launcher all that much since majority of the threats were zombies that could be taken down in maybe 2 shots from the starter pistol. The amount of gunpowder you find doesn't really help either. For the most part, the game was a cutscene. It's more like a movie than an actual game. Its also really short as this is the fastest I have ever finished a resident evil game. The map is about two streets, a sewer, a smaller version of the police station, and a lab with a couple rooms. Thats about it. Jill isn't really as likeable as she was in the original either, as majority of her lines were just cursing and insulting the very guy who helped her during her first encounters with Nemesis.

The game has some good moments like intro,graphics,soundtrack,motion capture especially with Nicolai.
Also they pretty well mixed slower and atmospheric sections(like spider nest and hospital) with fast (police department and sewerage)I was bored in RE2 making 10 circules in sewerage and lab.Here you have new location,go fast threw them and it's play good.
Nemesis  needed to be more balanced,a little harder,added more atack option(when he grab Jill,after that he just stay and watch how you run away from him.Why not give him attack option and player dodge option in that moment?)Also the fight in square of Clock tower does'nt play good.Better was to keep his original second form.The person or people who decided to cut Clock tower(most iconic location in the game with mystery atmoshpere and puzzle section that was in all original re games)needs to be fired from capcom.
Shame to Capcom who betrayed fans of original and shame for develepor team who as creators didnt even try to make this remake with respect for old fans and make game better having best setting in the series Raccoon City. This game deserve another remake or at least directors cut version with all city location and more city streets.",1701466956,1701467869,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It had a cool story, and cool characters, and the enemies were cool too!
I enjoyed the game a lot, and I'm sure I'll replay it someday in the future as well as Resident Evil 2! I think this game was a little too short and had way too many safe rooms randomly placed on the map xd.
The game also kinda needed more of the puzzles that Resident Evil 2 had.

But if we look past those things then it's still a great game with a lot of things to do and explore. The game gave you a lot of fight scenes which I know many people find interesting, like myself! And that's awesome! 
The boss fights were pretty awesome and what I liked in both Resident Evil 1 AND 2 is properly the different stages of the creature you fight as your boss.

It is inferior to the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis in every way except for 2 areas, Graphics of course and characters. Though there are 2 characters i do find issue with.  ----WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!----

My first issue with this game is how linear and short it is. you can beat it in 2 hours, and that's not speed running. Another issue i have is with Nemesis, one, his redesign is sub-par to put it kindly. They made him look beastly and savage, actually, they made him look like the super licker from Resident Evil the Movie, which make it even worst. His original designs for his 3 forms was good, why the hell they didn't just recreate and remaster it is beyond me. Honestly, they could of literally ripped the Marvel vs Capcom 3 nemesis and out him in the new nemesis place and it would look far better then what we got. His voice however i will compliment is good, no other game besides the original had a good nemesis voice, this one does, so that's a plus. His other forms are also not great, except the final form, i didn't mind it, but it wasn't a threat, which is the problem. Nemesis is NOT A THREAT in this game. 1 Frag grenade literally will down him, the explosive barrels and generators you can trigger help stun him as well.  In the original game it took 24 shotgun shells to down him, once, and you had to down him twice in a row to get any loot from him. Now, just shot his chest contraption and BAM, hes down after maybe 5 shots. With these issue, Nemesis isn't scary, which is a serious problem. He is supposed to be the most powerful tyrant ever created, a damn near unstoppable force. He suppose to be challenging and terrifying, which he was for all of 5 minutes, until you discover how to easily dispatch him and now the main bad guy of the whole game is a joke. 

Weapons are pretty bare bones, the original game had weapons you could unlock by battling nemesis and earning parts to craft better gear like the STI Eagle 6.0 or the Lever-Action Shotgun, those are gone and no mine launcher either which sucks. Granted the MGL can fire mine rounds, which somehow damage nemesis more then explosive rounds. Sigh....

Ok, now onto Jill, Jill for the most part is amazing, she looks both beautiful and tough, like she actually was an ex delta force operator turned cop. Which, if you know her back story, shes was the first woman that entered and passed delta force selection in the resident evil lore, which is awesome. Her outfit redesign is good in my opinion, it makes senses for her situation. However, she has 2 issues. 1. Her classic outfit, is NOT her classic outfit, its a mock up of it and it looks rather bad on her. Very bad, i dunno why they even bothered it they weren't gonna do it justice. Modders! Fix this heresy! Ok, the second is her attitude. Jill in the original series was tough, kind hearted, witty and determined.  While she still has some of those traits, shes gain a few new ones i do not like. Shes lost that witty charm and gained a foul mouth, which at times is funny, others it makes me roll my eyes. I know CAPCOM wants to ""modernize"" their resident evil characters, but in doing so, you take elements away from them. And this whole ""modernizing"" idea isn't good for the series, especially with all the glaring issues it brings up. 

No Mercenaries Mod, WTF CAPCOM. Nobody wants or asked for Resistance, OMG you had 1 job......how do fuck it up, HOW?!?!........... Resistance is crap, its literal dead by daylight / left 4 dead and its not even good. The enemy AI is retarded and in my opinion the whole concept is far inferior to oh i dunno...Mercenaries Mode! For Fuck Sake, you didn't even have to put in operation mad jackal, just add a mercenaries mode like Resident Evil 5's and your set. Or make it Survival mode where you hold out as long as possible, like COD zombies mode, THAT would of been amazing, Resistance is shit. When i tried it during the demo, i barely got to play it because nobody was on the servers testing this crap. How the hell is this mode half the size of the game. Did y'all literally shove this in here to pad out the game that is way too short and fully of missed opportunities. One missed opportunities is Jill not encountering zombie Brad and Marven, they should not have sent Carlos and Tyrell into that situation, it has less emotional impact on the story and characters. SIGH..... OK Rant over, for now.

Monsters and Gore: This games gore is very weak, the originals had much more gore then this, character deaths are well, weak sauce, and this was a problem in RE2R chief irons death was pathetic to how he got 2 different death types in the original, which were pretty cool. Zombies are asset flips from RE2R which doesn't surprise me, but no new zombies, not 1, what the hell. Hunter design was amazing, ones for that. Hunter Gamma was....ok, i prefer the original but it was ok. Drain Deimos Look cool but aren't dangerous if your careful. The originals were more of a threat. Licker made an appearance, which was too bad, but again, easy to dodge, just walk and don't make much noise, then it cant find you. No Large Spiders either, which since i'm an arachnophobe was a blessing, but at the same time, i kinda wish they had been. They were an enemy from the original games so....

Story again, could have been longer, so much more that could of been in this game. The fact content was cut, is an issue. They cut the Grave Digger, a classic foe, RE3s mini boss per say. They cut the Park, which they could of expanded on since the park section was short in the original and technically, they cut the dead factory too, though what they did was incorporate it into the hospital which at first i though was cool. But then i realized the problem with that. Umbrellas facilities are supposed to be hidden right, well, its not so hidden when dozens of trucks marked as part of umbrella are driving in and out the hospital and disappearing into a underground base which somehow no one knew about. Well, correction, 1 nurse noticed it in the weeks of the city's life but that's it? Plus with that setup, we lost the amazing battle scene between U.S. Army special forces and the 4 tyrants from the original game. I was sooo looking forward to seeing that epic aftermath, but for some dumb reason, it was cut.... SIGH.

 I was really hoping this game would be great, a solid 9/10 at minimal, its honestly a 6/10 at best. 5/10 at worst. WHY CAPCOM, why did you put little to no effort in recreating Resident Evil 3?! You might as well have not even bother with a remake if you weren't gonna give it the love and respect it needed.  Resident Evil 2 R sure got the red carpet treatment, well, somewhat, it has issues too. 

In closing, i do NOT recommend this game. Go buy Doom Eternal, the developers of Doom give their games the proper attention and care. CAPCOM just wants our money and is using nolstiga to make a quick easy buck. Resident Evil 3 Nemesis was my first resident evil and my favorite, the remake shames it and for that i'll never buy another product from CAPCOM, EVER AGAIN. Yah hear me CAPCOM, you just lost a customer and i'm pretty sure you'll lose more and more as time goes on and the Hype train dies down and more people start spotting theses issues.",1586370132,1701136474,False,10,1,0.528078794479370117,0,True,False,False

It's also anti-explorer as it has segments you can't get back to and sometimes it's during a chase or boss fight. The dialogue is ok, onto Nemesis. In cutscenes/scripted sequences, he is inconsistent with him being shown to break through a wall but not being able to burst through a door and bookshelf. He is also made to be a fool with his introduction showing he can't even catch one person who he got the jump on then being called a fuckface and slowed. He is not even a threat in dialogue and to characters, Brad talks of him nonchalantly, and Jill hasn't shown fear of him and just curses a lot seeming more annoyed than fearful. nemesis's gameplay is also bad as he can hit you multiple times without giving you a chance to react or even get up, He also has an insta kill attack so if you get kicked into a corner you're guaranteed to die. During his burning demolition building chase, he is slow and isn't much of a threat and on his rooftop boss battle, I did it without taking one bit of damage. He also doesn't ever fucking leave when you're in a safe room and he's outside. Overall it's a bad game but if it's on sale it's a decent play, I personally got it for 10 bucks and have been having some fun. 

Post-completion additions:
It all around is fun but not good, It's very short sadly and the story is poor. Throughout the game, Jill and Carlos are quipping and it killed the tension. The bossfights were very easy and the final boss was so easy I thought it would have multiple phases. The only time Nemesis ever kills is at the very end and it's a side character, unlike the original where he kills Brad at the very start. Nemesis also has his forms ruined, his second form is a dog unlike the original where he was still human and his final form falls into the RE Final Boss syndrome and is just a blob unlike the original which was creative with how it was like an animal near death and not a powerful final form. At the end they state the theme of the game in a weird unnatural way. Nicolai or whatever his name was, was written poorly and acted like a cartoon villain. They also took away the choice-making and didn't compensate with extra small campaigns like Resi 2 had or any extra campaign. Overall the story sucks and Nemesis sucked but it was fun to play.

I won't go into how much I love the RE franchise and how long I've been waiting for a remake of my favorite entry ever. I'll keep it short about the things I, as well as I imagine thousands of other players, don't like. Or hate, whatever.

1. Cut out content. Well, imagine waiting for your favorite moments to be presented in a glorious remake, only to find that they have been cut out. I wouldn't mind them being reimagined, but there's a lot of stuff missing. I would love to get that extra stuff as DLC, let it be my loss, but Capcom, just get to work and do it right.

2. The most iconic boss, Nemesis. I was scared of the original Nemesis as a kid, and I still am. The new Nemesis? He is not scary, he is not dangerous, he feels like just another boss you see in every video game. Every encounter with him in the original game was stressful, but in remake, even while playing for the first time, it was ""meh"". To the point that I feel like Mr. X is more scary in RE2 Remake. Such a shame.

3. The Raccoon City. In the OG there were a lot of places to explore. The remake feels like they have shrunk the map and it feels really small.

4. Replayability. Even if you go for all the challenges, achievements, and earning ""S"" on all the difficulties, it won't take you much time. I won't get into RE Resistance, that's another story.

5. The original costume as paid DLC? That's just pathetic. It should be unlockable for beating the game on hardest difficulty, not behind a paywall. Also, the costume looks worse it was in OG RE3.

Even though it's the worst Resident Evil remake Capcom has released so far, it's still a solid game and I like playing it. It just won't be at the top of my personal ranking of RE games. That's about it.",1701002922,1701002922,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's not survival horror. No running away from zombies here—I get to blow their brains out with some serious firepower.

The story is solid, especially if you haven't played it before. And let's talk about the big boss, Nemesis—it's everything you'd expect from an action-packed game like this.

If survival horror isn't your thing, like it isn't for me, give this game a shot and maybe skip RE2.

When it comes to protagonist, Jill and Carlos are so fun! While I enjoyed Leon and Claire, there's something about this duo that made me enjoy them even more.

That being said. I don't like this game. This is my second Resident Evil experience, previously I played RE2 Remake. Well the contrast is night and day. They simply don't compare. It's like they took the RE formula and streamlined it to the point of absurdity.

There is so little gameplay. There are several instances where you go from cutscene, to cutscene with only walking 4 steps yourself. The moment you start skipping through cutscenes after the first play-through you realize just how little interactivity there us. The interactive parts that are there? They aren't all that interesting.

My least favorite aspect of the game is the Tyrant. That's the big bad evil guy that keeps chasing you and can't be stopped. He shows his ugly mug 11 times throughout the game. Of those 11 times, 4 are boss fights with different stages. It takes 4 boss fights to kill it for good... That's just too many. After every boss fight you walk away like you killed it. Only for it to return. It's so frustrating. You'd think that after the 2nd boss fight, Jill would would grab a sledgehammer and start beating every inch of his body to pulp. Right? That's what I would do. But no.

That's not all where the writing fails. Jill is a tough badass. But in a modern way. She runs into characters that are delibearely mysagonistic just so she can show how tough she is. We get it, she's just as good as the boys are. Show don't tell, please. Good grief. I forgive this part because it's a japanese game and in Japan the male/female archetype rolemodels are a bit different from where I live. It's just cringe inducing whenever they resort to the Hollywood strong female character stereotype. That doesn't work for Hollywood, that doesn't work for Japan, that just doesn't work.

I won't play this game again ever after finishing the S Tier run.",1700754201,1700754201,False,3,0,0.531755387783050537,0,True,False,False

Speaking on the game purely as a remake it does a terrible job, multiple entire areas from the original game were completely axed, namely the clocktower which happened to be my favorite section of the story. Secondly the ability to make choices at certain parts of the story were completely removed as well, the entire game is purely linear now. Thirdly there's little to no incentive to ever fight Nemesis for any reason anymore, the first few times you kill him he drops handgun parts then after that it's all ammo which you use way more than what he gives you anyways, say goodbye to fighting Nemesis and getting a new gun for it or continuously getting attachments from it because he's nothing but fast mr. X now.

All of the extra modes from the original do not make an appearance either, the story is all you get and that's all there is, which isn't much considering you can beat the hardest difficulty in under an hour and a half if you get the infinite rocket launcher (which doesn't take that long mind you, you'll find nothing really does in this game). It feels like this game is trying it's hardest to rush the story along so you'll go away.

To say something positive about the game however it takes the gameplay elements from the original that were either completely broken or just didn't work for RE at all like the dodge rolling and having to fight hordes of zombies all at once and actually makes them fun and functional for the short periods of time you get to do them. I actually found that when i took the time to fight Nemesis it was fun to do because it honestly felt like a souls boss each time he appeared, if only he dropped anything useful for doing so most the time.

All in all if you don't want to emulate the original or track down a $200 copy on ebay and just want to experience the story in a very brief summary, this is fine. But I would seriously caution you to wait for a big sale especially if you don't intend to 100% the achievements like I did as it is not even worth the $40 they ask for it.",1700712511,1700712511,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Praising modern money greed with it’s finest. As a hardcore fan of original ps1 re3, i really question this remake. Questions come from perspective of cutting many locations out, oversimplifying the story plot, the game was literally gutted, losing everything it was famous for, it’s speciality. Is it some kind of a bad joke isn’t it ? Some sick twist fuсk decided “ YEAH let’s implement Jill’s insect poisoning, like deepthroating her mouth, with voooomiting YEAHS every time she gets a bug over her wooo“. “Let’s be capcom, we can not do no wrong after critical success of re2 remake, we have the best resident evil to remake, let’s make an ULTRAWESTERNISED CINEMATIC ACTION RUNAWAY MANHUNT ROLLING IN MUDSНIT GUNSCOLLECTING SIMPLIFIED FOR IMBECILES typical re6 game full of absurd sh*t”. We’ll give a hot look to our main character and force her to moan every 5 minutes in order to distract from other lousy aspects of this game like poor level design, absence of puzzles, terrible shooting, fuсking barrels everywhere, poor characters and dialogs realization, ugly “japanese” style games enemies and levels, like those spiders, like overgrown toads in sewers, or implementing parasites in this game, like nemesis makes parasites right in front of you, and not just brutally kills, also sticking you on his launcher... Nemesis is a cringe, the absolute fail. Worst version of mrX, trying to impress with his endless cool gadget toys. Absence of fear of him, no chasing terror feeling, no horror at all. Every aspect of his role is lost in the void of commercialization. Even poor bastard’s “stars” sounds pathetic. He plays with you by grabbing by the head and throwing onto something instead of just rip apart, but Jill can handle any blunt  any kind force trauma. “Pessimistic exhale”. Because this game is 3 hours long you can’t dive into it, experience it, feel the story, thrill. What remains is to beat the sh*t out of nemesis for fuсking upgrade boxes and get “is he gone ?” achievements. Ow and nexus mods of course, if you know you know, that is a completely different run… and game in general… when your character is not a lowlife punk but bare naked… she’s more helpless and meaningful, and nemesis has penises out of his sleeve and everything like that to please one’s wet dreams quantity at nights. That’s what it is, overrated cash grab and nothing like a worthy remake of the decent game. It easily could be just another chapter in re2 remake, but capitalism, AAA games standards, corporats have turned this industry into a real joke, and modern kids will pay, buy and pay for every single defication which they can’t define.",1700641080,1700644115,False,4,2,0.512658238410949707,0,True,False,False

You get to revisit a certain place from RE2, which works very well, and the hospital area and onward is fantastic. The thing that drags the game down from an ""excellent"" score for me, is the combination of the narrow corridor-map of the city, and Nemesis. It's not as effective as Mr.X in RE2, and the whole chase feels too scripted. It's scary in the beginning, but drags on for too long (at least with the mechanics used here).

Also, the way the camera reacts when you're aiming, or getting into close combat, sometimes get in the way of a seamless playing experience (zooming in too close, being a bit jittery and unpredictable). This was not a problem in RE2. Not a huge issue, and RE3 still provides a great horror-action experience.

Otherwise, I like the characters (as usual) and the writing is fine, which fortunately feel more like action movies and games from back in the 90s and 00s, unlike the crap we mostly get nowadays, Though, I didn't play the original RE3 game. 

Also, the visuals in this game are stunning, while running consistently at a very high framerate. Afaik Capcom's engine seems to be a lot more optimised than UE5. No stuttering, and smooth + high framerate all the time, with all graphics settings maxed out. Impressive!

I was waiting to do everything possible in the game before making a review, but I couldn't wait. RE3, the remake version, since it was released I wanted to play, and it was the first remake of the Resident Evil series I've ever played, even though I didn't play the Resident Evil 3 classic I can tell it was a really really great experience from start to end. After finishing this game for the first time, I went to see the classic game and I could understand why the old fans said this was a bad remake: scenarios, boss fights, personalities, etc. were removed. Ok.

This is a game for 'new' generations (you got it), so one thing I can't disagree with is the lack of bad customization in the game, it was acceptable for PS1's games when we couldn't do a lot of things because the low hardware, so I don't know why this game is almost 25GB. Could it be because of the graphics? The engine? Nah, it does mean nothing that much... there are a lot of games with better features with lower sizes.

My opinion is the game is great! The best? No. Could it be better? Of course. But even with all of those negative points, it's still a nice game to play and I want to do everything it's possible to do on it before going to other remake of the Resident Evil series.

They did Jill dirty.

The entire experience is overly streamlined, all of the things that made the original unique like live selections are gone, several entire areas are removed from the original, boss fights were removed, tons of enemies were either removed or completely underutilized, the areas that remained were severely reduced in size and scope, it has lots of the worst elements of modern gaming (e.g. terrible dialogue, insufferable female characters, one-dimensional villains, male characters that can't stop telling the female protagonist how amazing she is, incredibly boring QTE's, one-button ""cutscenes"", way too many cutscenes relative to gameplay, etc.), there are no ""horror"" elements left to the game, optional endings were removed, the puzzles are gone, the exploration is gone, freeze rounds were replaced with useless mine rounds, there's no countdown sequence to the missiles at the end, etc. 

Worst of all, is that they made Jill a completely unsympathetic character, and they completely neutered Nemesis. Jill exhibited zero fear of Nemesis and just swore constantly at him without flinching. She wasn't a character; she was a caricature. There was nothing scary about Nemesis, no build up to his introduction, no development to make him intimidating as a villain, no real surprise encounters, no nothing. He just came off as an incompetent boogeyman, rather than the horrific killing machine hunting S.T.A.R.S. from the original. It was extremely lazy. 

The game felt incredibly rushed, watered down, stripped of anything that made the original good, and they insulted the original with their portrayal of Jill and the rest of the characters.

RE 3 is a very special game in the series and definitely worth playing. I highly recommend it.

The game-play runs the exact same to the previous Resident Evil 2 Remake but downgrades on the gore by a huge gap. Also, Nemesis is a great and Iconic stalker to the franchise that has been re-made I think excellently in this game. Same goes with Jill and Carlos, the two main characters you play as through out the story. Furthermore, The graphics are good and I did not experience any crashes at all when playing. The reasoning to why it is not my favourite compared to the others is because of it being a shorter game in general and I just did not enjoy it nearly as much as the others.",1699957582,1699957582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
952060,150105874,76561198081563686,0,2,1664,0,978,1706472285,"Resident Evil 3, the latest installment in Capcom's iconic survival horror series, is a relentless rollercoaster of terror that will have your heart pounding from start to finish. As a longtime fan of the franchise, I couldn't wait to dive into Raccoon City once again, and Resident Evil 3 did not disappoint. 

First and foremost, the visuals are nothing short of breathtaking. Raccoon City has never looked so hauntingly beautiful, and the attention to detail in every decaying building and blood-splattered alley is a testament to the developers' dedication. The atmosphere is thick with tension, and the lighting effects add an extra layer of realism that immerses you in the apocalyptic nightmare.

Resident Evil 3 maintains the series' signature survival horror gameplay while introducing some exhilarating new elements. The over-the-shoulder perspective feels intuitive, and the controls are responsive, allowing for precise aiming when confronted by grotesque monstrosities. The addition of the dodge mechanic adds a layer of strategy to encounters, but timing is crucial, making every escape a heart-stopping experience.

While the narrative might not stray too far from the original, the storytelling is solid, and the characters are well-developed. Jill Valentine's journey is both compelling and emotional, and the supporting cast adds depth to the overarching plot. The game successfully weaves together horror and narrative, keeping you invested in the unfolding events.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 is a masterclass in survival horror, delivering a pulse-pounding, adrenaline-fueled experience that will linger in your nightmares. Capcom has once again proven why they are the maestros of the genre, and any fan of horror games owes it to themselves to experience the relentless terror that is Resident Evil 3.

Visual and Audio Presentation:
The game inherits the impressive graphical prowess of the RE Engine used in the ""Resident Evil 2 Remake,"" bringing Raccoon City to life with stunningly realistic visuals. The attention to detail in the environment, the character models, and the gruesome design of the creatures make for an immersive horror spectacle. The atmospheric sound design, from the groans of distant zombies to the explosive ordinance of the titular Nemesis, further pulls players into the game's terrifying world.

Story and Characters:
""Resident Evil 3 Remake"" follows Jill Valentine, a former S.T.A.R.S. officer, as she navigates the zombie-infested ruins of Raccoon City. The narrative expands on the original plot, giving more context to Jill's character and fleshing out the story with cinematic cutscenes and interactions. The game also intersperses moments featuring Carlos Oliveira, providing an alternate perspective and gameplay experience.

Gameplay and Mechanics:
Capcom evolved the gameplay from the ""Resident Evil 2 Remake,"" offering a faster-paced experience that aligns with Jill's character as a seasoned combatant. The addition of a dodge mechanic allows for more dynamic encounters with enemies and gives players a fighting chance against the relentless Nemesis. The game is more action-oriented, with plentiful resources and more opportunities for combat compared to its predecessor.

The Nemesis System:
The Nemesis, an unstoppable bio-weapon pursuing Jill throughout the game, is a highlight. This towering adversary has been reworked to be more terrifying than ever, with improved AI and unpredictable appearances that keep the tension high. His presence is a constant reminder of the stakes and adds urgency to the gameplay.

Exploration and Puzzles:
While ""Resident Evil 3 Remake"" streamlines some aspects of exploration compared to the original, it still offers a satisfying balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The puzzles are intuitive and engaging, providing a respite from the action and rewarding logical thinking and observation.

Replayability:
The game encourages replayability through unlockables, difficulty settings, and challenges that offer rewards. Completing the game unlocks the shop where players can purchase powerful weapons and helpful items, incentivizing multiple playthroughs to acquire everything.

Production Value:
""Resident Evil 3 Remake"" boasts high production values, from the quality of the voice acting to the fluidity of the animations. This polish extends to the user interface and overall design, creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience.

Tightened Experience:
The game streamlines the experience of the original, resulting in a more focused narrative and pacing. This approach may divide some fans of the original's more expansive exploration, but it also makes for a game that respects the player's time and keeps the adrenaline pumping from start to finish.

In conclusion, ""Resident Evil 3 Remake"" delivers a high-octane horror experience that successfully modernizes a classic. With its exceptional presentation, updated gameplay mechanics, and the ever-present threat of Nemesis, it offers both fans and newcomers a compelling adventure through the zombie apocalypse. While some may miss the depth of exploration from the original, the remake's cinematic flair and relentless pace make it a thrilling and worthy entry into the Resident Evil series.",1699461059,1699461059,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I then went on about a year long hiatus before going back and playing through them again, i loved them all the same. however, I was definitely in need of a new story, bought RE:4 VR and played through that, loved the game, story was amazing. As good as RE:7-8 and RE:4 VR is, i was ready for something new to me. Then last month during the Halloween sale i decided to pick up RE:2-3-4-5-6. i wanted to play through the games that i knew had more modern graphics (2-3-4 Remasters) and then the mildly dated RE:5-6. 

I played this game after completing RE:2. Just like RE:2 this game blew me out of the water. the graphics were so beautiful, the story and action kept me on the edge of my seat, and the characters were likeable and interesting. As RE:3 ties in with RE:2 this was the perfect addition to the series as well as a very good resolution to RE:2's story. 

RE:3 follows the typical RE formula and does it spectacularly. RE:2 IMHO is a better game, but this one is not bad in the slightest. would 100% suggest playing it after RE:2. If you loved that one, you'll love this one.",1699429869,1699429869,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Whole sections from the original have been cut out. Where's the  factory? Gone. What about the park? Gone. The gas station? You only get a 2 seconds glimpse of it, from a cutscene. The Clock Tower, the City Hall, all of that is gone.

Some other locations have also been changed or mixed with some new areas of the city. There's places where you spent a lot of time in the original going back and forth that now you simply can rush through in seconds and never go back.

Its a shame because the city is so well done. The whole atmosphere is great, and places like where you find Dario are crafted with so much attention to detail that you can't help but think IF ONLY they hadn't cut so much from the game...

But the cut content doesn't end with just some locations, enemies like crows or the Grave Digger are also nowhere to be found. 

The puzzles? There's not even a single one, unless you count the diamonds from the monument or the railway control as puzzles, which would be fucking laughable.

Even such an iconic moment from the original game if not THE MOMENT, which is when you first encounter Nemesis at the RPD, has been cut out too...
[spoiler]Now you don't even know what happens to Brad. Did he died right there where you left him? Did he escaped and died later? How did he managed to get from that bar to the police station? We'll never know.	[/spoiler]

The story has been changed a lot too. 

Some of these changes I can live with, but some others follow the same pattern as the rest, as if they were more concerned about putting all thought and effort into reaching the launch deadline rather than trying to make the remake as good as possible...

The beginning was changed for one I particularly didn't like much. The ending has changed too. Like mentioned earlier, whole areas are missing, and some fights were also moved/changed. It's not good.

I understand this was a remake and its supposed to be different and that would've been a welcome change if only they had shown some more respect for the original material, just like they did with previous remakes of the franchise.

Nemesis is more annoying and stupid than challenging or terrifying like in the original. They somehow thought it was a good idea to introduce him within five minutes from the very start of the game... 

THUS COMPLETELY REMOVING ANY SENSE OF SURPRISE OR DANGER TO THE FOLLOWING ENCOUNTERS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE GAME. 

What the fuck? When one of the best things about Nemesis in the original game, was how he introduced himself to the player...

And the sections where you encounter him through the city, pfft, you can see then coming a mile away. 
[spoiler]There's one part after you restore power to the tracks where all the zombies vanish and you can easily predict that he's going to appear, which he does... And to be fair its not scary, or surprising, its fucking stupid.	[/spoiler] While in the original, you never expected him to come out of that tiny window, it was probably the most 'OH SHIT' moment in the game, which this one is lacking. Instead of 'oh shit' moments, there's plenty of 'ha, I knew it' moments. Lame.

I could keep going on, since there's so much stuff that feels wrong... 

Why remove the ink ribbons? It completely defeats the survival horror aspect if you'll be stumbling upon saving machines every 5 minutes and you don't have to think or managed how you save, just save scum till the end...

There's even one ridiculous segment when Nemesis is chasing you with the flamethrower where you get 2 saving machines and 2 vaults in the span of 2 minutes. Literally, 2 minutes, while he is chasing you and you're supposed to be desperately running for your life, you get to sit down, relax, save, manage your items... Ah, whatever...

But because of that, and the fact that you practically never run out of ammo and healing items, makes the game not feel challenging at all. Hardcore mode is a joke, Nightmare is what Hardcore mode should've been, and Inferno what should be unlocked after beating the game on Hardcore (Nightmare).

Very disappointing, and what's worse, is that we'll never get a proper Resident Evil 3 remake anymore, this was it, and such a wasted opportunity...",1608056330,1699365479,False,9,0,0.581237196922302246,1,True,False,False

Not only it lacks my beloved Mercenaries, in nearly every regard that actually matters it pales in comparison to the game it's trying to re-imagine. 
Level design, puzzle quality, encounters, characterization, Nemesis as a whole, gameplay variety, it all falls flat. I'd argue without the fidelity, this game would only get laughed out the door. Aside of some few setpieces, the whole game is also insanely easy and a step down from both the original and RE2's campaign. In my honest opinion RE2make was also not a very good remake either after the police station, but it was a great modern re-interpretation of the classic survival horror design, which alone made it good enough in my eyes. 
This one just does not have the meat to retain my positive sentiment.

Not bad but also not a masterpiece everyone expected after RE2Remake.

It just doesn't have that level of polish or budget. 

It's not like something went wrong during production: the game from the start feels far less ambitious, like devs never aimed for the greatness with this title.

CAPCOM just jumped on the tail of highly successful RE2R with this entry adding as little effort or fresh ideas as possible.

As a remake this game was awful. I didnt like Jill (obnoxious strong female attitude) or Carlos (who was a massive simp in this game) but everyone else who got given a bigger story role were improved. Considering how many assets they had from re2 rm there is no excuse for how much of racoon city was cut. continuing on from cut content what little content there was was reduced to an on rails W key simulator. to add further insult to injury nemesis is barely present as a stalker for the city section of the game.

In this game they just throw nemesis at you from the get go and it really just killed what re3 original did with the slow build up. Again its just hold W to end of cut scene and youre done. Half of racoon city is missing, There is no clocktower, and the hospital which i admit was vastly improved over the original, was ruined by the horrible zombie barricade section at the end. 

Game play wise when the game worked it worked but there were times especially in the nemesis fights where the camera would zoom in and hold so i could not see anything! other times my aim button would just become unresponsive causing me to get bitten by zombies. The tentacle zombies were a horrible addition. at a distance they hit causing an obnoxiously long stun animation which caused to me get grabbed with no invincibility frames.

Overall the game took me 2 hours to do on a first play through which is for a full game is actually unacceptable. And no artificially making us run through the game on nightmare and inferno does not count as ""more content"". combined with d/a the game play is artificially made worse.

Resident Evil 3 Remake ended up being a big letdown for me in the end. I still had enough fun playing the game to finish it without it feeling like a chore to do so, and to be fair the game definitely HAS a few good things going for it (good soundtrack, immersive-looking world, a couple tweaks to some of RE2R's gameplay mechanics such as removing knife durability and adding a dodge mechanic that feels better than the original RE3's, and a couple good tension-inducing set-pieces such as the substation and several of the early in-game Nemesis chases, to name a couple examples), but sitting here reviewing the entire package now that I'm done playing it, my first impressions of the entire thing are mixed to negative, especially when viewing it as a remake of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. 

In a nutshell, as a game that serves as a follow-up to Resident Evil 2 Remake I feel it's a letdown that doesn't measure up to it's overall more-polished predecessor, even if I admit the game is arguably fun enough on it's own depending on your mindset when playing the game... as a GAME. It's not a bad game to PLAY by any stretch, but it's a definite downgrade to everything the developers of RE2R had going for THEIR game, which still managed to keep most of the soul of the original RE2 as a survival horror game where you explore several complex, isolated locations with limited resources intact... which is more than I can say for RE3R, which on the whole feels closer to being a toned-down version of RE6 with an altered, compressed version of RE3's story than it does the original RE3, a game which cranked up the action from the original RE2 but was still at it's core a classic survival horror game similar to it's predecessor back in the day, albeit in a more open world (for the first half of that game, at least). 

Now, as a REMAKE of Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for the PlayStation 1... RE3R was simply awful. There's so much wrong with it in this respect that I feel that I could easily make my own dedicated video on the subject comparing this remake to the original on just this aspect alone, if I really wanted to. A short summary of things that come to the top of my mind, as of me having just finished the game, are as follows: Half the original game's content is missing (no clock tower, park, Dead Factory, most of Raccoon City's streets and buildings you get to explore are gone, no construction zone, the Gravedigger boss is completely gone, etc., etc..), a good bit of what DOES remain story/content-wise has been changed up in ways that feels inferior to the original more often than not, the changes in characterization feels like a mixed bag across the board (I do NOT like the changes to Jill and Nikolai's characters in this game, while everyone else I'm either neutral on or have no particular preference when compared to their original counterparts. Brad is the only character whose changed characterization I actually feel is an overall improvement from his original portrayal), the choice mechanic from the original game that influences how the story/game progressed is entirely absent (which was the source of most of the original RE3's replayability, but not here - apparently you play through RE3R once and you've already experienced everything the game's story has to offer), and they reduce the titular monster of the original game into a joke compared to his original incarnation -- one that the other characters treat more as an annoyance than a serious deadly threat to be feared (he isn't reduced to a joke in just story, either -- for most part he's been made into a joke during gameplay, too -- he's far less difficult than he was in the original game overall.). I'm just sitting here amazed at how much this game utterly failed to not only live up to my expectations as a follow-up to RE2R, but especially as a remake to one of my favorite games in the series. 

The game was arguably at it's best during the first 1/4, maybe a bit beyond that -- but once I defeated the Nemesis in his first actual boss battle, it seems like the overall quality of the game started to take a nosedive and kept going down all the way until the credits started to roll... which makes it quite frustrating for me because for that first quarter of the game I felt that I could see little hints of what this game COULD have been like if it had been given some more polish, but unfortunately a world where we got a remake of RE3 with a similar level of polish to the RE2 Remake is NOT the world we're living in right now.

So in conclusion, I'd recommend anyone who's looking into getting into the Resident Evil series to stick to the original game and avoid this remake -- the original is a far better game overall than this remake is, IMO. But if you absolutely MUST try this game for yourself, then get it on sale because I don't think RE3R has enough going for it to justify paying for it full-price... and even then I would STILL avoid playing it until AFTER you've played through the original Resident Evil 3 shortly beforehand, so that way you can experience all the differences from the original game for yourselves. But if you choose to think of and play RE3R as just a follow-up to RE2R instead of comparing it to the original game, then while it certainly could be a lot better... you could also do a lot worse than RE3R.",1698467926,1698471099,False,39,2,0.727412998676300049,0,True,False,False

Hello Resident Evil Fan!

In case someone is considering purchasing this one on the Halloween sale, or some other sale in the future, I am here to warn you!

Buy RE2 Remake instead! Go play RE7. Rethink your purchase. Go watch a video hating on this before you click that buy button! Make sure you know what you're getting into.

I purchased it for the price of 7.50, (would have been 10 but I owned the other products in the bundle) and I still felt the need to refund the purchase. This is just THAT bad of a game. If you must have it for mental illness reasons, make sure and get it on sale. Do not listen to the people cope about it not being so bad of a game really, yes it is! And I hear it is SHORT too, WAY TOO SHORT! 

If you like cutscenes and QTE, with levels that don't flow well or even suggest to the player where to go by design, then you will love this piece of shit. They had to write ""HERE"" in big yellow letters somewhere bc otherwise the player would have no fucking idea. 

I about lost it trying to give this monstrosity a chance. This game has no idea what it wants to do. It's the B product, a bad sequel, and it shows immediately. Just leave it at that. Abandon it like most the fanbase has that has played it, or skip over it like most of the fanbase has that has not.  

Game sucks. There are so many ways that it sucks, but I have read the writing on the wall and decided to bail and refund.    

Honestly, the product seems scammy to me in general, if I were to watch all the cutscenes, well shoot, I'd be pushing the 2 hour mark before I would have realized just how OFF this game really is. I skipped the cutscenes, and did the whole run simulator for the first 40 minutes, run, esc, spacebar, run, esc, spacebar, over and over until it got to something that felt remotely like Resident Evil.

Apparently in that time I escaped a building and beat a boss lolololol. Juked some zombies in the streets, noticed the TERRIBLE Linearity with short backtracking planned for later, I just can't support this with 8 bucks dudes...  

This is Spectacularly TERRIBLE. 

If you have put real hours into a game like the re2Remake, and you actually have come to appreciate it, then it's likely you will not be able to stand this product. I'd just go back to playing re2, or get the re4 remake, bc this is just atrocious. Go play RE7 or something idk. F. 

Go back and play the original Re3 unless you just love the interactive movie type game w some Resident Evil shoved in there. The original game was designed better and the player somehow knew where to go easier, with the level map being a lot more complex. 

I have to say, this could quite literally give RE6 a run for its money in being one of the worst RE games ever. It's impressive.

952060,148940316,76561198872369176,0,20,436,0,436,1678380400,"TL;DR Do not buy this game for any reason for any price. I’m not even joking - it’s that bad, mostly due to being 4 hours long at most, which is neither worth the full price nor the price it goes for on sale (10 bucks). Play the original. 

Earlier this year, I was greatly sick for a week. After recovering, I decided as a bit of a personal joke to myself to purchase this game while it was on sale for $10. I'd heard what people had said about it - It sucks as a remake, it's way too short, all that. But I did it anyway because I wanted more REmake gameplay and I saw no more fitting time to get some. 

Yeah, that was a mistake. 

Despite only being 10 bucks, this is one of the dumbest purchases of my life, and I am a clown for willingly, knowingly walking into this trap. I underestimated just how bad this game was and in how many ways it fails as a remake. 

I'll start with saying: I did get my wish - I got more REmake gameplay. Cool, nothing wrong there. Everything else though? Well, I'll summarize the main points: A hilariously inept and nonthreatening Nemesis, cut *important* content, references to the original being halfhearted at best, and overall a game so short that it isn't even worth buying on sale. I'll elaborate on each.

Nemesis: This guy is supposed to be a better, more threatening version of Mr. X from RE2 (a role he fulfills reasonably well in the original). Yeah no, he isn't - he only appears in scripted events, chases you for like maybe 5 seconds in gameplay, and the game gives you grenades to throw at him which will down him instantly if you really want him to stop his lackadaisical pursuit of you. In fact, that purpose is the sole reason why those grenades exist. In cutscenes, he also has Jill dead to rights multiple times, but manages to somehow fuck it up despite being what is supposed to be an unstoppable, ruthless killing machine, and additionally gets stopped by the most basic of means. At the very start of the game, he breaks through a wall like the kool-aid man, but no more than 20 seconds later, he can’t break through a locked door with one punch. Oh, and to quote Jill herself in this game: [spoiler]""Bitch can't even swim.""[/spoiler] This Nemesis sucks and is not a threat whatsoever. If anything, you'll laugh at how bad he is at his job. 3make Nemesis dreams of being a tenth of the threat that 2make Mr. X is.

Cut content: Honestly, some content being cut from the original is fine, because not *everything* was important. For example, I don't care about the gravedigger being cut (he was a dumb boss anyway), but cutting the clock tower and Jill going to the police station? That's two vital moments of the game cut for...What reason exactly? Worse yet on both points (spoilers if you care): [spoiler] Carlos is the one who goes to the police station on a sidequest, but Jill, the STARS member, doesn't. As for the clock tower, you actually see it in the distance and you read a little informative pamphlet about it, but do you actually go there? LOL no. [/spoiler]

References to the original: Aside from the above, this game is desperate to prove that it knows it knows its original counterpart. There's a number of things from the original that are just kinda...there...and serve no real purpose other than to exist and delude the player into thinking they’re playing a real remake. ""Haha, I promise we played the original RE3 guys, see? Look at my neat references!"" Aside from the things mentioned already, one of the more glaring of these halfhearted references is Jill's ""You want stars!?"" line in this game, which is delivered at a really bad time instead of at the end of the game when Nemesis dies for good. You can tell the line was inserted randomly out of obligation because they knew people would notice and complain about its absence, but if it was going to be used at an improper moment, then it would have been preferable to have it absent. Come to think of it, ""made out of obligation"" actually describes this entire game's existence well.

As if the game didn't have enough problems, it is *short*, with very little if any replayability (I wonder why). I bought it on sale for 10 bucks and still felt robbed, and it is insulting that they tried to sell this garbage for full price. Obviously, they didn't try to hide the fact that this game was a cash grab in the wake of RE2make's success. 

In case it isn’t obvious, no, you shouldn’t buy this game. Being generous, it's worth 1 dollar per amount of play time, which comes out to 4 dollars at most, but aside from the fact that it will never be that cheap, to be blunt, I'd say it's barely worth a penny. I'd say this is the worst RE title by far...Or at least I would were it not for the fact that I'm going to pretend this game just doesn't exist. 

I have so many more problems with this game that it's difficult to list and expand on all of them, but I've tackled the key points, so I think you get the gist. The game sucks as a remake, is mediocre as a game, and too short to be sold as a full fledged game. 

Play the original. This game isn't worth buying even on sale.

I know they cut a lot of areas, but I haven't played the original so I see it from another perspective. This one is way more action packed than RE2, there's basically no puzzles and area design is way more straightforward, you won't find yourself wandering around RPD for hours like you did in RE2.

I was really excited when I heard RE3 was getting a remake and had my hopes up that they would improve on the original to make a stand-up title just like the RE2 remake. Resident Evil games aren't traditionally too long and I ignored what I had heard in regards to this game's length and tried it anyway. I'm normally a fan of short and sweet games also, so I should've liked this game yeah? No, I fucking hate this game. This game is short and sucks and feels like a fat con even on sale for $40. The ""replayability factor"" that is additional harder difficulty modes and a store for buying new things for later playthroughs mine as well not even exist because the game left such a bad taste on the first go. Stupid cutscenes up the ass. Locations that made the original game memorable (i.e. Raccoon Park, Graveyard, Clock Tower, Dead Factory) aren't even present for the likely reason of time crunch. The Grave Digger is nowhere to be found in this game which makes a little bit of sense because the fights with it sucked in the original. However, it's not like it was impossible to make them better and improve upon the groundwork instead of entirely writing it out of the game. Reused assets from the RE2make are strewn about as well as the final area of the game being lazy enough to just be a fucking white lab again, taking away the identity that the original had of containing its climax in a dingy, disgusting, rusty factory full of suspense as to when Nemesis would show up again. When does Nemesis show up in this game? Whenever Nikolai wants him to because he's on a leash now that he's literally a fucking dog with dumb chalk eater teeth that morphs into a shitty goo monster at the end with a Nemesis head glued on.

Alright, buckle up folks, because we're about to dive headfirst into the wild, wacky, and wonderfully unhinged world of Resident Evil 3. Now, I'm not saying you should play this game while under the influence of hallucinogenic fungi, but if you were to hypothetically find yourself in such a state, you might just discover that this game takes on a whole new dimension.

First off, let's talk about the graphics. They're so realistic you'll swear those zombies are right in your living room. And when you're seeing double (or triple) thanks to those shrooms, well, let's just say the horde feels a lot more...horde-y.

The storyline? Oh boy, it's like a rollercoaster ride through a haunted house on steroids. You've got your classic zombie apocalypse scenario, but with so many twists and turns you'll feel like you're in a labyrinth. And when your sense of time is as warped as a Dali painting, well, it's like living through your very own epic saga.

The gameplay? It's intense. Every decision feels like life or death (because it usually is). And when your reflexes are as unpredictable as a cat on catnip, well, let's just say it adds an extra layer of challenge.

But the real kicker? The atmosphere. It's so immersive you'll forget you're sitting on your couch in your underwear. The eerie music, the chilling sound effects, the dimly lit corridors...it all combines to create a sense of dread that's palpable. And when you're already seeing shadows move out of the corner of your eye...well, let's just say it makes for an unforgettable experience.

So there you have it. Resident Evil 3: not just a game, but a journey into the depths of your own psyche. Just remember to keep telling yourself: it's only a game...

Its tone is slightly different, and that is fine. Whereas RE2 was gothic, claustrophobic and brooding, RE3 is urban, hectic, and action-packed. It is sort of what Aliens (2) and Terminator 2 were to Alien and Terminator; but without the wide scope and the memorable characters that made those sequels truly great. From what i understand, the game that reaches such heights is RE4.

Compared to RE2, RE3 is just a bit too short and too crammed. Even the safe rooms feel too close to each other. You only get one campaign, compared to the two we had in RE2. And the one campaign is shorter and recycles some RE2 environments, include a whole part of the police station.

Still, RE3's campaign is a great one. Jill is a cool character, and the RE engine is just spectacular. Seeing events unfold in Raccoon City from a different angle is kind of fun. Some of the action sequences are superb, and the opening in Jill's apartment sets the tone brilliantly.

Typically I'd rate such a title at 8/10; but the insane production values propel it to a 9/10. Very much worth playing as a standout genre title and a fun and good-looking action-horror.",1697781768,1697781768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But it's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. Not at all denying there are reasons to dislike it, but that depends on where your focus is. If those people would (pardon my french) get their heads out of their asses, they'll see there are more reasons to love this game than to hate it.

First of all, the game is NOT short. Look at speedrunner times, and you'll see even if by mere minutes, remake IS longer. The reason it feels short is because it is too linear. There is very little backtracking, and not a whole lot of challenging puzzles. That is pretty much all that this game is lacking.

In the original game, you would reach the cable car after clearing the Uptown and Downtown maps. Then you would need to get the car running. Remake starts at this exact point, so we can safely say we have those 2 maps removed. I'm not defending that they were probably forced to do this in order to meet deadlines. I (and pretty much everyone else too I reckon) would have gladly waited for another year, or 2, even 3, to get the absolute best game that we could have gotten. There's too much wasted potential here. You can see this in the game. There were clearly great ideas on the table. And some made it through, but unfortunately, the rest didn't.

But I still love this game. There may be heavy bias on my part because Jill is my absolute favorite character in the series, and my childhood hero. I've recently passed 400 hours in the game, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Sure Inferno Nemesis keeps pissing me off royally. But I like the challenge. There's nothing my Jill can't accomplish.

The game is not a frame by frame reworking of the original, unlike 1 and 2. There are a lot of changes and creative differences. Clock Tower is gone, but now you have the Sewers. Dead Factory is gone, but now you have Nest 2. Park is gone, but now you have an underground section of the Hospital - Hospital, which now you can explore with Jill. Unfortunately she doesn't go into RPD, as per the removal of Downtown map as I said earlier. It is what it is.

In the end the graphics are beautiful, Jill is gorgeous, fierce, brave and sassy, the storyline is improved, dodging mechanic is better, locations and the flow is more fluid, files are more part of the overall story and helps fill in many blanks, voice acting is top notch.

If a game has you wanting the work day to be over so you can come home and play it, it's a good game in my book.",1697571130,1697747573,True,21,1,0.679866552352905273,0,True,False,False

I’ve never played the original games, but I did leave this game wishing that it had been more of an experience akin to the other remakes.

This game seems to take more inspiration from games like Uncharted than the actual Resident Evil series, and the sheer number of “hold forward” scripted hallways makes this rather evident for me. Along with this, it’s pretty unfortunate how many areas are just short little jaunts rather than full-fledged areas to explore. A good example of this is the sewers, which can be blasted through in as little as ten to fifteen minutes even if you’re trying to really stretch the game out.

But there are a few stellar things I'd still like to praise, which I'll get to shortly. Now, as for why I'd ""recommend"" this with the many issues it has, is simply because of my undying RE bias. Let the dissension commence.

Pros: 
- Gameplay is fun. It's smooth and easy to get used to.
- Visually stunning. Loved getting to see downtown Raccoon City in the RE Engine.
- Despite his disappointing appearance, Nemesis' functionality is fairly solid. A lot of scripted chases, but the terror he provides is still what I was wanting. He's a menace to get by and creates tension and fear around every corner.
- Character designs were great. Carlos benefited the most in terms of his character redesign.
- Opening escape sequence was great.

Cons:
- Let's get the worst offender out of the way: CUT CONTENT. Removing the sequence at the clock tower, the park area, the power plant, etc. But that's just the areas. Getting rid of the multiple endings from the og, someone deciding it was good idea to not include Barry in the end scene and many more frustrating story elements they decided to remove. I digress.
- Nemesis' appearance. God awful. Plain and simple.
- The bad hospital defense sequence. Hoards of enemies that come in easy-to-manage waves. Not challenging at all. Feels lazy and carries on for far too long.
- Two Nemesis boss battles having pretty much the exact same patterns of attack. And aside from a subtle change in the second fight, its really easy to figure out. More laziness.
- NOT ENOUGH NEMESIS. For a game literally based around this hulking monstrosity, they failed to give him enough of a spotlight.
- And lastly, this game felt extremely rushed. So much more time and care needed to be applied here.

Overall, if you're looking for a good remake, turn away. This game isn't for you. But if you're looking for great gameplay with amazing visuals, go right ahead. So if you do decide to embark, I hope you're able to enjoy. --- [b][i]7.7/10[/i][/b]",1606839813,1697544631,True,1,0,0.517784833908081055,0,True,False,False

In my opinion, the remake seems to get some unfair criticism for changing too much from the original, but as a long time fan of the original RE3, I can tell you that the changes they made to the remake are smart and well executed, and there won't be much that you'll miss. Some people also criticize the game for being too short, but I got a pretty solid 7.5 hours out of my first playthrough. If you've played through it more than once, or if you're  a ""power gamer"" then i'm sure you could beat it even faster. Sure, a little on the short end, but it really doesn't feel like it when you're fighting Hunter Betas and Gammas. I feel like Nemesis lives up to his name in the Remake better than he did in the original. You'll know what I mean if you play it.

Revisiting places familiar to me.

However this game is inferior to the original by 100. No one will ever dispute this. I enjoyed the original and I still would now. 

Sure I enjoy messing with mods of the casual fun of this game and maybe the harder difficulties but holy crap did they do this remake dirty.
We fight Nemesis once outside the Clock Tower but never get to explore it like the original. Several cool moments from the original don't return. Many events of the story are shorter, and Nemesis despite being a fun adversary here doesn't keep the same level of intense and suspenseful pressure like he did in the original.

They also missed a good opportunity to give us Nemesis with a mini gun like in RE:ORC or the second live action movie RE:Apocalypse. Granted the Rocket Launcher and Flamer Thrower weapons were a joy to see be used against me.

Back when this game first released I said I'd never play it because of the bad changes. Now I may be a hypocrite for doing it now and even saying I;d recommend it. Maybe its because there are worse remakes out there at this point in time and I at least got some enjoyment out of this game.

The last thing I need to say here is for new players who are just getting into the Resident Evil franchise.
Play this game. Enjoy it because I know you will. But I want you to be open minded about playing the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Because this remake takes away good content and replaced the Jill we loved with a less appealing version of Jill. Sure they justify why she's mental now but I don't think its good.
The OG didn't go mental or start having annoying fits despite being put through the same situations at the very beginning of the classic because she was a much stronger character overall.

If anyone argues that this is a more ""realistic version of Jill"", not only is that wrong but this game doesn't go for realism as much as you'd like to think. The OG accomplished that feat long ago and did a better job even though it was a PS1 game.

Let it be known these remakes are good for their gameplay and atmosphere bringing back our beloved locations (except the Clock Tower) but ruins the images of each OG character with pretty bad dialog, bad redesigns, and an overall shorter story. Almost makes the game feel like a Saturday morning episode airing besides the main event movie we watched a year ago.

Play this game and then play the original. And Capcom for the love of all that is good, stop making your main protagonists look ugly or dress like Ellie from The Last of Us. 

When we play Resident Evil we don't an Ellie clone. We want the OG Characters we loved back in the day.
Jill's always been beautiful, compassionate, cool headed even in disagreements or distrust of Carlos and she kicked a lot of ass.

You made Jill ugly. Made her talk like an annoying modern day teenager with a foul mouth.
Its hard to picture her as special ops who was given professional training both as an officer, and the army.
Let alone someone who lived in the 90's. Somehow your PlayStation 1 games got the 90's more realistically than your highly detailed remake.",1696422147,1696422147,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For some criticism, from everything I have learned about the original RE 3: Nemesis, I must be inclined to say that this isn't a good remake (I haven't played the original though myself). However, it is such a good game and if you've never tried one of these games before, this is a great starting point. Chris and Jill have such a fun dynamic, and the fact that both characters play so differently is just incredibly immersive. 
Even though it is a linear shooter, the entire world feels just as put together as any open world would, with it feeling like you'll be able to go around any corner and find something of interest. The lack of super narrow hallways is appreciated so much as I feel it suits the game play way more.

Also, Nemesis is utilized in such a fun and great way, other than the fact that there is the same boss battle twice.",1695942426,1695942426,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let's start off with some positives:
- Graphics look absolutely gorgeous and detailed; Carlos' facial hair detail looks especially badass
- Shooting and gun mechanics are enjoyable, polished and surprisingly smooth
- Perfect Dodge mechanic; adds more variety in gameplay 
- Easy, fun game to pick up; It's great for casual gamers, or even people that want to try the RE franchise for the first time
- Banter between Jill and Carlos is refreshing
- The first bossfight is surprisingly enjoyable to fight

Negatives:
- It's way too goddamn short for a modern single player game. Look by all means the classic is quite short too, around 3 hours playtime if you know what you’re doing, but this is bad by modern standards (Finished a standard run with cut-scenes, exploration, backtracking and it took me 3 1/2 hours to complete)
- We get to finally see what happened street-level in Raccoon City but it's not enough, would love to see an expanded city level with more content
- Puzzles are an absolute joke; baby level complexity. While i'm not here for the puzzles, it wouldn't hurt to add some challenge to them
- Cut content; Where's the Grave Digger bossfight? Spiders? Freeze rounds? Where's the Clocktower level? Park? City Hall? Dead Factory? Why is the last level replaced with goddamn lab level again?
- No Live-selection or branching paths
- No Mercenaries mode
- No costumes varieties 
- Nemesis is scripted and so tame compared to Mr.X
- Scripted linear segments disrupting the pacing; going back and forth between Jill and Carlos feels disjointed
- Dismemberment is worst in this game, the gore noticeably dialed back from RE2 Remake
- Copy and pasted enemies from RE2 Remake like the paleheads
- The 2 boss fights where nemesis runs in circles are exactly the same 
- Reeks of rushed development in order to get the game out early; obvious cash grab
- They tried adding a multiplayer mode in a RE singleplayer game that was dead on arrival. So dead to the point they even split the installation in case you don't want it; Nobody asked for a Dead by Daylight clone, go remake Outbreak Files or some shit as standalone 
- Replayability is reduced to difficulty runs, not to mention you can buy dlc and skip all the challenges to unlock the rewards you would get by playing regularly
- Too much ammo variations for the Grenade Launcher, you're gonna die swapping ammo types because the reload animation always loads the full magazine instead of the actual number of missing ammo

Overall 5/10.

Honest judgement? Kind of disappointed by the effort Capcom put in. It’s a watered down, flawed, but fun third-person shooter that’s devoid of all elements which made the original RE3 game and new remakes great to begin with. Whether or not you’re a casual or hardcore fan, definitely not worth the full price tag, so always get it on sale.",1606885970,1695936588,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Good thing is its so easy you don't die much. Even the boss fights are pretty lame, shoot them a few times with your best weapon and wait for the cutscene to finish it for you.

The combat for the most part is very good, the dodge mechanic is a welcome addition to the game, it was something that everyone who did runs for RE2R would have liked, the weapons in the game are a lot more useful than before, unlike RE2R now the shotgun isn't practically useless for everything other than zombies, and the harder difficulties don't put you in a situation where certain enemies become mandatory skips due to low damage (Lickers), the only real problem in the games combat being the stunlocks in the final Nemesis fight on Inferno. With combat out of the way, RE3 loses a lot of the charm from the original! Jill's personality has a series of changes which may or may not put people off (mainly she seems a bit arrogant at points) and the treatment of Nemesis is very lackluster (unlike what we got with Mr X, NEMESIS is completely scripted, outside of boss battles, he'll show up during 4 moments while free roaming downtown, other than that he's absent from the rest of the game), entire sections of the game where completely removed and the 3rd Nemesis fight is just a repeat of the second one but this time with Zombies added into the mix. The game also has a few problems including a problem with HDR that messes up your colors and a glitch that can cause your game to crash while entering the STARS Office with Carlos (if you are doing a non competitive speedrun save at the beginning of the RPD) and in true REngine fashion the game has very lackluster RT implementation and due to the forced TAA it's not a good idea to use FSR (or even DLSS if you do happen to install the DLSS mod). I'm having a blast with this game because I've been an RE fan since I was a kid, with that being said, if you are adamant that you want a full on perfect reenactment of the original game, I'm sorry but this game isn't for you, furthermore, if you want to get a good value out of this game, wait for a sale to buy it, because it's very short, even if you do want to replay it. I did my first run in 3h40 mins, the rest of my playtime has either been farming kills for records, or replaying the game on different difficulties.

People argue: The original Resident Evil 3 was short.

My counter argument: And Capcom couldn't utilize some creativity and effort to expand upon, rewrite and create new content for RE3R like they did with all the games listed above??? 

It's a weak, piss-poor argument to say RE3 OG was short. Resident Evil 3 Remake was half-assed. Some segments are a pure COPY AND PASTE from RE2R, with a new ""face lift."" aka, texturing. 

The game, when I played it on Playstation, was beaten in 3 hours FIRST TRY. Little to none replay value, imo. They not only made this game short and half-assed, they also cut content from the original. Goodbye Clock Tower. Nemesis is a joke. 

The thing that makes RE3R so frustrating is that you can SEE ALL THE POTENTIAL -- the foundations for an AMAZING game were there. And Capcom failed to care to actually deliver. Un-fucking-fortunate. As RE3R with some soul and passion in the development would've been a fucking banger.

I played a demo of this with my friends growing up and Nemesis scared the every-loving crap out of us. I have always wanted to play through this story and while I have still never played the original fully, I thoroughly enjoyed this remake. I know it has been divisive with the cuts they made, but someone summed it up pretty well. They removed elements that were not directly related to our protagonists story and slowed down the pace of the action. This feels like an action game first. I still enjoyed the breaks you got in between encounters and the puzzles, but shorter more focused story was pretty nice. We got even more enemy variety this time and the ability to dodge was really handy (while not always effective ... lol). Nemesis still scared the pants off me when he would barge in like the Kool-Aid man, and I enjoyed the hell out of running from him. Combat mechanics felt a bit more enhanced with being able to use the environment to your advantage (generators and flammable barrels). There were also several combat set pieces that were kind of puzzle-like that you had to figure out, and added to the variety which I enjoyed. You mainly play through this as Jill Valentine but switch over to Carlos (an Umbrella combat specialist) several times as well. Seeing things from both perspectives at different times in the story was pretty nice, and added to the overall experience in my opinion.

I played entirely on Steam Deck and it played flawlessly. I had it set to high/medium mix graphics, and locked it to 40fps and 40hz refresh rate. It took me a little under 8.5 hours to complete.

Overall, a solid entry in the franchise and definitely one I enjoyed. Highly recommend if you haven't played, just know it is more action focused.",1695822027,1695822027,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

952060,147047689,76561198000405554,0,4,919,0,919,1586309422,"TL;DR This is a good game in a vacuum. Mechanically it's pretty good. The music is good, the atmosphere is good, the monsters are memorable. But as a *remake*, and a sequel to the RE2 Remake, it is very, very disappointing. But only in that respect. So if you want a remake of an original, this performs poorly. If you just want an isolated sequel to RE2R, then it's pretty good. What follows will go in depth about this opinion.

This game is conflicted in what it wants to be. It felt like it was being designed by two different teams at the same time; one that was committed to being a loving tribute to the original RE3, and one that didn't care.
On the one hand, you have the music; modern, atmospheric, bringing back the original RE3 score and perfecting it in one of the most lovingly nostalgic tributes to an OST I can remember hearing in a game. You have the atmosphere; dark, oppressive, bleak. The city is dying, death and despair are consuming it, and it FEELS like it. The environments are grimy, bloody, smashed, burning and crumbling. It sells the setting perfectly. It feels like a wonderful modernisation of the sights of RE3. It absorbs you into it. It looks convincing.

On the other hand, you have the plotline. It seems to rush through the story without letting any particular segment of it *breathe*. Like a tour guide leading you through a museum at a jog rather than walking through slowly, teling you the history and answering your questions.
You have the removal of whole segments from the original. The Police Station which should have been Jill's first stop, is never visited by her, and instead is a short detour for Carlos. The park is completely missing. The Clock Tower has been turned into a distant background landmark you may miss entirely if you're focused on your immediate surroundings and the boss fight that takes up most of the time it's visible. In the original it was an entirely separate location you had to explore. There were plot points tied to it; an escape route. It was a refuge, and a character-switch point.
Then you have the main antagonist, Nemesis. Arguably one of the most powerful and dangerous of Umbrella's various Tyrants. The original Pursuer of the franchise. He's been downgraded from a semi-persistent threat that pursues you from location to location to 3 brief encounters in the first 25% of the game and 3 setpiece boss fights for the rest of it. This is especially noticeable after RE2R's Mr. X and his stellar reimagining as a persistent pursuer; the role that should have been Nemesis's hallmark.
There's also the removal of the branching decision and diverging plotline system; a feature that introduced a lot of replayability in the original. As a result the game can be experienced in its entirety in one playthrough. The lazy difficulty system offers none of that replayability, as it can basically be summarised as ""everything is faster and hits harder"".

And then there's RE: Resistance, which is an online multiplayer subgame that was packaged alongside it, and which inherently has a low and dwindling playerbase which will eventually render it worthless. The development time for this would have been much better spent focusing on the main game itself and making sure it was as expansive and well polished as it really should have been.

It all just feels discordant. Like Capcom considered this game an afterthought while they worked on RE8. And it's a shame. Because the RE-Engine and the formula they achieved with the RE2 Remake could have made this game timeless.

I am giving this game a thumbs down because I imagine a lot of people coming to this game will be fans of the franchise itself, as opposed to new players coming to experience Resident Evil with no prior experience. On that basis, this game doesn't live up to its predecessors, neither RE2R, nor the original RE3. But if you just want to experience an RE game in the vein of RE2R and have no knowledge of the original, then this is a good game to play.",1695714268,1695714268,False,65,1,0.812378168106079102,1,True,False,False

Since 2017, CAPCOM has released:

- RE7 Biohazard
- RE8 Village
- RE2 Remake
- RE3 Remake
- RE4 Remake
- Many DLCs to go along with each, to include some story DLCs (RE4 Separate Ways, etc.)

Of all of the above listed, this is my least favorite, but solely for the slight downgrades in:

- Model Physics 
- Environment
- Lighting
- Shadow Quality
- Action Effects
- Sound Design

All of those that were listed above were drastically downgraded from the RE2 remake that released prior to this game. I feel that this game was rushed, as between RE2 and RE4 this is the only game where these downgrades are the most noticeable. With all of the downgrades, this remake does seem to capture the same gameplay and photo-realistic character models that RE2 remake had. Watch a comparison video to fully understand the difference. 

Above all, I feel that this game lacks conviction. A lot of missions were overlooked from the original RE3. I have 3.5 hours in this game. It took me less than a day to complete the entire game on Inferno, the hardest difficulty. Whereas it took me 10.5 hours to complete the first run of the RE2 on Hardcore, and I've just started the 2nd run on Professional. For the RE4 remake, same thing. 19 hours on my first playthrough in Hardcore, and I've just started a second playthrough on Professional. This is not even including any gameplay in the extra survivors mode in RE2 or the Mercenaries and story DLC in RE4. RE3 has no extra game modes. Although you do get some cool buffs after the first completionm, RE3 lacks the repeatability of the RE2 and RE4 remake because the game is so short and does not have multiple character story lines.

As the game opens it establishes a fairly interesting backstory for the protagonist, however that backstory becomes largely irrelevant as the plot just becomes: there's zombies, don't die. That's basically the story of this game. There are zombies. Do not die. In five hours the game fails to construct any kind of more interesting overarching narrative than that nor does it really fill the survival struggle with any kind of engaging character interactions; besides Carlos aggressively flirting with Jill right to start. Which is just creepy and off-putting.

The combat is similar to that of the previous game to an extent, fairly rudimentary shooting with little gameplay variety. In an attempt to make the combat more interesting since it's being recycled into another game; the developers added a dodge feature. Except it's not really a dodge feature it's more of a quick-time-event disguised as a reactive dodge. While playing as Jill players can press the dodge button to stumble rapidly in a direction to avoid attacks. However this dodge has no invulnerability frames and thus often fails to actually protect players from harm. To trigger the real dodge, which has invulnerability frames, players need to press the dodge button right before an attack reaches them. Except this mechanic isn't explained to the player at all; which makes the game a frustrating mess until it is learned.

Many enemies in the game will ram themselves into the player's face then trigger an attack, forcing the player to perform their quick-time-event dodge just to avoid it. Until the player realizes how this works they are potentially doomed to take damage over and over because they don't understand their primary method of avoiding harm. Even when learning how the mechanic works, players must still learn the timing on each individual enemy attack to be able to utilize the dodge fully. This perpetual system of trial and error creates a spectrum of extremes where the player either cannot dodge attacks at all because they do not know the timing, or cannot get hit at all because they now know the timing and thus can consistently dodge.

There's also no stun-lock protection in this game, so players can straight up just get stun-locked into a game over by certain enemies or groups of enemies. Enemies may randomly attack twice in a row when a dozen other times they only attacked once, or have artificially accurate tracking on their attacks, or have attacks with basically no telegraph that are consequently impossible to dodge at close range in a game that is constantly about fighting in close quarters. The game hides enemies around corners, or has them approach from out of sight on multiple occasions to ambush the player and lock them into an unfair grapple. Unlike the previous game there's no way to counter grapples, players just have to mash a button to force the enemy off them. Except even if players press the button extremely fast they still take damage anyways, which makes the whole mechanic of being forced to mash the button at all feel pointless. 

Players are also constantly forced to stop and repeatedly stab every zombie they knock down, to check if the zombie is actually dead or not while also conserving ammunition. Resulting in a decent chunk of the gameplay becoming consumed by the player rapidly spamming their knife attack on most enemies at least once or twice to avoid future danger.

In general the combat in this game is very punishing yet so clumsy, cramped and cluttered that the game mostly ends up punishing players for its own mechanical shortcomings. Playing on the easier difficulties may reduce the impact of these unfortunate moments but they still occur all the same, and playing on the harder difficulty actively makes these situations a defining aspect of the gameplay experience.

Another baffling design choice was adding a weapon into the game that is borderline necessary for at least one boss fight, but carrying that weapon is completely optional and thus the player may end up in that boss fight without it. Yet if players do bring this weapon they can amass enough ammunition to basically stun-lock certain bosses and trivialize the fight. The also game has multiple moments where it transitions from cutscene to gameplay abruptly with no warning at all yet punishes players with an immediate game over if they don't react instantly. Multiple achievements in the game even spoil upcoming plot elements.

Not only does this game include multiple maps that are reminiscent of those from the previous game, which makes the atmosphere feel stale, but it also has players outright return to one that was in the previous game.


Repetitive and terribly balanced combat with an emphasis on meaningless quick-time-events that overshadow the already skimpy shooter combat system. Strung together by a monotonous, empty story with little to no intrigue or depth. All of which takes place in very same looking generic environments, at least one of which is directly ripped from the previous game under the guise of this story taking place at approximately the same time. Which doesn't even make sense as the environments are slightly changed from the previous game in ways that canonically do not coincide with the fact that this is supposedly happening at around the same time.

This game doesn't even manage to just be a bland repetition of the previous game, as the combat system has now been skewed around jumping through quick-time-event hoops yet this core mechanic is not explained to the player nor does it properly work some of the time. And even when it does work; it's just boring. Now the sensation of blandness has transformed into the feeling that this is just a really overpriced and badly balanced DLC campaign for the previous game.",1639990345,1695581474,False,25,4,0.603314518928527832,0,True,False,False

The opening city segment is great. Not better than the original, but still great. But once you get to the end of it (which happens way too quickly with how short this game is), the game starts to fall apart. I know I'm kicking a dead horse at this point, but Nemesis is a complete joke in this game. Instead of being a tank that hunts you down and requires a full arsenal to down, he's a little scripted bitch with a goofy fucked up nose that can be downed with one grenade. On top of that, most of the rewards he gives you are useless, compared to the super powerful magnum and shotgun parts, as well as an item that can carry three first aid sprays at once in the original. They even turn him into a dog halfway through the game. In the original he'd slowly mutate more and more throughout the game to the point where he's unrecognizable, growing tentacles and larger veins, and then just becoming a pile of mush at the end. In this Remake he only transforms twice, and neither design does a good job at showing how the mutation works. They already perfected it with Birkin in RE2 OG and Remake. That also reminds me that they already had the perfect Nemesis in RE2 Remake as well, that being Mr. X.

Almost every location in this game is either boring, or completely gone from the original. Like I said, the City segment is really great at first. I love the 90's look everything has. But then you get to the power station, which introduces one of the most annoying enemies in the series (the Drain Deimos), and then you have your first real encounter with Nemesis, where you learn that he's scripted, easily taken out and easily manipulated. After that you get a boring sewer section with one type of enemy that requires zero brain power to kill, two more scripted Nemesis sections, and the first Carlos section. It was nice getting some more Carlos bits compared to the original, and the RPD section as Carlos in the Remake is alright, but it was way cooler going through it as Jill in the original. Jill had prior history there, so it felt much more interesting going through the place a second time as her (depending on if you played RE2 beforehand), and because she was the one going through it, Nemesis shows up and chases you, which is very startling on a first playthrough. You then take back control over Jill, and get to the most disappointing part of the game. The Clock Tower.

The Clock Tower is now a background set piece for the first Nemesis Dog boss fight, which drags on for way too long, or even longer if you don't bring the grenade launcher (which the game expects you to randomly do on a first playthrough). The Clock Tower was one of the best parts of the original, and now it's just in the background of a boring boss fight. On top of that, they also cut out the Park area from the original, which is less talked about, but is still a great area with a great boss fight that was ALSO cut out.

Luckily, after this disappointment of an area, we get to the best part of the game, which is the Hospital section. The Hospital section is the only part of the game that I'd say is better than the original. It has a very good horror atmosphere that isn't found in the original, and it's really fun exploring while looking for resources and items that'll get you into locked rooms. It does introduce another one of the most annoying enemies in the game (this game's version of the Hunters), but I think everything else in this section is good enough to make up for it. The defense section at the end of Carlos's part is pretty weak, but afterwards you get to backtrack through the Hospital as Jill to find some more resources that were locked off from Carlos and a new weapon, which was also pretty fun. But, just like every section in this game, the Hospital section goes by way too fast, and you'll be jumping straight back into mediocrity with the final section of the game.

The Laboratory as a location isn't bad, but when it's the final area in a series for the third time in a row, it's pretty repetitive. And what makes it even worse is that the original already knew that and made a brand new location called the Dead Factory that, as you can guess, was a Factory instead of a Laboratory, and was really fun to explore. Capcom literally went out of their way to replace a brand new location in the series with a location that we already had in RE1 and RE2 Remake, as well as Original RE1 and RE2.

Even when you just look at it as a game in general instead of a Remake specifically, it's mediocre. 6 hours is way to short for a $40 dollar game. I see a lot of people argue that the Original is also short, but the original was made in 1999, it's gonna have it's limitations, and even with the limitations, it still managed to be two hours longer than this Remake. There's literally no excuse for a game in 2020 to be $40 for 6 hours of gameplay, which is the length of a first playthrough, might I add. I've already mentioned how aside from most of the city section and the Hospital section that every location is boring to go through and why they're boring to go through, and I've also already mentioned how annoying the Drain Deimos and Hunters are. I haven't, however, mentioned how shitty the dodge mechanic is in this game. The timing on it is really odd and it only ever works 20% of the time. People also like to defend the dodge by saying it sucked in the original, which it definitely did, but just like the length of the game, the original was made in 1999. This Remake was made in 2020. They had 21 years to fix this dodge, and they failed. On top of that, at least you didn't have to use the dodge in the original. In the Remake, there are multiple points where you'll take unavoidable damage if you don't use the dodge, and on the hardest difficulty (something I did on console), you're required to use the dodge during the final boss, or you'll be caught in a stun lock and will pretty much be insta-killed.

I'll say this though. I'm glad that newcomers to the series or people who just don't have access to older consoles have some type of way to experience this game.

Doesn't stop it from being a shitty Remake and a mediocre game though.

Resident Evil 3 was pretty fun and looks amazing, it runs off of RE Engine and everything feels good when playing. I have never played the original RE3 so I can't really tell you how much is missing but I do know a lot of people talk about it cutting a lot from the original, so if you played that then maybe you won't like this game but who knows, still give it a try. However I do not think you should purchase it at it's current price of $39.99. The game itself is extremely short and not worth the price tag they slapped over it. You can beat this game in under 4 hours and 100% it in under 10, with that and the fact that they don't have anything like Mercenaries mode to keep you playing after you've finished it, I can't recommend you paying anything over [b]$10[/b] for it. If you catch it on a sale then I recommend you give it a shot but don't waste your hard earned money on this when for $20 more you can just get RE4 Remake which has may more content for your money paid.

If you have your""Resident Evil Bingo"" card handy, you can mark off the following squares:

MC learns about the zombie outbreak at the beginning of the game

MC starts with pistol, then later gets shotgun and grenade launcher.

MC needs to find a thing to put in a thing to open another thing to get a different thing to help find the MacGuffin that the whole game's plot hinges around.

MC fights ""different forms of mutations"" besides ""regular zombies"" that take more bullets than usual.

Shooting a zombie 5 times in the partially-decayed skull of a zombie is not necessarily a guarantee that the integrity of said skull will be affected by the bullets or even slow the momentum of a zombie.

""Tap button really fast when a zombie grabs you"" (if you're bored, since this literally does nothing, regardless of how ""successful"" you were)

Using explosions as jump scares

Using explosions as plot devices

Using explosions enough times to get the MC out of a scene at rates that would make Michael Bay blush.

MC survives multiple high falls and blast impacts that would dent a building while wearing a tank top and jeans.

MC fights big mutant thing, then bigger mutant thing, then ""super duper big"" mutant thing that could be seen from space

""Oh my god! How is this thing still not dead?  I am utterly perplexed!"" final boss fight.

I mean... it's ""fun"", don't get me wrong... it's just also... all of the above as well.

If we compare both - this is not a remake, it is just a trailer for original. Yes, it has good graphics, animations and other shenanigans, but at the same time compared to original - It is very short, characters simplified, gameplay simplified  and pretty straightforward, replayability is almost none, no diversion of choices, some parts of the map where simply ripped off. They even removed ""The Mercenaries: Operation Mad Jackal"" missions, where you play as Michail, Carlos and Nicholai.

The story of RE3 takes place in Raccoon City, roughly at the same time as the events that transpired in RE2. You are Jill Valentine, a member of Raccoon City elite police force unit called S.T.A.R.S. As in every survival horror game, your main goal is to survive. The city is totally overrun by zombies, plus there's a seemingly invincible super-zombie (Nemesis) that's jumping out of every bush trying to kill you.
Resident Evil 3 is a lot more action-oriented than its predecessor. Jill has the ability to dodge attacks by rolling to the side, which is extremely useful (especially in boss fights). Zombies and other monstrosities are plentiful, but so are the healing items and ammo. There is more than enough ammunition to pulverize every single enemy you encounter, whilst in RE2 I was counting bullets and struggling at every corner (I played both on 'standard' difficulty). Also, almost all puzzles were cut from the original game, along with fair bits of story that came with them. You can easily complete the campaign in about 5-6 hours without skipping anything, which is terribly little. Considering there are no bonus game modes, I'm left wondering why didn't Capcom include more content instead of cutting a large portion of the original game?
In terms of presentation, RE3 is the same as its predecessor - which is good. Everything looks crisp and realistic, and sound effects are on-par with graphics. The game is pretty fun to play, since you're loaded like Rambo and there are tons of zombies to kill. The atmosphere is still creepy, but lacks that distinct survival-horror touch (probably because you have 10+ healing items in stash, along with bombs, grenade launcher and whatnot).
In my opinion, turning this remake into a brainless shooter was a poor decision by Capcom. It's still a pretty fun game and I'd recommend it, but it could have been so much more.

This game could have been great and just as good as the previous entry but they decided to rush this one out before the new/next generation of consoles come out. This honestly couldn't just be dlc because it's actually INFERIOR in some aspects. The RE engine is already showing it's limitations. The graphics are really good and there are glimpses of how good it could have been but it falls short in nearly every aspect.
-Texture pop in is HORRIBLE in some areas.
-Enemies have static ""death"" poses.  
-Dismemberment is nerffed.
-Animations where taken from the previous title.
-A LOT was taken from the previous title. Assets, menus, sounds ect
-Changed a main characters emotional make up. Being a ""chicken"" to a hero. 
-A couple boss fights where way too similar.
-ADDED a sewer level.
-Took out the decision system thus destroying most replayability from the original.
-It is too short, I CRAWLED through it looking through nooks and crannies. My final time 7:20
They also just cut out way too much. Imagine cutting out Re2's last quarter and replaced it with generic bs. I could go on and on but this game has very little soul. I refrain from saying no soul because I can see some places have awesome easter eggs and it feels like some were made with love. Someone coming in wanting to shoot zombies, it'll do just fine. It didn't do anything to push this genre forward and it was almost insulting at times to fans of the original. There's a fine line between paying homage and doing a checklist for quick cash. For being rushed and a copy pasted rehash of the last entry(AND doing it worse), this game should be a 5/10.

You can say it's often a ""hold W simulator"" but I think the level design team did a really great job here within their constraints of scope. It had to be super lean due to time/budget due to someone higher up not providing the support this game NEEDED but for something this compact, they did really well with polishing it. It's especially evident in the later playthroughs when they move and replace the enemies in surprising ways.

Another criticism I see is that ""Nemesis hardly exists in this remake"" and I don't agree with that. There are only a few times that he will pursue you on foot but it's nothing like Mr.X from 2 who you can outrun. You have got to think quick and start learning how to dodge if you want to survive an encounter with this tyrant since he moves way faster than you. Sure there are some ways to ""cheese"" him but the same could be said about (i think) every other RE boss as well.

I don't know how the UI managed to get worse than in RE2 though and some of the visuals just don't jive as well as they do in the predecessor. Maybe I just need a computer that can run max graphics on everything in order to get the effects right but things like zombies being more then 20 meters away will move at something like 1/4 normal frame rate and it's odd-looking. Also for the longest time the game would crash between the first transition to playing as Carlos which meant I couldn't even play INFERNO mode. I reinstalled and repaired all the files multiple times but it was no good. Fortunately though after this last update, I tried once more and it finally worked so I was able to wrap up my experience.

The remake inspired me to play the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, but in turn made me realize how uninspired the R3make is. In terms of character control, graphical fidelity, and the writing/character development in cut scenes, the R3make makes obvious upgrades over the original. Jill controls wonderfully making combat fluid and dynamic. In cut scenes, Jill and the rest of the cast feel well written and fully realized with some of the most human-like facial animation I have seen. The RE engine renders Racoon City in gorgeous detail but this ties into where the game faulters. Where RE2R went all in on the Racoon City Police Department, sewers, and labs, R3make level design and scope pales in comparison to the original. Racoon City streets are significantly underdeveloped, the sewers and labs feel copy pasted from RE2R, and the infamous clock tower is somehow absent. The hospital level in R3make is the only noticeable improvement, but even that is hampered by a wave defense segment that feels out of touch with the rest of the game. Taking R3make on its own for what it is, the game delivers a very fun and action heavy Resident Evil experience. However, it fundamentally fails as a remake and makes one wish what could have been.

I played the classic trilogy countless times and all the newer games as well. The original Resident Evil 3 was one of my favorite games, having Nemesis chase you room to room with his rocket launcher, the dodging and decision making, the music, the characters, the atmosphere it was all great. This remake is very short and honestly not as good as the Resident Evil 2 remake, I got it originally for Xbox and played through it and was mostly underwhelmed and disappointed. I bought it again on PC to try and this playthrough was a lot more fun, I can appreciate more of the work they did this time around with the environments, the music, the voice acting and facial animations, the zombie movement and attacks, its like a roller coaster ride start to finish. It is definitely a good time to play this game. But if you are a veteran of the classic RE3 then there will probably be some glaring spots that annoy you that were left out or not fleshed out, the worst offender is Nemesis himself. In the first major area they have Nemesis like he was in the original RE3 chasing your buns around like you owe him money, but it falls off after that to a more streamlined action track. It is not bad it is just different, I wish there was a long directors cut that put more of the original games design to this remake, like a lot of the city, and giant worm boss and the clocktower, also the helicopter fight would be cool to see in this engine.

It's what I would call a ""rollercoaster ride"" game a la Half-Life 2, Dead Space 2 or even RE4. The game is short and linear but incredibly well paced and keeps pushing you forward to the next set piece. If you want a great action game that is horror themed this is for you. If you want a more subtle, atmospheric survival horror game a la RE2 Remake, Dead Space 1 etc. then keep walking buster, because this ain't it.

It borrows a lot of its mechanics, assets and general feel from RE2R, which is why I think a lot of people were disappointed, because gone is the slow exploration and gradual build up of threat and player power level from that game, and there are a lot of things that feel... slightly off compared to that game. No counter moves - they REALLY want you to use the new dodge instead, with boss fights that blatantly expect you to have practiced it. No sub-weapons - your grenades, flashes and now-unbreakable knife are equipped like guns instead. Locations, characters and enemies from RE2R show up willy-nilly and vanish again just as quickly, seemingly as a truly bizarre example of nostalgia baiting for a game that was then only a year old.

It's almost like the uncanny valley version of RE2R - or, more likely, it was just faster, easier and cheaper to recycle a bunch of assets from a previous game to push out a new one. People say this game feels like it should have been DLC, and they're not wrong at all tbh. Slightly ironic - the OG RE3 was originally just going to be a spin-off with a different feel and gameplay loop to RE1 and RE2, but it ended up becoming part of the main series. The remake was always supposed to be part of the ""new"" canon and was designed to be similar to a previous game, but ended up feeling like a spin-off. Whacky.

Anyway it's fun, buy it on sale, you can beat the campaign in 6 hours on standard and even if you want to 100% achievements it won't take you super long, which is both a plus and a minus. Either way it takes its place as part of the wild and wonderful ongoing story of Resident Evil and the series' ups and downs.",1693339582,1693339582,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

To sum up my feelings: more of RE2 remake, with more action and less content with a rushed story.

It's clear this was built on the bones of RE2's remake, which isn't inherently a bad thing, but it's noticeable they reused assets and even a portion of the game. It's quite short too, with my blind first playthrough took right around 4 hours according to the game. By it's own rankings it's S rank for highest difficulty is under 2 hours. personally I'd prefer a short good game to the overly padded mediocre games that come out these days but this just felt rushed by all accounts. The story in particular suffers where there is a mere handful of character interactions.

It's unfortunate this game didn't get to cook long enough to really hold up like 3 and 4 remakes. The shitty PvP mode is probably partially to blame but who knows.

It lacks alternative campaigns and game modes (challenges). One location has been carbon copied directly from the previous installment. There’s fewer guns, and equipment (e.g. blue herbs disappeared). Hardly any puzzles are featured; the ones that do appear are very trivial. There’s also a number of cinematics with QTEs which I didn’t like. 

The player character (Jill) strongly resembles the “Mary Sue” type of character—she survives impossible encounters without a scratch. Her personality is unlikable. She was better portrayed in the original Resident Evil.

I do however like the fact of new game +, and proximity mines, and all the different gun options, like finding the shotgun and a zombie is immediately around the corner to make you panic and use it effectively. But this game had 3 chances to get all 3 phases of nemesis right, and each time it failed. 
It seems Nemesises worst enemy in most cases.... is wood, bog standard doors, turning into an mutated dog, bulwark devices in NEST, and Guass Cannons. 
 
Despite the blaring issues with Nemesis? This is still a fun romp through the city for those who just want a callback to ol' times with brand new weapons.

Also, the remake is a lot shorter than the original RE3, but it's still a great title in the franchise!
It is a crazy exciting roller coaster ride that will keep you busy for a few hours.
But once you've completed the storyline, there's little reason to return to Raccoon City.
The multiplayer mode that the game has is a very welcome extra that will certainly keep you busy for a good number of hours.
Otherwise I managed to return with the VR mods that exist for the game and god was that an experience!

The game also works perfectly on a steam deck: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcOsviqfb4I

An average zombie is not a challenge for Jill (although it can still startle you at times) and the other enemies are also quite doable.
But the moments when you come face to face with Nemesis is really of a different caliber, and believe me, in VR this feeling increases tenfold.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35Nm8vb0F-o

The first time is already a crazy fight and the moments that follow only get better, because Nemesis learns more and more tricks and at the same time you also get a bigger weapon arsenal at your disposal and most importantly, he evolves and becomes really gigantic .
These are the moments that really put you on the edge of your seat.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdLn7p7dOgU

Although the game is a bit shorter than the original RE3, it is undoubtedly still exciting. It's just that in this game I quickly gained the confidence that Resident Evil 2 took a long time to get.
In other words, I never felt that the challenge was insurmountable for me.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHX8LIuvDX0

That's not to say the game didn't frighten me at times.
Early in the game, for example, a trip through a muddy nest in which something ungodly crawls literally made my forehead sweat, and I had THIS when I played the original RE3 on PSX.
Resident Evil also remains very good at teasing certain enemies before they actually throw themselves in front of your barrel. All pluses without equal.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeN-clVWfz8

Like the original, Resident Evil 3 Remake is more of an action game with horror elements than the other way around.
The pace is fast and you rarely have time to catch your breath. It also doesn't take long before you can fight back properly.
Despite the emphasis on action, the classic Resident Evil feel remains, thanks in part to your limited inventory and an emphasis on finding the right key items. In contrast to other action-packed parts such as Resident Evil 5 and 6, the balance is razor-sharp and there is still enough left to shudder. Think, for example, of a section full of spiders that shove their eggs down your throat in a nasty way.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LH09yYq8X8

The game does not let you go through all these moments. Although the campaign lasts between 4 and 7 hours, you will not be bored for a single second, because there is always variation in terms of environments, weapons and monsters that you will have to battle.
One monster that yours truly has stuck with is the Hunter Gamma.
It is a real monster that resembles a hybrid of a shark and a frog and walks on two legs. These beasts will bring the sweat to your brow.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kxX0gEKPFGE

In addition to the Hunter Gammas, there are many more types of monsters that all give you nightmares. Fortunately, this game plays just as smoothly in terms of controls as the Resident Evil 2 remake.
Shooting feels nice and there are enough upgrades and new weapons in the world to make you feel a bit safer. Until you encounter the Nemesis again who killed yours truly within five seconds after the second encounter, because unlike Mr.X, that beast can run!

From what i've heard and seen, alot of thing were cut out from the source material, like a big clock tower segment and some other elements that made the original one so memorable. 

It sounds like a big letdown for the hardcore fans, but i'm here from a perspective to have never played any RE's before until just recently. I loved RE7, and when opportunity came like, a steam sale with both RE 2 and 3 remake bundled up, i wanted to try it out.

Now i have 100% the third one and i had a freaking blast (pun intended, if you know you know)

First of all this is one of the greatest preformed games i've ever played on this PC. With a 5700 xt graphics card and with ryzen 5 processor this runs at a smooth 144 fps in 1440p with some graphics tweaked, that still let the game have some of the best graphics ive seen in a while. Weapon and character handling is so smooth once you get used to the mechanics, so if you are into that stuff i highly highly recommend.

Gameplay and storywise: you play as Jill, getting chased by a mutant called ¨Nemesis¨, orderd to hunt down all of the S.T.A.R.S. members, a special task unit in Raccoon Police Unit. You need to survive in order to escape the city, and along the way you meet Carlos which you ocasionally switch over to. They have different weapons and dodge mechanics so some varations of characters are also involved here.

Nemesis is absolutley terrifying the first playthroughs you play this game. You can't really kill him and he has alot of HP, so running and dodgeing his very stressful attacks is something you gonna have to do. It is keeping you on edge, and it takes awhile to master to dodge his attacks, the higher difficulty you play.

It is a very short game after a few tries which is why i like the ¨speedrun¨ aspect to it aswell, with your run being timed and you get a grade for how fast you went. But that is definetly nothing important and first playthrough should always be enjoyed with no stress, cause in the end, Resident Evil games are best when it's about figuring out puzzles or how to kill an enemy.

With that in mind, while RE3 is great anyways, one critical thought is that is can feel a little... too ¨actiony¨ in this one that doesnt make it necessarily the ¨best¨ RE game of them all. Everythings very linear and straight forward once you get to know it all.

Regardless, RE3 gets a strong 7/10 from me.",1692572288,1692615032,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you liked RE2 Remake, you will enjoy this (while it lasts) it's more action orientated than the previous, much like the original RE3, the presentation is outstanding as usual and it's great to get out and explore a little more of Racoon City.

Nemesis (unlike the Tyrant from 2) doesn't have AI path-finding, general events are a little more scripted but this is likely due to the fact that Nemesis packs a much harder punch.

Fan favourite segments have been cut from the original RE3, and this game could have used them to bulk it out a little. I'm practically finished with my third play-through and have a total of 43 hours on record.

Tacked onto this is Resident Evil Resistance, I expect to validate the pricing, but it's not a fantastic experience and doesn't offer the same style of game-play.

* Graphics and voice acting are both good.
* Pacing is good, game is very short though so it's hard to get bored.
* Rather than having 2 separate play though for the 2 playable characters, you go back and forth while playing through the story. I like this approach compared to RE and RE2.
* It takes place around the time of RE2 (it seems just after) so it gives some nice context. 

The Bad:
* Very short. 8 - 9 hours of game play on a play through. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for this game.
* Being chased for most of the game by big unkillable bad guy is kind of annoying.

The only real issue I have with RE3 is the lack of content, if you are only interested in the single player (which applies to most people) then you are looking at essentially a 5 hour game which is a little disappointing.

I am not gonna write a detailed review, because this game simply does not worth the effort and time to do that.
To simply things, the game is short, does not really have any replayablily factor, there is nothing good or exceptional about it, full of this stupid interactiv cutscenes (for example: the cutscene start then in the middle you have control for 10 second then the cutscene continues, or press a button in the middle of the cutscene).

The original Resident Evil 3 on the PlayStation 1 was an amazing game and follow up to the original Resident Evil 2. Now as a remake it gives new spectacular graphics, visual effects and even little bit improves on the already good game engine of Resident Evil 2 which all bring the game's characters alive and offers a good game play experience as you play Jill Valentine in escaping the infested and doomed Raccoon City. The environments look very realistic and the atmosphere is one of death and decay. Staying alive and shooting your way through every single zombie and other mutant is more action packed this time with much more ammo available and with the ability to perform cool and effective dodge moves when compared to the Resident Evil 2 remake. Jill is strong as ever and well acted in this epic escape from the dead city. Other characters, including the enemies, are also well done and it's cool to see them appear in new, modern graphics and engine. 

The Nemesis is menacing but could be much more and when compared to the original Resident Evil 3 Nemesis this remake one is also deadly but appears less frequently and is not so scary and terrifying as the original. Gone are some whole areas from the original game and here this is one of the biggest drawbacks and minuses of this remake. Resident Evil 2 remake tried and succeeded to be very faithful in remaking the original in terms of areas, characters and story. To some degree it is true with Resident Evil 3 remake also, but it heavily lacks in terms of game environment length department. The city streets part is made much, much more shorter, the clock tower part is completely missing (though appearing only when when fighting Nemesis in one of his boss forms in front of it). Also Jill does not explore the Raccoon City Police Station at all. You do go there as Carlos, which is cool, but they could have made this part and other missing parts as in the original and we could have had a much longer and stronger game. The Mercenaries mini game is missing too and it's inclusion could have given an added boost for the game's overall replay value. 

Still the Resident Evil Remake 3 as it is gives the series fans and new players a good, albeit short, experience of Jill's last escape and upon completion it's good ending is satisfying. One can play the game through with the multiple difficulty levels which give an added challenge and increase it's replay value to some degree. The Resident Evil Resistance, which is a standalone game, but comes included and FREE when purchasing RE 3 Remake, is an interesting concept in itself that gives some additional good game play but again could have been done much, much better by having a longer single player section. It had the potential for being an excellent single player campaign with more story and AI driven allies for busting through the undead challenges together but for some reason it was left too much as a multiplayer focused game which seems to not have a lot of online players anymore. If you can find someone to play it with then some added fun is there.

Over and all I recommend this game for it's take on the story and for it's engine, visuals and game play. This game has it's minuses unfortunately by being short but what good it has with that one can still be happy. Best to buy it when it's on sale.",1691781431,1691781431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some Resident Evil boomers complain that it left some parts from the original (Clock tower and Racoon Park) and was too short. Is the RE 2 remake better? Yes.  Does this make the game anyless enjoyable or great? No! It's fantastic.

I would say that the negatives are that it is a bit short, lacks replay-ability and the dodging mechanism is awful. I couldn't care less about the Clock tower or the Grave Digger boss in the original, however, I think having the Racoon Park would have been the icing on top. Simply it would have been a visual delight with the park. Boomers can suck it, this is a new re-imagining of RE3, it doesn't have nor should it be faithful to the original.

Keep in mind the story is very similar and the original was usually done in 2 hours of playtime, these two criticisms are unfounded.

Replayed the original before replaying this and threw off those nostalgia glasses cause that game wasn't flawless like the RE community would make you think it was.

It's not a remake. It's a re-imagined game. I don't hate it at all but I wish there was more. 

The story, characters, and the beginning are better than the original's cookie cutter avatars. That intro up to the station was great. Jill is actually a fleshed out character with great voice acting. Carlos is likable and has some great lines. Nemesis is a hulking monstrosity.....too bad Nemesis couldn't hunt you the rest of the game like Mr. X....which is reversed from the OG's.

The Clocktower bit being cut was disappointing but the Boss fights were fun. More specifically the construction site and final NEST 2 fight (Replaces the factory but I like this better). I wish the Uptown section was open as well but hey...it's Capcom. 

I enjoy this game but it could've been great if they pushed out production and kept some more original parts (that were good.... not the stuff that should stay back in the early 2000's)

Sure there are the harder difficulties and extra content, but they aren't something special and worth grinding for. Gameplay is fine, the gore system somehow was worse than in Resident Evil 2 (which honestly baffles me still to this day), the characters are great; and here's the kicker..... Nemesis got ruined. Brutally even! He somehow became a side villian, was stupidly easy to kill and barely even a threat. Nicolay opted in to be the main antagonist of the game, which I found to be interesting, yet robbing of that status from Nemesis.

All and all, is this a bad game? Not necessarily, but it definitely was a big disappointment compared to Resident Evil Nemesis and Resident Evil 2 Remake. It's a good game, but a bad game if compared to Resident Evil 3 Nemesis.

Too much cut content..
No puzzles
I also beat the game in 3 hours my first playthrough even though I was taking my time, watching all cutscenes and reading all notes I found. (It was on normal which I'm going to assume most players will pick their first run.) 

the pacing was fine,  though Nemesis was hardly ever a threat.. you just run in a straight line get to your next destination and he's gone again ( I believe the original was like that too though.) I stockpiled my magnum ammo expecting to have a grandiose battle for his 3rd stage.. it wasn't the case it's basically handed to you.. 

 I loved the characters they were re-created pretty faithfully though Jill wasn't nearly as mature acting as she had been in the original game/games though this is probably a generation thing or a direction change for her character and I will let it slide it's nbd.

I ended the game with  over 100 handgun bullets,  40 grenade launcher rounds,  and 30 shotgun shells and I killed everything I saw for the most part so definitely play hardcore if you want a challenge, I still recommend it but only on a sale unless you're a hardcore resident evil fan like me and will probably beat this game 20 times mastering speedrun tactics and forcing challenges upon yourself for greater difficulty.

	[td] Content and Replay Value [/td]
	[td] RE3 Remake is such a short game that it has plenty of replay if you want to go back and finish it faster. The only replay value is to play the game again and complete challenges. Completing challenges rewards you currency to a shop that allows you to get upgrades that can makes runs faster. What its missing compared to its predecessor is the alternative game modes that put a spin on the normal gameplay and even gave extra exposition to other parties involved. [/td]

	[td] Should you get it?[/td]
	[td] Here’s one of my main issues with this game. After completing the game in 5.5hrs, I was in disbelief. I had to go back and see if this was a full price $60 game. It was. This game is beautiful. Not worth $60. Not even one of my favorite games ever (Hellblade Senua’s Sacrafice) was $60 at release and that game is a visual masterpiece and one of the best stories I had the pleasure to play through. I implore anyone wanting this game to only grab it on sale. Those wanting to complete their Resident Evil Remake collection go ahead, the capcom renaissance is real [/td]

[tr]
	[td] Overall Verdict [/td]
	[td] 7/10. RE3 did a great job of being a remake. Sadly I feel as though I understand the sentiment of this game being viewed as one of the weaker Resident Evil games. The story feels a little rushed and a way to cash in on success previous success. I clocked in my initial run at 5.5hrs which is great for the working adult! But this game is only worth it when on sale. [/td]

[b] Setting & Writing: [/b]
Resident Evil 3: Remake puts you in the shoes of Jill Valentine coming off the events of Resident Evil 1’s Spencer Mansion incident. Jill is determined to bring to light the events of the incident. Theres one issue though, her home of Raccoon City is in the process of being overrun by the T-Virus. Jills objective to escape the city in three days. Her plans get upended when she starts to get hunted by a bioweapon sent to kill the remaining members of the Spencer mansion incident. Throughout the game Jill tries to escape the city with the unlikely allies of the Umbrella Bioweapon Countermeasure Service (UBCS). The journey ends up divulging ulterior motives within the unit that make escaping the city that much more difficult. Jill Valentine’s only friend in the chaos is Carlos Oliveira who shares the same pure hearted goal of saving civilians and finding a cure to the T-virus before Umbrella Pharmaceuticals pull the unthinkable upon Raccoon City.

[b] Gameplay system & Bosses: [/b]
RE3: Remake takes the same gameplay approach as RE2: Remake with the updated 3rd person over the shoulder view. The inventory system and how it works is all similar as well. What’s new in this iteration is the inclusion of a dodge button. And boy will you become friends with this button. A well-timed dodge rewards you with a perfect dodge that gives Jill I-frames and a slight speed boost to continue to get out of dodge. Perfecting the timing of this mechanic is key to speed runners and saves your life. This dodge is also important because this version of Resident Evil leans more into the action aspect of things. Because of this more zombies and other enemies are thrown at you in mass. This makes using the dodge button more pertinent. The lean into action was mostly felt during the boss fights of this game. They’re huge set pieces that feel fun and exhilarating. My issue with them was that they lingered to long. Yes, my nerves were shaking a bit when I had to figure out how to down the boss. But when I found out it felt to long taking me out of the atmosphere of horror that Resident Evil tries to build

[b] Quest, Mini-games & Challenges: [/b] 
RE3: Remake is mostly a linear game with some instances of backtracking. The puzzles in this iteration seem light compared to its predecessor. There are no minigames that accompany the game outside of collecting in game bobbleheads. Challenges come in the form of completing the game and completing challenges within subsequent runs. Completing challenges award you with currency that allows you to purchase upgrades to make the next run easier. 

[b] Miscellaneous (art, music, etc.): [/b]
The game shines here via the magic that is the RE: Engine. This game engine is the backbone of Capcom’s renaissance. Everything here looks beautiful. I’m a big fan on how they redesigned Jill Valentine and would love seeing this version of her going forward. Something that I miss is the sound of silence. RE2: Remake did a good job of making you feel alone within the police station. This uneasiness created a haunted atmosphere that made it frightening to move forward at times. That felt missing in this game because the scares happened more often through cutscenes than it did standard gameplay.

It's obvious the producers of this game take a lot of pride in their work and the details, story telling, and engaging action make you feel like you're part of a different universe.  My only complain is that their is entirely too much breakout up the action when the game has to narrate everything for you.  Carlos and Jill's constant radio conversation interruptions, video sequences that keep breaking in and out of quick-time events and chases, and the lack creative ways of giving you a choice to discover the story for yourself were missing.  Also, I imagine a censorship decision to tone down the gore for the general audience, I miss the head popping and dismemberment of limbs when shooting at a Zombie. RE3 felt like I was shooting moving bags of potatoes.

Take the role of Jill Valentine, a member of the S.T.A.R.S. police unit whose life is abruptly turned upside down by the zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. There's something else that makes Jill's situation even worse though: a menacing creature popularly known as the Nemesis, whose sole purpose is to kill all remaining S.T.A.R.S. members at whatever cost. Jill will not only have to make her way through Raccoon City in an effort to find a way to synthesize a cure for the outbreak, but also to find a way to stop the Nemesis before it takes her out.

Compared to RE2's emphasis on survival horror, RE3 makes a bigger emphasis on action horror. I would most closely compare RE3's story and action to that of the original Terminator movie. While there's bits and pieces of horror sprinkled throughout, there's more focus on the unstoppable force hunting down our protagonist. Jill's ammo and resources aren't nearly as limited as Leon/Claire's were in RE2, meaning you have more opportunity to lay waste to any zombies in your path. You'll definitely need to though, because the zombies are just as resilient as before, but now there's some new types that may throw you for a loop. Frequent boss fights with the Nemesis will dump loads of ammo on you, but you'll need it because the Nemesis hits hard and hits *fast*, especially compared to RE2's Mr. X. It is intense, it is exciting, there's explosions and tension and a little bit of horror and it is a wild ride.

RE3 in my opinion isn't as fantastic of a game as RE2. Don't get me wrong, it's a stellar remake and once again a fantastic product from Capcom and the RE Engine, but there are some areas where it falls short. Speaking of, the game itself is really short. My hours at the time of this review consists of not one but *two* full playthroughs of the game, plus extra time spent exploring and modding the game for my second playthrough. It's about 40-50% shorter than RE2, which definitely caught me off-guard when I first finished RE3. RE3 is also pretty cheesy at times. The focus on action horror means you get a lot of moments where the action feels so over-the-top that it borders on the side of ridiculous. The secondary antagonist Nikolai is also pretty corny, especially in his voice-line delivery (I can't tell if it's a bad attempt at a Slavic accent or if the voice actor genuinely just sounds like that). The cheesiness of this game isn't necessarily all bad though, I think it definitely emphasizes the fact that this is an action horror game and makes it fit that 80s action movie stereotype better.

Overall, I'd definitely recommend checking out RE3. If you're coming from the RE2 remake, I'd lower your expectations a little bit, but it is still a very fun game that I would recommend picking up in the Raccoon City bundle on sale if you can.",1691183449,1691183449,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Compared to this year's RE4 and the 2019 RE2, this RE3 has obvious traces of shoddy production (I have not played the original version, so I will only compare it with the remade version)
1. Bullets
Capcom, are you having a mental problem? In the auxiliary mode of RE2, the number of bullets does not increase. When I synthesized bullets for the first time in this game, I was shocked. Can two gunpowder composite 30 submachinegun bullets? I think this makes RE3 completely a shooting game, and you don't have to worry about bullets like in RE2, which greatly reduces the sense of horror.
2. Zombies
I can understand the reason for using the same model as in RE2, but I am very angry about not being able to break limbs. If you don't break the limbs of a zombie, you will waste bullets hitting the head and have to use a dagger to ""autopsy"", which makes the game immediately troublesome. Similarly, this also makes the game more like a shooting game.
3. Nemesis T Type
I am not satisfied with Nemesis' performance. He only appears in fixed locations, and his sense of oppression is far less than the T-103 in RE2 (when I am playing RE2, I have to reason to guess which room T-103 is in). Of course, I am quite satisfied with the production team's modeling of his three stages, especially the third stage, which has a stronger sense of authority than G5.
4. Scenarios
  Rough and shoddy production. The original scene is only the hospital. The streets and police stations of Raccoon City were all directly captured from RE2, and the underground facilities of the hospital were filled with traces of the mother's nest. To cover up this fact, the underground facilities were also named Mother's Nest No. 2. Production team, you're really ""smart"".
  Overall, this game is a bit of a mess, and I suggest everyone buy it during the big sale like me. This way we won't lose money.

However, my first impression was disappointing. The game fails to evoke a sense of the past, lacking many memorable locations that I had hoped for.

Despite this setback, I still find the game enjoyable, especially due to its fantastic graphics. The visual elements are truly impressive and add to the overall experience.

As for the other aspects of the game:

    Graphics: Fantastic
    Sounds: Good
    Gameplay: Not up to par
    Horror: Frankly, lacking
    Story: It bears some resemblance to RE3 from 1999, which may appeal to fans of the original.

In conclusion, I recommend the game primarily for its stunning graphics, but I must admit that it falls short in other departments such as gameplay and horror elements. Nonetheless, it can still provide some fun and entertainment.",1585902931,1690640915,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplaywise I just wished that Jill would run a tiny bit faster, as it is quite bizarre to just slender around in a big boss fight. Furthermore I wished it would be possible to inspect more items and the surroundings in order to connect with the main character while she comments it.

⁉️I don’t understand why the “oldies” of the game series don’t like this game, you see, “It doesn’t look like it at all, and it was scarier in the original” ...
Lol dudes this is one of the best remakes ever!

🎮The gameplay is classic, everything is the same as in part 2 (we run away from the monster, killing zombies in parallel), but now we have to play for one of the most beautiful girls in the gaming industry.

📚The plot is intertwined with part 2 and takes place simultaneously with it. (So I advise you to play part 2 initially). The plot in short is very simple.

👎The only disadvantage of this game is that it takes 5-6 hours of slow and not hasty play. (Come on, the game has an achievement for completing the game in 2 hours).

I played this game until 100% completion, and I have to say it was really fun. It has great gameplay (not always), good music and of course, good graphics. 
I think the voice and motion capture actors did a good job, but the story is bland and a little forgettable. It feels more like a DLC of RE2 than a standalone title. It's a frustration as a remake and the criminal thing is how short the game is. 
I never played the original one, I've only seen videos of it and all, and even then I can say it's not a good remake. 
Nemesis has to be the worst part, because it makes you think it will be like Mr. X from RE2, or maybe something like the original version of the antagonist, but no. After a short while, it becomes a goofy and scripted character, that wants to be better than Mr. X and fails terribly.

Not nearly as good as the RE2 Remake or the Classic HD Remakes, Looks wise is good, runs good, its fun, sadly its too short its like 4 hrs long, you are supposed to replay several times to do challenges and unlocks, etc... but it really doesn't add enough for that, original RE3 had more replay value imo.

Value wise it feels very low, more like a DLC than a full game, if you really like RE you will enjoy it but i wouldn't play more than $20 for this, RE2 Remake had lot of more replay value with several characters and extra modes.

The boss is generally unable to one shot you, but most of his moves can stun-lock you. If you get hit once, the second hit will kill you and you are unable to dodge it. Also the final boss necessitates mastering the perfect dodge, which is barely important in the rest of the game.

There's a lot of cut content and most tellingly of all cutscenes count towards the completion timer (unlike in RE2), if you skip all the cutscenes on your first play through you won't get more than 5 hours playtime and there's only one campaign.

Frustratingly the VA, motion capture and cutscenes are all high quality, easily comparable to RE2 but the gameplay, downgrades, short play time and cut content massively let it down.

Developed by Capcom, this remake builds upon the legacy of the original Resident Evil 3: Nemesis while adding new elements to keep players on the edge of their seats.

One of the standout features of Resident Evil 3 Remake is its stunning graphics and attention to detail. The game's environments, characters, and creatures are beautifully rendered, immersing players in a post-apocalyptic Raccoon City. The dark and atmospheric setting perfectly complements the tense and terrifying game-play, creating an unforgettable horror experience. 

The game-play itself is fast-paced and action-packed, with a focus on survival and resource management. As protagonist Jill Valentine, players must navigate through the city while evading or battling hordes of monstrous creatures. The controls are smooth and responsive, allowing for precise aiming and quick reactions during intense combat scenarios. The addition of dodge mechanics adds an extra layer of strategy, making each encounter feel challenging and rewarding.

The story-line in Resident Evil 3 Remake is engaging and well-executed, effectively conveying the desperation and chaos of the outbreak. Jill's character development is particularly notable, as her determination and resilience are showcased throughout the game. However, some fans of the original may feel that certain story elements have been streamlined or omitted, which could be seen as a missed opportunity. 

Another highlight of the game is the inclusion of the asymmetrical multiplayer mode, Resident Evil Resistance. This mode pits a group of survivors against a player-controlled Mastermind, who sets traps, spawns enemies, and tries to eliminate the survivors. While it adds replay-ability and a fresh multiplayer experience, it may not be as captivating as the main campaign for some players. 

One minor drawback of Resident Evil 3 Remake is its relatively short length. The game can be completed in around six to eight hours, which may leave some players craving for more. However, the intense and action-packed nature of the game-play compensates for this to some extent.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a must-play for fans of the survival horror genre and the Resident Evil franchise. Its stunning graphics, intense game-play, and engaging story-line successfully capture the essence of the original game while introducing modern enhancements. Despite its shorter length and some streamlined story elements, this remake delivers a terrifying and thrilling experience that will keep players hooked from start to finish.",1689882404,1689882404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b] Bittersweet. A good game, but not what people expected... [/b]

Although heavily criticized by the series fanbase, RE3R is not a bad game, but it's not a good remake either. While the previous remakes changed some things here and there, they still remained faithful enough to the original games. That's not the case here, almost everything has changed. In fact, the only thing connecting this game to the original RE3 is the same ""cast"", the characters. Speaking of which, the removal of the mercenaries mode was a big mistake, not to mention the player's decisions during cutscenes and the unlockable outfits - at least mods can fix that. Despite its flaws, the game is still enjoyable but could have been much better.",1688472090,1689714623,True,2,0,0.374551206827163696,0,True,False,False

I appreciated that the story took a more systemic approach to analyzing the current conditions of Raccoon City. Even though the story was shorter than re 2 I appreciated its take on how individualized human greed destabilizes the integrity of institutions. Carlos and Jill are both fun characters and in a way feel a little more mature than Claire and Leon in re2 (though I love them both). However I will say that there is considerably less content than in re2 and while the reuse of multiple locations was really satisfying from a narrative perspective it contributed to this feeling of re3 being a DLC to re2. That being said the game was much better making these narrative choices it made me feel more invested in Jill and Carlos to see how they paved the way for Leon and Claire in re2. For the reason I recommend the be played in conjunction with re2 and should consider buying it on sale.

I noticed how enemies in this game seem to lack any audible footsteps, especially Nemesis. You would expect something as big and heavy as him, like Mr. X, to make a loud thudding when walking but he was as quite as a mouse; during chase scenes, I was caught off guard as he punched me. Thinking I had put a considerable amount of distance between us, no audio cues (in this case footsteps) could tell me he was right behind me. As for the argument of ""Just turn the camera around"", it's inconvenient when you have to look where you're going while being chased.
As I haven't finished the original game, I have no way of comparing the two. Aside from that, this was an enjoyable game with, not surprisingly, replayability to squeeze more hours out of the money you spent.",1689683199,1689683199,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

This one didn't have as many puzzles, but seemed to be more action oriented. I was happy to play as my favourite character Jill, so that lets me give the game a higher rating.

Overall I'd give this game a 9/10, it's not quite the masterpiece RE2 was, but it's still a top-notch quality title from Capcom. I don't regret buying this at all, I loved the game enough to buy all the DLC as well (I got the DLC and game on sale). I hope Capcom is working on a Code Veronica Remake, as that takes place after RE3 and we'd get to see what happens between 3 and 4.

I haven't played the original, but do agree that the Nemesis isn't as good as the Tyrant is. Having the Tyrant chase you through various gameplay sections added some great tension - and although he was a good threat, he didn't one-shot you (and you could outmaneuver him fairly easily). In contrast, the Nemesis is restricted to a few cinematics, 2 or 3  gameplay sections, and of course the boss fights.

its good, don't get me wrong. I highly highly recommend, it's just the 2 remake is much better and i prefer that one, either way. Play them both, they're really fun.

Why...does this game exist, I ask myself and you? For whom was it made? I've never had such an existential response to a triple-A title. I came-up with an answer but, read-on.

Was this like, Capcom testing out the new theatrical stuff for the RE-4-remake? Was it made by another, smaller team than the RE-2 remake? I don't know but, fun fact: this reviewer once predicted RE-4 would not get remade/remastered because it did not need one (it definitely deserved one) but hey, I love being wrong in the right way. Let's get after it. RE-3...time.

Did you know...the original Resident Evil 3...doesn't technically exist? I mean, uh, the original is *actually* called...RE3: Nemesis. This is not a remake/remaster, it's literally a 'retell' of that game's main plot and that is all it is. 

It does have the new RE engine obviously but, as far as 'new content,' there is none. But, I still enjoyed it enough to cheese tf outta nemesis and that dude really needed to get offed. TL;DR--buy it on sale for no more than 20$ but, only if you are one of the three types of individuals I came up with below the dashes because I DO NOT KNOW WHO THIS GAME IS FOR, STEAM-PEOPLE.

This will be my softest recommendation of...any game I've ever played on P.C., and, any Resident Evil game, somehow. So, before I review it quickly, this game is for...three types of people.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Type 1: you played the Resident Evil 2 Remake recently. This is effectively DLC for it and while the reused-assets aren't too on the nose, there is enough here to justify...a *10-20$* price-tag.

Type 2: you are either a long-time fan of the series*or*, like some, Resident Evil puzzles are not your jam and you want a stream-lined experience. I think some gamers might enjoy this game solely because: it's easy af, the gun-play is as tight as RE-village, and, it's not a horror-game. This game did not have any *actual* puzzles either, in my opinion...nothing optional or nearly as difficult as those spherical maze puzzles in RE-Village and as far as back-tracking, only two areas of the game actually have back-tracking also--the rest is linear. In that way though, I was able to beat this game in 2 sittings so, it's not worth full MSRP.

Type 3: *You want to play on the hardest difficulty right out the gate (you should, it's hard af)*. This one's me. I started on standard and found it insultingly easy. I got bit by zombies *five times* in a row and my health didn't even go to danger, just 'caution.' Then, I switched to HxC mode and boy, was it worth dying 40 times in one play-through. Here's a quick review of pros/cons but again, if you're not one of these people, this game is likely not for you. It's barely for me and I'm the one reviewing it!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are one of these people, read on but if not, honestly, play RE-2's remake first and if you need more content after the...other main story-character there, this one's got two more characters. 

Pros:
-Fantastic Gunplay
-Satisfying movement--the game has a perfect-dodge aspect that's entirely necessary on higher difficulties because when pulled off, time slows down and you lock on to an enemy's dome with whatever weapon you have out. Very bullet-time-y.
-Focused story/gorgeous graphics/the best looking character models in the RE series before the RE-4 remake
-Not a single frame-dropped, no glitches...and I'm running ultra-settings on a 240+hz monitor. 

Cons:
-Cut content: in re3-nemesis, for example, there used to be this feature where you could choose between two outcomes at multiple points in the story, frequently. This game has no choices except 'how hard' you want to play it at. Side note: if you play on HxC+, ffs, be sure to get the extended-mag for the glock...I literally only beat this game because I had...two glocks.
-HxC BS: at one point on Hardcore mode, I realized I was lacking the extended mag for the glock which made it impossible to progress. Usually on harder difficulties, while one needs all the weapons uh, let's just say I was not happy that Nemesis actually carries a gun-upgrade and you have to either throw a grenade or waste a ton of ammo to get it. 

-It's short, almost the shortest in the series/it is the shortest modern RE game. While I have 12 hours on record, according to the game, I beat it in a little over 10 hours/I did waste time re-doing the part to get the glock-mag/switched from standard to hardcore but, that's literally...a few days of very minimal gaming. Not worth $40.

Ultimately, if you think of this game as a DLC to RE-2, it is worth recommending to fans and only a specific few who are not.

Of all types of people I think would like this game that I list--honestly, it's people who dislike RE's heavy focus on back-tracking, puzzles, and horror. This is an action game and super linear: the hardest part for me was deciding what gun I was gonna kill Nemesis with. Yes, it was the glock.",1689103477,1689103608,True,12,0,0.661701560020446777,0,True,False,False

Of course there will be changes, that's why it's called a [u]REMAKE[/u] and not a [u]REMASTER[/u].
A remaster is an improvement in the visuals of a game without interfering with its other aspects. 
A remake is a redesign of a video game while retaining its key characters and story elements. 
A reboot is a new game with a fresh storyline, including some elements of the original game.

Just like RE2 Remake this is a solid 10/10 for me.

So far, you can see that this game was a full blown remake instead of a remake + maybe remove some of the cringe dated mechanics. Right off the bat you are faced with a situation where you are being chased by the BBEG and you have to run away from him in a long hallway while the camera is way behind you (and the BBEG). It is an incredibly old mechanic that isn't around anymore. It kind of kills the seriousness of the game for me.

I've seriously only done the intro to the game, and I intend on finishing it, but this game is seriously not RE2, don't go into it thinking that it is going to be just as amazing as RE2, it isn't.

Generally, I do appreciate the resident evil formula so it was not hard to like the game. But, compared to RE2R it definitely has flaws.

Nemesis: Considering I never play this genre, Mr. X from RE2R gave a terrifying and uncomfortable presence. Combined with the general quiteness, loud foodsteps from him and his slow methodical walk, it was well done. The counterpart for him in RE3 is insanely luckluster. His appearence is painfully scripted and tbh, considering scripted events like those are not in your control, it makes you feel safe instantly. He does have way more abilities than Mr. X, but they are used in such an awful way, it is disappointing.

Gameplay: The way you move, shoot, loot etc. is similar to RE2R, but with a few additions. Both characters have their unique dodge/parry ability, which I appreciate. They do feel clunky at times (especially Carlos), but maybe it is something that can come with practice. The bigger problem however is how the gameplay is structured. They are many, many scripted sequences where you either don't do anything, or just hold one button. It reminds me of those ridiculous CoD campaigns with their insane (in a bad way) action sequences where you also don't do anything. Boring is a nice way to describe it. Also the game is way more linear compared to its prequel. 

Story: Story-wise I obviously don't want to spoil. It is just rather unsatisfying to say the least.

Overall, if you liked RE2R, you probably will still enjoy RE3 probably. Similar mechanics, just worsely packaged.",1688684766,1688684766,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The encounters with Nemesis though more structured and limited are still every bit as tense and memorable. His indomitable nature keeps him a major threat that will sometimes force you to think on the fly. The story also sees some stripping down but also some great additions too. Certain side characters who never got much attention in the original game or even REmake 2 get moments to shine here and as a long time fan it's heart warming (and gut wrenching) to see certain scenes throughout the more re-imagined story line from the original. Overall I feel this REmake will be the most divisive of the trilogy but I think it will come to find it's place in fan's hearts just as the original RE 3 did when it first came out to less than stellar reviews. 

Short and sweet with Resistance, it's fun and I was surprised that it meet my already pretty low expectations for it. It's a more enjoyable experience with a group of friends but otherwise I can see potential with the right amount of support from Capcom. Be wary of the shop that has yet to be implemented though. 
The price for the package as a whole is a bit steep. As a RE fan I think it's definitely worth it for the buy and play now appeal rather than wait until after the game's initial release when it will most likely be picked apart by YouTubers and speed runners alike.

Out of all the RE remakes I've played, this one is by far the worst. 
Compared to the RE2 Remake this thing has completely moved away from the survival horror theme and thus is feels more like an action game. Not to mention that there are countless elements they have removed from the original game which explains why this remake could easily be beaten within 2-3 hours. I got irredeemably bored within the first hour after dealing with Nemesis's scripted sections, along with its stupid dog form. 
Obviously this is another one of those games that rely on ""we have a strong female character"" as its selling point, while ignoring everything else such as the scripts, gameplay, and horror themes.

All of this for what, $39.99? The only reason why the game matters is because it has ""Resident Evil"" as its title. Without it nobody would have any reason to play, let alone buy this mess.

The game itself isn't very long so if you ignore some zombies and just run through all of the tasks you'll finish it under 2 hours for sure. It's missing some parts from the original game, but it was still fun playing. At some point you will be bored, but some jumpscares will make sure that you'll wake up :D (at least one for sure).

When you'll be able to buy stuff (you'll receive points that you can spend in shop that will be unlocked after finishing game I think) you will be unstoppable thanks to the guns that have infinite ammo and are pretty much strong.

DLC that can be bought where you can have Jill's outfit is only worth buying if you use mods.

don't pay full price for this game because I beat the game with a decent amount of deaths in 5 ish hours... so its not worth full price. I received this game for like 10 dollars on sale so please wait for a sale",1679360349,1688274355,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The original RE3 was great. I really liked it. It was more linear than 1 and 2 but I felt much more dread due to the nemesis being able to appear on a lot of places I didn’t expect and also was able to follow you through doors. It shattered my expectation of the game. Boss fights were mechanically more interesting although the aiming and dodge system were rather broken. I was hyped up for this one as it seemed a game that could be way much better with a remake unlike RE2 which was already really good.

[u]Gameplay[/u]
There is solely two changes in the combat. Defence items got removed, meaning your knife is now unbreakable thus you have to carry it all the time in a no item box run, and the dodge move from RE3 original is back. This time it works very well and considering how the nemesis moves a welcome addition. Although one that makes the game a bit too easy. Combat is much more action focused as is the whole game. It reminds me more of RE6 which I unironically liked. But is that really the route they want to go again?

There are more difficulties aside veteran, two more you unlock but those tend to also be easy due to the possibility to buy an infinite AR in the points shop after a playthrough or two. You get points for doing challenges.

I must say that I enjoyed the main campaign a lot even though it definitely lacked in a lot of content in areas and became quickly more and more linear. The first area is great where you probably spend an hour or so. After that I was surprised what kind of content they added. Some throwback to RE2 and some scenes where you play as Carlos and run and gun with an assault rifle.

The main focus is the nemesis but he is an overall less scary version of the one from the original. He’s very predictable here and later on its more just running away from him in a corridor. Its still fun and impressive but the game has such an incredible start gameplay wise. Spectacle wise it stays strong until the end of the game, especially the last boss fight was visually great.

Now the elephant in the room. It lacks content. A lot of it. The first hour is quite faithful while adding a lot of content. After the train ride it’s the opposite. A lot of scenes are scrapped, including the hydrogen plant(replaced by underground lab) clocktower, cemetery etc. My first playthrough took me just over 4-5 hours, the second less than 2. My fastest time was around 1 hour and 25 minutes and I’m not a speedrunner. It’s a really short game. A single run in RE2 will take you longer not to mention the Claire/Leon A and B route. Barely any puzzles and not much new. At least you don’t have that awful acid shower battle in the game anymore!

[u]Story[/u]
You start off a section as Jill where you get glimpses of her life and what she is up to due to Umbrellas workings. Until you’re suddenly amidst the Zombie outbreak and the Nemesis chases you in a very cool although heavily scripted sequence.

[u]Sound[/u]
I really like the new ost, it’s a more complex version of some tracks of the original. Although I prefer the raw dread the original nemesis theme presented. Again, game is available in a lot of voiced languages! Always like this commitment.

[u]Graphics[/u]
Not much changed from RE2 although the texture models of the characters are much better! There are also a lot more visually interesting places especially the chaos from the outbreak in the start of the game.

[u]Conclusion/TL;DR[/u]
I really enjoyed my short playthrough of this game. But considering it as a remake it doesn’t add enough to justify the content they cut. Especially since places like the clocktower museum which was my favourite are missing! Unlike RE2 remake it doesn’t stay that faithful while adding more content but rather just does this in the first half of the game. After that it gets much more linear and solely became a rather fun action focused game. Could have expanded and improved the content RE3 had and it would have made my favourite RE title. Still worth looking into as the game is still an enjoyable rollercoaster ride.

I'm the guy who pretty much enjoys every RE I've gotten my hands on; 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, Code Veronica X, Revelations 1 and 2, REmake2. (I haven't beat REmake1 yet)

But this....? Especially after beating REmake2 a couple weeks ago and PS1 RE3 a day prior? Oh man. Immediately after seeing uptown and Nemesis' arrival as a 5 minute tutorial sequence, when it's a whole journey's worth of exploration and solving in the original then suddenly I'm at the ""tram"" which is much further in the original, I knew it was going to be very watered down. I understand a remake doesn't need to be a 1:1 from the original, it's best to change things to keep things fresh with unexpected surprises while maintaining some familiarity, REmake2 and REmake1 proves this to be very effective. In this game it's just ""hey remember that [character or place] you spent a [considerable amount of time] with in the original? Well here you--- oh it's over now. NEXT TUTORIAL"".

All of that could have been forgiven and I would have pressed on and probably still enjoyed it, but they screwed up the one thing they definitely shouldn't screw up: Jill. A shame because I immediately liked Carlos and Mikhail when they show up, but Jill was already rubbing me the wrong way before the subway but I couldn't figure out what it was. The second she interacted with the UBCS members on the subway I knew what it was and it was her personality. She's a sarcastic douchebag and not the kind that really makes the character interesting or fun to hate akin to Handsome Jack in Borderlands 2. I understand that in remakes characters can change but remain familiar too. Claire was given a more scared demeanor with some slight sarcasm because she's just a college kid with a revolver, but still handles herself because she's from a law enforcement family. Leon has the composure of a police officer but the way he carries himself shows he obviously still green because he just got out of the police academy. Jill is a highly trained former officer of a special police force with experience of the undead and she...... lacks situational assessment and skepticism towards UBCS team, no investigative or interrogation skills... Just out of the gate know-it-all confrontational girlboss that actually lacks the military+LEO bearing to back up her sense of authority. ALT+F4, no way I can handle this kind of character for several hours straight

Já no 3, foi bem mais equilibrado, momentos de puzzles, zombies mais maleaveis, vc matava e eles ficavam mortos ou pelos menos menos deles voltavam a vida, também tem o fato de que não precisva de 25 tiros pra matar uma porra de zombie, 2-5 tiros na testa já tava otimo.

Momentos com o Nemesis foram mais Marcante do que com o Mr X, já que o Mr X é basicamente ele atrapalhando o seu caminho o game inteiro mas não em um sentido de risco e sim que ele fica literalmente na frente da porcaria das portas q vc precisa ir e ai  vc tem que girar meio mapa com ele só pra poder passar.

Não da pra dizer que o 3 é melhor que o 2 mas ele é bem mais agradavel de se jogar, diferente do 2 onde é basicamente puzzle a cada 10m de gameplay onde você só foge, é o que tornou ele desgastante na minha opinião, 3 foi bem mais  trabalhado nesse quesito.",1687276300,1687276300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The confrontation with the nemesis gives you the pleasant itch in your crouch. I was surprised by it’s length. Finished on normal within 5 hours +/-. The fun lies within it’s replayability to unlock all items and complete all challenges. By far I’m no completionist but i‘ll give it another spin.

The way the story is presented always keeps you focused and in tension.
Great surroundings and works on the environment, great voice acting.

I like that in this game they don't only show you the zombies but also other healthy npcs running around. It really adds to the atmosphere of a ""virus breakout""

In order to not spoil many details, I am only going to say that in my opinion some moments in the story felt a bit ridiculous ([spoiler] like for example these murlock looking creatures jumping out of the reserviour where there were being cultivated, pretty much every appearance of Nicolai character and interaction with him. It felt like the things around were too easy on him and he was a god: easily reaching places and as easily escaping them [/spoiler]).

Great aspects exist, however, the abundant issues are supremely critical to the overall experience. Did the game designers just phone it in, hoping the glowing reception of RE2 Remake would carry it? Even when not comparing it to its predecessor, RE3 Remake is a loud meh of a standalone product. While I have not played the original game, I’ve heard this remake is unfaithful and scraps much of the original content. No matter how you look at it, RE3 Remake is a mixed standalone game, disappointing sequel, or an unfaithful remake.  

For starters, the lack of content is abhorrent. It feels like a DLC for RE2 Remake. The game is only 6 or 7 seven hours long at a leisurely pace. This wouldn't be an issue if replayability existed. At all. In RE3 Remake, there are no alternative characters to play as. In RE1 Remake and RE2 Remake, I started a second playthrough right away. The other character provided their own story to experience in a familiar, enjoyable world. (Plus, it is fulfilling to play again because I had some skill built up.) Here, there is nothing close to that. The game is a one n’ done. I’d say if you’re curious, it isn’t worth more than $10. Some poor sods purchased this for $60!

The level design is far too linear with disappointing pacing that favors action over horror and puzzles. Locations are reused or uninspired copies of earlier settings. The downtown starting area is fun to explore, but you cannot return to finish exploring it (that I found). I had 2 of the 3 jewels in my pocket to deposit in a clock but no way to use them because I activated a scripted Nemesis cutscene before finding the last one. How was I supposed to know it would force me to stop and never come back? This is just a single incident that exemplifies the numerous scripted encounters that are no more than cutscenes that provide the illusion of playing a game via instruction of moving the joystick or hitting a button. (Those mechanics are good in other games but not something that works here.)

The sewers and laboratory environments are retreads of areas in the RE2 Remake, which wouldn’t be too much of an issue if they were well designed, though both are blander and without much in the way of puzzles or innovation. The hospital is scary and intense–easily the strongest part of the game. However, the A.I. of the Hunters can be bad at times. They never leave their spawn points, even returning to their assigned room after chasing you for more than a few seconds. This is made funnier when all these genetic monsters created solely to kill have just left Tyrell alone in the hospital lobby to chill on a computer.

The Nemesis battles start off as fun but soon become grindfests of smashing the fire and dodge buttons. After the first few, I audibly groaned when he’d pop up for another spout of failed revenge. There is no fun factor or innovation that builds upon the last encounter. Unlike RE2 Remake which lets you search environments after defeating the boss to pick up items you may not have collected, RE3 Remake forces you into yet another cutscene right away ultimately losing valuable resources. The final boss battle is the most lazy, embarrassing I've ever played (even more so than The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild). Uninspired and frustrating are understatements.

Jill seems like a different character than RE1 Remake. She was my favorite character but not so much here. Before, Jill was tempered, intelligent, and nice but tough enough to survive the horror she endured through perseverance. Through it all, she had a warmth about her. But here, she has become yet another generic, sarcastic badass. I can’t help but feel like I’m playing as 2013 Lara Croft. What else am I supposed to think upon seeing a blue sleeveless top, the boots, and all those utility and gun belts running through fiery buildings and squeezing through confined areas? Give her a ponytail and she’d look identical to Lara from the back. (Her appearance is a me complaint but not a strike against the game in the same way her personality change is.)

Jill falling off of buildings and standing next to explosions come off as mild inconveniences. Nemesis grabbing her neck for the tenth time might give her a migraine at best. Yes, many games I’ve played and enjoyed have characters with unnatural physical prowess. If video game protagonists were like our real-life fleshy bodies, there wouldn’t be a game as they’d outright die in the first scene. With that being said, RE3 Remake does go too far when considering the genre. A survival game needs more grounded action that reflects the consequences of bodily harm and mental trauma. A horror game loses menace when the protagonist survives every horrific encounter via a cutscene. Nemesis becomes an incompetent Saturday morning cartoon villain who fails at his one job over and over again.      

There are some annoying story cliches too. Jill has a couple nightmare fakeout scare scenes. If they’re suggesting she has PTSD from her experience at the Spencer Mansion in RE1, that’s a poor, underdeveloped way to express it. There is unexplored potential but action gotta be happening. The ending also involves the “I can’t shoot the bad guy because I might hit the good guy” gag.

In conclusion, RE3 Remake is devoid of content and challenges that don’t involve smashing the fire button. The exploration and intrigue are put second to straightforward boss fights that become tiresome quickly. While there is some of the greatness of RE2 Remake, RE3 Remake does not capture the same atmosphere or level of thrills. Not an utterly bad game, just one that is not good enough.",1686545127,1686768463,False,6,0,0.516846776008605957,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, if I had bought this for 60 bucks or even 40 bucks I'd be [b]pissed[/b] but for the 10 bucks I got it for it's a decent enough expansion of re2. I mean assuming I finish in about 5 hours for my first ever run (hardcore and doing my best to fully explore) that's a decent length, and much like re2 which can also be beaten really fast you're meant to play it multiple times, or in other words it's like buying claire run A for 10. Some quick lil notes of some of my thoughts:

There are some noticeable graphical and sound improvements in this game, feel like the pistol in particular sounds a lot better here.

This is a very much more action based game with a far more linear path, which I'm not particularity miffed about but I wish they made it a bit more clear when you reach points of no return (I missed some stuff in the town for sure because I ran back to subway station :( )

The dodge mechanic takes a little getting use to but it's an overall welcome addition, I do wish secondary items didn't get nerfed and kept being a get out of jail free if you get grabbed. But hey, I guess part of the S.T.A.R.S training is forgetting that you can shove a flashbang in somebodies mouth. Oh, and almost as if bootyhurt about how much people liked it in re2 they fucking massacred the knife in this game...freaking useless.

I would have been totally fine if the paleheads from the ghost survivor mode in re2 just stayed in that mode ngl. I also really don't like the hunter gammas, a way worse version of the G adults (betas are cool tho).

The main problem with RE3R (imo) is that this game in particular feels rushed; short story, lack of replayability and some of the game mechanics from RE2R released the year before - which are better than this game's respective mechanics - haven't been carried over which doesn't make much sense. Having never played the original RE3 I can't speak much about cut content, but it definitely feels like there should be more to it.
That lack of replayability is my main gripe, it's a ""one and done"" type of story that doesn't really have much variation to how the story can be approached.

Unlike this game's predecessor, Resident Evil 2 Remake, there is absolutely no other content factor to be experienced after completing the main game, due to the fact that the story is the only playable experience.

Starting off, I'd like to say that I do believe Capcom knows how to optimize a game without making it broken whilst maintaining the good graphics of the RE engine. I played this on a Steam Deck, and just like Village and RE2, the game still looked amazing. I was able to play at 1080p with most settings turned to medium, but later on went down to 720p for better framerate. So on that note, the game manages to be perfectly optimized and playable, while being graphically pleasing.

That being said, the way the levels are produced without a sense of backtracking makes the game feel way too linear compared to the games prior to RE3's release. The linearity is akin to that of a COD campaign with that one or two missions that make you go,""That was kinda cool!"" and then proceed to stick to the same play style as you continue. The only things that do tend to stand out are the boss fights, which are actually pretty fun. However, they fail to replace to series's staple of puzzle solving (which is absolutely absent in this game, apart from a segment where you align a subway), and thrilling levels pertaining to each game. In RE2 Remake, you had the orphanage and Ada Wong segment; in Village, you had dollhouse. This game has so much potential to be a good, open-area type game. The material is there for a burning city that you have to navigate through in order to survive and escape. Unfortunately, the finished product seems to be rushed instead of managing to deliver a creative and intricate experience that makes want to play it again.

There is also the whole argument that the game also fails to stay true to the original RE3, however I did not play the original game, so it is not in my place to say. I would also like to add that you get this game in the Raccoon City Bundle ON SALE like I did if you don't currently own RE2 Remake. It feels more like a DLC than a standalone game, which felt fitting for being in a bundle.

Overall, you might be wondering why I've pulled an IGN and recommended this game. Well there's a cool Shrek mod for Nemesis.",1686601360,1686601360,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Resident Evil 3 is the black sheep of the recent remakes. Not as beloved or groundbreaking as Resi 2 or 4 but apparently popular enough to warrant its own game. In my opinion it might have been better to have it as a DLC for 2 because it's really short. If I'm paying $40 for a game (thankfully I got this on sale bundled in with the second game) I expect more than ~5 hours of playtime. To be fair, though, it's a really great game. The shooting feels tight and it's always fun to kill zombies. It has that patented RE thing where you have to wait a second for your aim to steady. I actually really liked the story and thought it was well written and wasn't padded at all. The animation work is all top-notch and obviously the graphics have been completely overhauled. It's a very nice game, even playing on Steam Deck I noticed all the little details that make the world seem real. Speaking of the world, most of the ""locations"" are explorable areas filled with secrets and very very light puzzling. If you're coming to this after RE4 than I highly suggest starting with this over RE2 since it's more action focused and linear. I'd say my only complaint is the Nemesis who just becomes a big pain in the butt by the end. It's not scary, just really annoying. While there's a good amount of enemy variation, the only boss is just slightly different stages of the Nemesis. While it [i] is [/i] satisfying to finally kill him, I wish they'd toned it down a bit more. All in all it's a fantastic shooter whose length unfortunately requires a sale to justify buying it.

*Steam Deck note: As mentioned in the first note, I played this on a car trip (on my Steam Deck) and I'm happy to report that the game runs great on there. I was able to get roughly 3 hours of battery life with graphics on medium..

To begin with, this game is very action-packed and you barely have enough time to catch your breath, which is something that I liked very much. The weapons feel better and stronger than Resident Evil 2 remake and the combat is more advanced, rewarding good skill. The game has a lot of boss-fights and you switch with Carlos for some time in the game where You really feel the adrenaline pumping. BUT, it took me only 4 hours  to finish this game and I really took my time with it. Also, the game really does NOT feel like Resident Evil at all. I barely solved 3 maybe 4 very easy puzzles and the game focused more on fighting than strategy and unlocking the map progressivelly ( only in the hospital and barely in RPD did we get these things). In addition, Nemesis is very stressful to face but he feels sooo programmed. For example: MR X ( RE2 Villain) would pop out out of nowhere and scare the shit out of you cutscene or not because he was unpredictable and NOT just programmed to be in a specific scene. Moreover, at one point Nemesis feels more of an annoyance because of the many times you face him. The game offers significantlly less replayability than RE2 and in general little replayability, since you dont have nothing new after you finish story ( except from 1 outfit and other powerups that you get from challenges, which can get boring). So, unfortunately, when compared to RE 2 it is a worse and way smaller game. In general, I think you should give this game a chance ( especially if its on discount) if you are OK with the  downsides of this game (since it offers a decent story/protagonists) and you enjoy fast paced games or RE games in general. I can assure you on thing tho: if the game did not lack so many content ( because the developers had to remove a lot of content from the game) it would have been way more appreciated than today ( yet still I admit that I love this game and definitely recommend it to new players)",1686525857,1686525857,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

i agree that cutting stuff from original and no dlc plan was unnecessary decisions from capcom

i know people saying this game is rushed after one year ago that re2 remake came out
but i had to debunk this nonsense just let you guys know that both re2 remake and re3 remake are made by two different team during development same time before re2 remake is not out yet and its not just made by capcom. capcom has too many dev teams working on different projects.

re2 remake is made by Division 1 team and also the same guys who made recent re4 remake and thats why they did it better

re3 remake is made by M-Two and this team did horrible job on re3 remake

btw the reason why they charged us this game for $60? because this game is bundled with re resistance multiplayer game that no one asked for and that is the another reason why they ditched mercenaries mode over this garbage and hears a fun fact i still haven't touch or even bother playing re resistance at all since the re3 remake came out in April 2020 during early pandemic times lol

re3remake should have been $20 since the game is short and re resistance should have been free to play but the game is dead anyways lol

should i recommend you guys to buy this game? its up to you guys decide to buy the game whatever you want and its your choice or vote for your wallet and its best to wait for holidays and summer sale discounts and have fun :)",1682246948,1686462340,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Review:

As someone who played and finished the original game, I can say that the remake is a game where too much was cut out and it was rushed. Jill's dialogue is a bit soulless, and some of her facial animations are robotic. There seems to be a problem with the motion capture, but who knows?

There are unnecessary puzzles added to extend the game, and there are some unnecessary enemy additions to add challenge to the game. At the same time, since the game lacks horror elements other than atmospheric horror and the tension given by the nemesis, they used a few cheap jump scare tricks. 

The city modeling is well done, and it reflects the zombie apocalypse atmosphere really well. It's fun to feel that atmosphere while walking through the alleys. As in the original game, resource management is one of the things that makes this game good, and I think exploring and looting is a pleasure in this game.

I can say that the cutscenes are generally well done, and the action sequences are great. Especially the fight animation on the roof in the last scene was really good. Compared to the 2nd game, the particle effect and zombie deform physics are far behind. There may be many reasons for this, except that it was a rushed job.

The feeling of hitting is behind compared to the 2nd game, except for the modified version of Jill's basic weapon and the Desert Eagle-style weapon. I couldn't get the same feeling I got in the 2nd game with other weapons. Also, the M4 gun is extremely underpowered compared to the real thing. It's funny that you can take down a zombie with the M4 in 15 rounds, even if you shoot it in the head... (Note: I finished the game on Hardcore and Standard difficulty, so I don't know how it is on Easy).

If you are not loaded enough in the boss fight before the last boss fight of the game, you may have trouble. Usually, in Resident Evil level designs, boss areas have bullets and supplies, but there are not enough of them in this episode. If you don't play smart, you can die due to a lack of resources. You need to loot the environment well before entering this fight, and spending extra time for this is a bit annoying in the last stage of the game...

Overall, I liked the remake of Re3, an old cult game, even if it's not worth buying at full price the moment it comes out. It is a game that you can buy on sale and enjoy.

They were attending a charity event at a local park, where they were invited as special guests to entertain the crowd with their unique talents. As fate would have it, they were paired up for a surprise duet performance.

The stage was set, and the crowd was buzzing with anticipation. Jill and Travis stood side by side, exchanging friendly smiles. The music started playing, and they began singing a lively and energetic song together, their voices blending in perfect harmony. The audience erupted in cheers and applause as they delivered a dynamic and unforgettable performance.

After the song, Jill and Travis stepped down from the stage, their hearts racing with adrenaline and excitement. They shared a moment of camaraderie, realizing they had just created something special. As a token of their newfound friendship, they decided to take a break and find a quiet spot to relax and enjoy a well-deserved meal.

Jill led Travis to a cozy corner of the park where a picnic table was set up. On the table were two baskets filled with delicious sandwiches prepared by the event's organizers. The aroma of freshly baked bread and flavorful fillings wafted through the air, making their mouths water.

They sat down, and as they unwrapped their sandwiches, they continued to talk and laugh, swapping stories about their respective careers and adventures. Despite coming from different worlds, they found common ground and developed a genuine connection.

Between bites of their sandwiches, Jill and Travis couldn't resist humming the tune they had just performed on stage. Their impromptu singing turned into a full-blown jam session, with Jill providing a soulful melody while Travis added his unique rap style. Passersby couldn't help but stop and listen, captivated by their infectious energy and talent.

As the sun began to set, casting a warm golden glow over the park, Jill and Travis finished their sandwiches, feeling satiated and content. They sat back, admiring the beauty of the moment and reflecting on the magical experience they had shared.

With full stomachs and hearts filled with joy, Jill and Travis bid each other farewell, promising to keep in touch and perhaps collaborate again in the future. They left the park with a newfound appreciation for each other's talents and the power of music to bring people together.

And so, this unexpected encounter between Jill Valentine and Travis Scott became a cherished memory, a story they would fondly recall whenever they thought of that special day they sang and ate sandwiches in harmony.",1686426855,1686444787,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The pacing of the campaign is phenomenal and continues the survival-horror gameplay revival from RE2 remake, especially the first act. Going through the Raccoon City streets, looting, managing inventory, and exploring was an absolute blast. This game was a bit harder than I remember, I had to think about what weapons I wanted to use and which enemies to kill or avoid. The graphics are also beautiful, there were many moments where I just had to sit and admire the scenery around me. It also helps that this game runs flawlessly on PC, just like the other recent RE titles.

Here's the problem, it's just extremely short. I forgot most of this game and still beat it with around 70% TOTAL completion in about 5 hours. That's not a lot these days, especially since this game isn't as original as when RE2 remake hit the scene in 2019. It uses a lot of assets from that game. There is a high level of replayability even compared to some of the other RE games, which is saying something because this series has always done replayability extremely well, but it doesn't change the fact that this is an extremely short adventure. I however won't discredit that the item shop, extra difficulties, challenges, and achievements are super fun to go through and do add value to this package.

I love this game and it means a lot to me personally, which I know doesn't account for everyone else, but I can definitely recommend this game anyway especially in the current day. While it's short, you will have a great time whether you're a veteran fan or a newcomer to the series for the price points it's going for these days. You can get this game bundled with RE2 remake for just 15 bucks and that's an absolute STEAL, especially considering I still had enough fun to pay $60 back when it was brand new. Definitely check it out if you enjoy scavenging, exploration, and rewarding survival gameplay. While it's the weakest game of what I consider the revival era of RE starting with 7, it's still better than a lot of games coming out today.",1686438317,1686438317,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Graphics are still good, and the new feature, dodging, is quite difficult for beginners. It takes a while to get used to it if you repeat the story and practice.

I still prefer RE2 Remake to this one, only amazes you when u play a story game for the first time.

Cons: The dodge is weird, idk, just didnt fit well in the game? Nemesis isnt *really* nemesis after the subway. I mean he's still a threat and big and scary, but isn't what OG Nemesis was. This game is also unfortunately fast. Normal difficulty, beat in 3 hours 30 minutes. 
Pros: Jill Valentine and Carlos are a power team.

It's pointless listing all of them, but one of the posters on the Steam forums summarized it perfectly:

""Because it's basically a completely new game. It's vastly different than the original in almost every way.
People expect a remake to have more familiar locations and story of the original. Both RE2 remake and RE4 remake are a lot closer to the source material. In RE3 remake they took a ton of liberty and redesigned the entire thing completely for better or for worse.""

The changes that I did like:[list]
[*]Chaos of the city being destroyed by the zombies is great, especially in the beginning.
[*]Storywise it's more focused, especially character development.
[*][spoiler]Brad dying a heroic death, instead of being killed by Nemesis, as if to make up for leaving Alpha Team to fend for themselves at the Spencer Mansion.[/spoiler]
[*]Jill is a bit too potty mouthed for my taste. She’s rude and snarky, but on the other hand, she every right to be, considering she mostly interacts with UBCS. At first I thought they ruined her character, but then I remembered that in the original she did slap Carlos at one point and was pretty hostile, though had a lot less dialogue to work with and didn’t swear. She does eventually warm up to Carlos, stops being snarky/sassy towards him, and seems to start liking him as a person. There is actual chemistry there, unlike in RE3: Nemesis. She’s also nice towards Brad and Kendo, people she knows and trusts.
[*]Some people complain about RE3R being more action oriented. The original was already very action oriented, especially for a fixed camera game. It had exploding barrels to kill groups of zombies for crying out loud.
[*]I’m actually shocked that people are defending RE3: Nemesis so much. I was always lukewarm towards it, being so action focused and padding out the run time by forcing you to backtrack through multiple long alleys in the first half of the game, and then the out of place Clock Tower section (which took 20-30 minutes to finish tops), pointless park, and awful Grave Digger fight. NEST 2 replaces the Dead Factory, which was essentially a lab anyway. It also reused assets like RPD. Nemesis was scripted as well, though admittedly he did appear more often. Live selection added minimum variety (it allowed you to discover an additional corridor with some items and that’s it), as did the random spawns each playthrough, increasing the replayability only a bit. For me it was entirely skippable, despite good ideas, Nemesis, and Jill.[/list]

My greatest disappointment with RE3R is that they failed to take a mediocre game with a good concept and elevate it into something truly great. They did redesign the entire thing, yet somehow were still too conservative, as if they were afraid that if they go too far, people will riot. Instead, they created a game that's only a bit less mediocre, and people hate it. For me it’s a tad better, more focused, and fun to play, but mostly forgettable.

Pretty decent but unfortunately ends up short and with what feels like a rushed storyline that I would've loved to see more from. It is a bit lacking in overall horror elements in my opinion, as it quickly turns into more of an action game than anything, Many of the encounters are predictable and you get used to the ""formula"" the game uses around the half way point so it leaves very little suspense in your mind.

Resident Evil 3 felt like Resident Evil 2 DLC which may sound like a bad thing but it's actually a compliment when you think about it. It's more of a amazing game. Now the cut content from the original will anger a lot of OG fans of Resident Evil 3 rightfully so because of previously mentioned cut content as well as the handling of Nemesis' A.I and how they changed how he worked from the original which is why many people fell in love with RE3 in the first place. Despite this it is still a very good game that is Resident Evil at its roots which if you like the formula you will absolutely love this.

Boss fights are against The Nemesis too and you are armed to the teeth so battles are fun. I rate this game 9/10.

I mean ""spoilers"" but he gets literally stopped by a fuckin' bookshelf. so disappointing. and dont get me started on Jill and Carlos, they turned Jill into a hardass in this game, they actually turned her into the stereotypical strong independent women with a fucked up haircut, and reduced our boi carlos into a seperated gamemode in the remake, reducing him to two seperate occasions. i mean, they could off done it as a storymode kind of thing, give up Jill's Story then we can unlock Carlos as a playable story mode but nope. they even gave us a fucking store which ruins the challenge of the game, you can buy a GOD DAM INFINITE ROCKET LAUNCHER that may i add will crash your game if overused. 

Whats also worse is they made the game rushed and removed any sense of choice in comparison to its original counterpart. The original had instead of a AB scenerios like in the original RE1 & 2, and was intelligently changed to, on the spot decision making which rewarded you and fuck you up at the same time, for example; the first encounter with nemesis is at the RPD in the original, you would given two choices, you could, A) Run away and conserve ammo and shit but risk the fact nemesis will chase you through the RPD. or B) Take him on and get a weapon part but you'll loose a ton of resources in turn. actual worthwhile choices. Not to mention Nemesis's Fucking AI was so advanced he felt like he was actually learning in your fights. it felt like he was as smart as the player. a real god dam threat. in the remake, he was downgraded to a crappy version of MR. X

i mean his second boss fight, he literally is reduced to dog-nemesis and he stays that way and becomes really dog-shit. he just becomes repetative and lazy. not to mention they removed the clock tower from the original. i mean i have my gripes with RE2r with the AB scenerios and Boss Verity with Birkin but RE2r is actually fun to play. this game is a bad dream. whats even worse is none of the actors call Capcom out for that issue of laziness.

Already binged games from 0 to 2 and I can definitely say I've had the least amount of fun with this entry. (I played on hardcore from the get-go so my experience might be different to anyone playing on a different difficulty setting.)

The enemies and their lay outs are tedious. While in almost every RE game resource management is a vital, and weirdly fun, part of the game where you get to decide what to spend where, I haven't really got that feeling in RE 3. The enemies were seemingly placed randomly without real care put into it (with few exceptions). Instead of giving me an obstacle which I should deliberate upon and consider my options in a span of a few moments, I was given a hindrance which only slowed my progress.

The levels were all very short. It isn't a problem in the late game as usually RE games tend to pick up the pace near the end. Still, I barely had any time to get accustomed to any areas of the game, making it feel like I was speedrunning through everything.

As for the famous Nemesis, I read a comment somewhere that read something along the lines of 'Mr.X in RE2 felt more like Nemesis than the actual Nemesis.' which is very true. In RE3 Remake, Nemesis, with the exception of his second appearance if I recall correctly, every time he appears it's a cutscene or a sequence. Because of that he never truly felt like a threatening entity that hunted Jill wherever she went, never posed much of a threat or fear.

I bought this in a bundle with RE2 pretty cheap so I don't really regret buying it. Would I recommend buying it however? No. Would I say to never buy this though? Not exactly either. I'd say that if you can get it for a really low price and you're a fan of the franchise. Sure, get it. I'd just say to not get your expectations too high as the game won't live up to them.

In conclusion, RE3 Remake is a mediocre experience that feels more like a 4-6 hour demo of a game that somehow manages to conclude it's story in that span.",1685644048,1685713131,False,2,0,0.509851038455963135,0,True,False,False

The game is very cinematic and portrays the story through most of it and has a huge amount of cut scenes which take up about 50% of the game itself making it really short on its own. I see where people are mad about the game being really short and ends fast as it really cuts out 1/4 out of the original games game play but the moments we have with the game are never short tasted and honestly make the game very enjoyable and it was really fun to get all the achievements and the bonus rewards for doing all the rewards make the game have more replay value with its 2 really hard difficulties.

The only scary parts of the game were the chase segments with nemesis but those were scripted unlike Mr. X's in RE2.

The game is more dense and action packed leading to higher pace gameplay and less downtime than RE2.
Just like RE2 this game falls off hard towards the last act and becomes a chore to play, a common theme with Resident Evil games I understand.

The game is surprisingly short at about 6 hours and the last hour is pretty tedious and boring, just like RE2. This puts RE3 at around half the length of its predecessor.

The game was fine but felt small, basic, empty and devoid of passion compared to RE2.

The survival horror aspects of the series are mostly gone as RE3 drowns you in ammo and Jill gets a handy dodge button, making combat feel much more fast paced.

With that said, there's almost zero puzzles in this game - I only counted 2. And after a while it starts to feel a little bit tedious as you cut through far more zombies than Leon or Claire had to deal with, and while the Nemesis boss fights are visually cool, the big man himself is a bullet sponge so beating him can feel somewhat repetitive. Additionally, some areas from the original RE3 were cut for the remake, presumably for pacing issues, so the remake's campaign only lasts about 4-5 hours, which is hard to swallow if you paid full price for it.

Rating: ★★★★☆

Resident Evil 3, the highly anticipated remake of the 1999 classic, brings the terrifying world of Raccoon City to life once again. Developed by Capcom, this reimagined version successfully captures the essence of the original while delivering modernized gameplay mechanics, stunning visuals, and a relentlessly intense experience.

From the moment players step into the shoes of Jill Valentine, they are thrust into a city overrun by hordes of grotesque and relentless zombies. The survival horror atmosphere is palpable, with every corner and shadow harboring the potential for a heart-stopping encounter.

While the original Resident Evil (1996), Resident Evil 2 (1998), Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) and Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2000) are still the better of the options to play. (Why are they not on Steam? You’re killing me Smalls) The Resident Evil Remake (2002) as well as Resident Evil 2 remake (2019) and Resident Evil 3 remake (2020) are still wonderful to play as a true fan of the series.  

While the remakes fall a little short at times of the critical thinking and atmosphere of the originals. They are a large, healthy, and beautiful step in the right direction away from the button mashing, guns blazing, rock punching, brainless experience of Resident Evil 4, 5, and 6 the series took after the Resident evil Remake (2002) and Resident Evil 0 had poor sales.
. 
What Capcom missed here, is they thought people no longer wished-for old-school Survival Horror games due to the poor sales of Resident Evil remake (2002) and Resident Evil 0. When in fact they trapped a true piece of art and wonderful game experience in Resident Evil Remake (2002) and a solid game in Resident Evil 0 on a console no one owned (GameCube). If Capcom would have ported the games sooner as they did Resident Evil 4. They would have had similar sales and proven people still wanted the old school, true Resident Evil experience. 

With both Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3 remakes selling over 17 million copies combined. We can see people are still yearning for old-school Resident Evil. 

Overall, I would recommend this game to all fans and hope for another Resident Evil (1996) and Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2000) Remake in the future. 

As for now now, we wait for the Silent Hill 2 remake and dream of a Dino Crisis remake.

Every location, every scene, every encounter feels like it needed to be at least 1.5 times longer to be fully realised and developed.

Hey there, fellow gamers! I just had to drop a line about my recent experience with Resident Evil 3 Remake, and boy, oh boy, was it a wild ride! If you're a fan of survival horror and adrenaline-pumping action, this game is an absolute must-play.

First things first, let's talk graphics. They're off the charts! The level of detail in the environments, from the desolate streets of Raccoon City to the eerie interiors of the abandoned buildings, is jaw-dropping. I swear, I could almost smell the decay in the air. The character models are insanely realistic too, with every sweat bead and muscle twitch making me feel like I was right there alongside Jill Valentine.

Speaking of Jill, she's a total badass in this remake. She's not just a pretty face, folks. Armed with her trusty weapons and unwavering determination, she takes on hordes of grotesque zombies and terrifying creatures with style. The gameplay mechanics are smooth as butter, allowing for precise shooting and heart-pounding escapes. Oh, and let's not forget the explosive boss battles that had me on the edge of my seat, frantically strategizing every move.

The pacing of the game is spot-on. It's a rollercoaster of tension and release, constantly keeping you engaged. You'll explore creepy locations, solve puzzles (some of them had me scratching my head for a while), and encounter unexpected surprises around every corner. The sense of dread and urgency never lets up, making for an intense and immersive experience from start to finish.

Now, let's talk about the audio design. The atmospheric soundtrack perfectly complements the nightmarish setting, setting the mood for pure terror. Every creak, growl, and scream had me jumping out of my skin. And the voice acting? Top-notch. The characters felt alive (or undead, in some cases) with their realistic emotions and reactions. Kudos to the voice actors for bringing them to life!

While the game's campaign might be relatively short, the replayability factor is through the roof. There are multiple difficulty levels to challenge your skills, and the unlockable bonuses and achievements will keep completionists busy for hours on end. Plus, there's an addictive multiplayer mode called Resistance that adds a whole new dimension of fun and chaos.

All in all, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a blast from start to finish. It's a nerve-wracking, pulse-pounding experience that will make you appreciate the survival horror genre all over again. With its stunning visuals, tight gameplay mechanics, and captivating storyline, this game is a winner in my book. Grab your controller, turn down the lights, and get ready for a spine-chilling adventure like no other!",1684730352,1684730352,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Дело в том, что на контрасте со вторым ремейком, третий выглядит и играется довольно посредственно и уступает по многим параметрам. Начиная от отсутствия в прежней мере экономить патроны, из-за чего игра превратилась больше в экшен-шутер, нежели сурвайвор, до потешного Немезиса, который вселяет больше смех, чем ужас. Так же игра страдает скудной продолжительностью. И это удивительно, ведь если бы разрабы больше уделили внимания оригиналу, то всего этого можно было избежать. Классику я прошел следом, чтобы понять из-за чего негодовали олды, пройдя ремейк. После чего их негодование стало для меня доходчиво. В ремейке по какой-то причине отсутствует часть локаций и множество головоломок из оригинала, которые могли с легкостью разбавить тон геймплея. Так же в оригинале была малая нелинейность, когда в определенные моменты прохождения застывало время, и можно было выбрать одно из двух действий, которое не кардинально, но меняло исход ситуации. Мне показалось это интересной механикой, которую стоило развить. Хорошо, что хоть додж от поступающих атак оставили. В общем, описанные выше пункты могли стереть самую главную проблему ремейка на мой взгляд. 

В целом же графика и оптимизация на уровне. Персонажи играют и выглядят достойно. Стрельба приятная. Саундтрек неплохой. Игра сохранила некую часть формулы ремейка второй части, но опять же, в сравнении с ним, третий кажется слабым и пустым. Потерянный потенциал. Короткий хронометраж. Упор на зрелищность, экшен для сохранения динамики в геймплее. Отсутствие головоломок и части локаций из оригинала. Комичный Немезис, который к тому же появляется исключительно в рамках скриптовых моментов. Некоторые боссфайты с ним это что-то с чем-то. Пройти все же стоит, но еще раз, настоятельно рекомендую проходить до второго ремейка, чтобы впечатления были слегка ярче из-за неимения на бэкграунде почвы для сравнения. Лорно никакой путаницы для Вас не будет, т.к. события двух ремейков протекают в плюс-минус одно время.

There really is no justifiable excuse for what Capcom keeps doing with these remakes they should far surpass the ps1 originals in more than just graphics technology is much better now. I actually love all of these remakes but it's just a shame they can't do better on a remake of 90s ps1 games and include all the necessary content from the originals something good always seems to be missing that was in the originals. I can understand cutting certain things to make a game better in a remake but in this it's clear they rushed it and cut a ton of good content to get it out faster. Entire sections and mechanics are missing like the choices and the clock tower section as well as other areas.

With that out of the way it's still one hell of a game Capcom doesn't miss. The pacing and story are pretty much perfect imo even if Jills character is kind of inferior to the original as far as growth goes. She's a bad bitch from the beginning she doesn't grow into one. But maybe it makes more sense considering she's already been through shit in re1 that was pretty bad. Carlos was fine. The story kept me interested I could see the plot twists from a mile away though blind.

Now let's talk about the elephant in the room Nemesis. I think he was actually great and well made when not scripted. The scripted parts where cool but obviously being dynamic and free more would of been better and scarier he's only really set loose on you like one or two brief times. He was terrifying though in that encounter though he was way under utilized.

The gameplay felt really good and smooth. I liked the dodging mechanic it felt really good when you got used to it. All the weapons felt really nice. The puzzles felt super simplistic for the most part. Weather that's a good or bad thing is up to you. The graphics are great like any other re engine game this game is pure eye candy.

Honestly games like this are rare these days it's extremely short under 10 hours and pretty linear but in a world of open world games this is a breath of fresh air and a joy to play. It can often be picked up for cheap on a steam sale and it well worth it for the heavily discounted price.

First of all, as a fan of this series, I was excited, but some aspects of the game left me a bit disappointed. Let's go through them one by one.

Firstly, Resident Evil 3 stands out with its graphical quality. The details, character animations, and environmental designs in the game are quite impressive. The realistic appearance of the zombies and the atmosphere of the game immerse the player in a thrilling experience. However, I would have expected the environments to be a bit more detailed in some areas. Nonetheless, overall, the visual presentation can be considered satisfying.

The gameplay of the game is fast-paced and adrenaline-filled. As we control our character, Jill Valentine, we strive to survive against zombies. The controls are smooth and responsive, which pulls you right into the heart of the action. However, the game's short length was a bit disappointing. Although the progression of the story and the puzzles are satisfying, it may feel lacking for players expecting more content.

However, Resident Evil 3 performs weaker in terms of storytelling compared to previous games. The development of the characters and their background stories feels somewhat lacking in depth. While Jill Valentine's story is intriguing, I would have expected better development for some of the side characters. There could have been more depth and connection in the story.

The Resident Evil series is famous for its horror experience, and Resident Evil 3 continues this tradition with its atmosphere and sound design. The game shakes you with tense moments and occasionally provides scary encounters. However, more psychological horror and unexpected events could have enriched the experience further.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 is a game that stands out with its visual quality, smooth gameplay, and tense atmosphere. However, it has some shortcomings such as its short length, weak storytelling, and character development. Therefore, it may not be fully satisfying for players expecting more content and depth.",1684353558,1684533121,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

If you don't believe me about what content is missing, you can compare the two versions for yourself. It's not hard to see what's missing or was downgraded in the remake

I'm willing to bet that around 85% of the reviews that say this is a fantastic game, haven't played the original. 

One argument people love to make in defense of the remake. Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was short, yes. That was due to it being made as a spin off and was only became a numbered title for marketing purposes. But this remake has no excuse for it's length. The remake is so short because it blatantly refuses to expand upon the source material and removes fundamental aspects of what made the original RE3 great in the first place.

My two biggest gripes are how they made Nemesis into a total chump, and what pisses me off the most how they removed exploration which was the best part of RE3: Nemesis imo

First of all, Mr. X is scarier than Nemesis....that's not supposed to be the case
You can realize how much of a chump Nemesis is in the remake when in the first 15 minutes, he can bust through an entire wall but is immediately stopped by a bookshelf.
Furthermore, multiple times, Nemesis will have Jill dead to rights and will proceed to channel his inner Uvalde Police Officer and will outright refuse to kill Jill. Don't believe me when I say he's a chump? Toss a single grenade at his feet, you'll see what I mean. 
The worst part about Nemesis in the remake, ALL of his encounters are scripted unlike the original when the mf could show up at any random moment and fuck your shit up.

For exploration, here are the locations you CANNOT explore in RE3R that you could in the original.

They are all even good Resident Evil games. Are they replacements for the original Resident Evil games? No, they are not. That doesn’t mean you can’t still love and enjoy them for what they are.

Understand, these remakes are not like the Dead Space remake of 2023. That game is so perfect a remake, that there really is no reason to ever play the original Dead Space unless you miss the original voice actors for Hammond and Kendra. Everything about the Dead Space remake is better than the original. That is not the case with the Resident Evil remakes.

It really comes down to what kind of Resident Evil gamer you are. Do you like the running and gunning Survival Action of OG Resident Evil 4, 5 and 6? Then you will really like the new remakes and probably not play the originals, if you ever did. However, do you love the puzzles, keys, clues and Survival Horror of the originals? Then you probably won’t really like the remakes. While the (currently) 3 remakes do still have those aspects, they are not nearly as prevalent as they were in the originals. While the Resident Evil 2 and 4 remakes have expanded the environments and even added a few new places, Resident Evil 3 remake actually took places away, most notably the Clock Tower area. I did appreciate that you got to play as Carlos more than once, and the Hospital was expanded to more than just 3 rather small areas, but I did miss the Clock Tower. I do know why they took it out, because it was an area that was purely OG puzzle and keys. Didn’t really fit the new direction of the remakes. So, I understand why people are complaining about that. The ones that complain about all the Nemesis events being scripted apparently don’t remember that ALL of the Nemesis events in the original are scripted too. Look at and any decent walkthrough of the original game, or the wiki. They can tell you where all the encounters are going to be and what prize you can get from Nemmy when you put him down, temporarily. So I don’t get that complaint.

Still, the remakes are very good games. You just need to take a few minutes and figure out what part of the Resident Evil games you loved the most, and play those versions.",1684170485,1684265601,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Even at a 80% discount, this ""game"" feels like a scam. Major story beats of the original were cut and / or replaced with much lesser renditions. One example that actually made me mad is how they reduced the entire City Hall section of the original to a single f--king puzzle. No Restaurant, no Newspaper building, no City Hall, no Clock Tower, no Park, no Facility. What they did keep is the exact same RPD section from RE2:Remake, down to the same exact puzzles. I expected a little bit of asset reuse but this is just awful. There was so little of the original game included in this remake, that this might as well be a new game entirely. The few segments that were kept are not intact though, as they happen at different times or different characters go though them. Now, the original was not a very long game either but it was compensated by having multiple choices within the main campaign that would alter the way your story played out, making it a much more replayable game. Not this remake though, there are no more choices to be made and once you've beaten it once, you've seen everything. I beat the original game in 9 hours while this one took me just 5 hours. I should also note that it came with a god-awful multiplayer no one asked for and I dare not even touch for the fear I might waste any time in that pile of garbage. Jill in the original Resident Evil and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis was already established as a capable and likeable fighter. I don't know who came up Jill's dialogue in the remake, she's always making snarky and sarcastic remarks about everything. Not everything in this laughable attempt at a remake sucks though, the shooting and movement mechanics are nicely implented. Graphically the game is stunning and always a treat to look at. It's just a shame the rest of the game is not up to the same standards.  Don't buy this game, don't play this game even if you get it for free.

That aside, as an RE game it kinda sucks. This was my introduction to the franchise, and I thought it was fun. I liked it enough to give the original one a try, and holy shit were things cut from this game. I had read reviews before getting the game. Even without the cut content like Clock Tower or the multiple choice stuff, it's a sin how tuned down Nemesis is in this remake.

The game feels more like an 80s action movie than a survival horror game, Evil Dead has more horror elements than this game. The devs were definitely horny when they made this game, there's booty shots, tentacles, egg impregnation, and vore.

The actual gameplay is pretty fun, but the Nemesis ""boss fights"" really aren't aside from the flamethrower fight. Speaking of Nemesis, he's kind of a joke in the remake, as a lot of other reviews are quick to point out. In the original, even stunning the guy was an accomplishment, in the remake however, it really doesn't take much. Now, as I had experienced this game before RE2 remake or the original RE3, I had no idea how Tyrants, and by extension Nemesis were utilized in the games, so I thought this was the standard. In the original RE3 he has a highly adaptive AI that seems to be able to understand and counter any strategy you might come up with to fight him with, even cancelling an attack to reposition and strike again. In the remake he's used as a set piece more than an actual enemy, and the dodge mechanic makes any interaction with him feel unimportant and not really memorable.

The dialogue is unnecessarily cheesy but I figured RE games were just like that because I'd seen clips of RE4 and that's really all the explanation that needs.

I honestly wish the dev team had put more effort into this remake, because while I had fun my first time going through it, revisiting after playing other installments (and the original version of the game) just makes me sad that this was how the game is ""meant to be experienced"". Overall the game is still a good time, but a disappointment to the franchise as a whole.",1682477770,1684001273,True,1,0,0.496307224035263062,0,True,False,False

The game follows Jill Valentine, a member of the Raccoon City police department, as she tries to escape the city during a zombie outbreak. She is pursued by a powerful bioweapon called Nemesis, who is sent to eliminate all S.T.A.R.S. members.

The 2020 remake of Resident Evil 3 features updated graphics and gameplay mechanics, but it also makes some changes to the original game. The biggest change is the removal of certain areas and events, which makes the game shorter than its predecessor.

In terms of gameplay, Resident Evil 3 is a mix of action and survival horror. The game features a dodge mechanic that allows players to avoid enemy attacks and counterattack. 

Compared to other games in the series, Resident Evil 3 is generally considered to be less successful than its predecessor, Resident Evil 2. The game received criticism for its shorter length and the removal of certain areas and events from the original game. However, the updated graphics and gameplay mechanics received praise from critics and fans.

Overall, Resident Evil 3 is a solid survival horror game that is worth playing for fans of the genre. However, those who are looking for a longer and more complex game may prefer some of the other games in the series.",1683811689,1683811689,True,10,0,0.61922454833984375,0,True,False,False

It has very little of the exploration that made the remake of Resident Evil 2 feel so fun and rewarding. I've replayed that game 3 times over and am certain I never want to play this one again. There is very little replay value in it due to the fact that all the encounters with enemies/bosses are completely scripted so it doesn't leave room to try playing any differently. 

That all being said, the boss fights and big setpieces the game has are SO FUN. It's unlike RE2 Remake in the way that they feel harrowing in that game; no, in every boss fight you feel like a complete badass blowing everything up. It would be more fun, however, if the game didn't TAKE THE CONTROLS AWAY FROM YOU FOR A CUTSCENE EVERY FIVE MINUTES. That might be my biggest complaint. Right when you are about to pull the trigger on the finishing blow during boss fights, the game rips the keyboard out from under your hands and shows you a cutscene of the exact thing YOU should be doing. But I digress. 

I recommend this game ONLY to people with a predisposition to enjoying Resident Evil games. If the world of Resident Evil doesn't interest you and you don't care about the lore, don't even bother with this game. If you are, however, a Resident Evil fan, then this game has some very integral lore within it for the franchise. A lot of your questions from the previous two games are answered and you need to know this stuff going forward in the series. 

All in all, this game is just alright. You can feel the Resident Evil bones underneath everything, but it's packaged in a bland and uninteresting wrapper. Anyways, that's my rant.",1683782268,1683782990,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Оригинал был для меня одной из знаковых игр в свое время которую я проходил несколько раз. После превосходного ремейка второй части на тройку возлагали огромные надежды, но, как оказалось, напрасно. Может из-за того, что обе игры разрабатывались практически параллельно, может из-за того что разрабы просто спешили, может они просто не угадали с вектором - игру они порезали в местах, где фанаты им не простили. Отчасти я с ними согласен. Не потому что считаю что переносить 100% оригинальных локаций, врагов, боссов, загадок было бы хорошей идеей. А потому что то, что сделано, выглядит как огрызок от игры, которая задумывалась больше, чем она получилась в итоге. Уровень в канализации и уровнем-то назвать сложно, два коридора. 

Что получилось хорошо: помимо, очевидно, технической составляющей, игре прекрасно удалось донести динамику первоисточника, ее идею, на мой взгляд она даже лучше с этим справилась, чем оригинал. Стрельба сочная, есть увороты/уклонения, Немезис дышит в спину и не дает спуску. Загадки убрали да и хрен бы с ними, это атавизм, который только мешает в боевике. 

Чего я не могу понять и простить так это ценника. Извините, но такое продавать за 60$ на старте - это кощунство. Мало того что игра короткая сама по себе, она в целом ощущается как длц/спинофф, так в нее никаких режимов не добавили, реиграбельность нулевая. Наемники, напомню, были даже в оригинале. Не удивительно что здесь довольно много охотников за ачивками, люди буквально каждый цент стараются выбить.

That being said, it is a bit disheartening to hear that a lot was cut out and I can definitely see why that would be an issue for so many people. 

With that aside, this is basically the gameplay of RE2 remake but faster paced and less puzzle heavy. The game is quite short (~5-6 hours on a first playthrough on Standard difficulty), and Nemesis himself just feels like a chore to deal with in non boss fight scenarios (However, the boss fights with him are really well done). Where the game really shines for me is its replayability. I don't know why, but the NG+ style store after completing a first playthrough is insanely addictive. You're given incentive to go back through the game completing various challenges in order to get cool unlocks to use in other playthroughs. The fast paced nature of the game makes these unlocks tempting, like getting the powerful Samurai Edge or ammo crafting companion in order to make more ammo. Not only that, but beating the game on its base hardest difficulty unlocks another, harder difficulty, then another. Because of this, I've been playing through the game multiple times trying to get achievements and Records (the little challenges to unlock points for the item shop). I've been having a blast doing this, and at the time of writing I'm going through Nightmare difficulty, the second hardest difficulty, with an infinite ammo assault rifle, HP regen coins, and attack boosting coins. Key items, consumables, and small paths shift a bit on these harder difficulties too so you can't fully know what to expect with all of this either. I went in to this remake with low expectations after reading all the reviews and controversy around it, but I've been having tons and tons of fun. 

Admittedly, I'm not necessarily the biggest Resident Evil fan out there. I've only played all the main entries (1-8), with my playthroughs of 2 and 3 being those of the recent remakes and that's about it. If you can accept that this game is faster paced and not fully authentic to the original, then you should have at least an enjoyable time with this remake, especially if you like replayability. I would definitely only recommend it on a sale though (~20$ USD), because it would not be worth a full 60$ if you don't end up liking the game enough to keep playing it over multiple times.

Super late edit: I have since played RE3 Nemesis and ouch. Lots left out of this remake, making it feel incomplete. While the remake leaves so much out, I still recommend it on a sale since what's there is fun. However, I really wish this remake had done more.

This should've never been a standalone game, but rather an expansion pack for RE2. 
Only get in a pack during discounts, otherwise this is mostly a waste of money. Watch a walkthrough or play the original.

RE2 is amazing for both old and new players, a perfect game introduces new players to the franchise and a nice recap for returning players. However, RE3 feels like a new game - which is not a completely bad idea, but I feel sorry for some classic puzzles like the statue puzzles at the police station are removed. The biggest problem is the content is not that rich, I enjoyed the subway station area map but constantly fighting that undead Nemesis along the way feels tedious, and in the end I don't feel any excitement at all.

Also, RE2 has better mechanics than RE3. When it comes to the cutscenes, RE2 sometimes requires pressing the right key for actions, which offers player a better immersive experience but not in RE3. It's disappointing because Jill constantly experiences emergency incidents. The other thing is, RE2 has a better rhythm for fighting walkers and proceeding the story, yet in RE3 the fighting part is large with only one subway line puzzle to solve, I especially did not enjoy Brad dealing with endless waves of walkers in the hospital reception room. Speaking of characters, Jill is loveable but I don't see a reason to like Carlos.

I constantly have a sync issue. The voice always comes 2 seconds earlier in the cutscenes, annoying to hear the explosion and crashes before the graphic. It's like a spoiler. What's more, I can't get full screen and the graphic is terrible. 
I rate RE3 positive, it has flaws but still meets my standard for a good game.

The two biggest complaints are it's too short and they cheapened the combat experience in order to raise the ""difficulty"". I can see merit in both those statements. 

As an example of cheapened combat in RE 4 (2005) the chainsaw bagman had a one hit kill and so does nemesis in this game. There's a certain ""run from Nemesis"" sequence where he will jump into the air for some kind of aerial attack which ultimately ends with an instant kill when he lands on top of you. The difference between the two instakills is that you could run away and evade the chainsaw bagman before he got too close in the original RE 4 and in this game Nemesis does not miss when he jumps into the air.

There's just no nice way of putting it... it's a cheap big ""D"" move.

FULL REVIEW

It's been 3 years now since this game was released, but since I'm going back to play through all of them again, I figured I'd leave a review now that the hype for these games have gone down...

Of all the remakes when it comes to RE1, RE2, RE3, and RE4, this game would by far be my favorite in the series.... had it been a bit longer, and been more true to the original. :/

The original RE3 for the PS1 is a long and exciting ride, through MANY various locations in Racoon City. Where as this ""remake"" is a MUCH shorter version with MUCh... and I do mean MUCH fewer locations included.

Remember the [spoiler]city part at the start of the original RE3? Yup, 80% of that has been cut. And the police station, the clocktower, the park, the factory...[/spoiler]... GONE!

I'm am not kidding... The game basically starts you off at the point where you meet [spoiler]Carlos and his group at the subway station[/spoiler]... (I am so upset writing this review xD), and to people who has never played the original, the pacing will feel ""okay""... But to anyone who has played RE3 on the PS1, you will feel like this remake is RUSHING you through the various locations from the original... :/

So yeah...

This saddens me quite a bit, since RE3 for the PS1 is one of my top favorite games of all time, on any platform, in my 32 year long life. ':D ALL the other RE remakes are such incredible 1 to 1 remakes... But for some reason the RE3 Remake is the only one that didn't get the full treatment. :/

[b]Why CAPCOM why!? ':D[/b]

In any case... What IS here... is a 10/10 experience if you are able to overlook the feeling of CAPCOM ******** you over by removing most of the game... The game will take about 4-8 hours to complete (it hurts just saying it out loud), depending on how fast you rush through the game. I took me sweet time, and it took me 8.3 hours to complete on my first playthrough. :|

Atm as I'm writing this review the game is 75% off (9,99€), which I think is a fair price at this point for a discount. The games ""normal"" price of 39,99€ is however MUCH to steep for the amount of hours you get out of the game... 

To put it into perspective... RE3 is 5€ per 1 hour of game time... Where as RE2 is 1.5€ per 1 hour of game time (for both Leon and Claires playthrough), and RE4 is 2€ per 1 hour of game time. ':D 

5 FREAKING POUNDS PER HOUR! (insert mindblown emoji)

(Breathe Daniel.... Breathe....)

But like I said, the game is quite a good experience. Just make sure to get it on sale, and DON'T expect a ""full version"" of the original RE3, like we got with the RE2 and RE4 remakes...",1682978108,1683374492,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly, it fails to live up to the expectations of RE2R.

PROS
+Yet again, the graphics are phenomenal, bordering on photorealistic.
+The character redesigns are all 10/10, hands down. Jill isn't fighting in a tube top, Carlos' new hair works pretty good, and Nemesis... well I'll get to him.
+Jill's undergone some changes that work well taken alone, though they are kind of awkward taken together. She's one part PTSD-stricken survivor (which makes sense from RE1), one part Sarah Conner-level badass (which makes sense considering she was in Delta Force before STARS), and one part genuinely-caring person (which makes sense considering she was one of the gentler members of STARS). Separately, in individual scenes, they work. Taken as a whole, it's a little wonky. Still a W in my book, though.
+Honestly, I now get why people like Carlos. Dude's the definition of a good guy working for the bad guys, but he still tries to do what's right. He's distinctive from other ""soldier-type"" characters, and I could totally see Jilos as a ship now. Don't know if I support it, but I see it.
+Mikhail is such a bro! Man's the definition of a proper Russian who's got your back!
+Nikolai is such a scumbag! Man's the definition of a crappy Russian who's only got his own interests in mind!
+Brad has a much better send-off than he did in RE2 or RE3. Man makes up for his actions in RE1 and proves why he's STARS material (most of the time).
+The title character from the original, Nemesis has been reimagined to be less of a super-Tyrant and more of a horrific abomination, becoming more animalistic every time he takes too much damage. Many disapprove of the new ""trashbag"" outfit, but I genuinely prefer it. It's like the bags keep him in the shape of something human(ish), and he reveals his true form as he sheds it.
+In a similar manner, each scripted encounter with Nemesis feels like a desperate run for safety, only becoming a fight when there's no choice. There are exceptions to this, which I'll cover under Cons, but there's no ""oh shit"" feeling quite like watching him grab a rocket launcher and target you.
+Also, DAMN that introduction sequence was terrifying.
+Return of numerous elements from RE3. The one which stands out most to me is the dodge mechanic. While sort of unnecessary, it pairs well as similar, but different from Leon's parrying in RE4R.
+kid named FINGeR makes his Resident Evil debut! Jokes aside, the sequence is unpopular with many fans, but I love it sheerly for its massive BDE.
+That hospital holdout felt like some good, high-stakes, high-tension stuff! Loved it!
+Hunters are a pain in the ass.
+Solid replayability, and good post-game unlocks like alternate costumes, infinite ammo, and special gear.
+Oh yeah, btw the sound design is fantastic.

CONS
-To start with the elephant in the room: this game ships with Resident Evil: Resistance. It's the only way to get that game, which is an asymmetrical Dead by Daylight-style game. Honestly, it's pretty decent, and plays alright if you have multiple buddies to join up with. Unfortunately, the game is dead, so the only matches you'll (maybe) find will be solidly 300+ ping. In other words, we missed on a lot of stuff for an experiment that (to date) has crashed and burned. This only adds to the impression that RE3R is just a cheap cash-grab after RE2R's success. Maybe it is. I still liked it, but it's definitely not at the same level of excellence.
-It's a good thing this game has lots of post-release content, cuz dang is it short. Getting an S+ ranking in one playthrough of RE2R at highest difficulty must be done in under 5 hours (including both parts). In RE4R, that number is 5:30. In this, that number is 2 hours. This isn't a complaint on having less time, it's a complaint on there being less to do.
-Multiple missing elements from RE3 which arguably make that game better. Live Selection is the biggest one which bugs me, but others also cite the lack of multiple endings and the missing Clock Tower sequence as shortcomings (accurate, but they don't bug me as much, I guess).
-Remember how I said Nemesis was terrifying in scripted events? He's absolutely not outside of them. I was expecting something along the lines of Mr. X from RE2R: a constant presence keeping you pressured to be stealthy, careful, and constantly on the tip of your toes. Instead, he falls from the heavens and chases you while having access to a whip. Pretty unimpressive, to be honest.
-Worse, the thing goes down with ONE frag grenade on Hardcore! Not ""stunned so you can get distance"" like Mr. X, outright defeated with a loot drop! Disappointment doesn't begin to describe my feelings towards this.
-There's some hinting at what's going on behind the scenes with Nikolai, especially considering scenes from RE4R, but overall I felt more confused than anything in any scene where he was being evil.
-I know they only included one poisonous creature in the Remake, but I really wish there were multiple. I can't express how wrong it feels to cure poison with a green herb instead of a blue herb.
-Look, I love the FINGeR, and it's cool, but I gotta admit, it looks a little big to be man-portable.

Is it as good as RE2R or RE4R? No. Is it worth the full price? No. Is it worth playing on sale? Abso-freaking-lutely.",1683285629,1683285629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The only difference is Nemesis moves and hits like a truck, and can just appear anywhere the game decides. In an alleyway? He's coming through the wall. Running towards a gate? He's in front of the gate. Running down stairs? He's punching fuck out of you the entire way down.

Or you can just throw a single grenade and completely trivialise every early encounter with him. Could we not have met in the middle somewhere?

But none of that even compares to the amount of chase sequences where all you're doing is holding forward. You might be in a hall, on a fire escape, on a bridge, on the floor, and Nemesis might be a man, a dog, a gaping dragon, he might be holding a wall, or a missile launcher, or a big snake, but all you are doing is pressing forward.

That's it. The whole game. Running away from Nemesis. Until the game decides you have to fight him for a little bit. To kill him of course. He's definitely dead after that fuel tank explodes. No? Then definitely after the C4 and the train right? No? Then definitely after he gets cut in half by a portcullis. No? Then definitely after he gets smooshed with a crane and boiled in acid. No?

Jill's really going to work hard and try and think of a solution to this unstoppable monster then. It's going to be her ingenuity that saves the day, right? Oh, there just happens to be a railgun powered by a room and he just happens to be in the room. It really is a miracle that those grenades used to be so effective.

Ah well, I'm glad we get to break up the monotony of running away from Nemesis by playing as Carlos, captain of the bland society of blandness. The guy working in an elite mercenary group operated by Umbrella who was too stupid to think it was strange that a pharmaceutical company had an elite mercenary group.

Capcom has been absolutely killing it when it comes to the remakes of these treasured classics, RE3 is no exception, fantastic remake with all the horror and unique locations that you come to expect..

The game is set in Raccoon City, which has been hit by a biological weapon that has turned most of the population into zombies. You play as Jill Valentine, a member of the Special Tactics And Rescue Service (STARS), as she attempts to escape the city and uncover the truth behind the outbreak.

One of the standout features of Resident Evil 3 is the Nemesis, a terrifying bio-weapon that is pursuing Jill throughout the game. The Nemesis is relentless, and you will need to use all of your skills to avoid him and survive. The game also features a variety of other enemies, including zombies, dogs, and other monsters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.

The gameplay in Resident Evil 3 is a mix of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. You will need to search the city for supplies and weapons, fight off hordes of zombies, and solve puzzles to progress through the game. The combat is satisfying, with a variety of weapons to choose from, and the puzzles are well-designed and challenging.

The graphics in Resident Evil 3 are top-notch, with detailed environments and character models that bring the game's world to life. The game also features a dynamic lighting system that adds to the game's creepy atmosphere.

One of the game's main drawbacks is its length. The game is relatively short, with a runtime of around six hours. However, the game does offer replayability, with multiple difficulty levels and a variety of unlockables to discover.

Overall, Resident Evil 3 is a fantastic survival horror game that is sure to please fans of the genre. The Nemesis is a terrifying adversary that will keep you on your toes, and the game's mix of exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving make for a satisfying experience. While the game is on the short side, it offers plenty of replayability and is a must-play for fans of the series.",1619564355,1683052787,True,5,0,0.567281603813171387,0,True,False,False

Is there anything else worth mentioning that's better compared to the original? Unfortunately no, unless you consider tank controls as something bad, depending on whether you prefer the pre-re4 games. Now, what are the cons? There's a lot:

[b] Cut content [/b] 
If you're gonna cut content from the original then atleast add something different that replaces it, in resident evil 3 remake there's 4 main areas: [spoiler] Streets, sewers, hospital, laboratory [/spoiler], this isn't bad, the problem is the fact that you only spend about 30 minutes in one of these areas, and the starting area is literally [b] 2 streets connected to each other [/b], can you really compare it to the original that relied in shortcuts to keep the map incredibly dense? No, you can't. The level design in the remake gets old pretty fast because the scenery changes a grand total of 4 times in 6 hours of gameplay, compare that to areas like the clock tower (cut), the factory (cut), downtown, city park (cut), the lab, Nothing to compensate.

[b] Nemesis [/b] 
I'm not gonna get into detail on why Nemesis is a problem, I'm gonna leave a video that sums up almost all my thoughts, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfwvNUxF2uw&t=537s] it's worth watching on its entirety but if you want a shorter explanation start the video at 36:40 [/url]

[b] Jill is Mary Sue incarnate [/b]
Do you remember Chris in Resident Evil 5 hitting a rock with his bare hands with such force that it ends up moving? Everyone criticized that moment as being completely bullshit and out of place for a Resident evil game, [b] Chris may be jacked to the tits and highly trained, but nothing can excuse that moment as being something doable. [/b] Jill did some very badass things in the original Resident evil 3, but none of them were too unrealistic, at the end of the day Jill is only a highly trained and experienced individual, with that being said, [b] HOW [/b] is Jill able to carry a big ass railgun, with her bare hands!?!?! That makes absolute ZERO sense, even RE5 Chris would struggle to lift that absolute monster, Jill's ability to survive to insane stuff is also dialed up to 11, Jill falls from TWO buildings, in one of them she falls on her back from a building of atleast 3 floors, COMPLETELY unharmed, compare her to Leon in Resident evil 2 remake, the rookie cop that is barely able to hold his ground, [b] Leon is portrayed just like in the original, because that's how he's supposed to be [/b], nothing over the top, and this should've been the same for Jill.

 [b] Difficulty scaling [/b] 
There's 5 difficulties: Assisted, Standard, Hardcore, Nightmare and Inferno. With this wide array of difficulty options you expect an even scaling in difficulty, it's not. It took me 4 hours to complete the game for the first time in hardcore, this should be okay considering that there's 2 other difficulties that are supposed to be the hard ones, little issue, [b] the delay between attacks of every enemy is lowered significantly [/b], this may not seem like a big issue at first with normal enemies, but this means that you will get stunlocked to death a lot more frequently, this is frustrating, but Nemesis is another story, Nemesis in inferno will stunlock you to death, EVERY time. If he connects one attack it's over, you're dead, this holds true in almost all encounters with Nemesis, the final boss on inferno is THE HARDEST BOSS IN THE RESIDENT EVIL FRANCHISE, he hits you once with his zero delay attacks YOU'RE DEAD, GAME OVER, if you're having issues with the boss watch [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc5Ai4QwU5s] this video [/url].

This review is not like the others. I haven't played the original RE3 so all that stuff about missing certain areas and events doesn't really bother me. However... I HAVE TO SAY THAT I ABSOLUTELY HATE NEMESIS. After beating the game 4 times in a row. First one in the span of a week and the other 3 within the same 24 hours period. Once on Hardcore. Once on Nightmare with no infinite ammo or any sort of bonus. Once on Inferno with no infinite ammo/bonus. And one more time on Inferno (this time with 1 coin of each type and the infinite RPG). I can't express how much I FUCKING HATE NEMESIS. The more I played, the more I've gotten used to the game in general as any normal person would but HOLY SHIT, Nemesis' last stage is a MOTHERFUCKING pain in my tremendously humongous gluteus maximus. Buddy does not know how to follow one single pattern. He has 27 billion different patterns that he might act on at any moment whenever he feels like it. He might follow the same pattern for 47 tries in a row and then just for jokes he'll pull a completely different pattern out of his black hole looking anus of a face. Then he'll go back to the same ol pattern for another 93 tries and once again during the last part of the fight he'll Will Smith the shit outta Jill 8 times in a row making sure she definitely transforms into a Jill Sandwich.

Conclusion: as a person who hasn't played the original game I can tell which parts felt rushed and understand why some people were bothered by it and called this game trash. However, I enjoyed most of it and think it was a pretty good game. What really matters tho is that I HATE NEMESIS. FUCK NEMESIS. I ENJOYED FRYING HIS UGLY MUCK EVERY SINGLE PLAYTHROUGH. AFTER THE FIRST PLAYTHROUGH THE MAIN THING THAT MOTIVATED ME TO KEEP PUSHING WHEN PLAYING THE HARDER DIFFICULTIES WAS THE THOUGHT OF BEING ABLE TO SHOVE THAT BIG ENERGY GUN INTO HIS MOUTH AND BLOW HIS FACE UP ONCE AGAIN.

In this review i will explain why Resident Evil 3 Remake is an outstanding game and why it doesn't deserve the criticism mostly.

Story:
Don't come in to this game and expect the quality of story from it's predecessor. The story and the game might be a bit short, but i think that this game delivers an enjoyable fast paced story. We have our Characters Jill and Carlos which synergize both really well together and create enjoyable moments. As i said, there is not much to the story in this game, but if you're interested in the lore you can view it on youtube or search it up on the internet, worth it in my opinion, as your experience with the game itself gets way better. 

Gameplay: 
This is where the game shines. And for me the gameplay was better than Resident Evil 2 Remake. I know that there weren't that much differences, but theres one huge new mechanic, which complety changes the gameplay. It's the ability to dodge and parry, which frees you from the impaired state and gives you actually the ability to be more mobile while fighting hostiles. Apart from that it really plays like RE2 Remake. In RE2 Remake the Tyrant was tuff, but in this part Nemesis is extremely obsessed with Jill. I don't really remember moments were he wasn't chasing me around. I don't want to say more about him, cause the new players of the game should experience him for themself.

Graphics:
The Game looks and runs really well on the RE Engine, definitly a visual brilliance.

Conclusion:
This game is amazing even if some people won't agree, because they missed some characteristics of the original, which is understandable, but doesn't justify their criticism that the gameis bad. It might not be the remake that the fanbase wanted, but it's for 5-7 hours an amazing game, with two charming protagonists. I'd recommend this game for people that just want to enjoy the gameplay and don't want to deal with a complex story. You should buy this game when it's on sale, because it's a bit pricy for the short experience. I will give this game a personal score of 9,5/10",1682969985,1682969985,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is played from the role of Jill Valentine, the STARS officer who was already the protagonist of the first Resident Evil (AFAIK; never played it). The story begins during the outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, following Jill's attempts to get out of the city alive.

Much like RE2, RE3 combines action-rich exploration with survival horror, though RE3 feels much more linear compared to its predecessor. A single playthrough took me seven hours, but according to an achievement it can be done in less than two hours. There is no incentive for a second playthrough (unlike in RE2, where you could choose between two protagonists and follow different stories). This makes the game somewhat short for its price, even on sale.

The game is played in the third person, featuring Jill as the primary protagonist, and Carlos in two shorter sequences. Both characters are likeable if somewhat bland; Jill certainly doesn't have as much personality as, say, Lara Craft from the Tomb Raider reboot, or Aloy from the Horizon franchise, or Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite, or many other characters from story-focused games. The plot likewise won't win any literature prize, but it works well enough to get things going.

From a technical standpoint, the game is fantastic. The graphics are gorgeous, sounds are great, gameplay is fun and engaging. I prefer this kind of action-rich horror quite a lot over the subpar jumpscare kind that has become popular in recent years. The gunplay is pretty fun, the exploration part is very much reduced to RE2, and Nemesis as a boss enemy is kind of bleh. 

Resident Evil 3 is a fun and interesting game to play through over a weekend, even if you aren't a particular friend of horror games (like me). I'm not sure if I'll ever play through the game a second time -- there are better games if you want a good story, and better games if you want cool gameplay -- but I'd still call this an easy recommendation, and I'm certainly looking forward to playing RE4 once the price drops in sales. 

I'd recommend buying the game on sale, when it's typically 75% off (10€ / 10$ / comparable prices).

Edit: Note that there are lots of mods out there that typically change only Jill's appearance. I used one that prevented Nemesis from chasing me around (because that got kind of tedious). Most mods are made for the non-raytracing version of the game, which can still be accessed through the beta versions of the game properties.

Note further that this game comes with some free multiplayer game thingy, which I'm told is not that great (due to cheating players, not because the game itself is terrible). I haven't checked that out, and don't plan to.",1682945446,1682945663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game being to short depends on person to person. All of the resident evil games are short. So people crying doesn't make any sense when the og resident evil 3 is short. Took me 10 hours first play through on hardcore. Going to beat it again to get a higher rank and you should do the same also. After beating it on hardcore you unlock two more difficulties extending the Replay ability of the game. This remake doesn't blow peoples minds because it came after resident evil 2. Re2 was are first glimpse into what these remakes are. It will never have the same wow factor as it did when first experiencing the remakes. Nemesis wasn't disappointing for me but og players sure he is. Because most of his involvement is in scripted events. Not all like people on youtube would have you think. There is a section at the beginning of the game involving the train plot where he comes after you in the street. We needed more of that shame Capcom didn't expanded with Nemesis. All tho boss battles with Nemesis are epic. The game even on hardcore seems really easy. So definitely play that first then inferno and nightmare. As far as the story it doesn't seem as big as resident evil 2 remake. Feels more like a side story rather than the full blown discovery into what umbrella and there intention was. Probably because it treats gamers as if they already know all this because you should play re2 before playing re3. The game is more third person action shooter rather than what i prefer resident evil to be which is a survival horror. But one thing it is and succeeds is full on intensity. Especially in a part of the game involving Carlos in the hospital which never seems to get the credit is should. Jill and Carlos the main characters are both voiced well. The game does have a Lame main human villain. The villain and twist in the first game was much better. Same for the twist involving a character in the second game was done better also. If you really liked the first two games then this is worth it.,1682731717,1682731717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The controls are fluid and refined—some of the best controls in an RE game or otherwise. One of the best added features is the dodge mechanic. It's similar to the dodge in the the RE Revelations series but it actually works. It's more intuitive than the way they did it in RE2R where you couldn't dodge but had to carry a knife or grenade and use that to avoid grabs instead.

Another great addition are the ""coin"" boosts. You can really customize your play style if you are willing to sacrifice a storage spot. So, even beyond normal, hard, and even harder modes, you can tweak the difficulty from within there with the coins.

Jill and Carlos' characters are generally well done, neither too invincible, too weak, too arrogant, nor too obnoxious as are characters in many modern games. The Mikhail villain is a bit overly one-dimensional, though.

The upgrades and rewards systems are likewise actually attainable without being ultra-expert level player (like RE2R required) nor playing for a million hours. With moderate to generous repeated gameplay, you can achieve enough weapon kills and other reward points to unlock funner stuff — including the RE trademark infinite weapons which always make for a fun playthrough. There's also a very fun fire knife called Hot Dogger that won't ever break and will set enemies ablaze briefly with every strike.

The game was criticized for being too short or excluding some stuff from original, but what is actually there is polished and I don't recall a single glitch. You don't see much criticism of what is actually there - if this had been a DLC for RE2R, more people would rave about it. It's also a great game for single evening speedrun.

Resident Evil 3 is one of those chapters which were in my backlogs for a while. I’ve heard earlier that game is too short, as well that it’s not such horror. As well metacritic score shows, that game didn’t match users so much. After I finished the game may tell that this game is well done.

[h1] Main plot [/h1]

The story is interesting enough. We see a story of stars officer - Jill Valentine, who has been in Raccoon city, when started an epidemic. During all game we see one story from two characters - Jill and Carlos. While to see the hole story for both characters in RE 2 we used to play a new game from another characters view, here we have answers immediately. But I still have a question to one episode - [spoiler] in last part of the game Carlos went in underground to find a vaccine, and missed for almost a day. When Jill woke up she decided to find Carlos. So Jill made a vaccine, and then found Carlos. What Carlos has been doing all this time in underground? [/spoiler] If game shows us all story from both sides it would be correct to make at least 15 min episode where shows ‘Carlos was walking and then felled down’ for example.

Although the story is interesting - it’s very fast paced. The whole game I had no time to stop and get a rest, at this time I had a new cutscene, or a fight. So while previous part was more about puzzles and searching for keys, this part is more about action.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]

Technically main mechanics were taken from RE 2 remake. Almost all mechanics are the same, but we now have an option to parry. It makes game much easier, because after each well done parry the scope automatically rises on opponents head.

The game more looks as a shooter then horror, what is true. Before each big fight game gives us enough bullets, and during all game I had no filling of weapon deficit (have played on normal level).

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

During the whole game I had only one crash, but otherwise game is done perfectly. Despite the fact that the game is very quickly passed on the plot, there are no complaints. Yes, the game is not long, if you know what is happening, you can really go through it in 3-4 hours without difficulty. It took me 7 hours, despite the fact that I went through it without straining and died a lot of times.
But in general I had enough fun, and enjoyed the game.",1682462469,1682462527,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I actually had to lower the difficulty after my in game encounter with nemisis because I kept dying. I'll probably reverse it after I figure out the timing on a perfect dodge. I was only able to pull one off successfully against Nemisis and one against a regular zombie. 

The game is a lot of fun, challenging, and Jill Valentine is smoking hot. Definitely recommend it. The cons on this game for me is the perfect dodge mechanic window is way too tight especially against the undead. Being able to dodge roll away from slow zombies should be alot easy than this. I also think the on screen prompt to mash or hold (depending on your setting) should feel more responsive. I don't know if it actually does anything besides get the zombie off of you. It definitely doesn't prevent a bite or damage.

It was cool seeing how it connects to what has happened in Police Station before you had arrived at it with Leon in Re 2.

They may have overdid it with Nemesis a little bit, at some point it got so annoying how constantly he was chasing after us  and it felt tedious after a while (and let's be honest he had countless opportunities to easily kill us but luckily we got plot armor in this game), in that department Re 2 did a better job with Mr. X who was also chasing you through the whole game but it definitely felt much more better balanced between the story and gameplay.

The biggest thing I enjoyed was the lack of puzzles, I'm not a fan of puzzles at all so all that going back and forth in Re 2 I found really annoying but in this game there was no such a problem. 

Story is also great like in any other Resident Evil game.

But RE3 felt like a half-hearted side project. Reused environments, enemies, graphics, etc. I played it once and never touched it again. So when people say, ""I can't believe they cut out the clock tower in the remake!"", I'm thinking ""I don't even remember the clock tower.""

Judged on its own merits, RE3make is a fun romp. I enjoyed it way more than the original, for sure. But it's just not the masterpiece that RE2make was. It lacks the depth and replayability of that game. I think that comes down to the linear nature of RE3; With 1 & 2, you finish your first playthrough thinking, ""Oh yeah, I could have done this first and saved myself so much running around."" Here, every playthrough is more or less the same. And yes, the ""Nemesis Choices"" of the original would have helped a bit in that department. 

After a while, RE3make feels like you're just running from one boss encounter to the next. And then it's over in ~6 hours. Is it worth $60? Nah. But catch it on sale and it's worth experiencing.

I'm going to be honest. This is going to be a low effort review because if I would make an effort, I would basically still be copying my Resident Evil 2 review. So if you want detail to my rating, just read that. But I still think this is amazing. Keeping up the same quality is probably even better than a better game in general. Why? Because while it is still very good, you keep expectations for a continuation on the same level as before, reducing the chances for the player's disappointment in future titles.
Anyway, yes, I think this game is just as good as its predecessor. Gorgeous graphics and sound design, engaging and growing mechanics and a good but ""basic"" story.

Starring Jill, Carlos and of course the Nemesis who takes his time off from following survivors who just want to repair some generators, to following the last member of S T A R S. 
It is really something different to be followed by a something that only screams STARS to you.
It is definitely shorter then the other Resi games I played but it is unique and has a great implementation so that compensates it because it makes every moment more worth it.
Speaking of worth, the game is definitely worth your money and time, so go ahead and play.
However, there are some things that I dislike and the most important of them would be the Item management. When my inventory is full and I don’t have a heal item with me but I am injured. Why cant I just take a heal item in a room and heal myself immediately. Why do I have to delete something out of my inventory in order to be able to pick it up so that I can heal myself, so that I now have an empty space in my inventory. It is annoying but not such a great deal.
All in all it is good.

Game is short, Easy to follow.
Huge upsets with Nemesis and the way they implemented it. Mr X had alot more memorable moments than this Shit.

- Awesome graphic
- Very detailed faces and character expressions in cut-scenes
- Very atmospheric light/shadow ambiente
- Various zombie designs
- Played on 3070 with all settings to max and no dlss: Constant fps above 100

### Characters 6/10 ###
- The characters all stay very flat, but at least you play Jill most of the time
- Carlos is likable, but there is zero backround story
- All characters act absolutely cliché

### Story 4/10 ###
- Very very generic
- No surprises
- If you want a good story, play RE 7 + 8 :)
- I love everything about RE, so I didn't really bother

### Gameplay 9/10 ###
- Port to pc is very well executed
- Fast and easy to learn key layout
- Aiming goes really well with mouse
- Still quite difficult in differenct situations (played on hardcore)
- Even one zombie can get a problem, if he gets to close
- The dodging was clunky, but ok for some Nemesis encounters and ofc. the hospital situation -.-
- Tipp: Use the dodging on Carlos when you fight the hunters in the hospital. You have no chance otherwise, if you play on hardcore
- Some refreshing tasks, some nice secrets, but the amount of puzzles were drastically reduced, compared to the RE 2 remake


### Level design 8/10 ###
- Exploring is rewarded
- There is not much to explore, though. Pretty straight forward with some secrets not too far off the main route
- Minor puzzles, but nothing very memorable
- The overall design was pretty fitting and really well executed, especially roaming around the streets of Racoon City
- The levels aren't as complex and huge as RE 2 remake and I actually managed to play through the game in under 10 hours, with everything explored

### Overall 7.2/10 ###
What can I say, I just love Resident Evil horror games. So it is definitely a win for me. I played the RE 2 remake (which was outstanding) and this game was still good and enjoyable for me.
The playtime is really short, so try to get it on sale, because it is not worth full price money for what you get.
There is a shop after the game, that enables you to buy new items and weapons, so the re-playability is pretty high. Also additionally there is a new difficulty (nightmare).
The ending of the game was very generic and the part I disliked the most. Final boss fight, another boss fight and then a super cheese final cutscene.
But, as I said, I love RE, so I still enjoyed it a lot.
I'd say if you have never played RE, I would start with the RE 2 remake, then the RE 4 remake, then RE 7 + 8 and then RE 3.",1681511010,1681511065,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First of all, let's talk about the graphics. This game is so beautiful, it's almost a shame to cover it in blood and guts. Almost. And don't even get me started on the character models. Jill Valentine has never looked better, and Nemesis...well, let's just say he's a face only a mother could love. If that mother was a mutated monster, that is.

But let's talk about the real star of the show: the gameplay. This game is like a mix between a horror movie and a game of tag. You're constantly running from Nemesis, trying to find a way out of Raccoon City before it's too late. And let's not forget about the puzzles. If you're like me and can't figure out how to open a door without a keycard, then this game will have you scratching your head for hours.

Overall, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a thrilling ride that will have you on the edge of your seat...or hiding under it.

I'm really not a fan of Nemesis and the over the top action in this game. It's just goofy and going into this after playing RE2, which is pretty well grounded, this one was just ridiculous at times. So while I rolled my eyes a lot during my first playthrough, there was a lot I really enjoyed. 

The Good:
- The mechanics/gameplay are great. Most of it is carryover from RE2, but the game feels a bit smoother and maybe faster. The addition of the dodge mechanic also added some extra depth to the game when playing normally but especially when speed running. 
- Looks wise, it looks almost the same as the RE engine from RE2. Which is not a bad thing. RE2 looks amazing and so does this. RE3 might even look a bit better in a side-by-side but I couldn't notice any real differences. 

The Bad:
- The over the top action and goofy nemesis. This guy is just ridiculous. Mr. X was a lumbering presence like in the movie It Follows (go watch that if you haven't already), but Nemesis is hilarious. This man flies around the map like some evil version of Superman. I don't mind an intentionally OP enemy but they should have taken it down just a notch with this guy. It looked like he was moving at 1.5x speed and really just distracted me whenever he was around. And to make this complaint worse, the Nemesis just can't get the job done. He's an unstoppable machine when the game wants him to be scary and he's a bumbling idiot when the game wants Jill to escape or fend him off. 
- Maybe a minor complaint but boy does Jill take some damage throughout the game. I know it's just a game, but idk it just takes me out of it watching Jill drive a car off a 3 story parking garage (no seatbelt), crash it upside down, and walk away no biggie. 
- The BIGGEST con of this game is length. Not just in the main story but overall content. I was able to 100% this game in 18 hours. That is just way too short. 4.5 hours to beat it my first playthrough and my fastest playthrough was about an hour, hour and a half? Speed running aside, my first playthrough was not rushed at all. I played it very casually and still blew through it.

OVERALL, it's a fun Resident Evil game that's worth a playthrough. When the game goes on sale for $5-10 it's totally worth it. I'd say it's a rip-off at $40 so I can understand the hate this game gets.

And another complaint with Nemesis is the whole, oh the big bad isn't dead yet trope. It can be done well (like Mr. X in RE2 or Jack in RE7), but this wasn't it. I really just did not like the Nemesis so imo it's unfortunate how much of the game revolves around him (and yes I know, the game is called Nemesis).",1681458126,1681458126,True,2,0,0.525862038135528564,0,True,False,False

- Eagle and Weston Custom Shotgun is completely removed from the game. In OG, beating Nemesis rewards you with stronger weapon than your starting pistol and shotgun. Now Nemesis mainly drops you ammo, which you already used to down him, so what's the point of fighting him anyway.

- Nemesis, the nemesis fight is pretty good, but you could just down him with a nade. 

- Lack of costume, not going to talk about how many costume that Jill has in OG RE3, but a Resident Evil game that has little to no costume (Jill has 2 and Carlos has a hair make-over), is an insult to the Resident Evil Franchise.

- Removal of iconic scene from the OG, OG has one of the most memorable scenes in the RE Franchise and they removed most of them.

- Lack of puzzle, OG has the most puzzles in an RE game. In Remake, you have one, the Train station puzzle which the answer to it is just infront of you.

- I would highly recommend this. Even at $40 I would feel this would be worth it.
- RE Boomer fans are impossible to please because they don't know what they want and they all want different things.
- I enjoyed this far more than RE2 Remake. This felt more like RE4's playstyle. Fairly linear, little backtracking, more story, less puzzles, more action.
- I never played the OG on PSX. This game standing on it's own is fantastic. I would honestly replay this over RE2 Remake.
- My playtime casually was 11 hours. The playtime on howlongtobeat between this remake and the RE3 OG on the PSX, is about the same. 6+ hours. But a 6 hour playthrough is not possible imo if you play casually. Unless you're rushing and skipping stuff 4 hours seems not possible at all on a first playthough. Yes, RE2 Remake is a longer game if you do leon + claire 2nd scenario. But RE3R's story is more interesting.

Pros
- Jill. She's is now my favorite RE character.
- There wasn't constant pressure like RE2 Remake with Mr. X where you would run to the other side of the police station, only to have Mr. X appear right in front of you. In RE3R, if there is pressure, it is temporary and not constant.
- Wielding the knife in RE3 remake made more sense than how RE2 remake did it.
- There's no durability to the knife in RE3 remake, which i would prefer but you also can't use it deter a bite either.
- Scripted animation sequences were well done, the graphics overall were also very good.
- Characters were very high quality, and so were the animations. Mocap I'm guessing was used.
- I saw very little reused assets from RE2 remake, other than the police headquarters which was less than 1/8th of the game, and even that wasn't exactly identical.
- The story was far more interesting and action packed than RE2 Remake. But less horror survival.
- The music was absolutely significantly better than RE2 Remake in every way. RE2 Remake music was either weak or non-existent/silent in areas it shouldn't have been.
- I really enjoyed the boss battles. I died a few times, so they felt challenging, but not impossible and they weren't easy I felt.
- I didn't feel the game was a walk through the park or overly difficult.
- The dodge mechanic is handy.

Cons
- The laser sight could have been graphically improved other than just a red dot on the HUD...
- There are a few bugs, but nothing I felt was a deal breaker, such as collision areas blocking my shots when they should have hit the zambies. Sometimes dialog only occurred if I died first and replayed the scene.
- I still don't know what pressing A repeatedly during a zombie bite does... I always get bit and take damage.
- There were a few textures (very few) that could have had an increase in res. Fire maybe, nade explosion particles, and a few environment textures I saw, but that's all.
- The fire in some places looks somewhat poor and planar, and the animation rate for it felt a little too low to me.
- The animation LOD budgeter kicks in at a distance that's a bit too close. This also occurs in RE2, but since you're always inside and you don't seem zambies at a distance usually, you don't notice it as much. So it looks like it's an RE3 only thing but it's not. Basically, when you view zambies from a distance, they animate at a low sampling rate so they look choppy, but I only noticed this in RE3R about 3 times total.
- The fire hose sequence with the water spraying at the beginning of the game was quite poor imo, but it's a minor forgettable thing.
- The biggest thing I felt could have been better in RE3R were the 1 shot kills/insta deaths. Several times there was nothing I could do to avoid it or I would get stun locked and get his 3 times in a row resulting in death. Mainly with nemesis a couple times, and definitely with the dudes in the 2nd half of the game. So I saved often. I died about 30 times for my first run though this game. Fortunately, there is usually a save point before the 1 shot kills seem to occur, so not much time was lost and it wasn't as annoying as it could have been.

Note: Some of these things there are mods for to correct, so that might be something you could look at.

Overall the things I noticed that are negative are also minor. The biggest thing being the 1 shot kills. But, despite this, I would definitely suggest playing it anyways, but just make sure you save liberally to avoid some frustration.

With just that in mind, I was able to tell it was a short (speedrun friendly?), qte/scripted sequence heavy, and not really as deep. I kept thinking to myself ""this is like a call duty campaign version of RE"".

After hearing community feedback and feedback that actually had more of a connection to what made Jill special, the map design, the constant fear of the nemesis and little details of the original game missing, I realized that this is a disappointment for RE standards.

One of my favorite creators, Mayo, posted a video today about the big cuts in the Resident Evil Remakes, and is able to back up the consensus that RE3 has some of the biggest negative changes to the original.

first of all because the nemesis here takes up too much space in the scene and minimizes the rest of the enemies.

the product is fine.
the animations, the characters and their character, the enemies and their details, the environment, the plot and the graphics contribute to the creation of a story and a gameplay that manages to satisfy the expectation.

The suite of weapons available to each playable character creates opportunity to play your way, though my favourite weapon is the grenade launcher.

I only do reviews out of a personal sense of satisfaction anyway. So, this review is super bare bones because I havenb't played the game in a long time. 
This game is okay. I never played the original game (or anything that came out before Biohazard) so I can't speak for how well it relates to the original but I can tell you a few things. The game has the strongest start out of any RE game I've played. Jill and Carlos are a good duo. This game is unbelievably short. I can't even describe the way I played it because I bought it on Xbox One X and beat it a a few times before buying it on PC to boost my library and give it one last hurrah. It is so short. It's like 7 hours long if you take your time. It is not worth 60 dollars if they're even trying to sell it for that price anymore. It's worth more like 30 at most. The parts, from memory, go like: Wake up, run, make it to subway, gallivant around town, turn on power in unusually tense and well-made bug horror sequence, wake up scrotum demon... Part of the reason I was so excited for this game when it came out was the idea that Nemesis would function like Mr. X from the RE2 remake. This was not true, While he did act as a much more dangerous and interesting immortal antagonist, you only ever encountered him a couple of times and most of them were probably scripted. If you looted everything you were able to before triggering him then you probably won't see him outside of scripted chase sequences. I feel bad for the people who had to program him as an enemy that follows you, if he even does. I might be misremembering. Where were we? Wake up, run, make it to subway, gallivant around town, turn on power in unusually tense and well-made bug horror sequence, wake up scrotum demon, run to trigger subway, run to subway, run, go through sewers, make it up and beat him in a boss battle for the first time, walk a little and meet gunman, get chased with rocket launcher, meet Carlos. My memory for the next section is a little foggy but I think you do the most infuriating Carlos sequence ever imagined next. Actually, first they crash the subway together and Jill watches scrotum fall into the water while flailing. ""Bitch can't even swim."" Then, he mutates into a whole different creature and you fight him, he plays dead and then shoots heroin up your left butt cheek and you pass out. Then you do the Carlos hospital sequence before he comes and finds you? Is that right? Then Jill wakes up in the hospital and does a bunch of stuff. That is, after a defensive battle. Then we go into the basement and enter the endgame. We fight two or three regenerators and a couple of throwback enemies (hard to say throwback when we saw them two hours ago or less.) We make it through the secret underground lab and fight Nemesis AGAIN in a boss fight with little variation and the same gimmick. Then we walk two feet and fight him AGAIN. Then we shoot the bad guy and escape on helicopter. The time it took me to type that all out was probably about 1/3 of the time it took to actually do all of that. That is how short the game was. Carlos was so hot. 
Anyway, despite being visually impressive and looking good in all areas that we appeared in, and having memorable Nemesis sequences, this game's only lasting legacy is the blender p0rnography that people continue to make to this day because of how hot Jill is. I'm gonna give this a thumb up because I first played it when I was too young to care about any of the flaws and as long as I enjoyed it at any point in time (whereas I now enjoy Jill Valentine ""game-over"" screens with my right hand) it counts as a good game in my book. 
By the way, I don't know why the company tried to make accompanying add-on games attached to both RE3 AND Village but both of them are complete garbage. I can honestly say I'd rather bite off every finger on both of my hands before I'd ever reinstall Resistance or even try RE:Verse. Capcom making those games is a crime against humanity beyond anything committed in WWI, WWII, and every crime in Britain combined.

This remake of RE3 is definitely disappointing. Not because it’s a bad game, but because it has nothing to do with the original RE3. 
They completely removed all puzzles from the game and made it just a zombie shooter. They also removed the majority of the original game locations and added new ones that are much shorter and reskins from RE2 remake. Even the bosses fights were removed and changed to very predictable repeated encounters. 
Anyway, the game isn’t bad had they given it a different name as a side story like Revelation.  But to call it RE3 remake is wrong.

And this might be a controversial opinion, but I think RE3 Remake is a better package than RE2 Remake (that said, both games are excellent). It improves on the formula without requiring you to play through the same content twice to get the full story. 

RE3 also handles its two playable characters better, with their stories working off each other instead of overlapping like it did previously - Jill & Carlos are partners, whereas Leon & Claire only really saw each other at the beginning/end of RE2.

Nemesis was also a great antagonist... While maybe not as foreboding as Mr. X in RE2, chasing you through the RPD corridors, it appears when it makes sense (scripted), which isn't a bad thing, and allows the setup if explosive set pieces.

Conclusion: While RE2 is a better video game, RE3 was a more fun experience for me. Overall, I do not agree with the statements saying RE3 Remake should've been relegated as DLC to the RE2 Remake... People complain about the runtime, which I don't really agree with (9 Hours, 1 Playthrough) for me, versus RE2 (14 Hours, 2 Playthroughs). So, is it shorter? From a certain perspective. But it has a slightly better overall story (more character driven than plot driven), with more locations, and a use of its characters that don't leave the player as confused as the prior remake.",1680838960,1680840113,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Hot Dogger is a  really cool unlockable! This game has a much higher skill ceiling than it initially seems and it's satisfying to climb it and to try to beat Nightmare/Inferno without the buff coins.

Well lets start with the good stuff, unlike RE2make, this game is more action oriented, and you get a dodge ability, but it can be tricky to master, doing a perfect dodge will allow you to aim directly at the enemy's weak spot while the game its slow down, so theres some skills to be learned here, at certain points in the game this ability is instead replaced with a parry like variant, which allows you to stun enemies instead. 

You get more ammo compared to RE2make as well, which is why this game is more action oriented, of course, that means more enemies, so you gotta be ready for that.

The higher difficulties will also change the item and enemy locations, which adds replayability for those looking to complete the game multiples times.

Speaking of, after completing the game once, you will unlock the Shop, which allows you to buy several items, from weapons, to items to boost your abilities, items normally found during the run, etc, which you can use on future runs, to buy them you gotta do various challenges found in Records, similar to the ones in RE2make, theres several of them, some which can be quite challenging, with the amount of points earned being based on the difficulty of the challenge, this gives you quite a bit of content to play this game which is quite short. 

The boss fights are also pretty good and enjoying, something i felt RE2make didnt quite get to the same extend. 

Now into the negative stuff...

The gore was toned down, this becomes obvious with the zombies, instead of how it was in RE2make, when shooting at zombies limbs which would cause them to tear and fall off, now just explode and disappear completely.

The game is REALLY short, this is due to entire sections and even bosses being cut from the original, which is a letdown overall, you first run, which if you do explore plenty, you might get maybe 6 hours, maybe even less, more experienced players can complete this game in likely less than an hour

The decision making mechanic was removed entirely as well. 

And the main disappointment... the star of the show, Nemesis himself, anyone that played the original RE3 or heard of it, has heard of this guy, and how much of a threat he was, while in this game hes definitely dangerous, most of his encounters are scripted instead of random, and like mentioned before, due to how short the game is, his gameplay as a pursuer is quite short, only lasting for about the a fifth of the game, after which he just becomes a recurring boss, after how amazing the Tyrant was in RE2make with how he constantly patrolled the RPD and being a constant random threat, Nemesis was a downgrade, while Nemesis is considerably more aggressive and dangerous, (specially on the higher difficulties) the short duration of the game greatly hurt him. 

Last thing would be that the final difficulty of this game Inferno can be quite... unfair to say the least, specially the final boss. 

Now, i said many negative stuff, but this is still a good game, but, its not really worth the price, which is largely cause of this game being tied with RE:Resistance, which is an online PvP game (which is pretty much dead at this point i believe) so i would recommend buying this game when its on sale if possible, thats why many people said this should have come has a DLC for RE2make, and i can see why. 

Its a good game, but its not a good remake.

It took me awhile to get used to the fact that you can dodge in this game using Jill or Carlos. Though I think this is the only game where you can dodge? The game itself is pretty short, so you can get through a lot of the game play and plot quickly when you play. As for the scares, it wasn't bad overall, but nothing really scared me a ton. The most important thing would be to always constantly look at your map since it lists out locked items and areas you haven't fully explored. As for puzzles, I will say there aren't too many complex puzzles in this game most are pretty straightforward.

If you do want more of a challenge, you can always switch your game to different modes. There are: Assisted, Standard, Hardcore, Nightmare, and Inferno. I was also told by my friend that the games adjusts naturally based on how you play. So if you play good you get more of a challenge but if you don't then it gets easier for you. Though it does prompt you to adjust the actual difficulty if you tend to die a lot.

I played the original years ago when it came out and was always luke warm to it, Code Veronica was a far better sequel to RE2 in my opinion. So I was less excited about trying this remake than I was for RE2. However, I was pleasantly surprised, this game was really fun! It had a nice mix of action and traditional RE elements, and I feel like the new additions and design choices only improved the game. 

The nemesis can still be a pain, but I feel like the pacing and overall story structure of this version makes far more sense. Both to modernise and just generally improve the original game. 

One of the complaints I've seen a lot is length and value. While I agree this is not a $60-70 game, it definitely fits in that $30 range quite nicely. I feel like people who complain about this game's length are the same people who keep buying and praising the 100+ hour bloated collect-a-thons that Ubisoft churns out every year. Quantity does not equal quality and a game like this proves that in spades. About an 8-10 hour campaign for a first play through is perfectly reasonable and enjoyable. All these people who say they are ""thorough"" and ""collect everything"" in a first playthrough, and yet, also claim it took them 3 hours are simply full of $hit. I like to play lots of games and I enjoy a mix of short and long campaigns to mix it up; it's about quality. if a game is tight, cohesive, and enjoyable at 10-15 hours that's great. 100 hour games can be enjoyable, but are also exhausting! Especially when bloated with needless things included just to pad the run time. 

This game, while linear, has an enjoyable enough gameplay loop that subsequent playthroughs can still be rewarding, but they're totally optional as well.

I did pre-order at full price, and while the extra costume was decent and the game was great, there's simply not enough here to warrant that price. I almost regret it...almost. 

Things I liked: 
+ The graphics are fantastic
+ The gore is great
+ There is a survival aspect with inventory management, upgrades to find and plenty of weapons late-game. 
+ This one shows more of Raccoon City, a setting I prefer over all
+ There are two playable characters (both of which are really awesome)
+ There are callbacks to the RE2 Remake
+ It's more Resident Evil goodness
+ Dodge mechanic is cool - going slow-mo after you perform a perfect dodge and aim! The other games sorely needed this. (RE2 and RE4 remake)
+ Cool live-action intro scene. Really works to get you immersed in the city. 
+ Faithful to the source material, minus some missing parts (see below)

Things I'm neutral on: 
O The boss doesn't hunt you down like in RE2 Remake, it's more scripted
O Less scary than the previous game. Plenty of panic moments, but less horror. 

Things I didn't like: 
- TOOO SHORT. The primary complaint of every review. My first Hardcore playthrough was about 5 hours and my Hardcore Speedrun was 1hour40min! I've heard reports of entire sections of the original game not remade here, so they could have easily done more. Here is a guide that shows what modders have done to make it more of a classic https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2818555371
- Boss fights aren't very interesting. They feel somewhat samey: Knock them down to a weak state and shoot the blob. 
- I get a black screen hitch at a certain point in the game EVERYTIME. Lost a no-save run to it on the hardest difficulty (there are no autosaves) and lots of other people are STILL having this issue. Have to download a Stream Version beta just to finish the game. 
- Not many costumes. 

Overall: 
I really enjoyed this game for what it was. 
A quick 5 hour game about a virus that I can play in parts while I go out and work in the real world plagued by a virus. (this review was written during covid). The game does feel rushed and definitely could have been longer. But what was here, I enjoyed. We asked for more and we got a bit more, just not as much as we hoped. 

That said, I'd buy another for about this length - the quality is just too damn good. 
I'd probably hold off on the pre-order though and wait for a sale. Which is what I'm telling you to do now that I've completed a dozen times!",1586994651,1680643931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes I know this game is short, yes I know this game cut stuff out from the original, and no I didn't play the original and don't have easy access to it either. Do I care about this stuff? No, not really. I respect others opinions however, I must politely say I don't really care that some people didn't enjoy this game as much as I did.

Now that that's out of the way, I loved this game so much as it was like Resident Evil 2: Remake for me. A game I couldn't put down and enjoyed all the way through to the end. Nemesis has always been one of the coolest Resident Evil characters to me, and as a newcomer to playing these games the most interaction I had with him prior to this game was in other media and games such as Marvel vs. Capcom. His persistent chase of Jill Valentine is awesome and iconic and I was super stoked to hear him yell at you whilst chasing you, and even stare at you menacingly in certain areas like the toy store. I love the doge roll Jill has and the shoulder check/punch Carlos has as both made game play encounters with hoards of zombies really fun to deal with!

I like to look at this games shorter length as a positive more than a negative, to me it makes it have more replay value. And honestly not every game needs to be the 80+ hour long open world game that is popping up everywhere nowadays to be classified as ""good"", but I digress.

This game is great I loved every minute of it and I will be replaying it very soon! I'll leave you with a quote from my favorite character,

I still however fully recommend this game! The Jill Valentine and Carlos are amazing characters and the plot blends in so nicely with RE2R.",1680500782,1680500782,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My second introduction to the series. It removes a lot of the puzzle sections of RE2 with more action segments. The story is a lot more captivating to. Leon S. Kennedy is my favorite RE protagonist but in my first intro to the series, RE2 Remake, the actor who played him was a little bland, emotionless, and lifeless. But here, Jill and Carlos' actor and character are amazing. Natural delivery, distinct personalities, and the random bits of dialogue in gameplay are perfect. The combat is actually satisfying compared to RE2, amazing optimization, and that stuff. I felt weirdly connected to them to. Jill reminds me of a TWD Season 3-4 Clementine. And Carlos is played by the same guy who played Javier in TWD Season 3, they both were the same ""wise-cracking, smartass"" with excellent delivery. One thing is that this game is way to short to be $40. Get it on sale for $10 like I did.
Summary: Jill Valentine and Carlos Oliveira is one of the last remaining people in Raccoon City to witness the atrocities Umbrella performed. To stop Jill, Umbrella unleashes their ultimate secret weapon: Nemesis.

I read and heard so much criticism about this game and was put off from buying it until now when it was on sale. I will say that this would have been amazing DLC for Resident Evil 2 remake as it's set at pretty much the same time...it would've been one hell of a package to have both games together as one with maybe some added magic to bring both games together!!

I didn't play the OG Resident Evil 3 so, for me, this feels like another great Resi game.

One thing I'm finding consistently annoying with the remakes is the dynamic/RnG health that enemies appear to have. I really do miss the old days of knowing that a head shot meant something OR explosives were really powerful. Pumping in 6-10 headshots and half a dozen knife slashes to a single zombie who still decides to stand up again just crazes me sometimes (as well as the fact that animations make placing your shots near impossible!) I hate that blowing off the head is a rare, crit move that only happens a few times per playthrough. I understand this has made combat more scary and relevant for the modern day but I still feel that knowing where you stand with damage output lead to a lot more enjoyment. 

The new ""feel"" works well and feels progressive for the times but they do not in anyway replace the original games. Resident Evil 2 OG had better scenarios and story telling and, apparently, Resident Evil 3 OG had a lot more content that was cut from this remake!! Capcom could have really changed the times and made these remakes something special...instead they've done an OK job which still stands up as decent gaming.

Definitely worth picking up in a sale if you're a fan of the franchise. I'm consistently buying Resident Evil games at sale as I feel they're approach to DLC is just money grabbing at it's worst. Can't wait to play Resident Evil 4 remake but that won't be until at least Christmas 2023 as I won't be buying it at full price...

NOTE: I'm around 9 hours in on my first playthrough....probably got another hour or two remaining..?!?!?

It should have been a game mode not even a dlc because all you do in the game battling with nemesis. All boss fights are repetitive and easy thanks to dodge mechanic. That mechanic maybe the best part about this game. I don't really like the clumsiness of RE games so dodging gives you a slim chance to get rid of that. Of course it's not perfect but the only improvement over the previous game is this. Other part of the game falls apart.

And it also reduces the difficulty a lot. You don't have to carry ink anymore to save the game but this makes the game super lame. Hardcore difficulty same as normal because you have lots of ammo throughout the game and you never have a problem with ammo. Since you don't need to worry about saving, it breaks the whole immersion though this game fails to create that kind of immersion from start.

But if we don't count this game as part of RE franchise, it's still can't beat average fps games. Story is awful and so short maybe that's because there's really no story out there at all, compared to the other games' stories from RE games this is the lowest it can get I guess. 

Sound effects and voice acting are good and level design is okay. Puzzles almost none exists so does the inventory management because game gives you lots of upgrades whenever you're starting to feel stuck when managing inventory. Gun upgrades and getting guns super easy since there's no puzzle or find an item to open a closet etc. 

Only play this if you got this free or from RE bundle (RE2, RE3, RE7, RE Village) you bought. I'm not recommending buying this stand alone.",1680294165,1680294165,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

I finished RE2 quite easily on Hard and never had any big problems with Mr. X. He was scary and a constant stalker but if you knew what you were doing you could avoid and get rid of him pretty easily.
But Nemesis, man that sucker never stops and just spawns randomly in front of you. Also his HP is far too large. Needing for 4 shots with the shotgun, Mr. X only needed two I think. 
Anyways, I have come to the point where I just cant progress further in the story. I am low on health, have no medikits and herbs but about to finish the first map, but Nemesis kills me everytime on the way to my last objective. Doesnt help that he is safe-camping, and runs faster than you, is able to jump and use his tongue on you.
I know his name is Nemesis bla bla. But Mr. X already felt unbeatable while still having a fair aspect to it.

I know, the game shouldnt be easy, but an enemy that you cant outrun, outgun or get rid of, just ruins the fun. Mr. X was so much better.",1680080691,1680080691,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The controls are tight and responsive, making it easy to navigate the game's environments and take down the hordes of terrifying enemies. The game also features a wide variety of weapons and upgrades, allowing you to customize your playstyle and approach each encounter in your own unique way.

Also, this game is literally just RE2 with two different characters and a few new small map areas as you essentially re-enter many of the same locations from RE2, like the Police Station. Additionally, this game has the shortest campaign of any Resident Evil remake so far, coming in at just under five hours to do a single playthrough while not skipping anything and completing all the side content. All of the other newer RE games have typically taken about 8-9 hours for a single playthrough. It is also worth noting that RE3 has no bonus content after you beat the game besides the usual, do this for unlimited ammo guns in your playthrough or unlock this to have this gun or tool at the start of your playthrough. Thus, it may just be me, but I personally have no desire to do a second playthrough of this game. Anyway, I did still enjoy playing the game and it's definitely worth it to purchase on either a bundle sale with another RE game or a 75% off or more sale.

I got about an hour in before I got stunlocked by Nemesis throwing punch after punch in a row whilst me spamming dodge. Take it, while this is after I have looped him 3 times  at this point, he spawns out of the sky and one shots me.

For reference, I've 100%'d this game and haven't touched it since (and even then I took longer than most).

 I'll keep it brief, but the only really good parts of this game are the cut-scenes and characters, the gameplay is so chopped down from it's original PS1 version that it's not even funny. RE2R also had a lot of cut content, but this is taking it to a whole new level. It sucks because RE3R could have been amazing, and for one brief period in the city (the section the demo covers), it's really tense and fun. Being chased by a beefed up Nemesis is where the game shines, but it only really does it once and the PS1 version did it far better. Combat is fluid and engaging, being able to dodge-roll as Jill and punch as Carlos feels great, but it'll only last about 6 hours. Multiple difficulties are nice, but with barely any unlockables and such a short game it is kinda mute.

The game's graphics and sound design are excellent, and the gameplay is fast-paced and exciting. However, the game's campaign is significantly shorter than Resident Evil 2 Remake, and some parts of the original game have been cut or changed.One of the best things about Resident Evil 3 Remake is its intense action sequences. The game features a dodge mechanic that allows players to avoid enemy attacks and counter-attack. The game's boss fights are also challenging and require careful planning and quick reflexes.However, the game's shorter length and lack of replay ability compared to Resident Evil 2 Remake are major drawbacks. Additionally, some fans have criticized the game's lack of certain key locations and enemies from the original game. In conclusion, while Resident Evil 3 Remake is a solid game with excellent graphics and exciting gameplay, it falls short of its predecessor in terms of content and replay ability. Fans of the series will still enjoy the game's intense action and challenging boss fights, but may feel disappointed by the game's shortened campaign and lack of certain elements from the original game!

For the people who are saying the game is to short clearly are not playing it at its full capacity. Much like new day Elden Ring it takes more then one play through to enjoy the game in its entirety.

( that you cant get from playing just once) AND the all MIGHTY unlimited rocket launcher and extras from the store. For those of you complaining about puzzles. This game may lack in some of the more in depth puzzles but it still has some. (do not cheat and look it up) there is the puzzle in downtown that gives you key items, there are several lockers and safes that you can only open if you find the answer hidden around on posters and newspapers, re railing the train and a few others. Yes, it is a shorter game thus less puzzles but it was fun and infuriating finding them.The game play was like butter, much better then the original. They did cut some from the game but its still amazing af.  The boss fights with nemesis were fun and when that little f-er followed me around in the beginning I spent the rest of the game looking over my shoulder. The one bad thing I found was that in the first cut scene when your in the car running into nemesis for some reason I was playing on my x box controller plugged into my pc, I kept hitting the buttons they were telling me to hit and I kept dying. After looking online for like EVER to find an answer without actually finding one. I decided to try my keyboard instead of the controller and it worked. On new game plus I had the same issue. (only ever at this one part of the game) when using the x box controller the dial when nemesis grabs you goes UBER slow and you will die every time! Switching to keyboard for that one moment allowed it to work somehow. Do not really understand why as I had no other issues like that the rest of the game. As a die hard 4 fan and someone who has played nearly all of these games ( except 0 and veronica) I give it an 8.5/10 I have a very hard time getting into games and this game got me out of a game slump I had been in for months.

Absolutely great game, loved every second of it, definitely less scary/stressful than RE2make but for me personally the more linear gameplay suits my playstyle more, but if your favourite part of RE2make was the backtracking then you will be disappointed here. the dodge mechanic was much needed and a step forward however the removal of sub weapons is a step backward and took me a long time to get used to.

the game isnt as short as i was expecting it to be as many people said it was, and i think it was a very decent length

Nemesis fails completely as everytime he appears not in a bossfight is in a scripted sequence and you know you can just hold left stick and a cutscene will be around the corner and you will be completely safe which takes all stress/horror out of the situation

Not recommended, too short (took about 5 hours to finish), enemies didn't instill any sense of fear factor, including Nemesis - which is sad because RE2 did such a great job with Mr. X. Items are in abundance which creates a lack of urgency. Lack of puzzles and doesn't allow much replayability.

[i]Such a disappointing sequel to the perfect RE2[/i]

After having played RE2 back in 2019, that game was like, the perfect remake ever made. Everything was well made and considered. So you could say fans were expecting another killer sequel/remake for the RE3 iteration.

Alas, it is not the case. 

Granted, I never played the RE3 classic from 20 years ago but that one too wasn't much raved about back then. What is kind of irritating is the removal of game portions in this remake that were present in the classic.

The gameplay is more or so the same as RE2 and it works superb. Visuals, animation, sound, voice acting, music... all good!

However, the short nature (there's even an achievement to beat the game under 2 hours) of RE3 and the removal of portions that was included in the classic are quite underwhelming.

To be clear, this is NOT a bad game and NOT a bad Resident Evil game. RE6 still holds that candle of sh!t, being the worst of the series in my opinion (massive reuse of game assets everywhere, bad characters, mediocre story and being way too much action gun-ho, cowboy western style; which doesn't make sense in a RE game).

Also, I'd like to note that the UltraWide Monitor support is 100% well made and working.

After I finished RESIDENT EVIL 2, one thing I mentioned was that the game was shorter than the others I have played.
It was around 9 hours where the rest I've played finish off around 12, but I didn't claim that as a flaw as RE2 more than made up for it with numerous things. Plus the fact that there is two stories in RE2, that's basically double the playtime!

RE3 is... even shorter than RE2. When I say even, I mean around 6 hours shorter, at least in my playthrough.
My total play time (time just having the game open at all, & accumulates over every run) was around 5 hours & 30 minutes.
My actual run time (clear time as the game puts it) was barely over 3 hours & 30 minutes. That's ridiculous! I've never played the original RESIDENT EVIL 3: NEMESIS, but even I was disappointed with this game. Many people I see expressing their disappointment usually are players of the original game, but I am not. The game is unreasonably short, and although I've never experienced any of it myself, it cut a lot of content from the original game for seemingly no reason.

Not to mention, considering this game's big bad is NEMESIS himself, he only appears in scripted events for some reason! He appears unscripted about one time if I recall correctly, and that's terrible! I don't know how he was in the original game, but I seriously doubt he was only in scripted events. RE2 contained Mr. X, and he was constantly moving around. You could hear his footsteps getting closer all the time, making you feel terror as you attempt to do the tasks around the RPD. I don't know why RE3 refused to do this with Nemesis, but it makes no sense and only adds to the disappointment.

RE3's gameplay isn't bad, it's honestly really fun. It basically shares the same mechanics as RE2, but with an added roll move for Jill which is a really fun mechanic, especially when maneuvering around Nemesis.

Another flaw to note: this game's audio is terrible. Usually in voice acting, it's clear the microphone was not good and every line tends to sound a bit muffled. This becomes extremely clear at the very end of the game. Trust me, you'll know what I'm talking about.

Out of the now 5 games in the RE Franchise that I have played, this one is extremely disappointing. I've played 7, 8 Village, 1, 2 and now 3. 
So far, this game is probably at the bottom of my list out of these 5. The rest were great in their own ways, and while this one is still decent, it's not on the same level. It's really disappointing, even as a new player who never got to experience the original.

Capcom really went all out with the RE2 Remake, and it's clear they didn't do the same for this one. I feel really bad for those of you out there who played the original RE3:NEMESIS, as I know all of you were let down.
No matter the fun I had with RE3, there is no doubt I am left with some irritating disappointment.

I recommend Resident Evil 3. On a sale. This game is not worth it's full price & I would only get it on a sale. Usually, when RE3 goes on sale, RE2 does as well, and their ""RACCOON CITY EDITION"" bundle goes on sale too. Just get that, you get a great game with RE2, and a decent-yet-disappointing game. The game is still worth playing in my opinion, just don't expect anything super amazing because you will be let down.

Sigh, this one hurt.

However, instead of coming here and saying that this game is a lazy remake (or re-imagination if you wanna call it), I'll just recomend it to you as a great action third-person shooter game. Yeah, it has its flaws, and it certainly could be way better as a remake when compared to the original game from '99. Do not get me wrong, I'm not shutting my eyes to the problem. This title is a bad REMAKE, but it definitely isn't a bad GAME. If you like short-length and/or action-focused games, just go for it, you won't regret. Gameplay is really fluid and organic, and the graphics are really impressive too. The story is cool and all, but not the greatest, and replayability aspects are inferior to its predecessor (RE2 Remake): there are minor diferences between the difficulties and there is only one campaign to be beaten. It also has some unlockable itens that should make your playthroughs easier, but they are really simple to obtain. 

You should get it on a sale, as the game really offers little for its current price. 

TL,DR: Cool and enjoyable action game. Mediocre as a remake. It is linear and short. Has some replayability that can encourage you on beating the campaing multiple times with different weapons.",1670812972,1679333738,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

The Resident Evil franchise, a household name these days, set the gold standard for survival horror back in the day alongside its main competitor, Silent Hill. As a result, with such a legacy come great expectations and with the franchise finally back on the right path, post-RE6, what better way to excite and wow fans than by remaking one of the most iconic entries in the series.

[h2] REMAKING NEMESIS [/h2]

Following in the footsteps of the fantastic Resident Evil 2 remake, RE3 does away with the top-down perspective for a much more comfortable and atmospheric over the shoulder view. 
It still utilizes the RE Engine that was originally shipped with RE7 so in the visual department it's an absolute feast, especially here where the environment feels much more varied than the last remake. 
Gunplay is still extremely solid, although some weapons are somewhat underpowered despite their appearance, and great care has been given to the sound once again with meaty sound effects and catchy tunes. 
Exploration is a big aspect of the game ,as is a tradition in the series, meaning you will often run out of supplies, forcing you to scavenge around the levels which are quite well designed although admittedly not as impressive as RE2's in terms of ambition and scope. Also big props for the quality-of-life improvements ported here from RE2, like the game showing when it's safe to discard a key item or when you are done exploring an area. 
That's a comment that comes up quite frequently in fact when discussing this remake; it does a lot of things well just not as well as the last one, the tyrant stalking you being one of the many examples to be brought up as this time around the titular Nemesis is reserved mostly for cutscenes and scripted sequences, but it's still a great spook when the lad shows up. There's much more banter and dialogue between the characters with more screentime given to the sidecast in this one, compared to RE2's mostly cheesy back-and-forths between Leon and Claire which led to nowhere. Overall, there was clearly a bigger focus on story and characters, a lovely change from the drab storytelling we saw previously.

[h3] CONCLUSION [/h3]

Now, while i personally never got the chance to enjoy the original, it has to be mentioned that many sequences from the classic game were completely cut and certain mechanics were also axed from the gameplay department. For first time players like myself ,however, it isn't that noticeable as the whole experience feels very well interconnected with a clear beginning, middle and satisfying conclusion to a truly fun remake of a survival horror masterpiece.",1679304595,1679304595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I got this game on a heavy discount and felt I (more than) got my money's worth, I can understand why someone who paid full price for this game, expecting another RE2R sized game may have felt shorted.

This game is definitely short and sweet. It plays well, again due to the fantastic RE Engine, and controls essentially the same as RE2R. It has all the Resident Evil staples that you know and love. I will say that I never played the original RE3, so I can't really comment on the story/location/puzzle changes. I enjoyed the story as a sort of parallel story to Resident Evil 2, and it was neat how they fit in a few nods to that game.  The story moves along at a fast pace, again almost too fast - so I can agree with others in saying a larger game with some better pacing would have gone a long way to make this great game even better.

If you are a fan of RE and you already played the originals, just dont waste your time on this game. If not, maybe you will have some fun but i still dont recommend it. I just dont understand, why after the masterpiece of the RE2 remake, the producer had to change everything. I mean, In RE2 remake, the game was 80% of the original with better graphic, some added puzzles, and just a little bit difference in the story. They add the sub-weapons ( which is so nice actually ), and on my opinion, the game was a little bit harder ( which is also nice since i played more than 100h on the original and i was afraid to beat the game too easily which i didnt. ) After making this masterpiece ( RE2 remake ) the only thing we were waiting was the remake of the RE3. BOOM !!! they failed. It was so easy for them to create another masterpiece because they already did it with the RE2 remake. Now in the RE3 remake, the story is completely different, its a running game from nemesis since the start of the game and you always run. The only things that didnt change are the characters. There is no sub-weapon anymore, no puzzles, you skip half of the original place that you are suppose to go and i could say more.... So finally, i really dont recommend this game for a fan, it will only make them disapointed just like me. I think the producer didnt want to please the fans because it was so easy for them to do something good. Now i am afraid to buy RE4 remake because to me, RE4 is the best RE ever created and if they do like the RE3 remake, they will create a garbage game.

Teaming up with your old buddy Brad Vickers you must escape from the big bad, Nemesis. After a brutal alarm clock which can take 7 bullets to the face you're thrown into a fiery corridor. You better hurry!

But yo for real, this game is sick. I prefer this over RE2R because of the action set pieces are more plentiful. The lighting feels better too, it's not just darkness everywhere you look. The city still has power so the lights are turned on, but in RE2R everything is just darker to try and make up for the lack of static camera positions like in the older games. It's a shame the game only lasts around 6 hours total, but mods can make up for that if you're so inclined. Just be aware though, half the mods are Jill with her tits out or Carlos and his erect cock. If you're into that? Merry Christmas.

If you're looking for more RE2R this game will do you well, but this does feel like DLC for RE2R instead of it's own game. Buy it on sale, it's a great experience but it can feel like a one and done kinda deal. Unless you like stupidly difficult enemies then you can do harder modes.

Shame they wasted the ""You want stars? I'll give you Stars!"" line and removed the action choices. That made the game have more reply value but also more dynamic. Felt like you get to choose how the game played even though generally you end up fighting Nemesis anyways. They also removed the clock tower, but honestly I don't give much of a fuck about that part. They made up for it with Carlos getting more action.

I thought it was pretty much an extension of the previous remake with a couple of nice little quality of life changes that made the game-play a little more seamless. The most notable two (at least for me) being the addition of a dodge function which I was dying (sometimes literally) for to be included in RE2R, and another smaller change being certain inventory management aspects such as not having to go into the inventory EVERY time you pick up an item. Small things, but frequent things.

Other aspects of the game however seem to have regressed, for some reason you can no longer break out of an attack with your knife or any grenades you might have laying around in your inventory.

A lot of the criticism seems to be directed at the length of the game. Whilst I largely agree, I think I have an unpopular opinion by saying that there isn't that much less content, maybe a few hours, than the previous game. I think RE2R does a better job of making you think there's more content than there actually is by splitting it up into 4 ""individual"" playthroughs which in reality differ by about 10% each between them. 

Resident Evil 3 is a singular story which only changes in difficulty. Despite this, although I enjoyed my first playthrough of 2 more so than 3, subsequent playthroughs of 3 are much more enjoyable as they're packed with more action and combat rather than puzzles which are something that aren't as fun to replay! I think this installation drags on a lot less and acknowledges its length correctly and I found that I had finished it with all the achievements just before it got stale rather than after, like it was beginning to after 30 hours of RE2.

I'd say if you liked RE2, or even if you're completely new to the Resident Evil universe pick it up! It's a fun little adventure and plays quite smoothly. But get it on sale! I wouldn't pay more than the £8 it costs on sale. Though it is a great game, it's a short one and therefore doesn't justify its £35 base price.",1679088826,1679088826,True,1,0,0.461832046508789063,0,True,False,False

And for the game itself, it is the first mistep on the saga, with the old Capcom moving more and more on the action part and reducing the puzzles and the horror setting that made its predecessor one of the most iconic games of all times. This is where they started thinking that puttin a missile launcher on a zombie is a great choice and from here it escalated quickly until they kind of came back to the origins on RE 7.
On RE3 Nemesis, all the effort has moved to action and pressing the player: There are more bullets, more zombies and of course there is Nemesis chasing you in its 3500 different forms and making you run. It is a good game, but not the best one on the saga.

The game incorporates a terrible dodge mechanic with a window so small that it almost never actually works. Additionally entire sections of RE3 simply don't exist in the game at all. Graphically it's exactly the same as RE2 Remake so at least it has that going for it. I think the main reason why RE3 Remake suffered so much is because one it was rushed, it just barely came out one year after RE2 Remake. Second reason why this game is so bad is because time and effort was wasted on making Resident Evil Resistance a PvP RE game which we all know RE plus PvP never works, not a single RE PvP game has been good enough to keep servers up and running. Umbrella Corps dead, RE Resistance dead, REVerse on the brink of death already. Capcom needs to stop making PvP RE games nobody wants them period. If time and effort hadn't been wasted on RE Resistance than maybe RE3 Remake could have been a much better game that would have taken what RE2 Remake did right and kept the trend going.

Lemme preface this by saying I absolutely love Resident Evil 3: Nemesis and have probably put more time into it than any reasonably sane person should, and after running through this...this just ain't it, chief.

RE3: Nemesis had some fantastic elements to it. It was the first game in the franchise to utilize a dodge and counter mechanic, which was fantastic! Granted, it didn't work very well and was difficult to get the hang of, but once you'd get the hang of it fighting Nemesis got really fun, really fast. Being able to explore Raccoon City at your own pace was fantastic, and sure, some of the backtracking could get tedious, but it was among the best horror games in its day. This is like a really low effort reboot. Most of the iconic locations don't even appear, the sequence of events is all mixed up, Jill doesn't even really act like Jill, and what were they even thinking with that Nemesis redesign?! They went from a genuinely intimidating boss to Crooked Nose McGee over here. Bad decisions all around. It was also disappointingly short, and the only really good elements to this remake were the Hunter Alpha redesigns and the pale heads. I don't even want to talk about the Hunter Gammas, that was too strange.

After they did such an amazing job with RE2's remake, I'm still bewildered as to how they went so far wrong with this one. There are next to no puzzles. The Clock Tower was cut completely, along with 50% of the total game if not more. Brad's death in the original had a purpose, here it's just lazy writing. The entire game can be summed up as lazy writing. Take notes, this is NOT how you design a good remake. As a Resident Evil fan, I'm disappointed beyond measure. Really the only thing they DID get right was fixing the dodge mechanic, but Resident Evil 3 should not be a game you can easily run start to finish in under an hour.

Only get this on sale because that's the only way it's even remotely worth it. Though even that's debatable.",1679003890,1679003890,False,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

The police station of RE:2 reminds me a bit of Metal Gear: Ground Zero. It's got that perfect sandbox level replayability factor. 

Gameplay-wise, this felt a lot easier than RE:2. I never ran out of any stuff.  I had too much stuff. But the weapons are fun, and the switch between the two characters was really fun also. I appreciate not having to replay the whole game just to see the other character's experience.

The game made me generally kinda sad too, since after playing RE 1 remake, Jill became my favourite character and they gutted her so much here, doing a complete 180 on her personality. Like visually i dont mind the change, she still looks great even with a new face but all the comments she makes during the game didnt resemble her from the mansion incident or even the OG game from what ive seen. I hope RE4 remake will be a better game and a more faithful remake like RE2's remake was.

-First thing is the game is short VERY short. Even in one of the achievements it shows how short the game is (complete in under 2 hours)
-This one goes with how short the game is, HALF OF THE CONTENT FROM THE ORIGINAL GAME IS CUT OUT THIS MEANS THAT ALL THE OTHER ALT ENDINGS IN THE GAME ARE CUT OUT TOO!
-Its is not scary. When I play a Resident Evil game I expect it to be scary! (Most of the newer ones are not scary either)
-There is no puzzle solving or sorry I mean ""less"" there are like what 2 maybe 3 puzzles in the whole game that are stupid easy.
-Most of the unlockable outfits are cut out, okay maybe this doesn't affect the game play s much but its still disappointing. 

 -Pros 
-Very nice visuals 
-New doge mec is great much better and smoother then the old one
-The game being short can really go in both 
-Runs nice no lags unless you are adding mods even with mods it still runs nice most of the time
-Carlos and Jill are both really good protagonists 

In conclusion this is a good game, if you like the other Resident Evil games then play this game it is more action then scary so if you are looking for something scary maybe not this game! This game is one you should play at some point though.

The game switches periodically between two main characters: Jill and Carlos. While playing as Jill, I felt that my inventory space was constantly too limited. I know that's part of the genre but I don't feel like it was executed well. In later parts of the game, I was constantly running back and forth to the storage box. It just felt like the game was giving me things I didn't really need but I hoarded them anyway because who knows when they might come in useful.

While playing as Jill, you are also frequently pursued by the Nemesis. He's just an unkillable annoyance. There are some games that are based around this kind of mechanic and RE games have adopted it on occasion (RE7, 8 and the RE2 remake) but those are much better designed. Luring the Nemesis away from areas I wanted to explore was more difficult and getting anything done with him on top of me was out of the question.

I understand that the entire game is focused around this mechanic but it was much more annoying than fun or scary. When he wasn't bothering me in explorable areas, he would chase me down a linear path where I just had to keep moving forward. Those segments aren't tense or exciting. I know that if I just keep sprinting in the obvious direction, I'll be fine and I always was. These sequences just felt like they were there to pad out the play time or force the player from one area to the other.

Speaking of padding out play time, there was lots of backtracking through areas. This is also one of those things that can be done well or poorly. Heck, the entire metroidvania genre is based around revisiting areas. In this game, sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. One segment of the game takes place in a hospital and you first play through it with Carlos and then with Jill. I had already made several passes over the area with Carlos and now I get to do it again with no difference. It's optional as it's just to get items that only Jill can access but the assumption is always that I might need that stuff later on so I'm compelled to do it.

I guess I have mixed feelings about it. I certainly feel conflicted about one segment of the game where the player revisits the police station from the RE2 remake. And I mean the SAME. It's the exact same map in the exact same engine. The location of enemies and items has changed but it's a copy/paste situation. On one hand, it's kind of cool that we are hitting up the same location from another game in this universe but on the other, it came off as lazy. 

I think a big part of that is the length of the game. It's short. It's really short. Look at the play times on other reviews here. They are commonly in the 4-10 hour range. That's not a coincidence. So when a game that short reuses a level from another game, it feels shady. 

There are other problems too. One enemy type, hunters I think they're called, have an instant kill attack and take a lot of shots to take down. You also fight them in close quarters and they love to jump around a lot. Thankfully hand grenades killed them in one hit but those don't exactly grow on trees. 

These enemies would be more manageable if the dodge mechanic wasn't so touch and go. Sometimes it works wonderfully and it feels great. Other times it just feels frustrating. I get the feeling that some enemy attacks weren't tested very thoroughly with the dodge in mind. 

There are some other minor points but what it comes down to is that this very much feels like it was made by the Resident Evil B team and as a quick cash grab at that. Compared to something like the Dead Space remake that recently came out, RE3 isn't even close. 

On sale for $15 or less, it's great. A bit frustrating but there's definitely some good old over-the-shoulder horror action. Anything more than that feels like a rip off to me.",1678840210,1678840210,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay and graphics are straight from the successful Resident Evil 2 remake, so thumbs up here.
Like the original game, Jill is armed to the teeth and has a button for dodging that needs to be used to survive the vicious Nemesis and escape the nightmare of Raccoon City.

While the game is good, as a remake it is quite lacking for numerous reasons.
It misses locations, bosses and characters, not to mention the game is linear, unlike the original RE3, and with barebones exploration for the series standard, to the point that it is hardly considerable a survival horror, and more of a level based horror shooter. A very good horror third person shooter, but lacking on some accounts.

It's been awhile since I've played 3 classic, but one of the things that really stuck out to me about that game was the sheer amount of content available, and the pretty decent length for an RE game. You certainly got your money's worth if you bought 3 back in the day, and this is the inverse of that. Entire sections of the original are completely absent from this version. For example, a substantial 2-3 hour arc of the original has been consolidated into a 5-10 minute cutscene. It feels like this was supposed to be a dlc for re2 remake that some suit at Capcom decided to turn into a full price release. The repeated attempts from Capcom to validate shit like this with terrible multiplayer spinoffs only rubs salt in the wound. 

And just to clarify; I feel like this game is a blemish rather than indicative of the overall quality of the remakes. The other remakes Capcom has done have been fantastic projects that have retained the spirit of the originals while being different enough experiences to not make the older games feel obsolete. This game does neither of those things. If you want to play RE3, stick to classic.",1678726820,1678726820,False,2,0,0.509175896644592285,0,True,False,False

Getting my hands on the Remake of RE3, I had to play straight away, and to my expectations, it was an amazing time!   Again, after seeing the visuals and character models upgrade from RE2 Remake, I knew this was gonna be even better!

Everything about Resident Evil 3 Remake was sooooo much better, but what wasn't very easy to control, and or learn was the dodging mechanic.   I never played the Original Re3 which was just called, Resident Evil Nemesis!  I heard that the dodging mechanic wasn't the best, which was done that way on purpose, so for the Remake, the Devs decided to keep the nostalgic aspect of it, and implement the dodging, but make it super freaking awkward to use!  

Nemesis on the other hand, was as well, changed.   If you know of the OG Nemesis, you'll definitely notice the changes, but I still think it was well done.  People other than myself were disappointed that Nemesis at his second phase was changed to look more like a dog, rather than his Stage where he would just have several Tentacles swirling around him.  As well as his Final Phase was changed too, but again, STILL a great experience overall.

Carlos, this guy, this freaking guy!  From his Chad like appearance, to his shaggy hairdo, some people were all over him like Hot cakes, and others were like, %$#?!?!?!?!?  What did you do to Carlos?!  Aight, simmer down, his change isn't even that bad, it's actually better in my opinion, but luckily the Devs introduced DLC that gives you Carlos, and Jill's Classic outfits, but if you want the TRUE classic outfits, Nexusmods is just one click away, lol!

I thought the ending to this Remake of 3 was Wow, Jill is such a Bad ass!  ""Y'know what? This is the last F%$#ing Time!""  That line gave me chills!  Jill has had enough of Nemesis's BS!  I don't blame her, being chased the whole game, gosh, I'd be like, and this time, ""STAY DEAD!""

Gave deserves a 10/10 ranking, but it didn't get that from TONS of cut content, it's actually a shame.  I give it a 8/10 just my personal opinion, but that's just me cause I like these Remakes, they just look so good!",1608672171,1678493241,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to say that this game was quite a disappointment to me.
I would say they should have made this as a DLC for Resident Evil 2, at least it felt like it wasn't completed, but the story ended and was still really amazing.
The graphics were also still amazing, just like Resident Evil 2, maybe even some improvements.
Regardless of this being really short and basically with no puzzles, I would still rate this highly, because by playing both Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3, the story makes much more sense than just playing Resident Evil 2.

Yeah, there are quite a few set pieces and the game lacks the backtracking and puzzles of Resident Evil. Yet the core gameplay is still as tight as ever and even improved upon from RE2 with the dodge mechanic making it's return from the original RE3. Everything from the soundtrack, presentation, cutscenes, and sound design is great.  Yes, the game is short and it's not really a bad thing since it encourages you to play the game again on higher difficulties to challenge yourself. It also makes it less of a slog when you're replaying to do challenges (no healing, item box, etc.) since there's no moment in the game where it feels annoying to get through (other than the semi-lengthy opening).

The gameplay is the same as RE2make which is psuedo RE4 combat but easier. The story is sometimes a massive improvement and sometimes still dogshit stupidity.

The more realistic tone makes her driving a car off a building and then immediately walking it off with no injuries silly and it stands out. The constant beatings she gets from Tyrant is silly. The entire insect section feels unnecessary and like one of the designers fetishes that they crowbarred in.

The Umbrella Corp and Nicholai are both comedically evil which both chafe against the more serious tone. RE1, 2, and 3 (The originals) always had this camp movie tone but these games are trying to be taken seriously and it hurts to see writing this fucking bad. I can see good ideas in here but jesus fuck when Jill doesn't just explain to the Russian merc that the vaccine is the only way to stop the nuke, or that the russian dude puts you in elaborate james bondian death scenarios instead of just capping Jill and looting her is fucking silly.

The Story is pretty average but it at least gives a decent enough job as to progress the game forward in the way that it does. The characters are also just fine. Jill is decent enough to play as with Carlos being a bit more enjoyable due to his personality being both serious while able to throw a joke here and there. The villain of this game kinda feels like ""generic evil Russian"" with their goal being about money, but still does an alright job. The coolest character in the game is of course Nemesis which it being this unstoppable force that will do anything to get the job done and feels like an actual threat to Jill. 
The Setting of Raccoon City is really enjoyable to play through with every environment feeling like it has gone through hell and is infested with the undead. From the streets to the underground lab, every location you venture through does a great job at creating a perfect environment. 
Visually, its impressive. Performance was solid throughout my playtime and i had not encountered any bugs or glitches. Art Direction is also on point with it following in the same footsteps that RE2 remake went with. 
Sound and Audio are pretty good with it again following the same queues that the previous remake went with. 
In terms of gameplay, it's more of the same with some little things added on. If you have played the RE2 remake, you'll feel right at home with it being exactly the same when it comes to movement, gun play and inventory. One of the new things that have been added was the dodge/parry ability you can perform that can really help you out in a tough situation. The enemies are also pretty similar with the zombies well.. being the same since the last game, however there are new additions that do switch things up with the way players will approach the game. Nemesis itself is also a really nice challenge for the player with it acting like the Tyrant did in RE2 whereas he cannot be killed, but his abilities differ from Mr X as Nemesis with run at you and even grab you from long distances which can put you in a tough situation. The boss fights are really well done with each fight you have against Nemesis being different and tougher than the last one due to them evolving and becoming more powerful.  
Finally, there are some things that i feel that hold the game back from being as great as the previous remake. First of all, this isn't the full RE3. Instead (for some reason) this game is only a portion of what the original RE3 had to offer which i find confusing as to why they wouldn't go all the way out to give fans a full game and charging a £33 price tag on it. It may not be a full price, but this is still way too much for a 5 hour game (if even). One nit pick i had with the game was the way it overloads you with ammo to the point where it doesn't become an issue whereas RE2 made ammo sparse and forced the player to think carefully with how they would use that resource which was a really fun and challenging way to engage the player. The last nit pick i think i have with the game is the fact that it can be annoying when trying to dodge/parry enemies as sometimes it could be an insta death if done in a certain direction. 
Overall, Resident Evil 3 follows the remake trail quite nicely even with an alright story, but i would recommend getting this game on a discount as i don't agree that a 5 hour experience is worth that much money and the fact that it isn't the full story of the original.",1678135669,1678135669,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
952060,132326513,76561197986615405,0,20,252,0,55,1676509420,"I really, really wanted this game to be another grand slam like the RE2 remake. Unfortunately, it falls quite flat in comparison, and is a bit of a disappointment overall.

The RE2 remake was a masterpiece both as its own game, and as a faithful recreation of the original Resident Evil 2. It brought the older fans back and rallied all kinds of new ones as well. It combined amazing graphics, audio, and solid gameplay together into one awesome survival-horror themed package. It had different characters to pick from, each offering the player different perspectives to see the story with as they venture into the depths of hell in Raccoon City. There was a variety of game modes that injected a bunch of fresh content into the game, greatly enhancing replay value..

Blah blah.. point is, that game was amazing. The RE3 remake, on the other hand, is not.

The RE3 remake comes up short even in comparison to the original RE3 - only surpassing it in terms of visuals and sound. Everything else seems to be either pretty lackluster, or completely missing. Sure, the environments are nice to look at, but they offer very little to encourage exploration. For example, there are almost no puzzles in the game this time around. You can turn your brain completely off as you trudge your way through this bland hallway simulator, blowing away one zombie after another. 

Yeah, don't be fooled into thinking this is gonna be another blood-pumping, nail-biting, survival-horror epic just because you've played the other games. This is a generic zombie shooter at best, and there ain't sweet fuck all to be afraid of here. In the original RE3, Nemesis was one scary ass mofo that kept you on your toes all through the game (like Mr. X in RE2). The new Nemesis feels like a step backwards in both aesthetic design and gameplay function. He has been reduced to a mere annoyance that shows up for a few different story triggers, and gets stomped far too easily.

The story and characters are mostly what you remember from the original RE3, keeping it simple like before. The story starts with Jill getting attacked and chased by the Nemesis monster (which will continue to happen through the game). In an effort to reach safety, she encounters a few folks along the way and ultimately teams up with some umbrella mercenaries. The story becomes about securing the vaccine to the zombie virus and potentially saving Raccoon City, while trying not to get killed by Nemesis in the process. It's a simple plot with simple, boring, one-dimensional characters that don't develop in any real way. Carlos appeared to be the only semi-interesting character, whereas our protagonist Jill Valentine and the main antagonist were about as entertaining as white paint.

Before you know it, the journey comes to an end after like 5-6 hours. Again, where RE2 had lots of replay value.. this has almost none. Hooray, an item shop that lets you start with some basic items. But where are the extra game modes? Where are the alternate story paths? Where are the big decisions and multiple endings from the original? None of that exists here. There is almost no reason to play through this again. 

It just feels so half-assed. Could have been amazing.. what a shame.

Update: 

I did go back and play through this again, giving the game another chance.. but damn, what a waste of time and energy that was. It was just as painfully boring and linear as the first run through. There is absolutely no replay value here.

Additionally, I have since gone back to the original RE3: Nemesis for a playthrough. I wanted to see if it's as good as I remember, or if I was being biased due to nostalgia. Turns out that the original RE3 was even better than I remembered. Seriously, it's so much better than this garbage remake in almost every single way (except graphics and voice acting, obviously, but those are the least important parts of a game anyway).

[i]Resident Evil 3[/i], the great remake that could have been. I was one of the fools who pre-ordered this game on PS4 thinking it was going to be bigger than RE2R. For someone who holds RE3 Nemesis as one of my top RE games, I have a lot to say here.

To make things clear: as an action horror game, it's [b]okay[/b]; there are issues here and there but it works about 80% of the time at least. As a Resident Evil game AND a Resident Evil remake, it's pretty terrible. There are a couple of ways to tackle this game so I'll be reviewing it from the perspective of one who's grown up playing the original 1999 game.

That being said, this is probably my least favorite RE game and I didn't have that much more fun outside of my first playthrough.

[u]Story + Characters (Possible Spoilers!)[/u]

[spoiler]Most people will mention a lot about how improved the storyline is in the remake compared to RE3 Nemesis and I can see why: it's a lot more focused and streamlined. The plot for RE3R is almost like the original plot, except there's a plotline switch that focuses from escaping the city to getting the vaccine to stop the missile strike from blowing up... Raccoon City?[/spoiler]

[spoiler]The issue I have with this story is that, halfway, it goes absolutely nowhere. Jill makes the vaccine to ""save the city"" and the vaccine gets destroyed anyway (Jill couldn't care less about RC at the end). Also, aside from other reasons, Jill already has the T-virus antibodies from being cured so this plotline with the vaccine was pointless.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]It's like the RE3R team read a synopsis of the RE3 plot and decided it needed a human main antagonist to show that, ""oh, it's not the monsters that are actual evil, it's human greed that's actual evil"" except the original already showed these points much better without Nicholai being such a blatant villain with actual subtlety.[/spoiler]

[spoiler]As for the characters, almost everyone in this game has been dumbed down to a certain degree. Jill is snobby and acts way too hard to be a badass, Nicholai may as well be wearing a big white mustache to twirl whenever he's going to do something evil, Mikhail's despair over the loss of his subordinates under him is replaced by a generic disgruntled leader character, Dario is turned from a survivor struck with overwhelming grief over his daughter's death to a complete noodle of an idiot, and Nemesis is turned into an incompetent goofball that only tosses Jill around even when he's got her dead to rights. The only characters who improved from the original were Tyrell and Carlos who is by far the best character out of everyone; anyone who plays this game will LOVE Carlos.[/spoiler]

[u]Gameplay[/u]

This game is [b]short[/b]. That could be confusing considering that most RE games are short, but RE3R is one of the shortest Resident Evil games I've ever played due to the fact that it's the [i]most[/i] linear RE game yet. The reason for why this game can be completed so quickly is that there's not really much to explore compared to other RE games; you never have to backtrack that much because what you leave behind is relatively insignificant and you never have to go back to places for more puzzle solving. My first run was a little under three hours on PS4 and I explored as much as I could.

Given that the gameplay is derived from RE2R, it's still solid. Aiming and shooting feels good, controls are responsive, dodging is fun to do but is situational because enemies will sometimes rush you down from behind which makes dodging based on luck at that point. However, that's basically all there is to say that is good about the gameplay because the pacing that this game goes at does not work with the mechanics. 

Many new enemies you meet are either long ranged or agile which results in you trying to spin your camera to see where they're at and attempting to dodge them. They also range from being insignificant to defeat or being outright drivel. Ne-α Parasites can hit you from nearly across an entire room, Drain Deimos are relegated to one section and are never seen again, Hunter Gammas are almost free enemies considering that one shotgun blast to their mouths stuns them and one Flame Round will kill them, Pale Heads are lazily reused from RE2R's Ghost Survivors, and Hunter Betas are armored and can now randomly one-shot you at ANY condition of health with almost no warning. Dispatching enemies is easy because the game will give you the resources right next to the enemy that is weak to it ([spoiler]example, the Sewer section[/spoiler]) and you are given so much ammo in this game even on harder difficulties.

Nemesis T-Type is the titular enemy that made RE3 Nemesis as memorable as it was. Although he's much stronger than any enemy you will encounter, compared to his original, he is an absolute joke. Mind you, this was basically Umbrella's peak tyrant who could tank 10 Freeze Rounds. take two Rocket Launcher missiles, three Red Barrels, and would still come after you 11 times in the original AND follow you in most areas of the Raccoon City streets. In the Remake, up to Hardcore difficulty, a single Hand Grenade or Red Barrel can down him the fastest. Nemesis only ever truly stalks you in the Downtown area once ([spoiler]after the Power Station[/spoiler]). For him to be anywhere as tough, you basically have to amp up the difficulty to the point where his attack patterns become unfair ([spoiler]final boss, anyone?[/spoiler]).

There is no reason to think about item management at all. There are few key items that are used to progress forward and those that you do get are quickly / twice used (at most) to progress because it's so obvious where to use them. Puzzles are laughably easy to complete (with one puzzle at the end requiring a tiny bit of thought) and are almost non-existent; most ""puzzles"" that require you to progress will simply be installing key items, unlocking doors, or turning on switches.

It's never a good sign when there are challenges in a Resident Evil game that make you grind hundreds of kills in a series that EMPHASIZES on saving resources, running past a majority of enemies, and killing only what you're required to especially in an action horror game as short as this one. After beating the game, you're left with playing the game on harder difficulties and completing records to unlock rewards, but the replay value is short; I was able to 100% the game within a [b]day and a half[/b].

[u]Graphics & Sound[/u]

I will admit at least that the graphics on RE3R are as beautiful as usual for a game that uses the RE engine. However, I couldn't help but feel that RE2R had much better use of shadows and gore to emphasize the horror aspect and rarely was I ever tense playing this game. Many of the character designs are great; I liked Carlos' design the best and Jill's design is good enough for people to make mods for her.

The sound effects for the guns, explosions, and the chaos of the city are decent as well. Nothing sounded out of place or as if I was shooting out anything weaker or stronger than what the gun looked like.

[u]Conclusion[/u]

Like everyone else mentions, there's an insane amount of cut OG content. In short, about 70% of RE3 has either been changed or outright cut from the remake. To name a few: no Enhanced Ammo, no Clock Tower, no Park, no Cemetery, no Incineration Disposal Plant, no Grave Diggers or Brain Suckers, no complex mixing of Gunpowders and Grenades, no Nemesis-dropped weapons like the STI EAGLE.

It's a damn shame because newer fans will never know how much better this game could have been. Such aspects matter if taking them out removes a lot of depth from the remake and given how easy it is to complete this game in under an hour without speedrun strats, it only goes to show. I would only buy this game on discount and would recommend to RE fans just so you can say you've played it.

I actually both this game on sale for around 39 euros and although it was cheaper than original price, it is still too much. The game itself is very nice, it has great graphics, awesome atmosphere and interesting gameplay, the thing is - it is so damn short. I finished the game in 6 hours and I'm the type of gamer to explore and take a look in every nook and cranny, so if you are not that kind, you'll finish it in 4 hours probably, or even less. I did not play the original RE3, so I will not get into the differences between the old and new one, but as I can see from other reviews, some things were cut out from the gameplay, and I guess that is the reason for being so short. I think that in this format, new RE3 would be great DLC for new RE2, but it is just too ridiculously short to be standalone game. Capcom tried to fix things with adding that online multiplayer thingy (REsistance), but I'm not a fan of those kind of games since a lot of my friends are not gamers, and those who are - are not interested in this type of online multiplayer, so I kind of gave money for both things (because you can't buy it separately) and I will use only one of them, so I feel a little bit robbed.",1592581107,1677450801,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The Good: 
I prefer Nemesis over Tyrant, Tyrant was the silent brood that stalked you, Nemesis on the other hand? He would yell ""Stars"" and it felt like his ENTIRE purpose was to see you dead, well, yes... BUT, it was a lot more intimidating than Tyrant's silent walk in his goofy ahh hat. I may be biased with Jill, but I love Jill and her love interest with Carlos was actually well written in my personal opinion. I like Jill, I like Carlos, simple as. Sound design and graphics are great as usual. Setting was more of what I wanted out of RE2, the actual city itself and it affected the people. RE2 you were basically either only in the police station or underground, I really wanted to see more of Raccoon city, this game delivered that. I like the more interactive cinematics that were not in the previous titles. I LOVED the hospital section of the game, hospitals are an untapped goldmine in the RE universe, I need more of it, I love the setting and the atmosphere, I want more. The concept art looked great for it too! Maybe I am biased with my love of outlast! Settings were amazing overall, I enjoyed. I like the nice connections this game has with RE2 with pre and post events of that game, it was nice how it connected.

The bad:
RE is known for puzzles and backtracking, this one isn't too on par with that tradition, it exists! but seemed a little poor? Or I am getting use to it since I am binge playing RE games! haha! 

The Ugly:
Honestly, I wanted to put this in a middle ground? I more have no opinion regarding it since i have not played the original but.... The timing of the game, I had a run about 3 hours, it is a short game. Not worth the price to RE standards. There is supposedly cut content compared to the original so that is kind of disappointing. I'm sure capcom has their reasoning. Sure it is a shorter game to RE standards, but it felt like ti did not overstay it's welcome, length felt just right for the story it was trying to tell so I won't hold it against them. 

Conclusion: 
It's a great game for what the story is trying to tell and despite it's flaws, I think it hold's up greatly in my eyes. Nothing too disappointing for me and I really enjoyed the characters and story. Final boss was fun IMO. I give it an 8.5/10",1677434351,1677434351,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game objectively is good/ ok-ish, but as a remake is really barebones and it lacks in so many ways in comparison with the original and with the remake of resident evil 2. I recommend people to buy it at a heavy discount but this is in no way a complete game, they decided to cut half of the game just to put a multiplayer mode call ""RESISTANCE"" that was already dead a month after release, Capcom keeps trying to make RE multiplayer games  with no idea of what people want, we want coop game, no call of duty or Dying light clones. Please stop, they ended up hurting the campaign just for the sake of it...

[u]  [b] The good stuff [/b] [/u] 

This game has good qualities to it, this is by no means a bad game (although it was a rip off at 60 dollars at launch so I didn't buy it at that price) so let's start. 

The voice acting is superb, specially Jill, I love seeing a ""new game"" with her as a protagonist again, I like her new design but I still like her old one a bit more but it's still great, although is sad to see is such a short game :/. Nemesis design is great too, and how racoon city looks is just breathtaking, gameplay is very similar to RE2 but is a bit faster thanks to Jill's new dodge technique. The game is overall fun and I liked it, there are certain story moments that are great but the more I look at it the cons start to pop up more than the pros sadly.

[u]  [b] The bad stuff: The game that it will never be [/b] [/u] 

The remake of this game cuts so many stuff from the original, no clocktower, no park, no exploration, no anticipation, almost no puzzles, no dismemberment system as RE2, and the list can go all day. RE3 remake is extremely linear, the game is filled with scripted moments that makes nemesis to not be a menace at all, in RE2 remake MR.X was a chasing menace made to kill every witness of the racoon city incident, chasing you across the RPD in such unexpected ways and it was terrifying. But in RE3 Nemesis only has 1 real persecutor segment and is stunned with a battery in the most lame way possible, the beast that is meant to kill all the STARS members to avoid spreading the information of the mansion incident, is now just a predictable enemy that doesn't chase you after the first 20 min  of the game.... this is not how is supposed to work and now makes sense why Nemesis is no longer on the title of the game.

The overall map of raccoon city is now limited to just 2 streets and like 3 hallways, this is supposed to be the Racoon city game, but the city segment is so short that is really sad, all the locations are there but they are just cameos  and references, so they are closed in one way or another as if it was a fan game instead of a AAA remake like RE2 was, and after this section nemesis won't chase you anymore because they rushed their ""animal"" form so quickly for the sake of action set pieces that is no longer menacing, he just becomes a boss everytime you see him :/. So the rocket launcher nemesis is basically limited to a 2 minute sequence... like why??? that is his signature  weapon and is now just a cameo for 5 seconds because is just a run segment so you don't even see him using it. So, going back to the map, now is just City => Sewers => Hospital => Lab and yeah RE2 only had 3.5 locations but all of them were connected via puzzles but in this one they are shorter, they are not connected, you just see them once.

They also completely eliminated the decision making of the original, making this 100% linear in level design and 100% linear in story too. Now you can't choose if you want to explore the city but you can't choose story elements either, so the replayability of this game is non existent. And it sucks because they touched the PTSD of Jill on the beginning of this game but just a little bit, and is such a miss opportunity because if they had included more nightmares and more story choices they could've made a really good exploration of her character, but after the intro she just becomes a bad ass character with no build up :(.

[u] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/u] 

I am negative overall but I actually enjoyed the game, but this game could've been such a masterpiece just as RE2 was, imagining a complete racoon city with interconnected puzzles with nemesis chasing you across all the city as MR.X did , making decisions in the game with multiple endings, giving STARS members more screen time and exploring how umbrella is chasing Jill and how she deals with it thanks to her PTSD and her lack of trust in others.  that is a game I imagined after finishing RE2 remake, and is obvious this game was not made by the same team. This was made by a different team at capcom and it really shows. The RE2 team is working on the RE4 remake so I am excited for that one. That's why I can't recommend it as an RE fan, Capcom gave this game, THE NEMESIS GAME, to a secondary group and took half of their resources to make a trash multiplayer game that was dead a week after release, the lack of time and love put in this proyect is shown if you compare it with RE2 or the original RE3. As a separate thing , yeah is good, is decent. But capcom just chased the easiest and laziest  way to make money, and it sucks this game will always be remembered as the game it will never be :'(.

Buy it at a heavy discount, I give it a thumbs down because the average steam score is now at 79% which is undeserved, for me is around the 70s, so I do it to compensate.",1677340045,1677350375,False,358,5,0.895637452602386475,1,True,False,False

But first let me get into what others are saying about this game that is apparently bad:

[b]People saying ""This game is way too short""[/b]
A: Wrong. RE3 is just as long as RE2... around 5-6 hours if you explore everything properly without rushing!
Also, people dont seem to be paying attention to the store that unlocks after playing on standard difficulty which adds replayability for multiple runs afterwards where you can unlock different things. Besides, Resident Evil 3 has five difficulty levels, those being:
Assisted
Standard
Hardcore
Nightmare
Inferno

[b]But Smoke, RE2 Remake had 2 campaigns so thats over 10 hours of gameplay![/b]
Right and wrong... It did have 2 campaigns but lets not forget that they where nearly identical to one another... thats a cheap way of adding replayabilty in my book and not really a fair comparison!

[b]People saying ""The game sucks cus they cut out some locations from the original""[/b]
A: People dont seem to understand what a ""Remake"" is and just expect a full on ""Remaster"".
Its called a REMAKE for a reason because its REMADE with some alterations added! While i can understand people being upset about the clocktower not making the final cut, i cant say the same for the park and the cemetary. The latter 2 being fairly small areas with little to them but crossover sections in the original. Anyways, i do believe that they could have easily snuck in the clocktower by just having nemesis show up like he does in the remake but then something happens and you run into the clocktower. So even story-wise that should have been no problem in the remake... oh well... maybe they ran out of time?

[b]People saying ""This feels like RE6 and has too much action"".[/b]
A: The devs did state multiple times that this recreation will have much more action than RE2 and as far as im concerned there where plenty of explosions and action in the original ""RE3 Nemesis"". Also, in no way does this feel like RE6... again people are just using excuses to crap on this game by comparing it to capcoms worst RE game, which is RE6. The combat is still very much the same as in RE2 Remake, as are the jump scares, tension, atmosphere and surprises!

[b]People saying ""This should have been DLC""[/b]
A: I disagree. There is still enough on offer here to justify the price tag AND you get another game on top being ""RE: Resistance"".

[b]Conclusion:
Dont worry too much about all these people who are upset because the game isnt a 1:1 recreation of the original because lets face it, thats literally 90% of the complaints. Let's also not forget that Capcom wanted this game out in just over a year so i feel for the devs.[/b]

Anyways...with that out of the way lets get into the pros and cons:

[b]Pros:[/b]
----------
- More varied environments
- Ties up the original games plot holes well
- Realistic graphics
- Nemesis is relentless and will try to mess up your day in any way he can 
(RE2s Mr. X doent even hold a candle against him)
- Inventory management is done a bit better than in RE2 with quick stash on already picked up items

[b]Cons:[/b]
---------
- Explosive barrels make initial zombie encounters way too easy
- Soundtrack volume in safe rooms is way too low and the ""remixed"" save room soundtrack isnt as good as the original 
(why cant capcom give us the option for the original soundtrack like in RE2 Remake?)
- 1 or 2 questionable QTE's 
(i.e.: Jill crawling away with tentacle attached to her leg for nearly 30s)
- Sometimes its hard to tell if youre doing damage to nemesis in fights due to vague animations
- No Mercenaries mode
- Barely any puzzles and way too easy
- Some sections felt really short with less intricate level designs compared to the original game
(They should have just reused some of their outdoor/indoor assets to give each section a bit more length)

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]
---------------
Survival horror is still very much present in RE3 so dont let other reviews dissuade you on that! It's just that RE3 Remake has more variety and more action sprinkled on top, thats all.
There are still plenty of jump scares, tension, atmosphere and surprises throughout!

This clocks in at around 6-8 hours which is not acceptable in this day and age (Especially at the price point) I know the original was similar in length but it would have been good if Capcom added some more flesh to the bones or broke up the story line between Jill and Carlos as they did in Resident Evil 2 for Claire and Leon.
It unfortunately also strays away from the Survival horror experience which is a shame as this is one of the reasons why Resi 2 hit all the right notes.

What you do have though is a solid action experience with the production values you would expect from Capcom.
The beginning of the game is one of the most memorable in the whole franchise and the main creature one of the most terrifying. 
In short this is a worthy entry in the series but only just.....
I enjoyed this make no mistake but only pick this up in a deep sale as this can be completed in one siting.

I could go on and on about why this is god awful but to start: they cut out a chunk of the OG game, removed the choice making system from OG, completely ruined what makes Nemesis scary in OG (his sentience and intelligence) by making him animalistic in literally like his second or third encounter? 
To get more into it: Nemesis doesn't even really hunt you down in this? Granted I guess they didn't adapt the OG title of ""Resident Evil 3: Nemesis"" (or last escape) but God damn he's a boring antagonist in this. Nicolai is also completely dumbed down and is clearly evil when you meet him in this with all his remarks towards Jill, when OG actually makes an effort to justify his actions and make him seem like a harsh, but not bad dude. 
This remake treats Jill like shit and makes Carlos a love sick moron. Jill gets thrown around everywhere by Nemesis and fans praise her for being badass when this was really just an unnecessary addition to inflict pain on the female protag. Gross. In OG, normally the only times Jill is getting hurt by Nemesis, aside from getting stabbed and infected in a scripted scene, is when the player makes an error, not when there's a long obnoxious cinematic video of it. Carlos is just annoying to no end for me. Clearly he likes Jill in OG too, but a lot of his drive seems to come from his want to help people. I don't doubt that remake Carlos is similar, but the heavy handedness with which writers tried to push him towards her makes me want to gouge my eyes out.
This is a movie not a game, and a bad one that's just a money hungry grab that makes a bad name for RE3 original.",1674073814,1676348857,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I haven't played the original title so I won't be making criticisms on certain aspects that have either been removed or expanded upon as I'm yet to experience the 1999 game for myself.

I wrapped up my first playthrough of the story in just under 5 hours, and I've played through it a few more times since, in order to obtain as many achievements and collectables as possible, totalling to 21 hours of playtime. 

Although the story is on the shorter side, I think the shop system that can be found in-game following your first completion of the story adds a level of replay ability that increases the value of the title and makes it easier if you are aiming for 100% as it lets you cut certain corners that would typically make the experience feel drawn out and just not as enjoyable upon a second playthrough.

Another thing I really enjoyed about this game is the amount of colour that can be found throughout raccoon city and how Capcom was able to make it feel as though the city was once a living, breathing entity where thousands of people once went about there everyday lives until all hell broke loose.

My main criticism with the game is the lack of bosses that you go up against throughout its duration. Unlike the resident evil 2 remake where you explore a plethora of different environments and have a boss fight that matches up with the zones theme. The only boss you face in this game is a variation of nemesis that is often reused at least once more. For instance, the clock tower fight where nemesis seems to be in an animal-like state is almost the exact same as the nemesis you face for the first time in the underground facility. 

Overall, I think that the resident evil 3 remake is a game that excels in several categories but also falls short in others. I would recommend waiting for it to go on sale as the total amount of playtime doesn't warrant a £35 price (roughly $40) but I still believe it is a title that you should check out at least once.

First off, Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (yas, the OG) is my most favorite RE game EVEEERRRR. Probably my most favorite game EVEEERRRR as well - so I really have a lot to say here. I lost count of my replays already -- replays when we still had PS1, replays during college, replays when I started working, heck, I even replayed it once more during the height of this pandemic just so I could feel ""solace"" from my childhood, so to speak.

It would be a lie if I said it wasn't the least bit disheartening to find out that a lot of the locations and puzzles were cut and this game would pass you by like the weekends. The other remakes were fine (at least to my standards) -- [b]so why must this happen to the one I love most?[/b]

However, I would also be lying if I said I did not enjoy the visual treat that it is, like how tremendously eyegasmic RE2R is. Jill is also my favorite RE character, and I love how she turned out in this highly-detailed, full-blown 3D model. I love the face model they chose for her, including the voice actress who brought her to life. I was judging her ""new look"" so hard when this was announced, but I am so happy to surprisingly be charmed instead come actual gameplay. AND SHOULD I EVEN MENTION HOW A MILLION TIMES HOTTER CARLOS IS NOW?!?!?!

Despite the lack of actual content (lol), the action has been explosive right off the bat -- and this was nothing less of a treat for me (as someone who stopped gaming for more than a decade). I can agree with most reviews that somehow, some way, this was very lazily produced as a lot of the content has been recycled from RE2R, but I couldn't help but recall that the original ones (at least the first 2-3 of the OG games) were also very interconnected and used the same locations and elements, so this did not bother me much at all, that this is something I could brush off as a mere happenstance due to the plot's demands, universe building, all that shebang.

Overall, the 3D art and design goodness, the unique cinematography whether in the cutscenes or interactive chase scenes, the semi-awkward but albeit laughable dialogues and one-liners (Carlos, I'm looking at you), the superb voice acting, and all the stress it gave me are what's making it worth recommending nevertheless. I can still reconnect with my younger self replaying RE3:N/B:TLE for the Nth time during my playthrough, and for me that is the most important part. [b]And yes, do NOT buy at full price.[/b] HAHA.

The Gameplay:
It's a pretty standard, over-the-shoulder shooter. The gameplay is nearly identical to that of the RE2 Remake with some differences. These differences (like the knife taking up a weapon slot in your wheel) are pretty annoying coming right off RE2R, but it's still feels nice enough to play. The puzzles aren't too difficult, and it's fairly puzzle-lite considering it's a Resident Evil game. It's pretty much memory puzzles and mazes.
The good thing too is that (1) you can turn ray-tracing off and rest assured that the game is still going to look awesome and (2) it's flawless from a mechanical standpoint. As-in: no bugs. Ever. It's got that final polish and then some extra shine on top.
The Story:
Now, I won't talk about content cut from the original. I didn't play it. As far as I can tell, this trimmed all the fat without realizing that the fat gave it flavor. All the story content is there, but there's less impact, and the story is more linear overall.
That being said, the story is solid, but it's also a hard one to get wrong. Jill's primary goals are to escape RC and save as many innocents while she does it. Carlos isn't really given much of a story in this at all which is sad since it's his only appearance in the franchise and odd because he's the secondary protagonist. He's effectively a supportive himbo that pops up to remind you how awesome you are.
The ending is tragic with Raccoon City being destroyed (presumably with some people not evacuated yet) but lacks the impact due solely to how linear and resistant to deviation the storyline is. I mean, we're told people are still alive in RC, but we, the player, never see them. These citizens have no material presence to the player, and I like linear stories. It's saying a lot that I think that how linear and rigid it is is a flaw. Even if it was just a few encounters with people other than UBCS, it would have helped in the emotional impact.
Despite this, I like it so, so much. Jill is wonderful, Nemesis is my personal nemesis, and the fall of Raccoon City is horrifyingly sad particularly if you have the repertoire of the first, second, and prequel game under your belt. It's an intrinsic part of the original RE story.
The Problem:
It is very easy to complete this game in an hour and a half. I have, and I don't speedrun. Ever. My first playthough took just over three solely because I took my time and got super turned around. That means that I would literally bleeding minimum wage if I bought it at the 2022 full price. Luckily, I bought it on sale, and I still kind of feel like the playtime hasn't warranted the price. If you aren't 100% into the game and know you'll replay it, this might not be the best game to buy. Luckily, I do really like the game and replay it a lot. It's a nice game night. Something simple that you can play in one sitting.
And Resistance just seems like an attempt to pad out the price. Particularly with the new RE:Verse on the field.
So if you nab it on a wicked sale? It's a good choice. Otherwise, you'll get more playtime-to-price out of RE2R and the (at the time) upcoming RE4R.
And gosh, I hate to leave it like this. It feels like I'm saying don't buy it, but it's so very good, and I love it very much. This just shouldn't be a priority buy, and it's still cheaper than most copies of the original game I was able to track down.

The characters are interesting and have depth to them, I love the relationship between Jill and Carlos especially. The in-game shop is a great feature and definitely made me more inclined to replay on higher difficulties. I really love how they connected the game to RE2 in the RPD and how things were the same as they were there, the safes having the same codes and Carlos not opening the changing room locker but taking the note, leaving Claire/Leon to find what's inside instead. The attention to detail was really nice there. The horror element was really well done in certain areas, like the part where Jill has to restore the power in the beginning, always freaks me out. And the hospital section felt very eerie and especially scary the first time I played it.
As a remake I cant really say much since I didn't play the original, but I've watched reviews and they could definitely have done a lot of things better. The game feels pretty short honestly and they cut way more content than they should've. The fact that there's also only one ending even further contributes to the non replayability of the game unless you're a completionist. Compared to RE2 remake this completely fails at the remake part but it's still a good game. The beginning of the game feels very mid, it's just straight forward and just scripted sequences. 
In my experience playing on normal was the best option. The battles are pretty well leveled out and its all around a nice time. But then when you get to nightmare and inferno modes?? It's fine all the way up to the last bossfight. (the beginning is pretty difficult but still its managable) It's not even hard in an enjoyable way, you get stunlocked all the time and it's near impossible. Horrible design there as it seems like they ramped up the difficulty by 1000 compared to the rest of the game. The bossfights overall could be better, the second and third are basically mostly the same. The last one has a good premiss and design but it is far too easy on assisted-hardcore but then gets WAY TOO hard on nightmare and inferno. 

Over all I still love this game tho, it's one of my favourites and I really want to fully complete it. I've grown attached to the characters and story and it's just great.

I actually had a relatively enjoyable time playing it, treating it as a pretty average, rather toneless experience, BUT. It just comes across as low effort disappointment. It lacks substance and feels so very simplified, guiding the player by hand like a baby through a very short content - ridiculously short for a game in this price range. Especially given the fact that most of its good qualities and mechanics come from RE2 Remake. It feels more like a DLC or a cash grab - as if someone thought, ""hmm, we have most of the gameplay already figured out from RE2, let's just switch character models, throw in a few short locations, assemble some level art and switch difficulties to 5 instead of 3 and voila, the game!""
That's not ok. Such low effort games are NOT to be encouraged. And as someone who hasn't even played the original RE3, I can't even imagine the disappointment of the original fans who were looking for a remake of their beloved title. Throwing in metaphorical scraps to the players is just not alright and I refuse to accept such approach. 

But I've said that this game is ""meh"" to me even if I don't treat it like a RE remake. So to illustrate this fact with the very beginning, as this trend keeps up through most of the game.
The opening sequences of the game show me that - there is no real threat, almost ever, as the chase scene is scripted and only requires the player to literally press ""W"" for a fraction of a second, for a few times. I cannot feel any danger if all I need to do for survival is to press one button. I don't worry for Jill either, cause she easily shrugs off injuries that should have shattered her spine into pieces. Being thrown around, falling multiple floors in a car without even a seatbelt, getting pushed around in explosions - eh, just a day like any other. Let's just press a hand to what's left of our ribs and walk it off.
I also don't really fear the main antagonist, Nemesis, since he just literally barges into the opening without any foreword, gives a super easy-to-escape chase and proves not to be any threat, since scripted Jill is immortal and I would have to consciously try to make her fail.
So, besides showing that the player is not to be trusted to actually play a game, having things dumbed down, it also removes any fear factor from a horror game. A HORROR game. How am I to feel scared or cornered if I know my character is close to indestructible when the script requires it, my nemesis is not much of a threat most of the time (even when he appears in a regular gameplay, simply throwing ONE grenade makes him incapacitated. Lol). Not much to fear out there, is there?
This game has many more flaws (and few good qualities, but they ARE some, not to say no). But this review has gone on for long enough.
Just... stop cutting corners, cutting content and making the lowest effort possible, treating the players like idiots, happy to accept anything from you. Eh...",1675329458,1675329458,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay and graphics are similar to RE2R and many assets from that game are reused here.

The new Nemesis is relentless, but the game could have explored more of him before transforming him into the typical giant monster blob we see in almost all Resident Evil boss battles.
The game is more action-packed than RE2R, but despite the cut content, the narrative is well-written, and the characters, especially Jill and Carlos, are well-developed. Although it's a short game, it's still enjoyable and fun to play.",1675320356,1675320356,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game runs great aside from the fact that it'll sometimes try to launch in my secondary monitor for no reason until I restart, not sure what's up with that, no other game in my library does that not even RE2 Remake

Other than that, perfect buttery smooth 120fps on medium settings at 1920x1080 with what is honestly dated hardware at this point

I just wish the game was a better game. It feels bad in comparison to RE2 Remake partly because RE3 felt like shit compared the original RE2. They wanted to replicate the Tyrant chase sequences from the previous game but with more action, and it turned out to be an awful idea that isn't very fun at best and frustrating and annoying at worst. Not sure why I thought that would change with the remake, but lo and behold, it did not

The boss fight with flamethrower Nemesis at the end of the first act with Jill before switching to Carlos is quite possibly one of if not the most annoying and needlessly time consuming bosses in the entire almost 30 year long series, and that's really saying something because these games are notorious for having awful bosses

I'm only probably about a third, maybe halfway through the game at most I think, and I don't see how it could redeem itself. I intend to finish it to get my 10$ worth, but honestly I feel bad having spent that on it.

Final verdict? Purchase as part of the 15$ bundle that comes with RE2 Remake and treat it as spending 15$ on a really good game and getting a mediocre turd for free as a gift

It has a lot of quality of life improvements with increased save points and better level designs. Dialogs are better too, no more "" what the hell "". Instead you get a mouthful of "" what the fuck "" wherever possible. With that said, it feels more like an action-horror than a horror-survival. But, I liked that too. 

The only thing that I did not like about this game was the amount of gore and other special effects. In the previous game you could literally cut limbs with your knife and create holes in your enemy's body with your bullets. Most of it is gone in this game, which feels unpolished and like it was a rushed game.

In addition to cutting a lot from the original, it was made by a ""B-Team"" who didn't quite ""get"" classic Resident Evil gameplay the way the RE2M team did, resulting in a game that struggles mechanically and tonally.

That being said, I still like it a lot. You might call it a guilty pleasure.

There's a lot to complain about. The new dodge mechanic invalidates classic RE resource management since you just dodge past many monsters who'd force a fight/flight choice before, but it doesn't work as a blastathon like RE4/Desd Space since the action is rarely as consistent. This is all exacerbated by the second third of the game going way overboard on linear set-pieces.

However, when it hits the mark, like in the exploration focused areas (streets, hospital), or some of the more inventive combat scenarios (brainsucker maze, sewers) it's intense and memorable

Overall it suffers most from not being able to decide what it wants to be. Is it smart survival horror or adrenaline pumping action-horror? Devs didn't seem to knoww.

So, Jill is hot and has some cool gameplay features. There's cut and added content. Carlos is obviously hot as well with DIFFERENT gameplay mechanics than Jill's. Best character in RE3 ngl. Nemesis is more scripted and linear than Mr X was which he was supposed to be an expansion of.  8/10.

Welp, I successfully completed this in one day. Can't say that it wasn't bad. Mind you I got this on sale for $15 AUD and the experiences are from Standard difficulty. None of that easy shit. No I won't do any like checkbox shit. You'll get an actual review from me. Also I compare a few things to RE2

(SPOILERS IN THIS PART ONLY RN!!!!)
Story: Being the new RE fan I am. I haven't played the original for RE3 but according to people there is cut out parts from the original. After completing this in 1 day, I can see that. Overall, they kept the premise of the story line. Zombie outbreak in Raccoon city. Nemesis is hunting down S.T.A.R.S members, Jill is one. She gets hunted down by Nemesis. Meets Carlos. Do a bunch of shit to get them out of the city. Now, not everything is cut content. The RPD part is new. I believe the original just had Carlos in the hospital saving Jill and that was the only time you played Carlos, now we have Carlos in RPD then in hospital saving Jill. Nice little add-on to the story there.

Gameplay: It's still RE. Shoot zombies, scavenge, craft, unlock stuff. Boss battles, all that. Coming from RE2 remake, Nemesis is a bit more scripted and linear than Mr X BUT he is more deadlier(More on that later). A lot of the typical shit is still recycled. Herbs, spray, zombie behaviour, dogs, lickers. All that shit but there are a few different zombie types that they added. First off, pale heads are in this. If you never did 'no way out' or 'runaway' ghost survivors in RE2 then you wouldn't know them. Basically, you need heavy ammo so the pistol that holds MAG ammo. They're annoying but one shot to the head if you have that gun. Shotguns work but they'll get up again soon. Hunters (I believe that's what they're called) of all types are new. The gamma ones in the sewers weren't too annoying, you learn their mechanics pretty easily and you just have to be effective with your attack on them. The betas or whatever ones you'll encounter in the hospitals are..... brutal to say the least. Acid rounds are effective on them but they have a shell on their head that you have to break through so fighting them in NEST was annoying but as Carlos it was fine cause he had the AR so just spray and pray motherfuckersssss.

Nemesis: As I have stated, Nemesis is a more scripted and linear Tyrant comapred to Mr X. He is also supposed to be an expansion on Mr X apparently. He doesn't stalk you and hunt you down like Mr X does. He moreso just comes out of nowhere and hunts you down. In saying this, he is WAYYYYYY fucking deadlier than Mr X. Stage 2 boss battle was rough but he can stun-lock you if you aren't dodging his attacks with the quickstep or roll (If you can pull it off.). This will fuck you as you are pretty likely to die quickly if he stun-locks you. The easiest way to get out of a stun-lock is desperately pressing space and going in a direction. You can only pray if that happens. So Nemesis is and sometimes can be busted. So what? Well, it may be the difference between dying or living so just fair warning. Otherwise, his boss battles are what they're supposed to be. Fun yet challenging, stage 2 boss battle had me going insane ngl.

Carlos: He's hot... what else can I say? jk, I have more to say. Despite his looks, Carlos is surprisingly easier than Jill is imo. He can punch or barge through zombies which can be useful in a one on one or Carlos vs Hunter moment. He's more resistant to damage than Jill is apparently and the horde mode felt very much like something I've seen before just changed to fit the situation. HMMMMMM. Anywho, Carlos is just a good character and his sections were easier than Jill's parts were.

Jill: Now, Jill's graphics and looks wise is hot and that's about all for her graphics. Now, gameplay for Jill is a bit weird. Coming from RE2, I forgot about the roll/quickstep mechanic but it is useful. You might just use it to get past zombies but right click/aim after rolling and you can get a slow-mo headshot on the zombie you rolled past. Pretty fucking epic right? Wait, there's more. She is the ONLY character in this game who can lockpick and cut the chains off to access new areas. I guess it's cause she is the character you use all the time but it is pretty fun. She also gets to use some fun guns and ANOTHER MINIGAME TO CREATE SOMETHING. But it is kind of fun to figure it out so good on you capcom recycling that Idea.

Conclusion: Do I think it's worth the full price? No, get this shit on sale because off sale is not worth it. Do I think it's a good game? Yes. I probably will play this over and over again. I do want to see how easy assisted mode is and eventually work my skill level up to do the hardest difficulty which is nightmare I think? I don't know man. If I have to give /10 rating, this game gets a solid 8/10 for me. Obviously cut content, recycled content like zombie behaviour and design, and a more scripted and linear Nemesis, does bring the game down in the ratings. But seeing as it is a 5/10 or over it does get my recomendation. Now gamers, go and enjoy this game while it's on sale. Otherwise, wait until another sale or if you DESPERATELY want it then get it off of sale.",1674991277,1674991277,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Remake is not that hot tho. There's something missing here, and I can't quite catch what it is. Maybe is the fact that most of those things that I loved about Resi3 are not present, like the different paths that you can traverse, or the clock tower. Maybe is that. Expectations too high I dare to say.

Also, what did you do to my boy Nemi in this game? Why did you make him look like a god damn Xenomorph running like a dog and stuff?

[i] Pros [/i]

* Great looking graphics and thick horror atmosphere thanks to the RE Engie.
* Animations are nice and smooth, scripted events are really well animated, and fantastic facial captures and modeling.
* Voice acting and sound design are top notch which should be a given for a survival horror game.
* Music is great and heavily supports the current atmosphere you are in.
* Story still takes inspiration from the OG RE3 but is modernized with a cinematic feel.

[i] Cons [/i]

* Game is extremely short for a $60 price tag. My first run took little under 4 hours on Hardcore and not knowing what to do at all...
* Gore and some body physics downgraded. Less gore when you shoot Zombies and zombie's legs cannot be shot off like in RE2.
* Can have an extreme trial and error feel for first play throughs. this may be case by case but I would recommend having multiple saves at a time.
* Does not have much replayability which for an RE title is extremely disappointing. No 2nd runs like RE2, no side stories like RE2, and no extra fun game modes after completion.

The 'Resident evil 3 remake' is definitely a fun game which I enjoyed playing the game from 0% to 100% (ahcievement wise). Game mechanics like the roll dodge with Jill Valentine was a really cool feature which made me hyped up every time I made a clutch dodge. 

This 3rd person survival definitely is an amazing game itself. but as a remake this game is close to being a disappointment. As a remake this game is disappointing because this remake was incredibly rushed compared to the original. Missing major locations, enemies, weapons and many other features which made the game multiple times better in the og version. The game also doesn't include any extra modes which re2 remake did. 

Other than the disappointment which is caused from the game not involving many content that the og version had the game is still very likable and enjoyable. The graphics and the gameplay are nice and smooth. The point shop feature was nice aswell although it made the game a lot easier to complete 100%. The boss fights were easy but still enjoyable aswell (except the final boss on the hardest difficulty made me pull my hair out of my head a little bit). 

I would definitely recommend buying this game on sale and not for the full price. It honestly ain't worth the full price despite how much fun you might have during this game.

While this is called Resident Evil 3 it should just have been RE2 DLC since that's the amount of effort they put in the game. While the game does look really good along with a few new additions in terms of movement, weapons, and enemies. Most of the game is just reused assets that feel so close to the RE2 Remake that was released earlier. While Jill is the main character, she feels so annoying with her dialogue and actions towards other characters feels too hostile or weird given the situation. While Nemesis is the main villain of the game, he just feels like a nuisance just appearing out of nowhere and disappearing just as quickly. Along with Jill you also get to play as Carlos who gets to go through the police station along with the Hospital which is probably the best level in the game. He is such a better character from Jill as he is the only one trying to do good no matter the situation. The game is so short that you basically get the downtown as a level for like 20 minutes then after that you can’t access it. Just forced to go down linear levels with hardly any variation from what you have already seen before. With the Hospital being a decent level just a little later on just for the game to end basically 25 minutes later. There was a concern from myself when the lockpick was ready to be discarded despite still having 2 sections left in the game. Which made me feel like there was nothing really to explore, just in-game cutscenes you are forced to sit through and some pretty generic and annoying boss battles. On that topic the final boss fight on Nightmare and Inferno is just bullshit with it constantly going into combo moves where if you miss 1 dodge your dead. Including 1 move where it repeats it 7 times in a row where as mentioned you die alot. 3 hits in a row means your death so you basically have to be perfect just to beat it. Along with that there are bugs that could crash your game, 1 can happen sometimes before you complete Carlos’s 1st level. While the other occurs at the end of the train cutscene before it is supposed to load Carlo’s first level. This happened on my 1st run through as well as at least 10 times while playing the game on Inferno. Which really brought my overall opinion of this game even lower than it was before. While the game is harder on the tougher difficulties nothing really changes except some item placements and harder enemies. Which is a let down considering they at least you have improved it on harder difficulties. Even getting all the records is time consuming with many of them just involving you killing a certain number of enemies with various weapons or just the number of enemies killed overall to just pad the game until you get the better weapons from the shop. The shop is just unlocking cool weapons or items you can use my completing records which just makes it overall a chore to complete. I feel like this game had so much potential to be as good as the first 2 games despite their issues. Instead it is a hollow shell of a once good game but just falls flat in execution in many terms of gameplay and storytelling.

Building on the remake of RE2, 3 uses the RE Engine to great effect making a photo realistic survival horror game that plays well and can be unnerving at times. I never played the original 1999 title but from what I have been told this is a poor remake of it. As someone that went into this game fresh I can assure anyone else new to it that it is not a bad game at all. 

RE3 takes the gameplay of 2 but makes it more action oriented just like what the original title did. Jill has access to more ammo, storage, and has a dodge roll mechanic similar to what RE6 introduced. It is an extremely fast paced title that can easily be finished in under 5 hours if you know what you are doing. This is the most unfortunate thing about it due to their apparently being cut levels/boss fights, and the fact that the titular Nemesis no longer appears randomly to stalk you throughout the game. Every time Nemesis appears it is a scripted fight and he can be dispatched if you have enough ammo and no how to confront him during these scenarios. It is by no means bad but it does lower the amount of tension the pursuer creates whenever he appears. The other unfortunate thing about 3 is that it is not a very replayable title like previous games in the past. There is a store that you can buy items post game for a next playthrough but it is not nearly as well thought out as previous titles. 

When it came out RE3 was slightly controversial due to the price point it came out and the lack of content it had. While that may be a valid criticism, in 2023 on sale it can be a very value based title for $5 if you are looking to play something that is horror themed and survival horror.",1674085079,1674085079,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Superb graphics, with excellent optimization options. Over the top bullet time dodges with Jill and Carlos' Shoulder ram/ Falcon punch add some fun moments replacing the old iffy dodge mechanic from the original. Weapon selection is good- offers substantial fun in multiple playthroughs though if you enjoy speed running.

Cons: NO MERCENARIES mode was the biggest fumble here. Way too short. Too many locations, enemies, and boss encounters were cut out. Feels rushed at times due to different design team with some reused assets. Less gore/dismemberment, unlike RE2 REmake. Puzzles are simple and rather sparse compared to original. Nemesis looks way less imposing now compared to his iconic Debut appearance.

That being said, this game SHOWERS you with ammo like it's nobody's business, altering an entire gameplay element for the worse. The game is filled with an excessive amount of handouts.
Nemesis is much cooler than Mr. X, but Mr. X is much more of a threat. Every encounter with Nemesis is scary the first time, but then you realize it's all scripted and linear. He's just a small obstacle in the end and he only resembles a cool character for the first third of the game.

I do get surprised by some reviews. There are things I disagree on. Here is what you can expect:
[b]Game length[/b]: expect 4-5 hours of gameplay your first run. The campaign omits many areas and puzzles from the original RE3 game. 
[b]Graphics[/b]: Very good! 
[b]Difficulty[/b]: as much as some areas could be made more difficult, others WILL offer you a bit of challenge. You WILL die. Several times. 
[b]Ammo[/b]: there is abundance of ammo and you probably won't experience the lingering stress of scarcity that we know and love from RE. 
[b]Backpedaling[/b]: the game is relatively linear for being a RE game, correct. But there IS definitely some optional backpedaling to acquire some upgrades.
[b]Replayability[/b]: you can play the campaign 2-3 times to try to beat your initial game time and complete some achievements. That was fun for me.
[b]Nemesis[/b]: encounters with Nemmy are short lived, yet I would argue that they can be intense sometimes. There is little randomness to his patterns of attack. I can see why this is disappointing for some. But he is still powerful, and will definitely be the reason for some frustration as he will kill you. 

I have now played through the campaign twice, and I think the game has recieved way too much negative critique. As long as you accept that the game is 4-5 hours of gameplay your first run, you will enjoy it. Again, I bought it on sale, so maybe that's why it doesn't bother me as much. Try to view it as a DLC campaign for RE2 and you are good to go. If you want to make it harder, play it on Hardcore.",1673261751,1673265651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Of the remake of RE123, 3 is the one I enjoyed most. In fact I couldn't finish 1 and decided to simply watched a gameplay of it. 
I'm more into a game of fighting for your life more than a survival game where you can't fight and simply have to run for life, so 3 comes closest to this. Understandably, for people who simply want horror and hopelessness, this probably wasnt the greatest remake.
In RE2, I changed difficulty midgame to assisted (laugh as you like) and I still consider that a small challenge. Not entirely easy. But for RE3.....the easy mode is real easy, and I hope I would have picked normal -_-When the game ends I had >1000 ammos and >20 items for full HP in my safe, definitely didnt happen in RE2......

But afterall, the greatest plus of this game?
Playing Jill with mod is such a great, great enjoyment......:D

Pros
1. The graphics and presentation
2. The music and the atmosphere it creates. The music ties very well with each part of the game. In some parts it makes you feel safe and relieved, in other parts it creates the feel of urgency and in other parts it makes your poo touch your underwear. I even enjoyed the credits because I wanted to listen to the whole song. 
3. Nemesis is scary.
4. Gameplay is fun. The whole ""combine things to solve problems, manage your limited ammo and survive"" is very addictive.
5. The first scene of the introduction is well made.
6. Jill is hot.
7. The final boss fight was satisfying

Cons
1. Overall, the opening level/sequence is down right laughable. 
- Incohesive behavior that contradicts the dialogue. e.g. ""There is a monster chasing us.""  he says. And after 15 seconds of just standing there and talking about it, he starts to casually walk away in slow-motion while scratching his head.
- Incohesive scripted set pieces. Monster literally got through the building wall, but then gets he/she/it (because is 2022) gets stopped with furniture.
- ""Interactive"" gameplay blended with the scripted scenes, I guess to make you feel one with the protagonist (?). In actuality it has the opposite effect - the opposite of immersion? Sorry, english is not my first language.  Anyway, the monster is chasing you, ""Press W to watch the scripted scene"". Car is not starting ""press w to try and start the car"". Press ""W"" to walk five steps, then you enter a scripted scene again.  That's just stupid, play the scripted scene already or let me play the game.
- Rescue helicopter blew up with no apparent reason

2. The combat mechanics, basically don't exist. I've seen reviews praising the dodging ability of Jill and the ""shoving"" ability of Carlos which I find immensely stupid. You mean to tell me that a trained police officer can't perform any combat move on weak zombies, other than dodging? Because I've seen her battling and surviving against Nemesis in the previous scripted scene. Also, Carlos's ""shoving"" ability is less useful than dodging on some occasions, but I guess special forces self defense training only consists of pushing and hammer-punching because dodging is for ..female cats -.-
Also, the recovery time after dodging and the running speed are both ridiculous. I can run faster, dodge and recover more efficiently and I was never trained in the art of fighting zombies.

3. Incohesive/imbalanced/overpowered/bullet sponge enemies. 
- After 5 bullets to the head to kill a lower tier zombie, it just gets annoying. 
- Some non-boss enemies that you casually find in some levels, can use instant-kill attacks, even though Nemesis can't. 
- Weak fallen zombies slowly wiping the floor right in front of you with their belly and on the next moment they got you on a triangle choke. Am I missing a frame or what? 

4. Annoyingly positioned saves right before the boss fights. I may suck at the game and I need to play the boss for 3 hours before winning and that's annoying enough, I don't want to pointlessly walk for 30 seconds each time I die, just to get to the boss checkpoint.

5. Annoying long unskippable death scene whenever a zombie kills you.   

6. The game is too linear and restrictive

7. The puzzles could be way more challenging. I mean, calling them puzzles is over-reaching. 



Summary
That was my first resident evil game. It didn't get the best reviews and that's why I wanted to play it first. I didn't want to play resident evil 2 (which has overwhelmingly positive reviews) first and then maybe be bored to play a worse game. I recon it's a good game introduction to the genre. 
It is by no means a ""great"" game, mainly because of the unpolished and restricted gameplay, but I personally find the basic concept -> blend of action, puzzles and survival, to be very addictive. Overall it has enough gameplay, enough story and very good presentation (because of the music and the graphics) to keep you hooked, IF you like the genre. I recommend playing it for an hour or so and if you don't like it, just ask for a refund. Also, Jill is hot.",1673127023,1673137988,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

And that's it. That's almost all and every possible praisable stuff this game can get. Almost everything else is a tremendous disappointment, especially for the classic fanbase.

First of all, the game itself feels and looks more like a DLC from RE2 Remake and not like an original title since many different elements, from items to enemies and models to ambiences are literally reused in a way. 

The game fails to deliver a tense pace due to a laughable Nemesis whose new model can't compensate for the lack of a good challenge, combined with so many unnecessary cutscenes and missable encounters (including the usually bad boss battles) in-game that are easily solved while throwing a single grenade on him (an example of an absolute disregard for the terror that Nemesis should represent - he drops an item and pauses for a very long time, which is enough for you to kill the other enemies nearby, while collecting all the items scattered around and leaving the area, plus not being chased by him afterwards). If at least the Remake had some of the original good encounters, like the one inside the Raccoon P.D., when Nemesis jumps out of nowhere, breaking into a corridor after shattering a window, a moment that freezes your heart and gives you a sense of desperation and unpreparation, the Remake would've been so much better and well-considered by the players. But no, this kind of moment was stripped away and replaced with some cheap ones where you simply press an action button and concludes the scene, without having to think what to do or where to run. In the Remake, you have many scenarios of tranquility and calmness knowing that Nemesis won't be able to follow you properly or break through many rooms as it should. And speaking of action buttons that concludes some scenes, we don't even have those text boxes giving us the decision about to run or to fight Nemesis we previously had in the original game.

The general exploration was ruined in comparison to the original game due to the removal of puzzles (replaced with uninsteresting ones) and an unexplainable destruction of the original street map: whereas in the original game you could walk through different streets using the connections between them while having some options to get from point A to point B, always with a permanent sense of tension, the general areas on the remake are usually linear and without the same freedom to explore. To clarify this specific point, you pass through many classic places from the original game but you simply cannot visit them here ([spoiler]like the Stagla gas station[/spoiler]) like if they were only referenced to somehow but not really being part of the experience which ends up into a tremendous frustration. The number of areas that were removed from the original game alongside their respective puzzles is enormous.

The recreated personality of Jill is awful (and for many people, her recreated appearence too). Take Leon or Claire from the RE2 Remake for comparison: Leon as a rookie who haven't even had a single day on the academy and Claire as a girl looking for her missing older brother. Jill, by the time, had already fought against hordes of zombies and other monsters in RE1 while unscathed thus being a respected member of S.T.A.R.S Team Alpha (a special division of Raccoon P.D.) who survived all that terror and remained investigating the events soon after. And when you put these 3 characters from the Remakes side by side, Jill falls bland. She looks generic, unmemorable, naive (as seen from some decisions she takes) and unexperienced (even more than Leon and Claire, who are always trying to encourage themselves during RE2 Remake). Every other RE game co-starred by Jill itself have a much better Jill than this one, by default.

The replay value is absolutely non-existent, especially when compared to RE2 Remake and RE: Village (both titles using the same engine, as mentioned before). Since there are many places removed from the original game, there is little to nothing that makes you want to play this Remake again because the experience itself isn't memorable.

Capcom had a great opportunity to create an incredible and cherished remake, even more than RE 2, but instead has created a huge disappointment for much of its fanbase and showed how greedly rushed the Remake was.",1673066851,1673114706,False,47,1,0.716846346855163574,0,True,False,False

My understanding is that it cut content and mechanics from the original game, creating a linear, streamlined experience that especially stung for the fanbase after the runaway success of RE2R. Now, the only survival horror games I've ever played are the three Resident Evil remakes, so I can't really comment on comparisons to RE3, but I can say that if you expect anything like the police station in RE2R, you will be disappointed. On its own merits though, I think this game rules.

I haven't played the original, but my understanding is that in RE2 Mr. X was a scripted encounter while in RE3 Nemesis stalked you (or seemed to stalk you via programming wizardry) throughout the game. In the remakes, these roles have been switched. Mr. X's thundering footsteps are fully ingrained within me. He's a constant ever-approaching threat, closing onto you as you scurry through the labyrinthine station. Nemesis meanwhile is solely a scripted enemy, appearing during certain story moments and for boss fights throughout the game. This could be disappointing if the scripted scenes were meh. Thankfully, they're all lovely. Nemesis is your guide through and the instigator of the total destruction of Raccoon City, smashing through walls as you run building to building trying to escape. That's the real joy of the game: watching Raccoon City burn. In RE2R, the police station was monumental. I got the feeling, running laps around it to open doors and solve puzzles, that it would last forever. Every block in RE3R by contrast is waiting to be turned to rubble. The methodical pace of RE2R is thus quickened in a more action-focused direction, and you don't stay in any given place for anywhere near as long as in RE2R. Nemesis is coming to blow it up, after all.

The story here is also...really good? Jill, who was a bit of a blank slate in REmake, is really efficiently established here as practically a war journalist. She's close to closing in on Umbrella when she's turned into a reluctant action hero after her entire apartment collapses. Something I noticed in RE2R is that when the writing team expands on the original game into new directions, their writing becomes very strong (e.g. Kendo, a heartbreaking interlude that's unique to the remake). Here they're given even more room to breathe, to their immense benefit. RE3R is a surprisingly nasty story, following Jill as she tries to save who she can, and find any way to hold Umbrella responsible for their crimes, all while running, shooting, and swearing her way through the city. The characters she meets are strongly established and there's plenty of twists as the conspiracy unravels. 

RE3R is more than a different game than RE2R: it's its negative image. This is apparent in its mechanical construction (compare Mr. X's and Nemesis' behaviors, which are a microcosm of the games as a whole) but extends to the thematic core. RE2R's story, for as dark as it got, is still a story about defeating the odds. The ending is downright saccharine as [spoiler]the protagonists was into the sunlight, smiling kid in tow, preserving the innocence of a future age[/spoiler]. By contrast RE3R is downright bleak, with various forces conspiring to derail Jill's efforts, and an ending [spoiler]that legitimately shocked me, as the vaccine's destruction rendered all of her efforts null[/spoiler]. A particular comparison I found interesting as I got to the end is that the motivations for one of RE3R's villains is very similar to those of a fan-favorite in RE2R. Under the warm light of the second remake, the character can find the goodness in themselves and do the right thing. Here, things are less kind. These games take place in the same time frame, sometimes even sharing locations, but they live in different worlds. Playing both games back-to-back, however, they interweave with other, creating a larger understanding of the city and the many forces that drove it (for good or for ill). 

I can understand wanting RE3R to take a different approach. But for what it is, and what it wants to be, it's a home run. RE3R feels like a fully realized version of itself, and for me that's the most I can ask from a game.",1672979656,1672979656,True,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0,True,False,False

5/10 Wait for Sale 

After playing RE 2: Remake I was super hyped for 3make. This game should have been put in the oven for at least another year.  Nemesis was a baby compared to Mr. X. 

Nightmare and Inferno's end boss is broken, it was very obviously not play tested. The boss stun locks you to hell and you die or in Inferno you die in one hit with no room for error. 

The whole feminist crap really ruined Jill. Jill in other games was a super likable character with optimism and general care for her teammates and friends. Here she's a robot with some douche attitude who treats people like shit. 

This game has some good moments but at the end of the day it is not worth full price get it for $20 maybe $30 if you are a die hard fan.

even for $10 I recommend against buying. 
They've essentially changed genres since RE2 and nothing is scary anymore. Instead of feeling scared and like you have to seek refuge, the entire game is just tedious. Before there is scarce ammunition to add to the feeling of helplessness of the player character. Now? Now you're always saving up every bit of ammo you find for very long and tiring boss fights.

And the boss fights are terrible too. In a normal game, a grab attack locks you into the animation and damage at the end of the enemy animation. In this game, it happens at the beginning, just by virtue of being too close. You don't even get to see the animation play out in the final battle with the nemesis before you're watching a cutscene of Jill being bitten.

It's garbage. People have said this game was not made by the same capcom team as other Resident Evil games and it shows through.

It's shorter and more scripted than its predecessor and drops the ball completely when it comes to Nemesis, who is completely tame and unintimidating. Ironically enough, as he is supposed to be an upgrade on REmake 2's Mr. X, who was absolutely horrifying, especially the first time you met him.

What it comes down to is how mostly everything involving Nemesis - boss fights excepted - is either a cutscene or completely scripted. He doesn't free roam the area like X did, so there is no randomness to his movements. Mostly it's just laughably easy chase sequences that are more interested in being cinematic than fun or challenging. On more than one occasion, I escaped Nemesis by simply holding down the forward button.

The core gameplay remains good, however, so I can still recommend REmake 3 to anyone who was a fan of its predecessor. It's just a shame that instead of going bigger and better, they went smaller, shorter and more linear.",1672772799,1672772799,True,26,0,0.754915893077850342,0,True,False,False

If you play this game after RE2, yes, this game will feel like absolute waste of money. RE2 was beautiful, scary, adrenaline pumping, story and characters were absorbing you into game and it had so much replayability, as I'm writing this, I have still yet to play ghost survivor modes.

[MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD]
RE3 itself, was so dissapointing. I love the characters, Jill and Carlos especially (I would marry Carlos), but the antagonist itself, Nemesis, felt like a joke. Unlike Mr X in RE2, Nemesis was supposed to be faster, stronger and smarter. And where you have Mr X stalking you in the entire RPD, Nemesis only stalks you for 5-10 minutes of the entire game, other than that it's all scripted and only boss fights. And to know that I don't have a better Mr X stalking me was so dissapointing. Other than scripted encounters, cutscenes were absolute joke. Nemesis had our protagonist Jill in his hands many times, only to throw her away or, get stopped by a bookshelf (3 minutes after he bursts into your apartment breaking walls mind you). Also you could take him down with a simple hand grenade in each counter like what the hell? We are talking about an absolute biological weapon here.

Cutscenes were so beautiful, but until the NEST, it was just cutscenes, I didn't feel like I'm playing a game at all. And if it wasn't for cutscenes, the game had so many scripted scenes at the begging were what you did didn't really matter, but you had to go through each time you play it because you couldn't skip them because they were not a cutscene. These were absolutely pointless! Also it was really boring and even more dissapointing after you figure out those are scripted.

But the worst part of the game is, in my opinion. It was too short. As you can see I have almost 7 hours into the game, and I finished the game 1.5 times (I was playing the hardcore and trying to get the unlockables but I got bored and dropped it off midway). There is also no replayability other than playing the same game in a more difficult mode.

TLDR; The game is not worth spending money, graphics are absolutely beautiful and Carlos is so hot, but the game is not adrenaline pumping enough for a horror-action game, and it's too short to spend actual money on it.

The map is too huge with sections that can not be revisited due to story progression.

As i was warned ahead just what kind of disappointment awaited with this title. this review is set toward resident evil veterans, not folk who are first time players. 
as they will not understand much of what makes the games special. for those who may not have brain cells, this is a reboot of resident evil 3 nemesis(or biohazard the last escape). incorrectly referred to as a remake to swindle those who enjoyed Resident evil 2 remake, 
which actually stuck to the proper source material like a remake is supposed to while RE3 remake is a reboot in the since its a rewrite based on the original. it cannot be stressed how much is missing here, the story is lackluster to say the least. it feels rushed in it's writing.
an jill now drops a F bombs in nearly every sentence like she did in the movie resident evil apocalypse. the nemesis is nerfed in this released big time, he isn't as aggressive as he is in every other resident evil game in existence, when ORC nemesis is more of a threat than this games nemesis, I knew exactly what i was in for. and don't expect a good final boss battle, this game boss's are pure carbon copies of re2 remakes boss battles with revelations boss battles mechanics mixed in. In fact the gameplay can be easily compared to the Revelations spin off altogether, it's like capcom wanted to make a revelations game, but instead said ""why not Nemesis"". from the linear gameplay, to the dodge mechanics, to the scrapped mercenaries an multiple endings, this has revelations written all over it. this is in spirit revelations pt 3, if you want to play revelations this game is for you.
If you want something like re2 remake, play re2 remake an avoid this unless its on discount. I cannot stress enough DO NOT BUY FULL PRICE.

Combat;
no complaints, plays like revelations mixed with re2 remake(because it has actual zombies instead). 

Overall this game should have just been an expansion, it's not that long, took me 4 hours on the first play through. nemesis boss battles are repurposed from other games. difficulty curve is lower, no reason somebody who played the other games preceding this would struggle. could have been done better, game seems rushed in most parts. graphics are fine.  puzzles are easy, enemies are inconsistent and nearly random, some rooms are predictable, 3 or four zombies, maybe a BOW around the corner, maybe not, nemesis shows up sometimes. very easy dodge mechanic.

very mixed feeling on this title honestly. don't really feel like playing it again, first resident evil game that i have ever felt bored in a boss arena. So congrats capcom you made me bored.",1672359939,1672359939,False,4,0,0.505449593067169189,0,True,False,False

This game is great in some ways, but it cuts off what shouldn't even be cut off, given that when you look at what the original RE3 from 1999 looked like and this one won't fit a lot of things here, and it's true, since this game has been shortened so that it probably doesn't work anymore, and this is a mistake that has hit the player a lot, there are not nearly as many things as in the original part, and if they are so insignificant, or they are just for rewards. I was looking forward to it when I fought the underground worm, or when I decided whether to fight the Nemesis or not, but I didn't see these things and CAPCOM itself didn't even tell the players.
From another point of view, this game still sticks to the story from the original game and still tries to stick to what made this Resident Evil great, but as I said, after they cut so many things, this story in RE3 is definitely just a joke that isn't funny. Yes, the game retains its horror feel, but it's not as strong as in RE2, because they did practically only Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V with this game. They did RE2 Remake vol.2 just with a different story, taking away the opportunity to defend themselves, if you are caught by a zombie, and add that Nemesis is incredibly annoying and on a higher difficulty will not even let you get up, once you get to the ground, you can press Esc and load the last saved position, because he will not let you get up. Zombie design and their behavior have not changed since the last game, they all have the same model, animation, grab animation and scripts. I'm almost sorry they couldn't stick to what they were 21 years ago (I'm speaking for year 2020). They had a great plan and also a great design and everything looked so perfect, unfortunately it was not enough to convert a well-made game to Modern style. The whole game already seems like a horror for people who have never played a horror game, for me as a fan of RE games and also a fan of Horror, this RE game is really bad. But what I can't deny this part is shooting and action, this still sticks to what makes these Resident Evil games great and that's simple Gunplay. You can modify weapons, acquire new ones and expand your arsenal. This thing is something I can appreciate, but in terms of how the Resident Evil series should work, it's quite a small plus.
Of course, it's great to see Racoon City from a different angle than usual, because while we saw Racoon City it was just the Police Station and the Orphanage, in this game we look at the Metro, Power Plant, Metro Control Rooms, Umbrella Laboratory and also ... Sewers.
In terms of design, this part is really great, but again it's just a small plus. If you are a really big fan of the Resident Evil series so I can not recommend this game, perhaps only in Discount, but if you are new to this series and not interested in original, so I can recommend this game to you ... but also at a discount, because spending 40$ for a 6-hour story that you can finish in 2 hours is really a very bold price.  I think that 20$ is a more affordable price. For me, this game is really very bad and a bit pointless, the only thing this game saves is Jill herself, who is Arrogant and has no fear and really adds style to this game (Something like Dante).

+ Great design
+ Good gunplay + Weapon variant
+ Sounds and Puzzles

- AI is the same
- Annoying Nemesis on Hardcore +
- Retention from the Original
- Overpriced
- Short story

First, I have to mention that I haven't played the original Resident Evil 3 that came out in 1999. So I will not feel any nostalgia about that game.

The things I want to say about Resident Evil 3 Remake are:

1- Nemesis is fun to fight but it feels underwhelming during the story. Nemesis is a menace just during the first section of the game. After that, you will only encounter him in boss fight arenas. I wish Nemesis had a longer ""stalker"" phase (such as Mr. X in RE2 or Lady Dimitrescu in RE8). Despite that, I enjoyed really enjoyed being chased by it in the streets, he is way more threatening than the other stalkers from the other Resident Evil games. The boss fights are fun too, maybe it is a little bit too easy to win against his stage 2.

2- The story is short. In my first playthrough, I beat the game in Standard difficulty  in 4 hours, while spending a lot of time exploring the streets and collecting every items. Resident Evil 3 Remake feels like it was being rushed during development. I want to explore more of Raccoon City's streets, sewers, and NEST 2.

3- Almost no puzzles. If I remember correctly, there's one easy puzzle at the beginning of the game when you have to select a valid route for the subway and then, nothing else.

4- It might be controversial but I think this Resident Evil has a good replay value. There are 5 different difficulty modes and the 2 hardest difficulties offers different enemies at different locations. There also are challenges that give you points to spend after completing them. These points can be exchanged for new weapons, more health, more inventory slots, infinite ammo weapons, more damage output, recovery items and more. I beat the game more than 10 times and I'm still having fun finding a new way to beat the game once again.

5- Speedrunning the game is really fun. I'm usually not a fan of speedrunning games but RE3R doesn't have long boring phases as we can have in RE Village with Beneviento's House or Moreau's Reservoir being dull to play after the first time.

6- Some cinematics would have been way better to play than to watch and there are some part of the game in which you just have to press W and press left click once.

7- Visually, this game is beautiful. Resident Evil games doesn't disappoint when it comes to graphism. Jill's and Carlos' looks are great, Nemesis looks like the scary pursuer it is.

In conclusion, Resident Evil 3 Remake is a good game that could have been better. You should really give this game a chance and try it because you will have a great time playing it. Not worth the full price, but worth the €15 RE2R + RE3R bundle when it's on sale!",1671888240,1672335711,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What Resident Evil 3 managed to achieve is take the foundations from Resident Evil 2 Remake and it's survival horror masterful design and place it on a different skeleton. One that is more action oriented without losing the heart that makes this franchise wonderful. It is in my opinion what Resident Evil 5 and 6 should have been if they wanted to lean more on the action and if to do that successfully the game has to sacrifice some of the old content to create a more cohesive experience, I am fine with that. Some are not and rightfully so.
That said, the game did ditch with the extra modes in favor of a ridiculously difficulty setting in the form of Nightmare and Inferno both of which are very very cruel to the player and not the fun challenging way. You will constantly get stun locked and die for no reason and it sucks when it happens. This does not take away from your first experience with the game however which I think is the way most people will experience this.

If you are expecting a well made remake (Like Resident Evil 2 Remake) you are in for a few surprises. RE3 can't quite live up to its predecessor. Almost everything this game does right is packed in the beginning area of the game (downtown Raccoon City). The game's opening sequence, ammo scarcity, jump scares and constant chases by Nemesis (within Downtown area) are definitely its strongest points. 

Compared to the Good old RE3, some story elements were touched to bring them up to modern standards, which was a good call. On the other hand, I was expecting Nemesis to be more of an ever-present thread, Like RE 2's Mr. X or RE 7's Jack Baker or just like Nemesis was on its original run. 

The developers this time decided to remove a lot of the game's puzzles and a whole bunch of areas from the original ([u]Raccoon City Park, Graveryard, City Hall, Press Office, Clock Tower, Dead Factory[/u]), they also removed the branching paths and different endings based on the player's decision during cutscenes, in addition they also removed ""The Mercenaries"" and decided to rush Nemesis transformations so you are limited to basically two Chases and 4 boss fight with Nemesis, which is pretty much this game's identity. 

This game can be finished by someone new to the survival horror genre in about 7 hours, normally this short of a run time wouldn't be a problem if the game had different modes/reasons to replay (Like RE2's extra main scenarios) but they are not present. 

TL;DR: This is a visually stunning game updated to modern standards that suffers from [b]A LOT[/b]] of cut content and rushes the player to its ending without any sort of reason to replay it. Do yourself a favor a [b]wait for a sale[/b] before buying this game.

I would still recommend it because it is interesting and fun to play. I admire the graphics. Especially the new character looks. Like seriously. Rent was due for the character design team.

It makes me want to cry because I will never know a woman with that personality and those looks in real life. I've seen people complain about her look but they need to open their eyes. Peel back those lids and look at her. They complained that she was too ""Lara Croft"" like or something and I'm like yeah??? She's supposed to be a badass?? Honestly, she looks 10x better than she did in all the other games. I think people are mad that she doesn't wear a tube top anymore and finally looks like a real woman. She was for sure intended for the female gaze in this game and I am not complaining... because I am a woman. I am convinced that she was handcrafted by Aphrodite herself. She is just so... perfect. This game really made me like her. I love her. Did I mention that I am in love with Jill Valentine? I think I'm getting off track....

The pacing of RE2 is very good as well, slowly building up the suspense and allowing you to absorb what is happening on screen while feeling the terror of being chased by Mr.X (Later on). Resident evil 3 remake (RE3) either lacks in these in some aspects or ignores them completely.

RE3 has exploration mechanics but all while you are getting chased constantly and hit without mercy. It's nearly impossible to dodge the new ""big boss"" Nemesis, and I hate how they changed it from the original. It has a new dodge mechanic that allows you to side step and roll out of the way if you hit it just right, but how do you dodge an enemy that is charging behind you that you cannot see? You can't most of the time which allows it to grant free hits on you.

Item discovery in RE3 is constant and boring. In RE2 you are able to take your time with looking around at the police station and finding items, while new storage upgrades/weapons are few and far between. In RE3 you are constantly running, only have time to explore your surroundings in brief instances and when it does slow down while you are doing the very childish puzzle solving as it just throws new items and upgrades at you. 

What makes all good Resident Evils great? The suspense and terror of not knowing what is around the corner, the close calls with enemies when you are 1 hit away from death, that breath of relief knowing you made it to a safe room in time when a licker was inches from your heels. Those are things RE2 had. In RE3 as stated before you are constantly being chased and hit at all times. It is annoying and not fun. I was stuck for 20-30 minutes on the third encounter with Nemesis just because he kept either grabbing me with his tongue or hit me from feet away when he charged. Why don't you just dodge it? Because like I said, its nearly impossible to hit the dodge roll at the right time when you can't even see him!

In its defense, I was only able to get as far as the subway leaving the station because it took me almost 2 hours to get there. I however, wanted a refund because of the fact I had nearly no fun while playing this game. The only good parts that I experienced while playing were looking at the stunning graphics for the brief moments that I could stand still and a brief part when you are turning on the power and these new scary spider zombies are chasing you.

8/10 (if purchased at discount)
7/10 (if purchased at full price)

Pros
- The change in direction to be more action oriented doesn't completely eliminate the scare roots of RE2 remake, and it's a nice change of pace. Zombie encounters aren't as fun as human encounters in RE4, but it's still a very fun action horror game in its own right.
- Dodge system is an excellent addition and the game gets really fun once you get good at it. If the game were longer, this could have easily been my favorite RE game thanks to the dodge system.
- Letting players choose unlockables with currencies is a very nice idea. Getting specific unlocks in RE2 remake was incredibly stressful. RE3's system allows casual players to obtain many of their favorite unlocks without stress. In fact, since you're allowed to use infinite weapons to obtain S-rank in higher difficulties, getting all unlockables was much more enjoyable and casual compared to RE2 remake.
- The shop has some interesting items that allows the player to customize their gameplay a bit. Some items give health regen, some give more damage, there's an item that makes dodging easier, etc. It's better than the typical infinite ammo unlocks you see in most RE games.
- Nightmare and Inferno difficulties have different spawns, which freshens things up a bit.
- Graphics and overall atmosphere are very nice.
- Unlike RE2 remake, characters no longer use plastic knives. :P

Cons
- The game is too short. Supposedly, they cut a lot of contents from classic RE3 (I never played classic RE3). Even with the shop items varying things a bit, the player is still restricted to the same short campaign. This is a shame because the game is so good.
- Nemesis is disappointing compared to the Tyrant in RE2 remake. There are only a few parts where the Nemesis chases the player and all of these are short scripted events. By comparison, RE2's Tyrant dynamically chases the player throughout many parts of the game. Nemesis was supposed to be the big thing for RE3, so it's a big shame to see it reduced to this.
- Not having checkpoints for boss fights makes it frustrating to learn to fight a boss in harder difficulties as you need to constantly run back to the boss and skip cutscenes.
- Needs a random mode that randomizes the location of items and enemies. Once the player has the game memorized, the game loses its scare factor.",1669878566,1671948447,True,6,5,0.604512572288513184,0,True,False,False
