The truth is Bethesda has always sucked at making games, but they sucked less that their competition, and they also were always ambitious in scope, so their games looked like ground breaking at the time when they were just the same McD combo but in a much larger size.

Now there are studios that are much better at making the kind of games they are known for (some of them were once subcontractors of theirs). And it doesn't seem fair but it's not really possible not to judge Bethesda's old content without current day realization that they have always been bad at so many things that we once shrugged off.

Morrowind's writing is atrocious. The many problems this game's story has is a foreshadowing of all the bad writing that Bethesda put us through in later games, which eventually culminated in the absolute garbage that is Starfield. It seems the financial success made the people involved just get bolder and bolder in their twisted sense of storytelling.

It's such a waste too, the original concept for the story has so much promise (prisoner conscripted to become a spy for the empire because they match the conditions for some obscure local prophecy, prophecy turns out to be real), but it just becomes a nauseating sequence of poorly written ""fetch this"" / ""kill that"" quests that never manage to drive the narrative tension anywhere, and resolves in the most boringly dull manner possible.

There's no need to go in depth about poorly balanced gameplay mechanics, it's just a staple of Bethesda's games that they need no introduction. You either have a really hard time or you just breeze through using stuff that feel like you are cheating. It's also very likely that you'll reach the endgame having totally broken the game, removing all challenge from it, as it's customary with Bethesda's games. You know... ""it just works"".

Honestly, the gameplay abusing meta-game is more fun than the actual game, as in it's actually more fun finding creative ways to break the game than actually playing the game.

O fato de que esse jogo é de 2002, é entristecedor levando em conta a última afirmação, porque fazem mais de 21 anos que essa franquia não vê um jogo que pode equiparar-se com o terceiro, no quesito de importância e de responsabilidade com a história desse universo.

Eu digo importância, mas em todos os jogos, salvo alguns spin-offs, os eventos da história principal sempre são catastróficos, cataclismas que caem sobre os ombros do jogador, um prisioneiro sem nome, sem raça, sem rosto e sem relevância antes da história que se passa o jogo.

O jogador é como dito anteriormente, um zé ninguém, requisitados pelo próprio imperador Uriel para chegar até Seyda Neen, e receber um pacote para entregá-lo a um homem chamado Caius Cosades, na cidade de Balmora. A partir desse ponto, o jogador pode começar uma exploração sem fim, que pode culminar em dezenas de níveis e experiência em habilidades diversas. Pessoalmente, eu sigo uma regra pra jogos do gênero RPG de mundo aberto: Explorar um local novo, começar todas as sidequests, terminá-las, e avançar para a próxima área. 
Isso me mantém mais dedicado a observar cada parte de cada área do jogo, principalmente porque Morrowind é daqueles jogos que não seguram sua mão pra te dizer o que você tem que fazer, você tem um diário que resume o que um NPC disse sobre uma quest, e é isso. Sem bússola, sem um mini-mapa, sem um mapa muito detalhado (usando o OpenMW dá pra dar um zoom, que é uma ajuda legal, mas não é muita coisa). Tudo o que você tem pra te guiar é sua astúcia, e direções que os NPCS te dão que muitas vezes são vagas, e portanto, você vai com certeza passar uns bons minutos tentando achar uma porta no meio de um terreno baldio recheado de árvores secas, cinzas vulcânicas, e muito, muito, muito cliff racer.

Falando em Cliff Racer, um aspecto de design desse jogo é interessante. Você é um forasteiro, outlander, você não nasceu em Vvardenfell, ou Morrowind, e as pessoas sabem disso, e mesmo que você seja um dunmer assim como 90% da população dessa ilha, você ainda vai ser discriminado e esnobado. Das criaturas, com a exceção algumas, talvez menos que cinco, toda a fauna de Vvardenfell odeia você, sua aparência, e sua existência, e as criaturas malditas vão te perseguir até o inferno pra tentar expurgar você desse plano de existência, se brincar mesmo quando você morrer e aparecer em algum plano de Oblivion eles ainda vão querer te caçar.
Deu pra perceber que uma parte significativa desse jogo te odeia, só por você ser, e olha que eu nem falei dos Telvanni. E com esse contexto em mente, o aspecto que falei ser interessante é a respeito do vilão principal, Dagoth Ur. Quase tudo nesse jogo te odeia, menos o vilão. De todas as pessoas que poderiam te oferecer amizade, ou palavras gentis, quem faz isso é justamente aquele que você eventualmente vai enfrentar, e derrotar. Quando eu reparei nisso eu me senti muito mais ligado à atmosfera, à história que esse jogo queria contar.

E falando em história, que lore sensacional é a dos Dwemer. Todo o contexto dessa civilização, sua arquitetura, seus ideais, suas roupas, e criações, as grandes cidades subterrâneas, tudo é muito interessante, e culmina infinitamente em Kagrenac e seus artesãos, criando um deus, de metal e vapor. Boa parte dessas informações são reveladas a partir de uma quest que inicialmente você pode pensar ser apenas uma zoeira, mas lembrando de Edwinna da Guilda dos Magos de Ald-Ruhn, você decide levar um livro dwemer pensando se ela pode dizer algo sobre, e é a partir desse momento que você consegue ter pequenos vislumbres por meio dos diálogos dela e de outros NPCs de contos da força dos dwemer, e eventualmente, você acumula conhecimento por meio do que esses personagens dizem sobre livros como The Egg of Time, ou Divine Metaphysics.

Sobre a campanha, não são tantas quests, e nem tão interessantes, mas o Caius é daora. Até o ponto que você enfrenta um dos seguidores de Dagoth Ur, que te contamina com Corprus no último suspiro, te levando a conhecer Tel Fyr e o mago de quatro mil anos de idade, Divayth Fyr. No Corprusarium abaixo de sua torre, você se encontra com um dos seres mais importantes pra lore de Elder Scrolls. [spoiler]O último Dwemer vivo, Yagrum Bagarn[/spoiler]. Inclusive, na quest pra descobrir a resposta pro desaparecimento dos dwemer, você pode mostrar essa questão e os livros pra ele, e ele dirá o que sabe, que não é muito, mas ainda é entusiasmante ouvir o que ele tem a dizer. A partir dessa quest, a campanha fica bem mais interessante, por você finalmente começar a cumprir com as profecias do Nerevarine, Hortator Das Grandes Casas, Aquele Que Uniu As Tribos, portador da Lua-e-Estrela, o Encarnado. 
E por fim, temos a Montanha Vermelha, o lugar onde tudo vai terminar. A Ghostfence foi construída pelos Buyoant Armigers e Ordinators pra evitar que a tempestade de pragas, doenças e Corprus assolasse toda a ilha de Resdayn. E é por ela que você precisa passar pra visitar cada cidadela dos Dwemer que circunda a torre de fogo e encontrar os instrumentos de Kagrenac, [spoiler]Sunder[/spoiler] e [spoiler]Keening[/spoiler]. Das cidadelas a mais interessante pra mim com certeza foi [spoiler]a biblioteca de Kagrenac[/spoiler].  

Agora, não é como se esse jogo fosse perfeito (é sim), ele obviamente tem defeitos. Muitos deles porque é um jogo bem datado, de 21 anos atrás. A maioria desses defeitos é remediável por meio de mods, coisas como o MGE XE, o Code Patch, OpenMW, entre outros mods que dão uma nova vida pro jogo, deixando ele num padrão gráfico mais aceitável, principalmente quando o render distance é aumentado e aquela névoa que te impede de ver a mais de 30 metros de distância desaparece.
As mecânicas de gameplay também fazem o jogo ser muito intimidante e nenhum pouco beginner friendly, o fato do jogador precisar se atentar a mais de três valores diferentes pra saber se seu ataque vai acertar um alvo que está a menos de 30 centímetros de distância é frustrante pra quem não tem muita paciência ou vontade de aprender a jogar o jogo.
Eu poderia fazer um comentário elitista dizendo que adolescente que só joga cod, lol ou roblox, e nunca encostou num jogo que saiu antes de 2015 nunca conseguiria jogar Morrowind, o que é possivelmente verdade, mas eu estaria mentindo se eu dissesse que a mecânica de combate é agradável, principalmente quando você tem que lutar contra cliff racers a cada 2 minutos [spoiler](Ave São Jiub)[/spoiler]. Mas, longe de mim dizer que isso torna Morrowind injogável. É tipo café, com o tempo você acostuma a tomar.

OpenMW is *THE* modern way to play Morrowind, but does not clock time on Steam so my actual time played is much higher than 92 minutes.

This game is 20 years old. 20. I have trouble playing even some newer games. I could never get into games like Halo: Reach, or Resident Evil 4. I had no issue playing Morrowind non-stop for a 4-5 days, and playing it for multiple hours the following days. 

Morrowind is undoubtedly the best Elder Scrolls, and if I may, one of; if not the best WRPGs of it's kind (I say WRPG because I think that OMORI is better, but OMORI is a JRPG, that is to say, nothing alike Morrowind).

I am not going to write an extensive review, because I think there are people who have done much better jobs than me at explaining every little feature and quest, but I can say this: If you like Tabletop RPGs or CRPGs, and you are okay with reading and outdated graphics, I think you will like Morrowind, and even if you don't like those things, I recommend you give Morrowind a shot anyway.

I did a lot of research on mods, as I wanted to play through the original game, but with improved graphics and some of the rough edges smoothed off.  After much fiddling, I finally settled on a mod list that I was happy with and embarked on another 100+ hours adventure!

Morrowind is a strange, unearthly place, with bizarre landscapes and architecture.  It's very different to Oblivion, which is very much cast in the medieval fantasy RPG mold.  As this is a game from 2002, beware that it does not hold your hand.  For example, there are no quest markers, so you need to pay attention to directions given by the quest giver!  The combat is also somewhat clunky, although there are mods for improving that and making it more similar to Oblivion and Skyrim.  Same story for the UI.

Once you have your mods sorted out you can immerse yourself in the world and enjoy a really good story, with an interesting main quest and many, many side quests to distract you.

I believe there is only so far back someone is willing to play and I think this is a solid tar pit for me.
While some features are charming like using a lockpick to stab someone or the dark elf voice, there is so much that this older game lacks compared to the future games that I have been spoiled with.

But there is a certain charm to this game that makes you wanna try and go back from time to time. You keep going back and making new characters, constantly restarting and you slowly start to feel like that you're going insane (and rightfully so). But if you truly have the determination and motivation to keep going, you'll see a pattern. In Morrowind the landscape is very mountainous and the way your character moves, it's extremely hard sometimes to get to where you need to go, or the journey's to get from point A to point B can take literally hours, which is fine because after all this is an adventure game, but if you're trying to just get a quest done at the end of the day, As the old saying goes: if you can't go over it, go around it, and that leads to my point that with this game and many other games, whether if they are new or modern, there is always an easier way, always, and no, I'm not talking about cheating either. In total I have spent hundreds of hours grinding on this game, but in all those hours, it took me and the person I also play with that there are much easier ways then just simply following what the game wants. Exploits aren't cheating, because if anything, you know the rules better than anyone if you don't break the rules but make yourself completely OP with not too much effort. So, whoever is out there and is in the same boat I just was, just know that you must go around that big, ugly, red mountain.

Cities/towns are copy paste of similar buildings that are kind of boring, combat mechanics will feel weird to newcomers and a lot of quests are not really interesting. I like the UI as opposed to the console oriented modern UIs but a lot of people disagree with me on this.

The world and the main story are alright and like most Bethesda games there's a lot of lore and stuff to discover and enjoy. The land of Morrowind is breathtaking, it does not feel like the ""standard European fantasy setting"" which still stands out from other entries in the Elder Scroll series.

When I was younger I loved keeping a notebook and pen with me, taking notes, writing down directions to the cave I have to find to retrieve the random artifact, names of people and how they relate to each other, how I can take advantage of all this information. I don't know If I can dedicate myself at this level to a game released in 2024. These things no longer charm me, but when it comes to Morrowind I still enjoy it.

The third part, Morrowind, is a pleasant transition from the previous two parts, featuring more modern graphics and the ability to switch to a third-person perspective. For the first time, the game introduces the concept of ""Offline/online-RPG."" This means that the game offers a vast number of quests and the freedom to explore a meticulously modeled 3D world, departing from the randomly generated worlds of TESI and II. Morrowind is also easily moddable, extending the playtime of the game.

[h2] Story [/h2]

The story revolves around a prisoner (typical for this game series) from The Imperial City, deported to the Vvardenfell Island in Morrowind. This area may be familiar from Skyrim, where it is mentioned in connection with the eruption of the Red Mountain volcano. Granting mercy, Uriel Septim VII orders the player to join the Blades, where tasks are assigned by the Blade's commander, Caius Cosades. As the story unfolds, the player discovers that their arrival aligns with the prophecies of the native people about the reincarnation of the warrior and warlord Nerevar. After completing several trials, the player is recognized as Nerevar by the Daedric Princess Azura herself. The main goal becomes defeating the demigod Dagoth Ur and his cult.

[h2] Ratings [/h2]

Coming directly from the second part, I was relatively excited about the graphical improvement. The game, despite its age, still looks good, with engaging gameplay and a well-thought-out story. I am more than convinced that it is worth playing even today. So, I can recommend it to everyone with a clear conscience.

[h1] Recenze TESIII: Morrowind [/h1]

Třetí díl, Morrowind, je příjemný přechod z předchozích dvou dílů, kde je už modernější grafika, lze se přepnout do pohledu třetí osoby. Poprvé se zde vyskytuje koncept hry ""Offline/online-RPG"". 
To znamená, že hra obsahuje obrovské množství questů a možnost se volně pohybovat ve vymodelovaném 3D světě, takže zde se svět již náhodně negeneruje, jak tomu bylo v TESI a II. Morrowind šel i příjemně módovat, což také prodlouží dobu hraní této hry.

[h2] Příběh [/h2]

Příběh je o vězni (Jak typické pro tuto herní sérii) z The Imperial City, který je deportován na Ostrov Vvardenfell v Morrowindu. Tuto oblast můžete znát ze Skyrimu, kde se zmiňuje v souvislosti s výbuchem sopky Rudé hory. Zde mu milost udělí Samotný Uriel Septim VII, Hráč pak dostane rozkazy připojit se k Čepelím, kde mu úkoly zadává velitel Čepelí Caius Cosad. Postupem příběhu hráč zjistí, že jeho příchod zapadá do proroctví původních obyvatel o znovuzrození bojovníka a vojevůdce Nerevara. Po splnění několika zkoušek bude uznán za Nerevara i samotnou Deadrickou Princeznou Azurou. Jeho hlavním cílem bude zabít poloboha Dagoth Ura a jeho kult.

[h2] Hodnocení [/h2]

Jelikož jsem přešel rovnou z druhého dílu, byl jsem relativně nadšen ze grafického skoku. Ta hra na svůj věk vypadá stále dobře i včetně její hratelnosti a promyšleného příběhu. A jsem více než přesvědčen, že stojí za to si zahrát i dnes. Takže ji všem mohu doporučit s čistým svědomím.

It is steeped in alien culture, loaded with witty, flavorful dialogue and prose, and brought to life with a rich aural banquet; from it's atmospheric musical masterpieces to it's expertly expressed voice acting and engrossing sound effects. I have no doubt that the lens of nostalgia alters my view of this games many features and flaws, but I feel that the traits mentioned prior would likely be as true today as a novel experience as it was when it was first released so many years ago. 

All in all, an impactful confluence of passion, obsession, effort, and creativity.",1706723013,1707244572,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Grand in scope and scale, no other game since has managed to match the epic odyssey that is ""Morrowind"". Hundreds of quests, a huge game world, amazing amount of lore, creatures, and secrets. Although the graphics are dated, this game manages to beat modern games in almost every other aspect. The UI is fully customizable, allowing you to move the various windows, scale them to different sizes, pin them to your game screen, etc. The sounds (both ambient and music) are very excellent and both do a great job of helping to immerse you into the truly alien world of Morrowind. 

This game has features such as spellcrafting and alchemy that let you create and modify spells and potions, which I find to be awesome in that you can ""break"" the game by creating certain overpowered spells and/or potions that make you superhuman. But, hey, if that's your playstyle then go for it!

While the game contains ""some"" voice acting, the majority of the game, in terms of talking to NPCs, is text. You must read what they say and click on highlighted words in their speech to learn more about that subject. Some people, mostly modern games, wouldn't touch a game with hardly any voice acting. But, I feel that reading the text adds a bit more immersion and, too, allows you to proceed much faster since you don't have to wait for NPCs to finish talking when you can just quickly read what they're saying and move on. Having to listen to a long monologue is torture. Reading through it quickly is painless.

You can play almost any type of character you can think of in Morrowind. There are some default classes that you can choose from, but you can also create your own custom class and level up whatever skills you'd like. 

Bottom line: If you enjoy adventure games that don't hold your hand and can look past the dated graphics, you will find that Morrowind will spoil you for any other adventure games. Have fun, outlander!",1706188290,1706188290,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I don't play with mods though if I could I would. The vanilla version is great in every way!

Graphics are of course not nearly as good as today's but I think that's part of what makes this game so special. I prefer the graphics this way as it makes the game unique in it's own way.

Morrowind comes with better worldbuilding, character/culture/faction depths. Modded or unmodded, it has these core strengths compared to later games. Where the game/the world/npcs is stuck, at a surface level only. Most of the time at least.

Dose it has it own, problems? Ofc, its very old by now. My first rpg ever, was Skyrim hehe. Then Oblivion and later I tried Morrowind & Daggerfall unity.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

If you're like me, and played skyrim and oblivion and loved both, I can tell you for sure this game is totally different. Completely different game mechanics that I think are inferior to both oblivion and skyrim.

If your looking for a game with different game mechanics and play style but still like want all the elder scrolls lore included, then morrowind is the game for you, maybe...

The visuals, graphics and character designs are visibly dated, but what mainly makes this final Elder Scrolls-entry so compelling are its sound design, it's storytelling, its world-building and its timeless art-direction; all four of which make for an incredibly immersive atmosphere that draws you in and won't let you go. And while I still feel that relegating the entire game to two Islands apart from the massive Morrowind mainland (Vvardenfel and Solstheim) was a massive mistake on Bethesda's part, I also get that the company was teetering dangerously close to bankruptcy back then, and only had a small team to develop it.

And one more thing: the villain. Morrowind does a terrific job of embracing the concept of 'tell; don't show' with its main antagonist, and making it work. As you progress through the main story, the game passively builds up Dagoth Ur as a devil. The ''Sharmat'' (as ES lore goes). The embodiment of all that is evil and profane to the Dunmer people. But the closer the time comes to confront him, the more you come to realize that there is something very 'off' about the Tribunal; that they're not telling you everything. And this ultimately leads to an expertly-crafted plot twist.

But now, we get into the meat of the matter: 'why' I call this the final entry in the series, and it's for a very simple, overall reason:

Morrowind is the last Elder Scrolls game that remains true to the lore and spirit of its predecessors. While it 'did' make some questionable decisions (removal of fast travel and player mounts, and the ham-fisted removal of over half of the useful skills in Daggerfall), it at least didn't 'break' anything that had been previously established.

Oblivion and Skyrim, on the other hand, are not worthy of being called Elder Scrolls games, and I'll prove it below:

Oblivion warped the previously-established concept of the Dragonborn Emperors for the sake of suiting its Lord Of The Rings knockoff narrative. It removed the most interesting and compelling concepts and lore-established aspects of the land of Cyrodil (endless jungles and traditional Southeast-Asian/Roman-Mediterranean overall culture, dress and architecture) for the sake of making it look more medieval European, and therefore making it more 'safe' to market to western audiences. Not to mention the inexplicable absence of about 90% of the interesting lesser Daedric princes (though Morrowind shares some guilt in this as well), and the weird, amalgamated bastardization of the previously loosely-connected Temples of the various Divines into a single religious order that flies in the face of what had been portrayed in Daggerfall. And don't get me started about the complete lack of Knightly orders and the baffling removal of 'spears', medium armor, and all throwing weapons. All in all, Oblivion 'is' a decent RPG, but an unworthy successor to Daggerfall and Morrowind.

Skyrim... broke everything else. With the exception of leveled enemies, It took what all Oblivion did wrong, and multiplied it times ten. Don't get me wrong: I got a lot of enjoyment out of the mindlessly-wandering experience that is Skyrim, but at the end of the day I wouldn't be a true fan if I didn't roast this turd to Oblivion and back. 99% of the Skyrim-based vampire clans spoken of in previously established lore are simply non-existent, and not even mentioned in-game. The ruins of ancient Falmer (snow elf) architecture said to dot Skyrim's landscape are nowhere to be found, and none of the unique ancient Falmer weapons and armor exist, save for a light armor set that breaks lore, as the snow elves of old are said to have worn 'heavy' armor and wielded spears. Speaking of which: spears are 'still' absent, and so are throwing weapons. The aloof relationship between the mortal races and Dragons has been utterly bastardized for the sake of giving emphasis to the sudden shift in direction from 'slow character buildup to effective godhood', to 'Grade-school-esque power fantasy tripe from the get-go.'. 'None' of the minor Daedric princes are present, and now only a tiny, tiny handful of the Divines even have Temples dedicated to them. And whereas not being able to join the Imperial Legion in Oblivion was, frankly, a stupid decision on Bethesda's part, the way Skyrim handles 'joining' the Legion feels almost insulting, as you are not treated as a soldier by a disciplined commander like you were in Morrowind's IL faction arc: you are treated like a mercenary by a seemingly uninterested half-wit who doesn't care how you dress or how you talk to him (not that you have any real or meaningful dialogue choices in Skyrim). To top it off: the main quest is utterly forgettable, and the supposed main antagonist is just a bog-standard, stereotypical 'evil' black dragon... that we've all seen a million times since fantasy first became widespread in the 1980's. As such; Skyrim cannot and 'should' not be called an Elder Scrolls game... because it isn't, and couldn't ever possibly be, by virtue of its own design as a shallow, vapid, lore-bastardizing mockery of the series' founding. 

Case and point: Morrowind is not subjectively but 'objectively' the last game in the series.",1688377026,1704760411,True,3,0,0.331572741270065308,0,True,False,False

Never have I seen a game with this unparalleled level of immersion, where it's so incredibly easy to completely lose yourself in its world, which is accomplished due to a mixture of a sublime sense of progression and pacing, rewarding exploration, inventive lore, a great soundtrack, absorbing mechanics that make you pay attention to dialogue and use your wits to traverse the map and complete your objectives instead of mindlessly following a quest marker, and beautifully creative alien landscapes and architecture that give the game a unique identity and atmosphere.

The game has a fascinatingly weird world, and it does a superb job of fleshing out the lore, politics, conflicts, and culture of the Dunmer people. It is by far the best game in the series in terms of worldbuilding, and it has the best main questline in any TES game. Everything about its universe is very experimental, surreal, and ""out-there"", and it's a shame that Bethesda abandoned this philosophy in later titles, since this is one of the best things about the game, and all of it really helps to immerse the player in the amazingly interesting and strange place that is Morrowind.

The game can be quite unforgiving and doesn't do a lot of hand-holding, but that's part of what makes it so special. Its mechanics have a lot of depth to them, and allow for a lot of experimentation and player freedom (I think [url=https://youtu.be/27iaPhD6Nt0][u]this video[/u][/url] does a great job of exemplifying this). I absolutely love the RPG elements, which I think are the perfect balance between complexity/depth and not being too unwieldy like Daggerfall when it comes to the stats, skills, attributes and so on, alongside the layered clothing system, which all make building and progressing your character one of the most engaging things about the game. I also love the amazing systems in place with almost infinite possibilities like Enchanting and Spellmaking, as overpowered as those can be.

Now, despite all the great things about it, it's far from perfect. The game hasn't aged well, both graphically and gameplay wise. If you're coming from Skyrim or Oblivion, it's almost certain you're gonna have a hard time learning the game's ropes, especially the archaic combat system. The leveling system can be quite tedious and grindy if you're looking to min/max and build your character in the most optimal way. The game is REALLY unbalanced and some aspects of it can be really frustrating while others are far too easy, since there are many exploits that the player can abuse to break the game. Also, even though the soundtrack is one of the game's strongest aspects, it can sometimes be fairly repetitive due to a relatively small quantity of tracks.

Most NPCs in the game are fairly generic due to copy-pasted lines, and basically just serve as lore vending machines. The wiki-style dialogue system makes it nearly impossible to role-play your character through dialogue choices in the same way that you would in other RPGs, so you shouldn't go in looking for that experience. You play a game like Morrowind to feel completely immersed in it's rich fantasy world, learning about its history, exploring and adventuring, joining different guilds, building your character, experimenting with the mechanics, becoming more and more powerful, etc. Just like any of the other TES games, you shouldn't really go in looking for a story with lots of different moral choices and branching paths, since that's just not the point of the game.

Let me also just take a moment to give potential new players two important tips to avoid frustration. First, make sure to only use weapons that your character specializes in, in other words, don't try to use the crappy Iron Dagger that you get at the start if you didn't pick Short Blade as a skill when creating your character. Instead, do some quests in Seyda Neen to get some gold since they usually don't involve any combat, talk to Caius Cosades in Balmora to get some more starter money, and then use that cash to buy some decent gear that your character can actually use. Second, you need to keep in mind that, unlike Skyrim, Fatigue is an important mechanic in this game. If your Fatigue is low when you enter combat, your character is much more likely to miss their attacks, and running and jumping everywhere will quickly deplete it. So, try to carry some Restore Fatigue potions with you, and if you see an enemy ahead try to either start walking slowly to regenerate a bit, or just rest for an hour in-game, which will completely refill your bar.

I would also definitely recommend installing [url=https://openmw.org/][u]OpenMW[/u][/url] and following [url=https://modding-openmw.com/lists/i-heart-vanilla/][u]this guide[/u][/url] to enjoy an enhanced, stable, and mostly bug-free version of the vanilla game on modern systems.

With all of that said, Morrowind is a masterpiece, albeit a very flawed one. If you persevere through all of its problems, what awaits you is one of the most incredibly engrossing and rewarding experiences you will ever have in an RPG.

I played this back when it came out (2002) and the janky graphics we see now were actually quite laudable then. I preface this because visuals are very important to getting invested in a world and MAN was I invested in the land of Vvardinfell. The first time I went through the game it was hours and hours and [i]hours[/i] before I did anything of note. Simply walking about the towns with NPCs and the 3D rendered open world, at the time a much more novel concept, gripped me like no game had. The sky at night, with its double moons; the rain falling near the swamps full with little noises; the ash storms rushing across the wasteland near Ald Ruhn all made the world feel realized, like i was fully there.

Morrowind has so many pieces that get you to believe in its world, alien as it is. Libraries of books and poems; stories of oral and real history give this place depth. Politics both grandscale between empires, and small and local among houses or indivdiual city-dwellers make this place seem true. The guilds and their advancement, or your ability to buy property and increase its value, or even your own increase in power just from [i]doing[/i] gives the player a sense that they, themselves are increasing in scope and ability. Its hard to describe just how this game makes one feel involved in its place and people.  

There is just so much meat to chew on here. Immersive quests that the player must figure out, rather than hand-fed via markers or illuminated paths. Dialogue and investigations into minutiae, world building, or complete triviality for the sake of coloring in edges or people; making the world seem whole.  A narrative with characters having a sense of agency and motives and depth. 

However, in 2024 you won't get the same feeling from Morrowind I did.  Its combat is borderline unusable when you start, and outright broken by the end. The menus and inventory system and sorting are tedious, as is the process of persuasion and general conversation.  There is little voice acting and what there is you will hear often. Its just so....dated.  I don't think even were I to go back I'd find it as powerful.

So here it is then; Morrowind is a flawed gem. A masterpiece from a bygone age. It can shock you, mesmerize you, give you an experience you cant find anywhere else, but only if you let it and can freely look past its myriad issues. One should try this game, but I understand if they immediately bounce off.  For those that stay they will be rewarded.",1704228049,1704228269,True,41,1,0.783354341983795166,0,True,False,False

I have very mixed feelings towards Morrowind. It's generally one of those games where you're either going to fall in love with it or you're going to hate every minute, but I kind of fell in the middle.

On one hand, Morrowind has one of the most unique and interesting settings in video game history, paired with some of the best writing and storytelling to come out of Bethesda. The world design is amazing and still holds up today. Morrowinds magic system is one of the all time greats, and you can break the game in so many fun ways. There is also still a very active mod community that has created some really impressive projects, most notably OpenMW (a complete engine rewrite) and Tamriel Rebuilt (a mod that adds most of mainland Morrowind to the game).

On the other hand, Morrowind has some real questionable design choices that feel weird even for RPG veterans, and would make it VERY hard for someone coming in from Oblivion/Skyrim/ESO. It feels archaic and clunky even compared to RPGs that released around it. Morrowind comes from a time when Bethesda were still refining the TES formula. Instead of being a vast, procedurally generated dungeon crawler like Daggerfall, they opted to make it a more focused, simplified and story based experience, and that's part of why it's so rough around the edges.

The vast majority of Morrowinds quests are very simple fetch quests or escort quests, and Morrowinds dungeons on average are much smaller and simpler than what you'd find in any other TES title. There is no natural mana regen. The fatigue system is terrible and poorly explained. The combat is based on dice rolls despite handling like an action RPG, and unlike other dice based games that released around the time (NWN) there is no animations or logs to show that your attack missed.  

There is no sprint, and your base movement speed is ridiculously slow given the sheer size and scale of the world, and ""running"" drains fatigue so you don't want to be doing it too often. There are no quest markers, which usually isn't a problem as most old school RPGs don't have them, but there are a handful of quests where the game doesn't give you sufficient information to find the objective (see: Dwemer Puzzle Cube) or they don't let you ask local NPCs where the guy you're supposed to talk to is, or where a nearby place is located. 

Nowadays there are mods that can fix a lot of Morrowinds design issues (shoutout to Fair Magicka Regen and Alex's Running Without Fatigue) but it's still worth bringing up. 

Overall, Morrowind is a gem that is worth playing if you're a fan of old school RPGs or the TES series in general. It can be a bit hard to get into due to it's design choices that are very uncommon and strange even by old school RPG standards, but if you can stick with it you will be rewarded. The games lore and world are so interesting and very easy to be immersed into despite the dated graphics, and the magic system and gameplay will make you feel more powerful than you have ever felt before in a TES game once you get a few levels in.

If you're coming in from Skyrim or Oblivion and are having trouble sticking with it, then make note of all the things you don't like about Morrowind, and see if there are any mods that can fix it (there probably is). Ignore all the purist gatekeeping and do whatever you need to do to stick with the game. It will be worth it.

But surprisingly, this game functions perfectly fine on every other platform I've played it on. Original Xbox, and even the unofficial android port run fine with no crashes and give you the complete experience, letting you experience this wonderful game in all it's glory. However I cannot recommend buying this game on steam, as despite being the way most people play Morrowind, Bethesda has neglected their PC audience for the last 20 years leaving this game in an unplayable state. 

If you want to enjoy morrowind without all the bugs and crashes, I suggest trying either OpenMW, an unofficial source port of the game that provides additional engine features and keeps most of the base game intact (the original water shader is gone though, a damn shame) or the official Xbox port which you can play using backwards compatibility mode on any xbox console. The xbox port is probably the best if you want the ""pure"" TES 3 experience but if you don't own an Xbox and don't want to bother emulating then OpenMW is the main way to get the game functioning on PC.

A veritable tapestry of intricate design and audacious ambition, this seminal entry into the annals of gaming history is not to be trifled with lightly. A magnum opus, it stands as a testament to the industry's capacity for transcendent creativity, yet, dear reader, I must humbly submit that despite its undeniable merits, it falls short in the shadow of its predecessor, the magisterial ""Daggerfall.""

Morrowind, with its sprawling landscapes and labyrinthine lore, beckons the intrepid adventurer into a world teeming with mystique. The vibrant tapestry of the island of Vvardenfell unfolds before the player like an ancient manuscript, laden with intrigue and beguilement. The labyrinthine narrative, woven with the threads of prophecies and arcane mysteries, is an opulent banquet for the intellectual palate, albeit one tinged with the pangs of inconsistency and convolution.

However, let us not overlook the insurmountable shadow cast by the colossus that is Daggerfall. A sprawling continent, a vast expanse of provinces, Daggerfall is the epitome of a grandiose vision brought to fruition. The sheer scale of its ambition dwarfs Morrowind's confined island setting, rendering the latter's attempt at world-building akin to a mere sonnet in the grand symphony of Daggerfall's epic saga.

Furthermore, one cannot escape the palpable sense of nostalgia that permeates Daggerfall's every pixel. A pioneer in the realm of open-world exploration, Daggerfall's labyrinthine dungeons and procedurally generated landscapes remain unparalleled, underscoring Morrowind's regrettable inability to ascend to the same celestial heights.

In matters of depth and complexity, Morrowind may be praised for its intricate web of political machinations and rich tapestry of cultures, but, dear reader, let us not lose sight of Daggerfall's sheer audacity in granting players an empire to traverse. Morrowind's bespoke intricacies may seduce the discerning intellect, but Daggerfall's audacious sprawl remains unmatched.

In conclusion, as one contemplates the multifaceted brilliance of Morrowind, one cannot help but discern the looming specter of Daggerfall, an awe-inspiring testament to Bethesda's unbridled ambition. Morrowind, though a masterpiece in its own right, merely grazes the surface of the immersive odyssey that is Daggerfall, casting a perpetual shadow upon its magisterial predecessor. Thus, while Morrowind may sparkle as a gem of its time, it behooves us to acknowledge the superior grandeur of Daggerfall, an exemplar that transcends the mere confines of gaming antiquity.",1703704979,1703704979,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Visit the spellmaker and make it so. Want to sell your goods to an alcoholic merchant living on a deserted island? There's a crab for that.

This is also a really well-written game. The voice acting is pretty limited, but the amount of actual, juicy, coda makes this a really satisfying lore dive, if that's your wheelhouse.

Yes, the gameplay is pretty dated. It's clunky, and buggy in classic Bethesda fashion. Moreover, nearly everything you attempt to do requires a dice roll to succeed. Swinging your sword, casting spells, enchanting, arrows hitting their marks; these are all taken for granted in later titles. Here in Morrowind though, there's always a thin veneer of rng between you and lethal comedy. 

Also, the movement speed kind of sucks at first (though there are ways around this). If you can get past that, Vvardenfell is your oyster. You're presented with an incredible repertoire of magic and skills to get over obstacles and create mischief.

The world is handcrafted, and there's plenty to explore. Prepare to be surprised by environmental storytelling and excellent loot as you plumb the depths of this tightly designed, yet profoundly unbalanced role playing adventure.

Also, the speedrunning community is also hilarious. Since all items are always in the same place every new playthrough, you can get amazingly overpowered quickly and early, and can punch the endgame boss in the face at level 1 if you really wanted to. Lots of options here. Lots of love from the devs. It's a joy to play, even if its age is painfully obvious.

This was the Elder Scrolls that I played in my teen years. It's not for everyone. This game is a lot more complex than Skyrim, and it is very unforgiving to players who don't learn how it works. Having said that, it is an amazing game and a prime example of the fact that they just don't make things like they used to. If you are having trouble with combat, try this: 1. Start a new character. 2. Build this character with your entire playstyle in mind. Don't major or even MINOR in skills that you won't be using all the time, especially ones you use from the get go. Don't specialize in more than one weapon and armor skill, and only use that type throughout the game. Make sure your Agility, Luck, Strength, and Endurance are at decent levels at the start. Don't pick a birthsign that just gives you a spell. You can get any and all spells during gameplay. Pick a sign like the Lady or the Mage, which gives you a stat bonus with no drawbacks. 3. Don't waste your fatigue running everywhere. This is a slow paced RPG, and you should be walking most of the time. If you find yourself in combat with low fatigue, you most likely will end up the losing party. Fatigue affects many many things, including your chance to hit, chance to successfully cast a spell, and even your chance to craft potions or persuade people. Only run when absolutely necessary.  4. Don't sleep on enchantments. They can be immeasurably powerful assets in your arsenal if you use them right. For example, a 1 pt slowfall enchantment on a piece of gear set as a constant effect, will completely negate all fall damage. If you use dispel magic while wearing the Boots of Blinding Speed, you essentially get the massive speed bonus without being blinded. Constant effects are basically godmode. 1 pt Levitate may be slow, but it's infinite. Meaning you can basically get around the entire map without coming into contact with most enemies. Find yourself running out of health too quickly in combat? Enchant your weapon with ""Restore Health on Self"" and set it to cast when the weapon strikes. This may not be as good as Absorb Health, but it is easily accessible early on, and can be a total game changer against more powerful enemies. There are so many tricks and such to make this game a breeze, and while many of them are basically broken, most of them are relatively balanced and super super fun to use! Morrowind may have its flaws, but it has so much going for it that they for some reason decided to gradually phase out of the Elder Scrolls games, starting with Oblivion, and continuing in Skyrim. You can craft spells in Oblivion, but Morrowind has twice as many effects to use. Skyrim completely did away with spellmaking. In Morrowind, you can use a mortar and pestle to craft potions, instead of trying to find a stupid alchemy table. I find the skills system in Morrowind to be far superior to any other RPG, let alone Skyrim. And it doesn't hold your hand and always magically point the way for your quests, meaning you are looking around the world for things instead of staring at a compass the entire time. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, and I urge you to not look at it with Skyrim colored glasses. This game is an absolute gem and the main reason why the Elder Scrolls has had so much success. If it weren't for Morrowind, Skyrim would have never existed. Morrowind goes back to what is in my opinion the glory days of Bethesda, and will never not bring a smile to my face when I hear that in-game music.",1703445902,1703445902,True,122,1,0.863416433334350586,3,True,False,False

Morrowind's world is expansive and immersive, but it feels like a missed opportunity to create a truly inclusive and representative fantasy realm. The character designs and racial options are limited, with a lack of diverse ethnicities and body types. In a gaming landscape that's increasingly valuing diversity, Morrowind's stagnant approach is out of touch.

The game's narrative, while epic, could have been greatly enriched by incorporating a broader range of perspectives and backgrounds. The lack of diverse characters and cultures within the game's universe is a letdown, making it difficult for players from various walks of life to fully connect with the story.

In an era where players are seeking meaningful and diverse experiences, Morrowind falls short. The character creation options feel outdated, and the lack of representation can make the game feel exclusionary to many players.

Abandon hope, player. It's not worth your time. It might be if the game didn't do this to me, but I'm to the point where I want a refund and I'm never going to be able to touch this game again. It just hurts too much.

EDIT: I did eventually find a way to make it work and finish to the end. Can't remember how, but i know it created other issues along the way - like how i had to reset the controls every time i started. I fixed that now, and i do remember how i did it, but now the music is glitching out. I have a fix for that too now, but its a pain in the butt and i forget to do it every time i open the game.

honor the sixth house and the tribe unmourned come to me openly and not by stealth it began here it will end here have you any parting words or would you prefer to skip the speeches and get to our business you are the challenger here after all so to you goes the courtesy of the first blow now that you have come to me here there can be but one result many times i have considered offering to share this place with you i considered offering to accept your oath of service you might try to buy my trust by giving me wraithguard keening and sunder i thought we might once again be friends comrades brothers in arms but i have won this place and power by right of conquest by right of daring and enterprise i will not risk it to cunning and deceit i offer you no deals if you are my enemy i cannot trust you and even if you are not my enemy i cannot let you live it wall all be decided here i believe i will prevail but i cannot be so sure and i am vain enough that should i fall i would wish to be remembered in my own words so if you have final questions you would ask ask them now i have final questions i would ask you if you would answer my first question is are you really nerevar reborn that is bitter the gods and fates are cruel i served you faithfully once lord nerevar and you repaid me with death i hope this time it will be you who pays for your faithlessness my second question is if you win what do you play to dow with the power from the heart will you make yourself a god and establish a thearchy or will you complete akulakhan and dispute control of tamriel with the septims or will you share the heart with your followers as i have and breed a new race of divine immortals you will follow the model of the tribunal that is a dull and unenterprising ambition see what the tribunal have done theyve sacrificed honour and dignity of the dunmer race and handed over our ancient land to the mongrel dogs of the empire you may mean well but you lack vision you are not worthy of the heart my final question is if i had offered to let you join me would you have surrendered wraithguard sunder and keening to me to seal your oath thank you for your forthright response and now if you have any questions ask them otherwise you are the challenger i await your first blow i will continue to draw divine power from the heart and distribute it to my kin and followers i will continue to broadcast divine power upon the blight winds so that it will touch each soul on vvardenfell and then more broadly across the waters to the rest of morrowind and tamriel in time every mortal in tamriel shall feel the liberating contact with the divine the sixth house will serve as the elite cadre of our movement as cultists evolve through various stages of enlightenment they will become as suits their abilities either holy warriors or priests their duty is to prepare themselves for service their joy and liberation is to enter even more deeply into the profound enlightenment of the divine dreamworld i will free the dunmer from the imperial yoke and cast down the false gods of the temple i will lead them out of their ancient superstitions and gift them with intimate knowledge of the divine then perhaps when morrowind is once again restored to its ancient glories it will be time to consider whether the dunmer should cultivate ambitions of empire if by my crimes you mean the inevitable suffering and destruction caused by war then i accept the burden of leadership the sixth house cannot be restored without war enlightenment cannot grow without the risk of upsetting the tradition bound and complacent herd and the mongrel armies of the empire cannot be expelled from morrowind without bloodshed as i have charity and compassion i grieve but our mission is just and noble i have no idea what happened to the dwemer i have been denied the opportunity to study wraithguard and i am not sure how much of kragenacs lore was invested in his tools and how much in his own sorcery and mastery i have long studied kragenac and have come to admire his wisdom and craft someday after the campaigns of the sixth house are secure i hope to have time to dedicate to this mystery akulakhan will serve three purposes first it will be the champion of my armies liberating first vvardenfell then morrowind and then perhaps the rest of tamriel second it will serve as a sower and cultivator of the divine substance derived from the heart three it will serve as the prominent banner and symbol of our cause to defy the empire to liberate mortals from ancient superstitions and to glorify our crusade against the gods oh please nerevar spare me i surrender i surrender ha ha ha ha ha farewell sweet nerevar better luck on your next incarnation this is getting tiresome you are a

I've never played a game quite like this- proves they don't quite make them like they used to. Morrowind is my top favorite game of all time- the ultimate RPG, in my opinion, and definitely the best Elder Scrolls game to date.

Graphics and Gameplay Feel/Fluidity-
While Arena and Daggerfall are great in their own right, they're clunky, old, and dated. Morrowind is as well, don't get me wrong- but it's just new enough that it's perfectly playable if you don't mind older graphics. 
The gameplay is nothing short of perfect for any RPG lover- if you were ever into Dungeons & Dragons or old tabletop RPGs of that nature, then you will love Morrowind. If you are carved-in-stone no-exceptions used to Skyrim's gameplay- maybe stay away from Morrowind, as it's much more complex and can be intimidating for those who are used to Skyrim's (for lack of a better word) dumbed down systems.
When you start, by creating your character, you will choose a race (This determines some starting abilities, skills, and attributes (to a larger extent than the other two)), class (This determines what you're good at! You have 5 major and 5 minor skills, to which you recieve bonuses that add on to previous racial bonuses, and these are the only skills that can get you points to level up- Pick ones you know you'll use), and a birth sign (This will give you a unqiue special ability or power. Choose wisely- there are better and worse ones to pick). You can also create a completely custom class, complete with a custom description that you can write (I like to write a backstory for my character here).
It's the perfect video game adaptation of a tabletop RPG, with complex calculations automatically being taken every time you perform an action. You will fail to cast your spells, you will have to run, teleport away, regroup and return when you're stronger. You will even completely fail to hit many enemies when you first start out- I found it incredibly frustrating, even redundant at first, as someone who started on Skyrim and the like- but after spending some time on the game, I realized it's all part of the amazing journey that your character goes on. 
You will NOTICE your progression- the devs made sure of that. The game's difficulty doesn't scale with the player, it depends on the region and the type of enemy. This means that you WILL be able to surpass enemies eventually: those pesky Ashlander outcasts who once tore you to shreds in a matter of seconds will become mere pests that you can flick away without much effort. Eventually, you will never miss, and the skills that you decided to capitalize on WILL pay off, immensely.
The role-playing aspect of this game is one of the ways it shines the most- where in Skyrim, you are handed god-like abilities and the title of ""Chosen One"" (Dragonborn) from almost the very beginning, in Morrowind you must earn them. This also means that if you don't want your character to ""save the world"" or be a household name in Morrowind, you can choose to forego the main story and live out a ""normal"" life. There is an enormous abundance of other quest lines to pursue, and you will find many ways to create a unique character that the world reacts to accordingly.
You can kill literally anybody you wish, everyone is kill-able and being ""essential"" in the game merely means that upon killing that character, you will be notified that unless you revert to an earlier save, you won't be able to complete the main quest or DLC main quests. And if you decide after the quests that you want to kill them, go ahead- They're not ""essential"" anymore.
There's so many incredible things about Morrowind's gameplay- this review would be a novel's length if I listed even half of them- but to sum up some of the most exciting ones, you can do the following things in Morrowind:
-Custom spell creation and spell engineering
-Custom potions from complex alchemy systems involving multiple pieces of apparatus
-Powerful custom enchantments on almost any equipment
-Kill anyone (Literally ANYONE, I cannot stress this enough)
-Interact with/kill literal gods
-Become famous
-Become an outlaw
-Become a vampire/werewolf (With ACTUAL drawbacks- vampires and werewolves are hated in Tamriel, and this game makes you pay for the power of being undead, or a shape-shifter)
AND SO MUCH MORE! You will spend countless hours exploring all the features of this game.
Now, onto the next part.

Atmosphere/Immersion-
Morrowind, out of all Elder Scrolls games, is definitely the most atmospherically impressive and immersive. Like I said earlier, I started on Skyrim (Which has a much bigger map) and I didn't think anything could top that level of immersion. Morrowind's map, albeit smaller, is incredibly dense and much more interesting- every step is handcrafted and beautifully designed for maximum immersion- you feel like you're in this world. You will find hidden locations and secrets, sometimes (actually more often than not) containing useful equipment and tools, or even powerful one-of-a-kind artifacts.
There's no ""fast travel"" in Morrowind. Either you can pay at one of the silt-strider ports to be instantly taken to neighboring cities (You will spend a lot of gold on this), you can use spells Mark and Recall to teleport yourself to any location you have previously chosen, you can use Intervention scrolls to be teleported to religious locations, and there are about two items in game that allow for VERY LIMITED fast travel through magical capabilities. Other than that, you have to walk and explore- Trust me, this is better. Enjoy the view, Vvardenfell is a beautiful, diverse place. 
There's also no quest markers. Whaaaaaat? That's right- none whatsoever. NPCs, book pages, and subtle clues will give you accurate and descriptive directions to where the quest objective is, and your character records everything of that nature in their journal. You can access any part of your journal at any time, because of the alphabetized sorting system that can take you to any category or quest record instantly. 
The attention to detail in the game is also immaculate. Argonians and Khajiit have snouts- and in Morrowind, digitigrade (multi-jointed and animalistic, think of a cat's or a dog's hind legs) legs as well. These two races can't wear boots, and they also can't wear full-faced helmets. Why would they be able to? Argonians, lore-wise, are semi-aquatic as well- and the developers showed that, not only through their ability to breathe water, but also their unique swimming animation that only they use. Instead of pushing their arms like wings through the water like a human, they swim more like crocodiles or monitor lizards- pinning their arms to their sides, and using their tail to propel them forward. This is just one small example of attention to detail- it makes sense, so they put it in the game. You will find that there are many facets of the game that adhere to this rule. All of these small details add up to a bigger picture that creates a huge amount of immersion.

Story-
I won't spoil anything about the story, but it is amazing- once again, it shines in the Elder Scrolls series as an example of great storytelling. You will meet many characters, all with different personalities, likes, dislikes, inclinations, talents, and skills. You will fight, you will make diplomatic agreements, you will bribe and persuade, make alliances and enemies, and so much more. It's something you really need to experience for yourself to get the full idea.

I finally decided to come back and actually play it properly after almost 20 years. I was not prepared for how good it would be. I had alot of nostalgia for Oblivion, and saw it through rose tinted glasses for a really long time, where I kind of just ignored all of it's flaws. When I played Skyrim, I was older and didn't have that nostalgia and was able to see it for what it was. Morrowind, unmodded, completely shattered my Oblivion nostalgia, and is probably my favorite RPG now. Every complaint I've seen levied against the game for years is a complete nonissue. The hit chance mechanic is not a problem unless you go out of your way to make it a problem. Power attacks actually do enough damage to warrant spending the extra stamina to use them. Magic is fun and viable. Alchemy is absurdly powerful and is actually worth using. Enchanting is more than ""[INSERT MAGIC DAMAGE TYPE] on hit for [INSERT ARBITRARILY LOW NUMBER] damage."" Every skill has an absurd amount of trainers who can train you as much as you want, with the only restrictions being your attributes, their skill, and how much gold you have. It might also be the single most stable Bethesda game I have ever played, with my only crashes being from drinking potions until I had over 100,000 in an attribute.",1702118076,1702376515,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Political intrigue, racism...well.. everyone, like, pretty much everyone is racist... the landscape is so very alien, yet familiar enough to not feel like a feverdream... shit's great.

morrowind is grey.. there's a joke there somewhere, but honestly dull and grey and i feel like the volcano and ash are a lazy copout, even the areas that aren't purposely drab are just so bland and tired. 90% of npcs are placeholders with copypaste text dumps. the ones that are more 'memorable' are that way cause of 'good writing' which is just hardcore rpg fan speak for purposely weird 'this guys a pervert isn't that so quirky'.

remember when you first start this game, you swing your sword and miss way more than half of your hits, maybe even die, get wrecked early on and take it as 'man i must've been doing something wrong' but now your skills are honed your attacks connect, the magic dice roll of combat has finally stopped being rigged, you fly over obstacles.. you've done it.

now this game isn't NOT enjoyable, it has it's quirks but there is a world to love and fun to be had if you can get past it's pitfalls and shortcomings, there are worst games in this genre, but this game is put on such a platform, it's called a perfect game so often that it deserves to be dissected.",1572906685,1702057333,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is slow at first and always monotonous and janky. It's well worth spending the time to explore the world, interact with its citizens, and participate in some of the most wonderful lore ever written for fantasy. The main game, with almost all faction quests, took me 150 or so hours to complete. The Tribunal DLC is even better than the main game, with really impressive environments, and it directly builds on the end of the main story (takes about 15 hours). I highly recommend it. I haven't played the Bloodmoon DLC yet.

[h2]MORROWIND'S PROBLEMS[/h2]
Many people will claim that Morrowind is better than Skyrim, and that its many complex systems are part of what makes it a masterpiece. Despite all the praise, anyone can see as soon as they play the game what the core problems of Morrowind are: the initial hours are extremely slow, and the combat is not immersive. 

[b]The game starts slow.[/b] Your movement is slow, combat is slow, questing is slow, leveling up is slow. Many people claim that this is fine because it means you are forced to leave a difficult dungeon/quest and level up elsewhere before returning, and that this sets it apart from other RPGs. That is true, but that doesn't make it an inherently good system. It means that you have to try to make any progress anywhere you can. This doesn't always mean you're more immersed in the role of early adventuring. It just means that you will take any non-combat job you can get until the questline presents you with a fight you can't handle. Returning to that initial challenge you couldn't take earlier isn't particularly satisfying to me. Once you're capable of taking on the combat missions that once gave you issues, you can complete almost any quest in the game. Level/combat/wealth progression reaches a plateau after about 40 hours that removes impossible challenges and equalizes quests into somewhat monotonous chores. There are a handful of interesting combat challenges after this point, but since you are now capable of quickly reaching any destination and quickly dealing with quest objectives, that slow early game grind loses its meaning, because it's just a regular RPG now.

[b]The combat is not immersive.[/b] It is very clear that you're looking at an abstraction of a probability calculation playing out on screen. Because your level, gear, and wealth play such a large part in your progression, your skill at controlling your character doesn't matter. You walk up to enemies and click until they die. If something goes wrong, you quickly scroll through your long list of spells and run backwards until you take care of it. The difficulty of a fight is determined by how quickly you can kill an enemy and how much damage they can do to you in that time. The wealth of unique spells you can create are methods of cheating probabilities into your favor in particular situations. They don't meaningfully change gameplay. Combat isn't fun. It's not bad, it's just boring. To claim this is better than Skyrim's combat is, in my opinion, clearly contrarian. 

[h2]WHY YOU SHOULD PLAY MORROWIND[/h2]
Despite its problems, I still think Morrowind is a good game. Well, maybe it's not a good ""game,"" but it is an immersive interface with the Elder Scrolls lore in a way that no Elder Scrolls game has gotten as well besides Elder Scrolls Online. And the Elder Scrolls lore, a lot of which was greatly expanded/explored for the first time in Morrowind, is an artistic treat. The stories, spirituality, culture, and art on display is masterful. The first time you see a sunrise/sunset against the water, you realize that there is something deeper to this game. Maybe the act of swinging a sword at a nix-hound isn't immersive, but them showing up across the countryside and their disgusting mannerisms certainly are. The transition between biomes is poorly done, but the biomes themselves are gorgeous and heavily varied. The characters you meet are important. They contribute to the lore at large or have already contributed to the lore, but they feel like characters still living in the world when you come across them. 

Quests in Morrowind break down into three main categories: the main quest, faction quests, and miscellaneous quests. You will spend the bulk of your time doing faction quests for the large number of factions in the game. These are mostly fetch quests and combat chores with no engaging gameplay. All that to say, once the character writing that differentiates the NPCs beyond the preset dialogue options becomes apparent in quest-givers, chores become framed around exploring guild intrigue and progression through their ranks. You might feel morally apprehensive about taking on a quest in a guild you want to advance through, only to learn that there is better alternative. The guilds have histories, and the guild members have histories that all interact to make your otherwise chore-filled experience a lot more rewarding. There's even inter-guild interactions that help connect your progress.

Miscellaneous quests usually have the most interesting gameplay, having to solve unusual problems, but they rarely have good rewards or solutions clear enough to feel worth doing. Plenty are just as boring as the faction quests, or even duplicate themselves, just in a different location. There are Daedric quests here in order to retrieve some artifacts, but they aren't especially complicated quests, nor are the rewards always better than something you'd receive during a faction quest.

The main quest really is the gem of the game. Yes, there's great dialogue writing everywhere in the game, but nowhere is it more consistent than in the main quest line. The level of the Elder Scrolls lore weirdness it explores is phenomenal. There's no other fantasy story like it. Unfortunately it becomes less writing and more a sprint to the finish in the final stage of the story, but Dagoth Ur and the Nerevarine's story is good, even by literary standards.",1516515955,1701754066,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

Title: A Journey Through Vvardenfell's Rich Tapestry - The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind Review

The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, released in 2002, stands as a monumental achievement in the realm of open-world RPGs, setting the stage for its successors in the renowned Elder Scrolls series. Stepping into the shoes of the Nerevarine, players find themselves on the island of Vvardenfell, a sprawling and mysterious land filled with intrigue, danger, and a depth of lore that remains unmatched.

The first thing that strikes players about Morrowind is its vivid and unique setting. Vvardenfell is a fantastical world teeming with diverse landscapes, from mushroom-filled forests to ashy volcanic plains. The attention to detail is exceptional, making exploration a captivating experience. Every corner of the world feels deliberate, each region telling its own story through environmental design.

The narrative is another high point of Morrowind. The game boasts a complex and engaging main questline that revolves around the player fulfilling a prophecy as the Nerevarine. The depth of the lore and the political intrigue surrounding the Great Houses and the Tribunal add layers of complexity to the overarching story. The freedom given to players in their approach to the main quest and the numerous side quests creates a sense of agency and personalization in the storytelling.

Character customization is one of Morrowind's strengths, offering a wide array of races, classes, and skills. The intricate character creation system allows players to craft a truly unique protagonist. However, the combat mechanics can be a point of contention. The dice-roll combat system, while a staple of classic RPGs, can feel clunky to modern gamers. It requires a degree of patience and adaptation, but those who persevere will find a satisfying sense of progression as their character becomes more skilled and powerful.

The modding community has played a significant role in Morrowind's enduring popularity. Even years after its release, a plethora of user-created content is available, ranging from graphical enhancements to extensive quest mods that expand the already vast world of Vvardenfell.

Despite its many merits, Morrowind is not without its flaws. The aging graphics may deter some modern players, and the absence of voice acting for most NPCs might be a hurdle for those accustomed to more contemporary RPGs. Additionally, the lack of a quest marker system means players must rely on directions given in the dialogue, which can be confusing at times.

In conclusion, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind remains a landmark title in the RPG genre. Its expansive world, rich lore, and unparalleled sense of freedom set the standard for open-world games. While some aspects may feel dated by today's standards, the game's enduring legacy is a testament to its lasting impact on the gaming industry. For those willing to immerse themselves in a meticulously crafted world and embrace the challenges of classic RPG mechanics, Morrowind is a journey well worth taking.",1701658469,1701658469,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Let's be honest: People my age are too nostalgic, and we say that our old pixelated games are better than the new stuff. BUT younger people have the exact opposite problem where you insist that anything newer and shinier is automatically better. If we both set aside our biases and just judge this game based on its gameplay, I maintain that it is ten times the game that Skyrim is. I'll give 3 examples.

First, Morrowind truly lets you go anywhere and do anything from the very beginning. If you want to wander into a high-level area and get yourself beaten up, or if you want to kill a character that is crucial for the main story, then Morrowind will let you do this. It's your playthrough--you can enjoy it however you want to. By contrast, Skyrim is full of unpickable locked doors and unkillable main story characters because the devs want to force you to play the game a certain way and only interact with certain content at certain times. If I want to overthrow the crime family that runs Riften, the game won't let me. If i stumble across the Thalmor Embassy, I can't get inside (without a glitch or mod) even if my locking level is 100.  What incentive do I have for exploring, if I won't be allowed to access half of what I find?

Second, Morrowind never bothers you with the main story. You can pursue or ignore the main quest however you'd like. By contrast, after you fight the first dragon in Skyrim, the game will constantly send dragons after you. The main story will hunt you down, find you, and make you pay attention to it. This is yet another example of how the devs want to force players to play the game a certain way, instead of giving players the true freedom to interact with and enjoy the open world in any way that the players choose.

Lastly, many of the so-called achievements in Skyrim are actually obstacles or caps. For example, in many towns/cities, high-level quests are off-limits to you until you own land in that city. So you have to spend a lot of money buying houses in every city. This process is probably done to prevent players from becoming game-breakingly rich early in the game. But it's still a very obnoxious scenario, where the game is pretending to reward you by actually forcing you to spend a lot of money in order to progress. By contrast, you can only (""only"") buy 2 houses in Morrowind, but they're wonderful houses and they are ACTUALLY rewards for having completed a long questline.

In conclusion, Morrowind gives players far more genuine freedom to explore a brilliantly immersive world.",1701557825,1701557825,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

When I first played it, upon it's release in 2003, my old computer was barely able to keep up with the graphics, and in fact the cut scenes were clipped and stuttered. Fortunately, they were few and far between.  The only thing that I really disliked about the game, was the facial graphics, which were absolutely horrid. Otherwise, the game was a treat, made me a fan of the Elder Scrolls series, and led me to purchase and play to death first Oblivion, and then Skyrim.  

It was not until just recently, some 20 years after playing the original, that I purchased the Morrowind Game of the Year Edition on Steam, and have just completed my first playthrough.  I did download several mods, with the most important being (for me):  MGE XE, Better Heads, Better Dialogue Font, Morrowind Enhanced Textures and Graphic Herbalism.  The other mods were all good, but I think those 5 contributed most to my enjoyment of the gameplay.  It was so nice to not have to deal with that original facial art, and Graphic Herbalism made harvesting components so much simpler than trying to guess which plants you had already harvested, and which you hadn't.   

Having been a big fan of both Oblivion and Skyrim, it was amazing to go back and play Morrowind once again, and find that it not only held up to those two later games, but actually surpassed it in almost every regard.  The depth of the main quest was awesome, and really pulled me in.  For my first character I made a custom built Nord melee specialist, specializing primarily in Axes, and it was a joy to have him swinging and slicing his way through the wilderness of Vvardenfell.  By this end of this playthrough, which I admit I spent a lot of time on, he was at 100 at all his stats except INT and WIL, and those were both over 80.  All of his Major and Minor skill were maxed or getting close to it, except for Armorer, which seems to go up very slowly, Alteration, which is limited by INT, and a couple of others.  Granted, he was very, very overpowered by the end of the game, but I had finished the main quest with him still around level 40, so it was still somewhat of a challenge.  

As to the expansions, which of course are included in the GOTYE, I really enjoyed Tribunal ... I mean really enjoyed it! ... but found Bloodmoon very tedious, and the only really unsatisfying part of the game for me.  The packs of mobs, attacking you around every hill, was just a pain, and contributed nothing to the enjoyment of the game.  Why the designers made such a radical departure from previous gameplay is beyond me.  These mobs meant nothing to Bloodmoon's questlines, dropped no meaningful gear, and seemed to be put into the game just to slow the player down.  

Conclusion:  For those who have never played Morrowind, or like me have not played it for the past 20 years, it is well worth picking up and enjoying.  It remains one of the best games ever released.",1701344062,1701344062,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There's not just a feeling of standing in one place and knowing there's a world around you to explore - it's also that that world has history, and those histories have their own histories, everyone has their own place in the world, and they have their own opinion about that place and where they want to go from there - it's a similar sort of feeling to Fallout New Vegas' world design, in that you're a big part of a small part of a big world.

It's okay if the jank drives you off - it's an acquired taste. Once you start to get the hang of things though, there's a definite feeling of satisfaction, of progression, and when you find those things that absolutely break the game, it's reticent to that. There's a lot to be found here, but the game isn't just going to give it to you - you have to engage with it, and that is, of course, not for everyone.

Get it on sale, try it out. If it's not for you, it's more than okay - it might just take you in one day when you decide to give it another go, and once the ball gets rolling, it *will* reward you for giving it your attention.",1701133955,1701215305,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

TES 3 Morrowind is in my opinion the best Elder Scrolls game and one of the greatest games of all time. This game has one of the most compelling narratives I've played, and it does far more with the lore far better than any TES entry before or after. The gameplay itself is also truly spectacular. The dialogue system is the best of any entry in the series, and it's a shame the depth it offered had to be put aside due to voiced line hardware constraints. The magic and fighting systems are done really well, and the leveling system works especially with the lack of leveled enemies.
Admittedly the graphics are a little dated, but I still personally find vanilla graphics enjoyable and at times breathtaking. The other big complaint often posed is how often attacks miss, but it is an intentional game design that wouldn't be egregious if you used a weapon you're actually proficient in. The bugs are admittedly bad at times, and I'd recommend you play with the unofficial code patch by default.

Despite its age, this game continues to astound with its intricate storytelling, vast world, and immersive gameplay.

The first thing that struck me was the sheer size and diversity of Morrowind's world. The land of Vvardenfell is a breathtaking mix of alien landscapes, from verdant forests to ash-covered plains and mushroom-filled swamps. Exploring these diverse regions was a true adventure, with surprises lurking around every corner.

What truly sets Morrowind apart is its dedication to immersion. The game doesn't hold your hand; instead, it trusts you to uncover its mysteries and lore on your own. This level of freedom, though daunting at first, soon became the game's greatest strength. The ability to choose my path, make decisions that shaped the story, and engage with various factions felt empowering and rewarding.

The depth of Morrowind's lore is astounding. The world feels alive, teeming with history, politics, and cultures. The conversations with NPCs, each with their distinct personalities and stories, added layers to the rich tapestry of this game. Unraveling the prophecies, uncovering ancient secrets, and navigating the intricate web of political intrigue kept me thoroughly engaged throughout my playthrough.

Combat and character progression might feel a bit dated by today's standards, but once I embraced Morrowind's unique mechanics, they added to the game's charm. The complex spellcasting system and diverse skill sets allowed for diverse playstyles, making each character truly unique.

Despite its age, Morrowind's visuals hold up remarkably well, especially considering the era it was released in. The art style, coupled with a hauntingly beautiful musical score, contributes significantly to the game's immersive atmosphere.

That said, Morrowind isn't without flaws. Some might find the outdated graphics or the occasional bugs a hurdle. Yet, for those willing to look past these minor issues, the game rewards with an unforgettable experience.

In conclusion, my first venture into Morrowind was nothing short of mesmerising. This game has aged like fine wine, proving that true greatness transcends time. For any gamer seeking a deep, immersive RPG experience, Morrowind stands as a testament to the genre's timeless brilliance.

I say that to specify that I am not an OG Morrowind player viewing the game through nostalgia goggles. That said, I would HIGHLY recommend this game. You can really feel the love and effort that the developers put into Morrowind back in the day, and I found myself extremely engrossed in the various stories and characters present within the game. (Vivec may very well be one of the most interesting characters I've ever encountered in a video game and certainly within the Elder Scrolls series) In terms of gameplay, I really appreciated the level requirements present in order to rank up within factions (Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, etc.), which makes exponentially more sense than the Skyrim model that allows you to become the Wizard's College Archmaster with only a basic knowledge of destruction. However, even though I liked that system, I did find myself cheesing level-ups a lot, particularly on magic skills, by casting spells near a bed until I ran out of magika, going to sleep to refill, and repeating, which is not terribly immersive. 

Mechanically, there are some issues with the game that I could see preventing someone from enjoying the game. First, movement and attacking (at least with melee weapons) in the early game is ridiculously slow. It takes an obscene amount of time to walk from one point to another, and attacking enemies can be a slog when only 1 out of 10 attacks actually hit your target. Second, it IS possible to lock yourself out of pieces of the main story quest by exploring the world and stumbling on another side quest.  In my playthrough, I would've been completely unable to complete the main quest without console commands, and I ended up missing a very lore-important conversation with a high-level enemy. These issues aside, I do still highly recommend this game as long as you're willing to put up with some old-game jank.

I've heard Morrowind described as an immersive sim first and a curated experience second, somewhat like an inverse of Skyrim (which was crafted as a linear power fantasy with a deliberate aversion towards standard classes and builds when you can easily become a master swordsman/mage/archer/thief/blacksmith/alchemist/enchanter/etc without many role playing opportunities aside from mod support, and the only vanilla role-playing option is minor variations with character race).

The gameplay mechanics of The Elder Scrolls III are somewhat hardcore. Much like Daggerfall / Elder Scrolls II, Melee attacks have a significant chance to miss at low skill levels and spells have a high chance to fail, which increases greatly if your Fatigue gets low from sprinting... but you have the options of toughing it out or installing Magika/Fatigue mods for a smoother gameplay experience. I highly recommend the latter as someone who died to a tiny worm when playing Xbox Morrowind as a kid before moving on to Xbox 360 Oblivion and modded PC Oblivion and PC Skyrim SE with mods.

The setting of Morrowind is very unique and interesting and diverse with alien landscapes, cool architecture, fascinating transport options and exotic semi-hostile wildlife, the homeland the land of the Dummer, an ethnocentric, slave-owning elven culture with a very dim view of foreigners that they call 'outlanders.'

Still, it's an interesting change of pace from the pretty but standardized, puzzle-infested and linear frozen mountain dungeon caves of Skyrim, the standard fantasy woods of Oblivion, and it's more expressive and artistic than Starfield.

Lore is deep, although it is fed to you forcefully, since the main quest is heavily political.
Dialogue windows having more than three options are a breath of fresh air after Skyrim.
Power scaling is incredible - you start fighting for your life with mudcrabs and you end up killing incredible creatures.
Disposition as a mechanic is rather good.
Geography is what makes this a true fantasy: people eat eggs mined underground and take leather from flying land-borne jellyfish.
Atmosphere is pretty weak but well, you don't need a thousand mods to enjoy the game as is.
Levelling up is extremely confusing but once you get to know it, allows for fun stat management.
Magic is, unlike pretty much all other games in the series, actually fun and properly implemented. More meaningful spells than in Hogwarts Legacy, many more than in Skyrim. Magic is not required for playing, but it makes everything more fun. Spellmaking is just creme of the crop.

There's also bad stuff.
There is no way to organise your Journal, so it's best to keep a second one on you just in case.
Aggro mechanics are as annoying as it gets - a creature can spot you from a mile and get stuck while trying to approach you - this means no resting and healing within 100 metres of the spot, until you noclip and find the poor soul.
Most quests are ""a naked guy is cursed by a witch"" or ""they stole my guar skins""
Inventory is just a mess, even more than in Skyrim (unbelievable).
Game crashes are... more common than I would like to admit. Happened to me probably 40-50 times, so like every 2-3 hours.
Bland melee and range combat (excluding fists and magic), once you come to an enemy, you just click faster than it does. Although, considering Weapon Condition, three strike types and weapon class diversity, I guess it's not as bad as in Skyrim.

I went to GameStop in 2002 with a little extra Christmas money. I was holding you and another game, Shenmue 2, and having a hard time deciding which to take home to my Xbox. I ultimately decided on you and I'm a better person for it.

I still think about the first time I stepped off the boat onto Vvardenfell and I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. No quest arrow pointers, no direction. I was just supposed to do whatever I felt like. The very idea was mind-boggling and so hardcore. My first trip down the road toward Pelagiad, then on to Balmora, Caldera, and Ald-Ruhn. It was days before I even started the main quest. I rolled a few characters and we had a lot of fun times, but then you changed. Yes you changed, for the better, when you decided to show me so much more with your Game of the Year release on Xbox. 
 
The game I had already spent hundreds, possibly thousands, of hours in had nearly doubled in size. I still hadn't even done everything there was to do in the base game, but I knew I would come back evetually, so I moved on the expansions. We had so much fun together. I never imagined it could get any better.

But then, I got a PC. Oh, how I never even dreamed of the possibilities. Mods. Mods everywhere. The Unofficial Patch. Better Bodies. Morrowind Graphics Extender. I was never very shallow and didn't mind how you looked, but these and hundreds of other mods, no thousands, showed your true potential.

We've had our ups-and-downs. There's been times I have looked through old saves and realized I haven't spent time with you in over a year, but I know you'll always be there waiting. I'll admit I've cheated on you with your younger siblings. I know I'm a terrible person. 

I fell victim to the sway and promises of Oblivion, but it was too easy. It showed where to go and what to do. It gave me less armor and weapon choices. It tried to limit my experience. It was cold-hearted. While it was fun, it was really just a fling.

I went back to you for awhile, but then Skyrim released. Sure it was new and flashy, it looked gorgeous, but that's not what it's about. It was even easier than Oblivion. So after another fling and another lesson learned, I went back to you yet again.

I've purchased you 4 times over now (Xbox vanilla, Xbox GOTY, PC GOTY, Steam GOTY) and I've still never experienced all you have to offer.

----------

Environment: 10 - From the shores of Dagon Fel to the sprawling city of Vivec. From the streets of Mournhold to the Clockwork City. Very few words can describe the magnitude of the environment - sprawling is the first that comes to mind. Go anywhere you want. The sky's the limit. No really, it's the only limit.

Controls: 7 - Look up, look down. Strafe left, strafe right. Pretty basic setup. Combat may be clunky, but mods exist to make it better if you want. It's an action RPG, but an RPG none the less. Stat based combat means not everything willl hit every time.

Gameplay: 10 - Essentially, Morrowind allows you to do what you want, when you want. Play the game however you feel like. Don't feel like ever completing the main quest line? No problem. You might even forget it's there like I did. Want to kill off an important NPC that's part of the main quest line? No worries there either. There's even a work-around quest line that will still allow you to finish the main quest line if you prefer.

Entertainment: 10 - Become a member of the Thieve's Guild and steal your way to the top. Rise through the ranks of the Fighter's Guild and earn your place. Join one of the three political houses for some intrigue. Go on a walk-about and see what there is to see.  You might run into a naked Nord that has been bewitched or you could possibly encounter a group of bandits. There is so much going on in this game, you just have to explore to experience some of the random and crazy things out there.

Replayability: 10 - I've spent many, many hours in this game, and have only played a total of four characters. I still want to start a new character at some point. I hope that explains the score well enough.

Graphics: 7 - At release, it was gorgeous. Compared to modern games, it's not much to look at. If you're a shallow Hal, there's plenty of mods available to spruce things up a bit.

----------

If you've never played an Elder Scrolls game before, you have no idea what you're missing. If you started with either Oblivion or Skyrim, you have no idea what you're missing. A lot of gamers agree (no source) that Morrowind is the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series and I agree. Do yourself a favor and get the game.

Most important is give it some time. After the short intro scene, you're on your own. You decide where to go and what to do. You decide how to play the game. The learning curve can seem a bit steep, but believe when I say very simply, it's worth it.

Disclaimers:

- If you're questioning my listed hours on record, I just purchased this on the Steam 2014 Holiday Sale (12/22/2014). However, as listed above, I have spent quite a bit of time with Morrowind outside of Steam.

- No, I'm not truly in love with this game nor do I have some sort of abnormal gamer fetish. It's just a game I love to play that is the top of my personal ""best games"" list.

What makes Morrowind truly unique is the ability to craft any spell and potion one desires, plus its alien landscape which modern-day fantasy  RPGs have failed to replicate and its fantastic lore which makes the player feel as if they have stumbled into a Lovecraftian-inspired fantasy world.

And who could forget the story? Compared to the likes of Oblivion and Skyrim, Morrowind's main plot is simply out of this world, as it involves a resurrected warrior from the old days on a quest to overthrow those who betrayed and killed him while also dealing with a monstrous madman who seeks to enslave all of Morrowind's inhabitants using something similar to a Blight.

Last but not least, it is worth pointing out that while the combat is not the best, it gets progressively better depending on how many skill points one invests as one levels up.

Do yourself a favour and give this last old-school RPG a shot.

The controls are a bit clunky and you feel a bit awkward swinging around the first dagger you get. Well screw it, let’s see what this game has to offer. So you go up to the first enemy you see, a mudcrab. You start hacking away at it, only to find that you miss almost 90% of the time. Finally after getting hit a few times you dispatch it. Well, that didn’t go as well as you expected. Then you realize that even when running you are moving at a snail's pace and you are constantly very low on fatigue. You get your hands on better weapons and armour, but you still miss often and take more damage than you expect. Despite all  this, you play on. You get your first side quest, and then you realize that objectives aren’t marked on your map nor are you notified when they are completed. Then you find other tedious things, your magic doesn’t regenerate, there isn’t a fast travel system*, spells can fail, equipment can break, etc. At long last you snap. You run around cursing the day you ever thought it was a good idea to purchase this game in a blood-curdling scream. But for whatever reason you play on, maybe you want to see if you can get the slightest satisfaction out of the money you’ve invested, maybe a small part of you likes the game, or maybe you want to add more play time so your multi-paragraph rant about why you shouldn’t play this game will be taken more seriously.

	Then something magical happens, you get a few level ups and your skills improve. You start figuring out how to keep your health up without constantly purchasing potions. You start paying close attention to the quest instructions and find that they aren’t so difficult to follow. You finally start hitting more than you miss and with every hit you land and every creature you slay you get a burst of adrenaline. You grow stronger and start making short work of enemies that once made mincemeat out of you, laughing triumphantly in your sweet revenge. You start moving much faster than you ever thought you would. But that was just the beginning. You then find yourself paying close attention to the side quests and the people of Morrowind and suddenly you’ve completely immersed yourself in a game that has graphics optimized from the N64 era, but that no longer matters. The controls that once baffled you become completely second-nature. The combat that once was infuriating becomes so great you will charge at every enemy you spot.** The magic system that once seemed impossible suddenly seems like the only way a magic system should work. Even the most trivial interactions become satisfying, and at long last all the troubles you had in the past with this game make complete sense.

	Unfortunately Morrowind isn’t for everyone, and that’s okay. It’s no exaggeration that this game takes a LOT of patience to get into. You begin with selecting races you’re not familiar with and making choices for your character without any knowledge about all they ways they will affect you throughout the game. Then, you are put through a brief tutorial and are thrust right into the game with only an item for the first main quest and a dagger. The rest you will have to look up online or learn through experience. But don’t be discouraged, as this game get’s extremely enjoyable once you get out of the ‘rut’ of the first chunk of the game. Once you finally get a good understanding of how everything works you finally start to see that things that once frustrated you are there for good reason. The customization level of this game is extensive, more extensive than Oblivion or Skyrim. Not that those are bad games, but Morrowind offers a deeper and more challenging experience. You have plenty of classes to choose from, you can make your own class, and you choose a birthsign which can augment your stats or grant you new abilities, further increasing the amount of character builds to experiment with. Overall, if you’ve got a lot of free time on your hands and want to play through an deep and immersive RPG, I cannot recommend Morrowind enough. 

Pros:
	+Very immersive open world
	+Plenty of ways to build your character
	+Background Music is subtle yet very catchy
	+Deep Stat/skill development 
	+Rock Solid Gameplay, takes some getting used to

Cons:
	-Takes a large amount of time to get used to gameplay and controls
        -Outdated Graphics (Can be fixed with the right mods) 
        -Sound Effects are a bit lacking (Fixed with Mods)
        -Enchanting is the worst

* There is a Fast travel system of sorts. (As Nerf mentioned earlier) The Mage’s guild allows you to warp to any other Mage’s guild building. The Silt Striders (Giant mountable insects) let you ride to almost any town. Also you can use intervention spells to warp you to the nearest temple, fortress, etc. When you get further in the game you can use exotic means of transportation such as jumping/levitating across the entire island. Bottom line is, just because there’s no fast travel doesn’t mean you can’t conveniently get places

** Morrowind is often criticized as having a “God-awful” combat system. I have yet to figure out why but the complaint I hear a lot is the fact that you can miss, and early game you will miss a lot. I actually loved this. The higher your agility stat and weapon skill the more often you will hit. This motivated me to try and improve my weapon skills so that I could hit more often. Plus I feel like the health of enemies was lowered to compensate for this. Most of the early enemies will go down in a few hits so long as you're using your most effective attacks. So even early game when you miss a lot fights don’t last too much longer than they would in Skyrim where you hit every time. Point is, the combat system is something I love, but you might not enjoy it.",1423544530,1700028056,True,768,161,0.972065627574920654,26,True,False,False

is an old but still nice to play classic from the RPG Genre that gives the Players a huge Freedom to explore the fascinating Island with the Titles same Name Morrowind.
With a high variety of Weapons, Spells and ways to play it leaves the choice up to the Players themselfs if they want to be a Warrior, a Mage, a helpfull Hero or a Thief with lots of Quests and Stories that this Game wants to tell.

The Game’s strong side is its high Focus on actual RPG Elements with which it grants the Players a huge Freedom with which they can decide what Quests they want to do, what Weapons they want to use and in which direction they want to go.
Another Part of this old Classic is its huge World and the well implemented Questlines it offers to keep the Players occupied for Hours (Hint: I played more than 500 Hours with the Non-Steam-Version. If someone wonders why i have not so much on the Steam-Edition. :P)

The sad Part in this Game tho is, that the graphics are no longer up to date and could eventually look horrible to People who are now used to much higher Details and Resolution.
Would be nice if Bethesda would give this classic an overhaul instead of Skyrim!

I recommend this Game to Players who like a good classic Fantasy RPG with lots of Exploration-Potential.
---------------------------------
[h3]Points i give this Game (average Points 7,04 / 10):[/h3]
6 / 10 Graphic (Good for the Time it launched, but out to date for todays Standards.)
7 / 10 Art-Style (The World is cleverly made with the placement of all the Buildings and Dungeons and the interiours and how it gives good vibes of a Fantasy World with all the Armors and Fantasy-Creatures in it)
5 / 10 Atmosphere (The Atmosphere in Quests varies from Main- to Guild- to Sidequests. Some Sidequests dont hype the Atmosphere that much as Main and Guildquests do.)
8,3 / 10 Gameplay (Solid Gameplay for an RPG. Gives a lot of Freedom into the Player’s Hands. A little outdated to in Combat.)
9 / 10 Main-Story (Well made Main-Story, as specially with the Expansions that really drag Players into the world of The Elder Scrolls.)
7 / 10 Side-Story (Interesting Guild-Stories that introduce the Player to different Factions of the Island.)
6,5 / 10 Characters (NPCs feel like Individuals, but sadly after a certain Point they can only repeat what they have already told the Player.)
7,5 / 10 Soundtracks (Good Soundtracks in this Game and as specially the Main-Menue one leaves a Mark)

Base game good, VERY good. Kill anyone, craft crazy gear, have a fun power fantasy. Amazing mods like Tamriel Rebuilt. OpenMW multiplayer and VR is incredible. The game is super atmospheric. It's a very well realized world. 

The expansions/DLC are underwhelming after beating the base game's main quest. In all fairness plenty of people enjoy them so take what follows with a grain of salt.
Tribunal is a lot more on rails, claustrophic...and it just feels like a really long Oblivion-esque dungeon with a town on top of it. The story was probably good but I was too frustrated at the level design choices to care. Every hallway looks the same. There is very little freedom. You MUST complete the linear questline to do much of anything. It drove me nuts. Meanwhile in the base game you could wander around, completing segments of the main quest in any order or ignoring large swathes altogether and just doing the back door approach.

Solstheim feels a lot like Skyrim if it only had one town and one or two tiny villages. Wander around and you'll find some draugr tombs. The Skaal. Some werewolves. It feels like its somewhere between the openness of the the base game and the restrictiveness of Tribunal. Tribunal is literally summarized with a flowchart on the wiki. Bloodmoon is not nearly as linear but to move things forward you still need to complete specific sets of quests. So to me Bloodmoon felt like a pretty big downgrade.

[h2] Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) [/h2]



The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is an absolute gem that has stood the test of time. As a long-time fan of the franchise, I can confidently say that this game is a must-play for any RPG enthusiast.

Right from the start, Morrowind immerses you in its incredibly detailed and richly crafted world. The depth of lore and the intricate history of Vvardenfell, the island on which the game takes place, is truly remarkable. From the moment you step off the boat, you feel like you're part of an authentic living, breathing world.

What sets Morrowind apart from its successors, Oblivion and Skyrim, is its sheer complexity and depth. The game doesn't hold your hand, and you're left to explore and discover things on your own. This can be initially challenging for newcomers, but once you get the hang of it, you'll appreciate the freedom it offers.

The character creation and progression system is incredibly robust, allowing you to customize your character to an astonishing degree. You can choose from various races, classes, and birth signs, each influencing your gameplay in unique ways. Leveling up requires careful planning and decision-making, making each choice feel meaningful.

The quest design in Morrowind is superb, filled with multi-layered stories and interesting characters. The main questline is captivating, but the true joy lies in engaging with the numerous side quests and guilds. The writers have done an excellent job of creating a diverse range of scenarios that keep you engaged throughout your adventure.

The combat mechanics may feel a little rigid compared to modern games, but they are functional and still enjoyable. Spellcasting, weapon skills, and stealth gameplay are all well-implemented, providing various playstyles to suit your preferences.

While the graphics may seem outdated by today's standards, the artistic design and attention to detail make up for it. The environments are stunning, giving you a sense of awe and wonder as you explore the unique landscapes of Vvardenfell.

Furthermore, Morrowind has one of the best soundtracks in gaming history. The haunting melodies perfectly capture the atmosphere and elevate the overall experience.

For the time I can see why this is so revered. Large map (artificially), pure freedom, unique scenery that feels otherworldly, and a magic system that is epic. The main takeaway I have from this game is that Bethesda screwed up streamlining the magic, because nothing is funnier than levitating over enemies and poking at them with spears. The combat is actually fine, it makes sense that you suck shit at fighting at first. Even if I don't like this game, I still can see why others might TO AN EXTENT. When I hear people rave about how insane the decrease in quality is from Oblivion, I kinda roll my eyes and feel like the nostalgia glasses have been on tight. But this isn't about the other games, so back to Morrowind. 

Now for the bad.

The dialogue system SUCKS. It's like if they continued Daggerfall's system, but for some reason thought to make it more Wikipedia like. The hyperlink system was bad in Daggerfall, and it's bad here. I know they couldn't have added fully voiced, hyper interactive dialogue I know the story behind the development of this game. But even then, this is the best we could've got? Fallout 1 didn't have a lot of voice acting either, yet in that game you feel like you're speaking to not just characters but actual people. Here, everytime I meet a person it's like I'm reading the Wiki. 

The world is not that interesting. Yes it's alien, yes it has some pretty sights, and yeah it's by far the most unique map Bethesda ever had. But it's uniqueness isn't enough to make me like it even half as much as Oblivion or Skyrim. Let alone something like Fallout 3 which is one of my favorite game worlds. Vivec is a confusing mess. Balmora is fine. I actually really like the one with Skarr, even with those storms. But they're just cities, I don't really care about them. What I do really care about is every dungeon being the same exact thing. I know people hate Daggerfall's dungeons, but at least you actually felt like you was dungeon crawling. These ones are just boring, and I already know people would see this and say ""but realism, daggerfall made no sense at least in Morrowind they're realistic"" and to that I think it's fair. But this is the elder scrolls, not real life. The giant mushrooms, alien swamps, and ash mountains are kinda cool but again I'm not that crazy over them. 

The quests are really, really bad. This is actually a criticism I share with Daggerfall as well, in that game the quests were generally the same and you could actually get screwed over by bugs and not be able to finish it. But here, they work and all but it's just boring. They're fetch quests, but usually have you fetching items from places in the cities. And when you do get a dungeon, it'll be just another confusing Dwemer ruin that looks just like the other ones. The main quest though is way cooler than I thought it'd be, you're basically an agent which is cool. But the Mages Guild, Thieves Guild, and Fighters Guild SUCKS. I joined one of the Great Houses because I heard they're usually great, but it's the same shit there too. Imperial Legion? Same shit. Cults? Same shit. Cool assassin group? Same shit. This is one of those things that Oblivion wipes Morrowind on, at least in that game I can remember more than like 2 quests because they're usually interesting. And yeah I know there's hidden plots and more than meets the eye in a lot of these guilds, particular with some of the Great Houses and the cults. But that isn't enough to make me even remotely care.

There's more I could talk about, but really every single problem I've mentioned seemingly carries on to whatever else you'd want to discuss about the game. And since this is one of those Reddit games (not that being a reddit game means it sucks, just that the fandom is insane) I've seen people with any criticism be labeled as casuals or tik tok zoomers or whatever. And to that I say fine lol, I'll be a casual if it means I don't have to walk another 30 fucking minutes just to grab a Dwemer tube. Or make my way through Vivec's bullshit interior layout. As someone who wants to go through each of these games and rank them, I'd put this in the same boat as Skyrim but for different reasons. Play Daggerfall instead, it's free so you won't be giving any money to Zenimax and Todd Howard.",1698249172,1698249497,False,4,0,0.435589641332626343,0,True,False,False

This review's goal is not to say this game is worthless. It was one of the first open world games, but it certainly is to counter the claim that this is Bethesda's masterpiece.

Combat
It isn't good. You spam click with either magic or melee, then rest when you can. I rarely needed to buff myself, or even could as the inventory menu requires you to read 90% of the potions in your inventory to even know what you have. Some people say the attribute system is superior to Skyrim, it's not. Skyrim had a perk system that made you feel like you were getting stronger. This is spamming actions in order to increase skills. The main attributes feel like nothing, simplifying it into the Skyrim level up system was a major improvement.

Quest design
I never expected for the gameplay to be good, but I sure as hell got hyped up for the quests in this game. People say it's this and it's that, yada yada about old game design. Let me walk you through what every single Morrowind quest is like.
Go to quest giver - > find fetch item location from journal directions - > either the fetch item is in a dungeon (go clear it) or it's an NPC at which, that NPC will give you a dungeon or you can talk to them - > go back to quest giver
I have yet, in my 35 hours been given any meaningful decisions in quest. The closest I've gotten, is being able to rat on NPCs for doing crime. Which the only consequence is losing that NPC as a vendor if you rat on them. In these 35 hours I have laughed once at dialogue.

World design
The open areas are barren hell scapes in which you hold W for hours, inter sliced with clicking on random enemies with the worst AI I have seen. The cities are copy and paste hell scapes in which there are few quests, only centered around the main 'factions'. I put factions in airquotes because they hardly interact with eachother, in reality they are large fetch quest handout lines that at the end, you finally get access to a vendor that's identical to the one across the street.

Dialogue
Spam the blue highlighted buttons so the NPC exposits the quest in the most bland way ever, with zero stakes because again you are literally just a errandboy. You don't even have to read ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of what they say because you can just press j and know everything you need to. The Bethesda fanboy will claim that this is an improvement to quest markers, not realizing both are the same mindlessly uncritically following directions slop injected into RPGs for more playtime. Except, this is more of a time investment. You get use to it and it becomes braindead easy. It's not that the journal is harder, it's that it's a substantial increase in time investment for F tier quests.

This game isn't hard, it's incredibly easy. It's just that because of the era, they weren't able to fill the world so they added hours of mindless tedium. The Bethesda fanboys will of course say no, it's actually incredibly riveting gameplay doing the 30th mindless fetch quest so you can get a meaningless title in a faction. No your brain is just rotten if you don't enjoy doing 30 hrs of these fetch quests.

When I first played on Xbox, I loved this game and the main story became my favourite in the series. Do not judge my playtime on here as I have played a lot more on Xbox as of this moment.

Morrowind's outdated combat and graphics might frighten modern gamers, but it's a game that stands tall on it's own merits with it's classic uniqueness.

The world of Vvvardenfall is absolutely beautiful, the charm from the game comes from exploring a wondrous and odd land full of weird creatures and a landscape that just screams fantasy.

If the lore behind the Elder Scrolls is something you are interested in this is a must-play, with my favourite main story and setting in the series I can definitely recommend this game to those who love classic rpgs and Bethesda titles.  The lore behind the Nerevar and Dagoth Ur solidified my love for this game and settled Dagoth Ur at the top of my list of favourite video game antagonists.

The only other game I want to get a remake close to as much as this would be Fable 2, I believe Morrowind is a game I would absolutely love to revisit in the future, not that the games current state has aged badly but I would love for a modern audience to explore the world of Morrowind and its landscape.",1651790472,1697823807,True,2,0,0.531737744808197021,0,True,False,False

The island is dominated by the great volcano, Red Mountain. The island itself is named after the original Dwemeri name of Red Mountain, literally translating to ""City of the Strong Shield"".[2] It is characterized by arid wastes, rocky highlands and coastal wetlands filled with unusual and unique flora and fauna. Red Mountain’s lava flows, eruptions, and ash-fall cause Vvardenfell’s landscape to undergo a constant cycle of death and rebirth. The soil becomes greatly fertilized thanks to the volcanic activity, and new plants and fungi emerge from the cooling ashes. It also causes the island to expand as the lava hardens.[3]

Vvardenfell was initially inhabited by House Dagoth, the only Chimer clan to have their capital (Kogoruhn) on the island, as well as a kingdom of the Dwemer.[2][4] The corruption of Dagoth Ur’s Ash Blight would have a dramatic effect on the environment and its inhabitants. By the late Third Era, Vvardenfell was noticeably less vibrant, and Cliff Striders, Nix-Oxen, and Vvardvarks were wiped out.[5] During the Red Year of 4E 5, Vvardenfell was devastated after the Ministry of Truth crashed into the city of Vivec, causing Red Mountain to erupt. Most of the island was covered in ash, forcing much of the population to evacuate.[6]",1697556756,1697556756,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am not a Morrowboomer My first introduction to The Elder Scrolls was Skyrim, then Oblivion, then Morrowind. I plan to review the game in a critical fashion and lay out its strengths and flaws Also, I use minimal mods to enjoy a mostly vanilla experience. [url=https://modding-openmw.com/lists/i-heart-vanilla/] I Heart Vanilla [/url]

Morrowind is a game from another era in gaming. Its graphics are not what you would call realistic, but it was a huge step up from Daggerfall. It processes most things through dice rolls like a real TTRPG, like whether or not your sword swing lands, or if you cast your spells properly. These of course get better later on as you level up, but in the beginning it can be INFURIATING. The GUIs are very unique: even looting can be tedious. Leveling up is something you have to get used to. You get points and depending on how you use your skills, you get multipliers for those points to be spent in attributes. 

[h2] Vvardenfell [/h2]

Vvardenfell is an island filled to the brim with mystery, weirdness, monstrosities, and side quests. There is an incredible amount of content packed into this game. There are so many guilds and organizations the player can join, each with their own unique questline, plenty of random sidequests you simply find out on the road, and places to explore like Dwemer ruins and Daedric Shrines. Truth is, you'll never run out of things to do, including the main quest.

[h2] Different [/h2]

I did use the [url=https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Morrowind] uesp [/url] just to learn how to play this game and to help with a few quest, because it does not help you one bit. You're dropped off in Seyda Neen and that is it. But once you get the hang of how the game functions and keep in mind that things will get better as you increase your stats, you'll find that Morrowind is truly one of the best RPGs ever made.

[h2] Magic [/h2]

Magic in Morrowind, I think, is one of its strong suits. There are tons of different spells you can learn. But the best part is once you buy a spell, you can then make spells at certain vendors who will give you a host of options to choose from. You can make Self spells (they affect you), Target spells (aim and fire!) or Touch spells (get up close and personal!), and then you can select how long the spell lasts, and how effective it is. The game then generates the price for the spell, how much Magicka it consumes, and your chances of casting it properly. 

[h2] Melee Combat [/h2]

Once you have increased your stats, you'll find that stabbing in someone’s face with an ebony spear can be quite... relaxing. Just push through the tedium in the beginning. The melee combat is not the best by any means, but it is still fun and there are many different types of weapons. Something Skyrim did not do so well at. Including Long Blades, Short Blades, Blunt Weapons, Axes, Spears, Bows, and even Crossbows. Most of these have to be leveled up individually, so it's best to pick one or two of them in character creation.

[h2] Character Creation [/h2]

Another highpoint for Morrowind. If you fill out the papers in the beginning yourself, you can become a truly unique individual. By selecting skills to put in the Major category, you gain a ton of points in the beginning for those skills. The same goes for Minor skills, but to a lesser extent. Everything you don't pick is tossed into Misc. with only a paltry 5 points. Good thing Morrowind is good at this part, because it falls flat on player appearance. You pick a race, but you only have a few different heads, hairstyles, and faces to choose from. Sure this is not Skyrim or Oblivion with its sliders for infinite customization.  

[h3] Other [/h3]
[list]
    [*]Levitation, Water Walking and Water Breathing spells.
    [*]Vvardenfell is gigantic. There are so many things to explore outside of the cities, and quests to go on. 
    [*]The main quest is completely separate from everything else. You are not required to complete it outright. 
    [*]The game is very slow-paced. This can be a good or bad thing depending on your playstyle. If you love really digging into a game this is perfect. If you are looking for some instant gratification, this might not  be for you
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]

Morrowind is truly is a diamond in the modern rough. It is a labor of love, and you will, with patience, have a fantastic and memorable experience in this legendary title. I’ve avoided making too many comparisons to TES IV and V because it is a little unfair to do so as far as graphics go, but I believe Morrowind is the better RPG of all of them, while Skyrim is a more polished lite RPG. If you are a hardcore RPG lover, Morrowind is an ideal choice.

This was because I had eliminated the cave rat found in the bedroom, and there was only one rat. However, the quest giver behaved as if I hadn't accomplished anything.

Upon inspecting my journal more thoroughly, I later unearthed that there were more rats lurking in a separate room that was supposed to be located higher in the building.

In my experience, Oblivion and Skyrim quests of this nature would be completed in less than a minute. This is primarily because my strategy always involved sprinting towards the quest-marker or the NPC below the quest-marker.

Contrary to Morrowind, I believe it's impractical to play Skyrim with the quest-marker disabled. The reason being, game designers anticipate that players will have it enabled anyway, thus they don't bother incorporating written or verbal directions like those found in Morrowind.

...

For the record, I earnestly hope that The Elder Scrolls 6 will not merely be an extension of Skyrim, either in spirit or in scope. Furthermore, I anticipate its prompt release as the intervening time since Skyrim's debut has already doubled the period between the launches of Oblivion and Skyrim!

The worlds of Fallout and its less-than-stellar, Spore-themed spinoff have ceased to captivate me.

In my opinion, Bethesda should have prioritized the development of The Elder Scrolls 6 over Starfield. Even if The Elder Scrolls 6 ends up being a reimagining of Fallout 4 set in Tamriel, it would still offer a worthwhile experience, justifying the wait.

However, it is disheartening to acknowledge that Bethesda Game Studios and Bethesda Softworks have both long recognized the financial viability of producing 'blank slate' games over crafting more intricate experiences akin to Daggerfall or even Morrowind. It's concerning how much they rely on their fanbase to rectify game issues, particularly those of their own making.

On a side note, I am apprehensive that they might now focus on creating games that necessitate DLC to feel complete.

If TES6's release extends beyond the year 2030, then it would signify an unusually prolonged development period.

Should the base game prove to be merely a high-definition version of Skyrim with lesser scope than Starfield, and another lackluster storyline, it would indeed be a disappointment, especially for an ardent fan like myself.

Bethesda needs to seriously consider upgrading their infamous Creation Engine. It's about time it became stable enough to realistically render an entire city, rather than a mere microcosm of one. They are long past the point where excuses are acceptable!

Even if Bethesda's performance falls short, there will be modders who will adapt to their shortcomings. However, it's regrettable that Bethesda seems content with simply meeting the minimum standard by leaning on the efforts of modders, rather than striving for excellence.",1688327941,1696835861,True,1,0,0.500413715839385986,0,True,False,False

This game is a gem. I love Skyrim and Oblivion, but you don't realize how lackluster their writing is until you play this game. Morrowind reminds me a lot of Fallout: New Vegas- it feels like you're existing in a real world and talking to real people in a way that is difficult to capture in a lot of RPGs.

If you're on the fence, just do yourself a favor and try it out. If you're like me and used to modern games, you might have to mod it a ton until you get to the point where you're satisfied with gameplay and graphics, but the writing alone is so worth it.",1695138956,1695138956,True,2,0,0.520547926425933838,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- One of the first truly open world games that were good
- SO many games have ripped it off,should speak volumes
- Once you know, storing stuff at the one house that's not yours is cool, unless ya have the expansion, then ya get ya own house in skald village
- Voice acting and story, lots of time put into that
- Runs GREAT on steam, I've had less crashes than when I played it on xbox for sure
- Again, this set the bar, I wont keep going with the pros, play this game if you haven't, if you have, play it again

Cons:
- No controller support
- Missions can be a bit vague, side quests are very trivial
- Cliff racers, constantly, wherever you go not near a town, get used to THAT annoyance
- 95,000 dollar items, we'll give ya 2000.  Best fill up that room with glass junk

I mean again, this set the bar, I dont even need to write a review, it runs great, it's tons of fun, its a classic, I mean if you like this sort of game, you can't go wrong.

To not like it is fine, but people who say this game is bad are people who hate having to think while playing a video game. They create a character who isn't skilled in short blade, take the dagger from the census office, and then complain online that their character isn't killing anything with a weapon they have no skill in. If you saw someone playing Guitar Hero, and they were only pressing the fret buttons without strumming, and they complained that they kept failing the song, you would rightfully mock them for not playing the game right. This is directly analogous to Morrowind. Combat is extremely easy if you equip your character with a weapon they actually know how to use, you actually charge up your swings like you're supposed to, and you keep your character's fatigue up. If you refuse to engage with the game's systems though, of course you're going to fail. Simply learn how to play the game correctly, and the experience that will be opened to you is one that you'll never forget.

Skill issue sermon aside, there's not much I can say about the base game that hasn't already been said better than I could by dozens of other people (I highly recommend PatricianTV's brief retrospective), so instead I just wanna talk about the expansions for a second. If you've never played this game before, let me give you some very important information up front: Tribunal's main quest won't make sense if you haven't finished the main quest yet, and the enemies in both expansions will rip you a new butthole if your character isn't at least level 25-30. As for the actual content of these expansions, one of them is extremely mid and the other is one of the best expansions of all time. 

Tribunal seems cool on the surface; you go to the mainland of Morrowind and meet returning characters from Daggerfall, plus the two members of the titular trio of gods which are missing from the island of Vvardenfell. The city of Mournhold is beautiful, and there's some fun side quests on offer, such as the one where you join a stage production as an actor. You can also buy a pet scrib, which is an incredible feature which should be standard for every video game. However, the main quest of this expansion reeks. Literally. You'll spend 90% of it delving into the same sewer over and over. That sewer is the ""epic sized dungeon"" that the game's store page is talking about. Todd was real proud of that sewer. The finale of the main quest is cool though, I really really like Sotha Sil's design. It's a shame he plays such a small role in the story, though.

Now Bloodmoon, on the other hand, kicks ass. If you've played Skyrim you're likely already acquainted with the isle of Solstheim, and it's super cozy to visit in Morrowind. I love the alien landscape of Vvardenfell, but after more than 100 hours, it was bliss to see snow, pine trees, and wolves. Having played so much Skyrim myself, it felt like returning home, which is very appropriate since my character was a nord. What about the actual content on the island though? It's great. You actually have two main quests to play through in Bloodmoon. In one of them, you meet the Skaal tribe, you have a chance to either become a werewolf or join the fight against them, and you eventually come face to face with a daedric prince. In the other questline, you join the East Empire Company, and help steer the development of the brand new colony of Raven Rock. That would already be really cool when the game came out in 2003, but it's awesome when you've already played Skyrim and seen the colony still thriving 200+ years later. I can't speak highly enough about Bloodmoon.",1694406043,1694406043,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am a diehard fan of this game out of all the Elder Scrolls games. I actually got into Morrowind just a few years after its initial release thanks to being allowed to watch over my fathers shoulder while he was playing the game and owned the CD version of it ever since I got my first computer.

It's no modern game by any means and it's complex on a mechanical level. It will look ugly compared to modern game aesthetics and will give you a rough start if you don't know what you're doing. But.

It's one of the few games where you really feel like you've earned your win at the end. No quest-markers, no scaling difficulty(for the most part). Just you, your journal and quest log and the world to explore, learn from and conquer. 

The setting is alien enough to get you interested, but not alien enough for you to feel really lost in it unless you are spoon-fed explanations. Unraveling any mysteries is more fun than chore. 

The music is fitting, immersive and calming to a degree that can make you actually want to roleplay your character. They even reused it later in the series in 2012 DLC. That's how good it is.

One plays this game for the world and exploration, and these are executed just fine. Dialogues are almost all text, and navigating blocks of description and simple dialogue trees is par the course. Most of the writing is interesting, with humor and heart to it. 
Skyrim did combat better, but Morrowind wins at atmosphere and world building. The story is a bit scattershot, but the real fun is in some of the guilds, and the side quests. This game has solid expansions with plenty of content. 
Graphics are decent for the time, and the world is very large with plenty to discover. The graphics don't hold up that well, but I like the visual style. It is very alien and out there. 

I recommend modding the game, to bring it closer to expected QoL in 202X.

I'll start off by saying if you went back down the pipeline from Skyrim to Morrowind and you never played Morrowind before, you might have a bad experience with this game. Morrowind is old, like really old by the standards of today. The combat is clunky, characters walk funny and you actually have to read the dialog. But if you can look past all of this, this game is a great experience. I used a program called OpenMW to update the game a bit, to be able to play in 1980 x 1080 resolution and to stop the game from crashing when you alt tab out of the game. A must get program for the game, highly recommended.

Morrowind is a game I tried to play back in high school, this was around 2007. The graphics does not bother me, but the journal in this game is very annoying. It kinda tells you where to go and you literally have to keep notes on a piece of paper with you as you play, as its easier than bothering with the journal. Back then we did not really had internet to just do a Google search, you had the play the game the old way. I got far with the game but never finished it. I have now finally finished the game last month and I regret not doing it sooner. Once your combat skill get to around 50 and you can actually reliably hit enemies, the game feels exactly like Oblivion or Skyrim. The story is really fun and there is plenty to see and explore. Another old school thing is the fast travel in this game is not like Oblivion or Skyrim, here you have to rely on smaller transport across Morrowind and just walk around on foot to get to places. I'll admit I followed a guide as it is easier then fumbling around with the journal. Exploring cities was really great for me to do, new people to meet and places to experience. Except the City of Vivec - screw that place. You gonna spend many hours there trying to find your way, let alone find the correct person you need to talk to.

This is an extremely fun game to play. Sure there are mods out there to improve the graphics and make the game feel more like a modern experience, but that really takes away from Morrowind if you do so in my opinion. Give this game a try, a real good and honest try and do not quit if you die to a mudcrab in the first city. The experience across the barren lands of Morrowind is one you should experience if you love the Elder Scrolls game. This is a game from a different time, always remember that when you play it.

[b]Morrowind[/b]
[list]
[*]A huge-gigantic world to explore, all sorts of places to visit, starting with major cities like Balmora, Vivec, Ald-Ruhn, Sadrith Mora etc, each having their own-different city designs which is the best thing about it.
[*]All the different 50+ port cities and small-settlements with lots of lots of different characters with mostly being involved in a quest.
[*]200+ different caves and mini-dungeons to polish your skills against the outcasts and enemies and less-valued yet high in quantity loot items to establish your economy. For a starter this is the best place to take experience of Morrowind.
[*]100+ dungeons and enemy-group lairs with a series of tougher enemies and big loot in terms of value, like Ancient Dwarven Settlements, different Enemy Bases etc.
[*]If you are an explorer kind of person then Morrowind is best for you as you can travel all sorts of places with roads and pathways which are beautifully designed.
[*]A huge set of different armory for all different parts of body armor, be it helms (helmets), cuirasses, left and right gauntlets, greaves, boots, pauldrons, bracers. Also armory differ on the basis of heavyness - light armor, medium armor, heavy armor.
- Heavy Armor being the best armor, but took too much space due to which you might not able to store many things.
- Light Armor being the weakest sort of armor but took very less space so if you are a farming type or collector type of guy then you should use this type of armor as the additional space can be used to store or collect valuable or unique items.
- Medium Armor, mostly being used by NPCs, so all the unique items are available in Heavy (almost 60-70%) and Light (20-30%) with some exceptions being available in Medium (1-2%).
[*]A huge set of Weaponry for all type of gamers, 
- if you are a sword type person then you can use Long-Swords (One-Handed, Two-Handed), Short-Swords, 
- if you prefer ranged weapons you can go with Bows, Crossbows, Throwing-Knives, Throwing-Stars, Throwing-Darts etc,
- if you are a heavy weapon type guy you can go with Battleaxes and Blunt Weapons (Hammers, Maces, etc), 
- if you don't want to use any weapons then Morrowind features a Hand-to-Hand combat type as well.
[*]Morrowind also contains a huge amount of Flora and Fauna, though they are not very visually attractive. The beasts and animals can be skinned to make different items and gear for you, the flora can be used to make potions
[*]Potions and Intakes. Morrowind contains a huge variety of potions that gives you all different sort of abilities like levitation, invisibility, ranged damage abilities like fireballs, shockballs or lightning strikes etc. These potions are divided into different categories: Exclusive being the best of the class and Bargain being the most non-useful, why non-useful because their effects only lasts 5 seconds and exclusives effects lasted 60 seconds. There's another category - Spoiled, as the name suggests, it gives negative effect on the consumer.
[*]Enchantments and Magic. Morrowind contains different sort of Enchantments and Magical Abilities which are highly beneficial when facing a tough opponent or visiting some unknown place which is very hard to reach for example you can easily travel above the mountains and hard-to-cover terrains using levitation spells or abilities which you can either get using some magical spell, or some potion or some magical scroll or some enchanted item. Morrowind also features different types of magic initialization methods, 
- using scrolls and potions that can only be used 1-time only, so you might need multiple of them. And if you ran out of them at some important place then you either returns to some nearby settlement to buy some or find some other (super-hard) method to achieve whatever you are trying to achieve, 
- using enchanted items, these can be used unlimited times, given that you use them wisely, otherwise they will eventually ran-out of magic and thus needs time to regenerate the magical energy or you find a constant effect item (super-hard to find).
If you have an item which is not enchanted then you can convert that item into enchanted item as well given that your enchantment skill is very-high level or you can find the right NPC of which could provide you the enchantment service for your preferred ability.
[*]Skills. Skills in Morrowind is the most important thing, just like all the other games features. If you are trying to do something that lies under a specific skillset in which you are not good at then the possibility of it being successful is equals to the level that skill is for you. So for example if you are trying to attack using a Long-Sword and let's say your Long-Sword skill is at 50th level then there are 50-50 chances that your first sword attack will be a successful strike to enemy.
[*]Factions. Morrowind features a huge number of different Factions and Groups which you can join. Each of these groups have their own separate storyline which can easily took 1-2 weeks to complete. There are around 30+ different factions and groups in morrowind and around 20+ are joinable and the rest which you can't join, you will encounter them in different quests.
[*]Though Morrowind have comparatively a short storyline but if you are to join all the possible and joinable faction and groups, considering you don't f'ed up the concurrent-joining-conflicts and not mistakenly activate some random glitches your 95% time will be invested in completing or preparing for those quests and work exploration.
[*]Vast amount of Reading Material available for you to read. There are too many books, scrolls (non-magical), pages etc available to read by the player which provides all sort of information, historical aspects of Morrowind, stories, novels, plays (a certain quest, one of the best), some also providing reference to the past releases in the TES Franchise etc.
[*]BGM, one of the best game with the Background Music
[*] Different Sort of Useless yet Antique Material.

The best part about Morrowind is it's story, when you reach the endgame and you got to know the truth for both Morrowind and Expansions, it's quite surprising for you. Though the story campaigns are quite small.
Time it take to Beat the Game.
Main Story Only -

Main Story and Expansions Only -

I have only completed the Main Story, Expansions, all the side quests, all the factions quests, and travelling to all locations of Morrowind, Mournhold and Solstheim. The only thing which I haven't done is visiting each and every dungeon one-by-one to explore what's in them and loot if there's any important stuff present their. If I were to do that too, which is truly the most time-consuming task, it would easily took me 600+ hours. I have only explored only 10-20% dungeons only and that only took me 374 hours, so it's quite a large one",1693143531,1693143656,True,3,0,0.529085874557495117,0,True,False,False

The realm of Morrowind in which this game takes place is truly unique and any true fantasy or RPG fan would appreciate the amount of care and detail put into the characters, lore, and plot of this game.

Sure, its graphics and combat system are now terribly dated. I recommend looking up one of the many overhaul mods to help give those aspects of the game a facelift (although some purists might even prefer the game unadorned).

Regardless, those of you who appreciate the type of things I mentioned above will not be disappointed. Hopefully, this game will continue to be remembered for all it did for the RPG genre in general and the Elder Scrolls series in particular well into the future. 10/10",1334358337,1693135485,True,1,0,0.513422846794128418,0,True,False,False

If this problem occurs, simply browse local files, backup saves to an external folder, and leave only one or two of the most recent saves to continue with your game.

With that out of the way, the game itself is absolutely fantastic. I've played Oblivion and Skyrim (IV and V in the same franchise), and Morrowind has the best writing of the three games in my opinion. While it's not fully voice acted, the text-box version of the conversations held with NPCs means that you can scroll up and down to see previous dialogue instead of asking them to repeat something. And the journaling system means that you are able to find most of the dialogue even while you're away from an NPC by just scrolling through the alphabetized list of topics. The world is beautiful even for having 2002 graphics, and the music is amazing. If the gameplay gets to be too tough, there is a very forgiving difficulty slider option in the pause menu. Above all else, the class system is extremely customizable with things like unlimited training (not found in Oblivion or Skyrim) and spellmaking (found in Oblivion but not in Skyrim). The factions have ranks that actually mean something with more and more services becoming available and more and more equipment rewards. And even though fast travel is not an option, the Mark/Recall system paired with two kinds of Intervention (teleportation) allow for quick escape from a rough situation. And between cities, Mage Guild teleportation combined with boat and silt strider travel for a very low gold piece cost lets you avoid most hostile encounters that you'd find in the wilderness. It's not as accessible as Skyrim or even Oblivion, but Morrowind's complexity is quite beautiful once you learn all of its facets. And if you can master the mechanics, the protagonist of Morrowind will become even more powerful than the Hero of Kvatch or the Last Dragonborn.",1594906256,1693089003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As many of you may know, Morrowind was released for the Xbox and PC on May 1st, 2002 (Wikipedia, 2023). Morrowind was a hit release - taking both the gaming and pleasure markets by storm. While the open-world RPG initially seemed innocent in its pursuit to give gamers a truly immersive and fun experience, free of the constraints of reality, I fear the long-term effects it could have on a healthy capitalist society were improperly studied at the time. 

Morrowind was known for many innovations in the world of virtual reality, including: A truly free open world that the player could leave their mark on, faction dynamics and high-emotional political situations, a new take on a mystical fantasy, and of course, the irresistible, curvey, high-definition NPC and player models - specifically, the character Dagoth Ur, the man who ruined my relationship with my wife.

Dagoth Ur is the overarching antagonist of Morrowind and many other Elder Scrolls titles. His goal in Morrowind was to take over the continent, by dominating, binding, enslaving and otherwise forcing the populous into submission (UESP 2023, ""File:MW-creature-Dagoth-Ur""). His goals as a villain, however, have attracted the (often intimate) attention of many unknowing Morrowind players, including myself. Dagoth Ur promises, through dreams that your character experiences, a wedding, hot corpse erotica, your ascension to his ash-vampire status (and the perfect, sun-reflecting sparkly skin that comes with it), and the domination of your character. 

Believing his promises, I set out on a journey not to defeat Dagoth Ur, but to side with him, imagining that this game's truly unique and innovative open-world dynamics would allow me to do so. What I did not expect was to watch the most intense, passionate, fiery intercourse between Dagoth Ur and my player character that I have ever seen. This may seem relatively normal to the modern-day reader, however recent studies have been conducted into the effect that these fantasy relationships may have on one's performance in the bedroom. In my case, I was not prepared when I set out to meet my current wife, for a body completely devoid of the rough, low-rendered edges that I had come to expect. This has lead to much pain for both of us, as my I simply cannot seem to manage to stay ""active"" in the bedroom without such stimulation. At one point, I tried wearing a VR headset, to envision my wife in the glory of the sharmat Dagoth Ur, however even being deprived of his touch was enough to send me into a depressive spiral. 

In conclusion, Morrowind has ruined my life. My wife is filing for divorce due to my unrealistic expectations that were FORCED upon me by the 2001 title Morrowind. If any accurate Dagoth Ur cosplayers wish to contact me for further relations, my lawyer is on standby. 10/10 I love this game.",1692874339,1692874339,False,5,17,0.485871672630310059,0,True,False,False

If I finish it I will likely update this review and say more about it. In 20 hours of game time in Morrowind I feel like I have accomplished shockingly little. If I were to say one thing and only one thing about this game it is that it does NOT respect your time. There are so many mechanics in Morrowind that drag the experience down and slow the pacing of the game and I mean that literally. I usually wait until I have either finished a game or given up on it before writing a review but in this case I have to give my thoughts on it as soon as possible. The reason being I have never ever played a game like Morrowind before. A game that misses the mark so incredibly and so frequently.  I also do not wish to progress considerably further into the game only for my experience to suddenly get better and for my demeanour to change and potentially go easier on the game and some of the unforgivable gaming crimes it commits. What do I mean by that? Well, Morrowind lacks some of the most basic and fundamental quality of life features in a video game. This has got to be the most egregious example I've ever seen. If you are considering playing this, please do yourself a favour and skip this one OR look up guides on what classes to use and how to get the most overpowered build and gear early on in the game. Otherwise, you are going to have a REALLY rough time with this. I am one such player. I have never played this before and decided to go in more or less completely blind. I wish I didn't. This game without any exaggeration does not tell you ANYTHING. It doesn't have a tutorial of any kind. It just plops you into the game world and expects you to figure everything out yourself. I know a lot of people may enjoy figuring things out for themselves but when that entails literal HOURS of walking around not knowing what the hell to do, it not only becomes incredibly frustrating but also boring. Depending on the race you choose, in my case being Altmer, your movement speed will vary. I was never expecting to choose a race and move at a snails pace but that's what you get and that is my biggest problem with the game by far. Even above the RNG combat. The walk and ""run"" speed is so awful and wastes SO MUCH time. Of the 10 or so quests I've done (yes, in 20 hours I've only managed to complete around 10 of the quests in the game) most of them seem to be fetch quests and the writing is incredibly bland not to mention the fact that there is little to no dialogue in the game itself. The first 2 characters do have dialogue but these fuckers were so lazy that all ""dialogue"" is just text box after text box that you have to read yourself. The quests aren't particularly interesting. Combat is a godawful mess and is the worst I've ever seen because it isn't buggy or broken or anything. The clunky aspect is how they WANTED it to play out. Either way, I'm very unimpressed by Morrowind and its lacklustre mechanics, awful pacing due to how slow you move, completely RNG based combat and lack of any guide on where to go, what to do, where each location is and so on. Stay away. I hope I can update this review and say something more positive in 50 - 100 more hours of playtime, but just know that if you are like me and plan on playing through this dumpster fire blindly then you are going to be left with a feeling of suicide by the end of each and every play session. Seriously, if you want to play this, look anything that's even slightly unfamiliar up.
UPDATE: 
Almost 10 extra hours and to be honest things haven't gotten much better for me. I've reached an area called Vivec which is so large and complicated that it honestly has me asking whether I can even be asked to go through the trouble of trying to remember the layout. I've hardly been doing any combat as I've just been trying to figure out where to go and whilst the game does have a sort of quest tracker it is very unintuitive. So many quests have required me to steal something whilst I don't have adequate points into the sneak skill so stealing things fails more or less 100% of the time. So at least 6 or so quests I just flat out can't complete and I've even given up on doing it blind, looked it up and there really are no other solutions. Certain quests are bugged and won't progress for example a quest where I have to convince or force an Argonian to stop providing magical services without being a part of the mages guild and when I talk to him there is out right no way to progress as his dialogue just awkwardly stops and has no way of furthering the quest. Two quests involved me having to escort someone somewhere and they wouldn't stop following me until I finished their quests. Now the world being too large and obviously no quest marker I had no idea where to take them and they followed me around and would engage enemies in combat and one of them died to the enemies and the other I accidentally attacked during combat with another enemy (in case you can't tell the combat is VERY awkward) and then he became aggressive towards me forcing me to kill him. The worst part is that after this his quest didn't fail, or complete or disappear. It's still in my quest ""journal"" without anyway of getting rid of it and acts like he is still alive and following me. Honestly, there are so many other problems I could list but I'd need to talk for hours to list them all. The only thing to really consider is that this game is ultimately a waste of your time and for the amount of time you do play it, you will get nothing done. Now, I am uncertain what I am going to do going forward. Either 1. I keep playing and trudging through it and MAYBE it gets better (very unlikely to do this) or 2. I mod the shit out of it or use console commands to make myself not only move a lot faster and combat to be a joke at least to see the story and DLC (I may do this to at least get my moneys worth) or 3. I move on to Oblivion which I have played a tiny bit before and was a much better experience than this horseshit. In the end, Morrowind is a fucking crapsack of awful, blatantly disrespectful design decisions that not even a sadistic serial killer would put into a video game. I get it, it's old but when people say things like ""oh, people back then were built different"" and ""oh, git gud, you're such a casual"" I ask myself whether people ""back then"" seasoned their soup with stomach acids or that they made milkshakes with their own fecal matter. Did ""people back then"" just enjoy pain, are they all masochists? I fail to understand how standards were so different back then that rancid dogshit like Morrowind was given a pass and is still somehow seen as one of the best games ever made. Are there some good aspects to this game? No. Is it fun? No. Does it respect your time. FUCK NO. Fuck this game, 2/10.

	What to say... Well I could start by saying its possibly my favorite Elder Scrolls game. For those of you not in the know of what the Elder Scrolls series is, it's an RPG series started in March 1994 with The Elder Scrolls I: Arena.

	What you do in the  game is your choice, whether you want to be an assassin who's good with heavy armor, a straight up tank, a noble adventuring mage, etc.. The goal of the series is to make you feel immersed in another universe, play another life. Now the series started to go downhill with their spin-offs falling flat. and it wasn't looking good for Bethesda. So they put  ol' Todd Howard in the lead for the development of Morrowind. Now Toddy boy, he figured if it might be their last game they might as well go out with a bang or try to revive the series (at least that's what I think) and had the team work on Morrowind and put their all into it. Of course, this worked tremendously.

	Now enough history, lets get back into the review shall we? Hmmm... where was I? Oh yes! I remember now, favorite elder scrolls game blah blah blah no one cares. Now let me tell why this is.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]	[b]1. Quests.[/b] The game is rich with quests that could take you weeks or more to complete and lots of detail and places that can take you months to see. The amount of NPCs is astonishing (even though the dialog might not always be too interesting or unique), and all of them are individually named with the exception of the re-spawning guards or creatures, which is awesome and immersive.

[*]	[b]2. Openess.[/b] The openess is impressive even with today's standards. You can go to any part of the map, whether it's in the ocean, or some mountain, or castle, or whatever, you can go there at any point in the game (though it's easier to do with a levitate potion or spell). You can start a new character and right after you finish the quick character creation/tutorial bit you can go where ever you want! No need for the  main quest when you've got exploring to do!

[*]	[b]3. Map.[/b] The map size is huge (though not the biggest by any means, it's 16 km2 or 6.17 m2), it will take some time for you to fill your map. You could be walking for an hour thinking you've made a lot of progress, but when you look at your map you see you only discovered a small percentage of the world. Better walk a few more hours huh?

[*]	[b]4. Lore.[/b] This game has a lot of lore, from abandoned fortresses, to extinct races, to gods, to a guide about the Fishy Stick, and much more. Since this is in the TES series, if there's a part of the lore you can't find any information to, odds are there's something about it on the wikis. It's full of history, and you're also, in a sense, creating some of it by being the [spoiler]reincarnation of the Nerevarine[/spoiler]. Wanna learn some of the lore? You can either read one of the many books, talk to NPCs, go questing, stumble on it by accident, or by discovering and learning it by some other means.
[/list]
	Now I could keep going with this review praising this game but there really is no point. There are very few cons, but I'll name a couple and they won't be of much significance I can assure you.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]	[b]1. Learning curve.[/b] Steep learning curve for new players, trust me. If you're transitioning from a game like Skyrim then you're in for a surprise. Welcome to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind - Prepare to Die Edition! But don't worry, you'll learn sooner or later, just keep practicing and you'll get it.

[*]	[b]2. Lack of dialog.[/b] You could talk to 20 NPCs with the same things to say. This can get a little boring looking for quests or an overall interesting NPC. It's not really a big deal, it's just a minor thing. Although you can just download the LGNPCs (Less Generic NPCs) mod, though it's still in development. 
[i](The [url=http://lgnpc.org/home]LGNPC[/url] homepage.)[/i]

[*]	[b]3. View distance.[/b] The view distance is terrible. Now I know this game came out in 2002 but the game is made to put the entire view distance rendering on the CPU. Now I'm going to be honest, I'm not sure if most games from that time period do that but I doubt it. Bethesda just didn't optimize it very well. Though it does help make the map seem larger than it is, so perhaps some people like the view distance. Whatever I guess, it's realistic right? Seriously, who can see more then 50 feet ahead of themselves?
[i](Use [url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/morrgraphext/]MGE[/url] to increase view distance.)[/i]
[/list]
[h1]Final[/h1]

	Anyway, this game is amazing, and I don't know what it is about it but its more open than the newer Elder Scrolls (at least it feels that way to me). While it may be difficult to get into or just difficult, odds are it's going to be that way for a while with new players. But after some hard work, perseverance, and maybe a little help from the UESP, you will find the game becomes a bit easier and you will be rewarded for your efforts in one way or another. It's filled with lore, easter eggs, and many quests, you won't be discovering everything anytime soon.

	Also, if you'd like a more stable, cross platform experience for this game, I would highly recommend [url=https://openmw.org/]OpenMW[/url]. OpenMW is an open source engine that can be used to play Morrowind instead of the vanilla engine. It's very simple and easy to use, continually receiving support and updates, is open source, cross platform, and just overall a better experience than playing with the vanilla Morrowind game engine. It also enables an increased view distance, and if your computer is powerful enough, you could even set the view distance high enough to see the entire map. It doesn't contain any of the game files (of course), so you will need to download Morrowind. Seriously, highly recommended.

	I guess that will conclude this ""short"" review. And to all you new comers, have a Fishy Stick! I know you would like to keep reading this ""amazing"" review but I gotta go. This is me signing off, see ya!

 The gameplay was awesome, the soundtrack was Ocarina of Time level, and the quests, oh my god. The quests were awesome, and just exploring the island was fantastic!

And Solstheim, oh my god... I'll never forget playing Bloodmoon, the best DLC I've ever played, bar none!
I will never forget exploring Solstheim, and the feeling of eerie dread in those woods and tombs! Seeing the progress the settlement made, was superb too, unlike anything I've ever seen in a game. Also the storyline is fantastic, and really really atmospheric! I keep remembering patrolling the woods with the guardsmen of the fort and our torches. Words cannot explain.

Bethesda's magnum opus, released in 2002, continues to capture my imagination with its sprawling world, intricate lore, and non-linear storytelling that have kept me enthralled from day one.

Vvardenfell, the game's setting, is a fantastical land brimming with wonder and mystery. The towering mushroom forests, ash-covered plains, and otherworldly architecture create a sense of place that feels both alien and strangely alluring. Over countless hours, I've embarked on endless expeditions, from the bustling streets of Balmora to the serene shores of Seyda Neen, unearthing hidden stories and secret corners that speak to the game's meticulous attention to detail.

What's truly remarkable is how Morrowind thrives on player agency, allowing me to shape my own destiny. While the main quest looms in the distance, I've been captivated by the wealth of side quests, guilds, and factions that beckon me in every direction. With each decision I make and each path I choose, the game evolves, ensuring that my experience is uniquely my own.

Character progression in Morrowind is a gratifying exercise in patience and strategy. The leveling system, which rewards practice and usage, has encouraged me to hone my skills organically, making each step of my character's journey a testament to my dedication. This personalized growth has imbued a strong sense of attachment to my virtual alter ego.

The lore of Morrowind is like a treasure trove waiting to be discovered. Conversations with NPCs, in-game books, and environmental details contribute to a rich tapestry of history, mythology, and politics that add depth to the experience. The main quest, while intriguing, is only a small part of the broader narrative that unfurls around me, and I revel in the opportunity to unravel its layers at my own pace.

Combat and challenges have been a source of both frustration and gratification. Morrowind's combat system is not for the faint of heart, demanding tactical thinking and perseverance. Yet, every victory, every hard-earned level-up, has brought an unparalleled sense of accomplishment, as if I'm truly growing into the role of a capable adventurer.

The fact that I've spent over 100 hours in Morrowind without completing the main quest is a testament to its grandeur and complexity. The world of Vvardenfell is an intricate web of stories, interactions, and choices that have woven together to create a deeply personal narrative. As I continue to lose myself in this immersive odyssey, I can't help but appreciate the lasting impact Morrowind has had on the RPG genre and my own gaming journey.

In conclusion, Morrowind is not just a game—it's a boundless realm of discovery and self-expression that welcomes players to explore, experiment, and immerse themselves in a world unlike any other. With over 100 hours invested and the main quest still ahead, I'm a testament to the game's capacity to captivate and inspire, offering an experience that transcends time and leaves an indelible mark on those who dare to venture into its depths.",1692515222,1692515222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is set in the Third Era and chronologically precedes the Oblivion saga. The game has been launched in 2002 but after 20 years, it does not feel the age. It perfectly represents the essence of an open world and perfectly adapts RPG mechanics to a single player experience that you can play in the way you like. This is in fact the motto of Bethesda and The Elders Scrolls. The game itself can be seen as a container (not to be mistaken for a sandbox) with quests, NPCs, guilds and factions each one interconnected with the others in a different way. To play the game and finish it you do not have any obligation to follow any predetermined path. You can simply explore the world, adventure, become stronger and finally defeat the big enemy (if you are able to understand who he/she is 😊 ) or you can follow one of the multiple questline you have available to forge your destiny.
The total freedom that Morrowind gives you can easily be seen also in the implemented class system. Your character will evolve and level up by practicing the main skills that are specific to your class but you are totally free to improve any other skill that you feel interested in. Skills improve with utilization, so if you want your character to improve in a specific area you simply have to continue using that skill.
On RPG side, Morrowind is in my opinion by far the one that better captures the essence of a pen & paper role playing game. Belonging to a generation where the quest indicator had not yet been invented, you will have to note down all the information about a place to reach it. This means that you will have to pay attention to landmarks while adventuring to find where to go. 
The concept of quest giver itself can be quite different if you are used to modern RPG. In Morrowind you have two kind of quests: the ones that can be formally obtained by a quest giver and those that you’ll discover overhearing conversations and rumors. These quests, as in traditional p&p RPGs, won’t be immediately added to your quest journal since it will be up to you to: understand if the quest is real, decide if you want to deep dive into that mystery and complete it. Once you will begin progressing in the “overheard quests” and you will have verified that the rumor you heard is real then, you will see the entry on the quest journal.  
Playing Morrowind is therefore highly recommended if you are looking for a true RPG with a lot of lore, a lot to discover and infinite possibilities.
Just a warning, if you have never played to end of nineties or first years of 2000 RPG, in order to enjoy it you have to keep in mind some things:
1)	Do as you like. Do not restrain yourself from doing anything. Just face the consequences of your actions. As in every RPG, whatever you do will modify the context and the environment but there is always a way to move on and continue. Try to avoid reloading if you inadvertently killed someone important, you will surely find another way to proceed and will be much much fun.
2)	The concept of build and gear is not applicable to this game as you would expect in a modern RPG. You do not play to grind equipment, there are no XXX run (you replace XXX with gold, farm, etc..). You equip your character according to your feelings and your playstyle.
3)	Morrowind is axed on exploration, Lore, and discovery of the environment. Sometimes the biggest reward of a quest is not the final prize but all the fragments of history that you learn doing it. 
4)	Read, read, read. Read everything, read books, and lose yourself in the lore.
5)	Take notes: Morrowind belongs to old school RPG where you were supposed to take some notes on the side to remember important facts, riddles, etc.
6)	Solving quests will not make you level by itself. You will have to use your favorite skills to progress.
Since the game has more than 20 years I recommend to play it using at least the OpenMW (you can google for it) engine. This engine is a user friendly tool that will help you to run this beautiful game on modern machines without compatibility issues.
To conclude, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to have a taste of what could be considered one of the best RPG of all times.

If you're like me, you likely played this back when it was first released (or sometime around then, anyway), and may just be grabbing it for the nostalgia. I always loved the way your stat progression made such a large difference. That was my favorite aspect, which wasn't quite as prevalent in future Elder Scrolls games. I always loved leaping across Belmora in two hops after getting my acrobatics maxed out.
Well, in that time, games and technology have changed quite a bit, and some functions and limitations feel clumsy. And that's why I recommend grabbing those two mods.

Now, in 2023, playing this game for the very first time, I understand why the Elder Scrolls has the legacy it does, and why people still play this game and make memes about it 20+ years later. 

This is one of the single deepest RPGs I have ever played, with a mind blowing amount of detail (for the time). It's a little slow to get into at first, easy for new players to use weapons they didn't major and minor in, make a slow character who misses all the time etc---but honestly, new RPGs are missing this level of D&D style stat systems.

It's the little things like making the player question the motives of various faction members without outwardly spelling it out for you, which impacts other factions and the Nerevarine in a believable way. Some quests in Oblivion (especially the Dark Brotherhood questline) do this well too, but Morrowind's base game consistently does this across most factions. 

Another thing that I loved was just how well-written Vivec and and Dagoth-Ur were. They felt so believable, and even relatable, even in Dagoth-Ur's case. Both of them felt like genuine, multifaceted statesmen that had well-thought out intentions, plans, and motives, instead of the one-dimensional antagonists and supporting characters we usually see in the sequels. 

Unfortunately, Bloodmoon and Tribunal do not share the same level of quality that the base game's writing and world has. Bloodmoon has very uninspired dungeon designs compared to the base game, and is significantly more linear and predictable, though it isn't bad by any means. It just doesn't hold up to the passion project that was the base game. 

Tribunal, on the other hand, felt like an entirely different Bethesda game; virtually all of the quests were a slog to go though due to the painfully boring and large dungeon areas (especially the sewer systems, but also the end game area which I don't want to spoil the nature of), and the enemies being so high-level and unvaried made it even more tedious. The writing and voice acting for Tribunal was also a far cry from the quality of the rest of the game, and genuinely felt like the weaker parts of Oblivion or Skyrim. On top of all that, Tribunal feels very empty, being so large, yet having so few people in it, as opposed to the city of Vivec. This entire expansion feels so rushed, which is unfortunate given how important Mournhold is to Morrowind's story.

Despite the jankiness of Morrowind and the flaws of its expansions, the majority of it is a flawed masterpiece, and is well worth the price. If you can get past the clunkiness of the game, it is well worth the money, as it arguably the best game Bethesda has ever developed in terms of story and worldbuilding.",1691943594,1691943594,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
22320,76635549,76561198063797852,314,114,9224,0,6576,1707712456,"I have had all the add-ons since they became available nearly 2 decades ago, so I cannot speak to the base game. I immediately re-acquired them here, too. The game runs well. Periodically, it doesn't start-up correctly. Close it and re-open it. Also, do not try to optimize performance by opening the task manager. It will crash. I've not had any other issues with the game. I'm running Win 8.1. 

The game is a lot of fun and has a flexibility that other games of the era do not, and yet not having a proper class system feels like it limits it in other ways. You create a character. You are a prisoner to start with, but soon freed. You will choose your sex, race, birth-sign, and whatnot at that point. These will effect various aspects of the game. Well, your sex won't, but the rest do. 

After that, it's a free-play system. You aren't required to do one thing after the other after the other. You can even run around exploring. You will level-up when enough of your abilities have increased. At that point, you will choose to increase your attributes, such as personality, strength, intelligence, etc. There is an xn next to some of them. This means 1 point times n. If you continue raising your skills, you increase the bonus for the associated attribute, HOWEVER, the bonus applies to the upcoming level-up, not the next one. You will shorten the amount of skill increases that you need to attain the next level. 

So, for example, if you can level-up, but you continue to increase your Axe skill, when you level-up, you will have an increased strength bonus. However, you will need to increase less skills for the next level-up, thus depriving yourself of bonuses at that point.

There are a variety of cool weapons and armor to acquire. The armor rating increases with your stats. Your level is by and large irrelevant. You have a reputation, which will increase as you advance in either one of the guilds or one of the 3 Great Houses. They correspond roughly to the three classes. There is a mod available to allow you to join all 3 Houses. Your House will eventually let you build a stronghold. There are also mods available to buy houses. You will likely enjoy acquiring things and decorating your home, although decoration in Morrowind is a pain-in-the-rumproast.

Be carerful who you kill. Do not kill people or attack them, unless they attack you. Or do, then you can experience going back to prison. You are let out quickly and often must pay a fine, but I believe your reputation takes a hit. Your reputation, race, and affiliations determine the starting attitude of NPCs toward your character. 

You can focus on being a fighter, thief, or mage, but you can combine whatever abilities you find to be advantageous. If you lack too many skills from any class among your major and minor abilities, it can hinder your advancement in the corresponding guild. 

This is many hours of gaming fun. The controls take getting used to. Right click opens your inventory, or closes your inventory or open dialogs. E is jump. F is ready weapon. R is ready spell-casting. Q is constant walking. WASD are the directional movement controls. Shift is run. CTRL is sneak. Left click is attack. SPACE opens doors, chests, and initiates dialogue with NPCs, as well as closing dialogs from open chests and dialogs that contain dialogue initiated with NPCs. CAPS is constant run.

Note that the settings do not write to the .ini file in this version, so you will have to re-choose them every time you play. That was not the case with the original game. Trust me.

I really wanted to like it, I tried to play it several times in different ways, but I just cannot get much further than Balmora. The story intrigues me, but the gameplay is such a slog. I don't mind not having my hand held, but so many aspects of the gameplay aren't very intuitive and complicated too after having looked at guides, it just feels like a chore to get into everything. Dice rolls are just extremely frustrating in real-time combat, especially at the start of the game when your skills are still low. Walking speed also feels like crawling at the start. Having to open your journal to read directions to somewhere is immersive, sure, but not very fun when everything almost looks the same.

This game is the transition between old school dice rolls, skill checks, and systems that were put in place reminiscent of D&D. It is one of the last times in Elder Scrolls where you truly start as a nobody. Heck even when you become the ""chosen one"" it's because you force yourself to fit the description of the chosen one. If you choose to try Morrowind, try to enjoy it for what it is, a product of its time. Find a good guide on how to get started effectively so your time playing isn't painful. While some things are matched to your level, you can easily find places that don't care what level you are and will wreck you. Don't bother with min/maxing until you have played for a while and can enjoy it. My recommendation for the most enjoyment is go pure warrior/fighting class with the stats to match. It is the easiest to get started and probably the most fun. Magic is great in this game but takes a lot of patience (since magic doesn't regenerate over time in this game). I don't know.

It's only within the past few months that I've really come to appreciate the game, I cant place my finger on it but something about this game has really grown on me. However despite coming to love Morrowind, I do still think it has some problems.

It's not an easy game to get into, it plays awkwardly, it doesn't explain much, and there's no shame in using the wiki (seriously, that guy who claims he relies exclusively on the quest journal and people's directions is a lying bastard). 

The strength of Morrowind lies in its freedom in character building, and deeper dialogue, the lack of voice acting may be a turn off to some, but this allows the NPCs to say much more than they can in later games where storage limitations of audio keep dialogue length down. In Morrowind, the game will rarely outright tell you ""no"" when you try something cheesy. The spell building system is really only limited by your cash and your Mana. You can use the potion system to leap across huge swathes of the map. You can smack enemies so hard with your sword that they fly across the battlefield. 

The main turn offs for most people in Morrowind are the slow start, and lack of unlimited fast travel. To clarify the latter, there is fast travel, but only from set hubs to other set hubs, usually for a small fee. You aren't made to walk literally everywhere, this is a misconception. Secondly, you do start slow, but as you power up, moving around becomes easier and easier, and eventually you'll be faster than you could ever been in Oblivion or Skyrim.

The story and variety it offers are the best parts, and the music fills me with nostalgia. Some gameplay mechanics and graphics feel outdated or complex. One of the reasons for my long break was that I felt optimization of stats and skill-ups and custom classes felt like a must to be effective. I like numbers-go-up and stats but in a story-oriented role-playing-game constantly keeping tabs on my skill-ups and training a lot of skills outside of my chosen class killed the fun for me, especially when I'm not planning to create a munchkin. I then decided to create more balanced characters such as a warrior who has a birthsign with healing spell and may use a summoning scroll or an area damage scroll if the situation is dire. This made playing the game so much more enjoyable. I'll still keep tabs on my most important skills and attributes but I don't need to count everything.

The conflict between cultures. The dice roll chance mechanics, ohhhh the dice roll chance mechanics, they are so good! It's so much better, challenging, and rewarding when your chance of a hit is balanced against how much energy you have and how skilled you are. Low energy and low skill will net you less successful hits. Magicka not regenerating in battle is great. dice rolls on casting spells is great. It's so rewarding when you have raised your skill in a weapon or type of spell and can cast it with greater success. This game has everything. The soul. the possibilities. the mechanics. the story.
I would of course recommend playing with OpenMW engine and OpenMW-Modding graphics overhaul mod list whilst not opting for the blood mod or heads mod and instead installing upscalled vanilla heads but none of that has anything to do with all the stuff i just raved on about. This is a brilliant AMAZING game and i can see why Morrowind players thought Oblivion was goofy. Its because it is goofy(And i still love it!). There is nothing goofy about Morrowind. Its a very serious story, with serious people, that have serious stories to tell. the terrain is serious and ash storms are harsh. It's everything they tried to make Skyrim into as an apology for Oblivion but this time its a success.

While not having the same stumbling-down-the-stairs drunk clusterfuck-y feeling that The Elder Scrolls II does when you boot it up for the first time, Morrowind does [b]NOT[/b] hold your hand. 
*  No inexplicable magic arrow to point at where you need to go as if you're a skull-dented toddler who looks at a map like it's ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. This gives the player an actual sense of freedom, as well as actually making you pay attention to the dialogue and journal entries, coupled with the fact that you won't be able to just speedrun every quest you do your first time around. 
*  There is no Teleport-Across-The-Entire-Fucking-Continent-Twelve-Times-Over button, you need to walk to the fast travel points around the map. You actually get to walk around and experience the world Morrowind has to offer you, instead of just mindlessly sprinting up to a spot to fill the color in on a black icon that you can then teleport to at any moment.
*  You actually have to play the character you build, and can't just pick up a completely foreign weapon to your character and wield it like my father wields shattered bottles on a Saturday night.

The dialogue is amazing. While there is very little voice acting, this actually does the game a favor, allowing the developers to add a plethora of dialogue to every single character in the game, save for a few generic paupers. [i]There is a lot of dialogue in this game.[/i]

While the game is great no matter how you play it (except for the Xbox version lol), it's a Bethesda game, and as such is full of bugs and best experienced modded. Morrowind Script Extender and Morrowind Code Patch make this game an even greater experience than it already is, as well as the many graphical overhauls and QoL mods that are a mere 5 clicks away for anyone with half a brain and the ability to utilize their wrist muscles and index finger simultaneously. I personally have so much graphical shit installed and active that this 21-year-old piece of software uses ~80% of my RTX 3060 the moment I step outside (worth it though).

While Morrowind is hard to pick up for those who are more used to the overly streamlined sludge we're served nowadays (trust me, I had trouble getting into it myself, having experienced Oblivion and Skyrim first), it's definitely worth playing, and is a nice change of pace from what some RPGs have become today.

The main story of the game consists in stopping Dagoth Ur from conquering Morrowind. You start in Seyda Neen, liberated from an imperial prison boat. Your journey starts there.

I must say that the gameplay, despite being kind of archaic, it's not a pain. It feels weird to use the menus with right click, clunky combat and magic (or maybe I'm not used to it), but still, it's ok to play.

I can't blame graphics, since it's a 2002 game. You know, PS2 and Xbox's era. I say the enviroment is well done, but the characters models are just goofy.

But if something in this game is just timeless is the soundtrack. Voice acting and sound effects are meh, but the music is just wonderful and magestic. You know, Skyrim's music is epic, Oblivion's music is cool, but Morrowind's music is a blessing to our ears. 

The thing that annoys me the most is the price. Despite being a good game, Morrowind doesn't worth 15€ nowadays in my opinion. Yeah, it gives you many hours of gameplay, but come on, Bethesda... It was released in 2002, and if it was remastered or remade I would understand that price...

Just like other Bethesda games, Morrowind is a good way to play a medieval RPG with tons of hours of gameplay. Seriously, try it",1689604433,1689604433,True,1,0,0.520201981067657471,0,True,False,False

It's different everytime, sometimes you jump as a service, sometimes you run as to get away, sometimes you jump to sell, sometimes you sprint to find. Find what? Everything. Find Vivec, find a special specific person in Vivec, find the exit, find an item, find some dust. Move faster with that special sweet dust. Find out about more special things to find. Where?.. 
I'm not here to answer your every question!

The best feature, by far, is paying for transport and the worst feature, by far, is walking. 
The totally undigestible amount of content is a classic trademark, of the main Elder Scrolls Trilogy; Names, Books, Towns, Directions, Books.

You want to read some books? Yeah well, maybe at least some NPC's do.

Every bandit has a name. Ferlod Woris, with his buddies Mathos Luber and Therasa Suck are here to ruin your day. Deal with them your own way, you can even calm them down, if you want, they are probably very important so don't kill them. 

A good rule of thumb, and also a feature,  is that if you heard someone mention something specific, or sometimes, totally general, you will be able to ask anyone at any point of the game about it, and get the same NPC response. Why? 
Well what if the player wants to hear about ""Dunmer"" on the go? What if there is no one left? As long as there is one person still alive in the slums of Balmora, you will be able to hear about ""Dunmer"" at least one more time.  So knock yourself out!.. Ask the Arch-Mage about ""Cave rat"". Travel to the edge of civilisation and ask about ""citizens of the Empire"".  What about ""Jobasha's Rare Books"", that's a popular one in Vivec.

You are the perfect errand boy, an upstanding member of society where no one ever leaves their house. Except (most definitely not luckily) you! 
Use your house leaving abilities to gain power. Use your skills as well. Use some herbs to breathe in the canal water. 
But don't breathe in too much, you will hyperventilate. Speaking of hyperventilating, what about hyper jumping? You want to jump? Oh, they'll give you it. They will take away the game, and leave nothing except jumping in Vivec, you should go there and jump there yourself. Jump the short way, or take the scenic plunge, enjoy the comments as you spring by.  I will have you know I jumped for 2 and a half hours straight. I'm still at 70% of my Acrobatics potential. My legs are motionless as I bounce. The remaining 30% of Acrobatics is just more content, and by that definition, I still have a monumental amount of Athletics to get through. I can jump so high my spacebar is pressed only once a  second. There is a permanent tilted angle to my spacebar, that's how you know I went full morrowind. 

I totally disagree with the fact that jumping should be 100% successful every time, what are you doing Bethesda? You had it right with the weapons. You know? Miss me with that chance to hit! On the contrary, let ME use a wide selection of spells through my monotonously trained perspective. As I naturally come to the conclusion, that if you are playing the role of a knight, you are playing the game the *challenged* way.

One of the Fan Favorites in The Elder Scrolls where you enter the Land of Elves complete with Construction Set & its 2 Expansions, Bloodmoon & Tribunal as it had years of building up after Arena, Daggerfall, Battlespire & Redguard.
It was originally slated for a 1998 Release but was delayed to be polished up until its Release in 2002.

Throughout the game's introduction, you get to create your character in the game world itself. In Morrowind, you play as an Ex-Convict who is about to be released from incarceration but first you have to create a character and choose a class then deliver a package to a Neighboring Nation as part of your character's Release Forms when creating the character & then the game is open to you where you are free to proceed whatever you see fit to do so such as the Main Story, Side Quests or Go Adventuring on your own.

Like Final Fantasy 2 (The REAL Final Fantasy 2, NOT Final Fantasy 4) & Secret of Mana, your Skills will increase as you use them so that you can Jump Higher & Run Faster, just to name a few.

You can enter a world of Fantasy and live the life of an adventurer in anyway you want, such as joining a Guild, Adventuring Freestyle, live as a Hermit, a Magician Lord, a Knight and more as the possibilities are limitless. You can also purchase a House, Boat and more. Morrowind & Open Morrowind has been and will always be one of Bethesda's Greatest Hits as they Rose from the Ashes & to Towering Success.",1679148317,1688386510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Now stating that, I have beaten Oblivion and Skyrim to completion before playing Morrowind so there is no nostalgia harking back to when this game was released for this reviewer.

With that being said, Morrowind is the best gem Bethesda has ever and will make to date. A game that you can get lost in, figuratively and in a general sense as well. When I start a new character I build a history around the race and gender of the character I am making. If that's an Orc Zerker that lost his home to the empire after being a prisoner for over fifty years or a High-Elf lesser-noble came to Morrowind to prove themselves and earn enough gold to come back as the wealthiest and most powerful house in the Imperial City next to the Emperor himself. 

A solid game worth playing today, recommended on every platform from someone that enjoys a great story, an alien and beautiful world, the play styles with melee and magic are fantastic and you have to earn how you swing that weapon or cast that healing spell that will save your life through practice or make sure you have the stamana to lift your arm to hit something and cast that spell needed (or learn to use the console commands). Highly detailed and has a high replay value for such an old game. 

Below I will talk about modding and my opinion of Todd Howard's ethics of making video games, read more if you dare or care too, if you aren't willing to read below that is fine, this is the end of the review.

 There are plenty of mods on Nexus that I have used over the years for graphical settings and a bigger world to be immersed in. I enjoyed my time with Tamriel Rebuilt and Morrowind Rebirth. Before moving forward about Todd, I wish to add something about the community that make these mods, back in the day some companies were okay with fans of there games to make mods while most sued their fans for copyright abuse. 

Bethesda didn't and was praised for this by their fans at the time. Which overall if we look at the gaming industry, that was a smart move. Though I don't like how today's Bethesda relies on them to fix their games even if they are doing it out of the love for the video game. Bethesda needs to learn to fix there games the time when they release them. But overall about modding, I have given money to some of these hard working people that make these mods and if you use them yourself for long periods of time, I would ask you to do the same. There are guides out there how to install mods. I wish you luck on installing them.

Now for the real reason I asked others that just wanted to see a review to not look at this is Todd Howard's opinion on game development. Which is that video games should allow everyone at anytime, be able to pick up and play any Bethesda game and have a fun time with it. I agree with this outlook on video games in general, what I don't agree is that every Elder Scrolls game after Morrowind doesn't feel like I'm in a RPG that gives a flying fuck about its world building. For example, interacting with NPCs that know anything useful, I enjoy to learn about the world from these NPCs, how they live, by what they wear I know if this is a noble, peasent, warrior/threat and so on. 

I enjoy the plot that they provide in Morrowind. Though when you take out these important events, characters and conversations that Oblivion as well as Skyrim does, the player character SHOULD be there or the very least a huge part of it. Its ether we just missed the conversation to an important event, missed the event entirely or just got there in the nick of time to hear a one liner or two. Let alone having NPCs ask questions on how you built a specific character and have conversations that can lead you into world shaking quests that have nothing to do with the main quest but can affect them in huge ways that are meaningful TO YOU and your playstyle! 

I have played what was the best in my eyes to what Bethesda has provided us, I don't think they will ever change their outlook to have a rich RPG-based world again that isn't reliant on GURPS. When I think Elder Scrolls, I shouldn't think ""Its for the casual gamer"" though, this is an opinion from someone that enjoys ADnD as well. I hope this review gave some outlook for you and I welcome you to comment. Thanks for reading, have a swell day.",1688020107,1688220656,True,48,0,0.810405254364013672,14,True,False,False

+ Environment + 
""Alien, Unique, Weird""
Yea it is those things but it's also extremely well built and structured in a way where it feels lived-in and has genuine history and atmosphere, Vvardenfell to me is probably the best in-game world to truly get into and explore.

9/10
 
+ Story + 
Definitely lacking in some places, especially in the Imperial side of things, but other than that it's a great experience that doesn't feel over-the-top or feels like its going too far in places. It feels like you're an actual regular-ish person in the world trying to live a life and get by in any ways that you can.

8.5/10

+ Gameplay + 

Clunky, Slow, but otherwise very manageable.
This is definitely one of the places that you need to struggle with the most at first but also the one that yields some of the biggest rewards. Breaking the game in good and bad ways is very much possible, whether by accident or on purpose and there are ways to fix the issues in 3rd party programs.

8.5/10

+ Graphics +

Definitely aged a lot, but they still hold up really well at parts. Character and creature models are very well done and the weapons + armour look great. The various and well built designs of Vvardenfell's architecture are just as wonderfully bizarre as the flora and fauna

8/10

+ Overall +

Morrowind is a genuinely really great game that almost anyone can get immersed and sink hundreds of hours into. Probably the last great game Bethesda made before being watered down into generic fantasy action games with a pathetic fraction of the role-playing elements that this one has.

Very much recommended.

In 2023 you can use OpenMW, which is just a f new game engine written from scratch, much, much more stable than what Bethesda did. It seems uncrashable. Mind. Blowing. And very easy to install.

Some tips/other stuff:
- if you find the game too hard, you clearly don't know how the game work yet, it's one of the easiest Elder Scrolls
    -> try to start any fight with a full fatigue bar. Fatigue impacts everything, even trading prices
    -> set at least one weapon skill as primary skill, and only use a weapon for it at the start, otherwise you won't hit anything
    -> you can get your attributes damaged permanently, until you restore them with potions/shrines/scrolls/spells (they'll appear in red)
    -> NPCs are not leveled, you might encounter something too powerful too soon, just come back later
- if you find the game too easy, try Morrowind Hardcore Mode. It's just excellent, reminds me of Requiem for Skyrim. This mod just made me love fighting in Morrowind, quite a feat.
- if you don't like a tedious aspect of the game use a mod
    -> don't like having to overoptimise your character levelling? Install madd leveler
    -> don't like having to rest to regain magicka? Install a magicka regain mod

A free magic system that have their own exploits to make insanely powerful magic spells what is more fun than not.
The main story has depth what again is something most games struggle nowadays.

The fighting system can be bothersome or even boring especially at the beginning where you don't have much options.
Traveling per foot if you don't level it, exploit it or even cheat it is really depressing sometimes like you killed all the enemys and you run for 10 minutes without anything happening of Cliffracers attack you every 10 seconds.

But overall a good old classic RPG to enjoy that can be fun if you like these kind of games.",1687116384,1687116384,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was my first contact with the Elder Scrolls series, I first played mororwind on my old pc like two decades ago and then went to play Skyrim and Oblivion in this exact order as I had to skip oblivion because my pc wasn't powerful enough and when Skyrim was out which was when I got a finally good pc I had my eyes already on it, but lets talk about Morrowind and my adventures on it.

Something I always disliked on morrowind was the combat, as a melee character It simply sucked having to hit and get no feedback because a specific skill wasnt leveled enougn and in order to level it you had to just keep swinging at something until it levels up, it doesnt make it any better, its a product of its time but playing as a melee character unmodded is true suffering, so when I played it the first time and then my return to it years late here on steam, I went with a mage build and there you dont actually need to keep hitting targets, its actually more immersive and fun to go to my dorm on a mages guild and train my skills there with the door closed, while everyone is minding their business on the guild I kept myself there training, conjuring stuff and more until I finally hit a high level and then I went to finally complete quests, every enemy being down in 2-3 spell shots, I felt strong and my efforts weren't wasted, with a mage build this system really shines and puts you in a immersive state that modern games don't have, a lot of stuff may feel dated, the controls, sluggish movement, ui and inventory systems but those you can get over with, the shitty combat system is the one you may not easily get over with unless like I said above you go as a mage.

Talking about story, its surely a good one, altho I think people overstimates how good it is, while its definitely better than the more modern rpgs we got in the last decade its not as good as people say it is, it does have some memorable characters but I guess being an older game the way quests are structure and a lack of set pieces doesnt make it something great to replay, what morrowind truly has going on for it is the worldbuilding, the locations are very creative and doesnt feel like just another generic medieval setting, exploration can be tricky tho especially at early game due to how sluggish the movement feels but as soon as you get immersed in this beautiful world, you will start to endure the game's flaws and learn to appreciate it. Also the soundtrack is very good, like in every other elder scrolls game.

While I never played the dlcs, I usually start getting tired near the end of the game, even this replay that I've done after years since my first playthrough, It was getting really draining at the end of the game and after finishing the main story and some guilds I had to put the game down, I may play both dlcs some day but I had enough with the main game, morrowind for hardcore rpg fans that have patience to older, dated gameplay may feel some fun and immersion here even today, but know what youre getting into, even with mods, its a dated, flawed experience, one that you need to get into a right type of mindset to appreciate, its a very good game that deserves a recommendation, its just not for everyone to play for the first time or replay today.",1686423491,1686423557,True,10,0,0.605263173580169678,0,True,False,False

I love the story, the way it is left open if we are the ""Chosen One"" or not, if we actually are the Ancient Hero reborn or not, rather we are someone who CHOSE to become the chosen one through their own actions.
Magic after this game in the TES series will never live up to the way it is here, and I genuinly love the lore.
TBH I rather read walls of text and get good writing then getting the same 10 Voice actors voicing all Characters, but worse dialoge for it.
The graphics might be a bit old, but I am not really a graphic person to begin with, I rather like old graphics tbh.
Progression feels great and the way you actually need to have the skills to join and get to higher ranks in the guilds? It is amazing!
""OH but I can't play all guilds!"" YES, thats the point
A Warrior does not belong in the Mages Guild, the houses are political rivials

Creativity: Check
In-depth Lore: Check
Worldbuilding: Check, Check, Check

All around, the most solid TES game, IMO. Oblivion is a slightly un-creative downgrade. Skyrim, on the other hand, needn't be mentioned due to it not holding up to either games. Other than superficially of course, whether that be graphics, gameplay, and so on. Or, in other words, everything that you'd expect from a modern-ish game. The downsides of Morrowind would be that: gameplay, graphics, etc. Otherwise, the quests, dungeons and roleplay potential are superb.

I'll add that im a returning player, and know a lot of the ""tricks"" to make things easier (boots of blinding speed, enchanting constant strenght on items, a strong levitate spell), so playing through the main game was a LOT faster than its designed to be - That said, I still got almost 70 hours out of the main quest and factions, which is great value for money.
I was excited to play Tribunal, as I had never played the Morrowind Expansions, however Tribunal was very disappointing, and took about 90 mins to complete, including the optional quests. Glad I never paid for Tribunal seperately! 
That said, Bloodmoon is much more fun, and whilst I havent completed that expansion yet, so far it has been great and Im really looking forward to doing the rest of the quests and exploring the island.

My only real criticism (and this is my fault) is that the enemies are all trivial by this point, if you have gained power through your normal playthrough. I turned the difficulty up to max and still 2 hit most enemies in Bloodmoon, but I am level 56 with maxxed out Attributes (and 410 strength from constant effect enchants) so that's on me really - I'm sure if i started the expansions at a lower level it would be a lot more challenging, or indeed if I only had the normal 100 strength max, mobs may take a few more swipes to kill.

Overall, I would give Morrowind and the expansions 9/10 - It would be 9.5 if you removed Tribunal from the game entirely.",1685435168,1685435168,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Beyond that, especially if you want to be immersed in the world, then I do not recommend you dig into it if you can't find the charm a few hours in. It's mostly empty filler material around a thin skeleton of relevant and interactable content. There isn't much to do outside the main questline and you will keep running into lifeless NPCs and towns that don't offer you anything to do and when they do you'll get a boring errand quest to fetch this item or deliver that note.

While an interesting alien world, it's mostly empty barren land with enemy creatures placed in expected locations with little variation. The towns vary slightly in that there are remote fishing villages, towns made out of giant mushrooms, out of giant crab creatures in a remote mountain, and so on but you will not feel any sense of character, uniqueness or depth to any of them because there isn't much to do outside of fetch/deliver sidequests and the main questline. They all feel bland and devoid of life. I'm someone who enjoys early 2000s graphics when they're done right and fleshed out, but this is not it.

The NPCs are also very lackluster and almost all of them respond to the same irrelevant prompts with the same exact responses. You have the option to ask them about something or someone in an unrelated and far-off town, but they'll respond with the exact same text as someone from that far-off town. This was especially surprising given that there's almost no voice acting which means that they could have added unique dialogues and provide new information ad nauseum. They didn't, so it's just the same filler content in each town.

The dungeons have the infamous early 2000s design relying on platforming and navigating the ""difficult"" thin land bridges all the while creating confusing layouts reminiscent of Daggerfall's atrocious dungeon designs.

The infamous guilds of the series are glorified fetch/delivery quest hubs. There's barely any substance or story going on except for the bits and pieces indicating there's some inter-guild drama going down. 

The melee combat system is atrocious. This is well known so I won't go too much into it, but fatigue is needed for combat and for running. In this game where fast travel at any time does not exist, you have to run everywhere which means when you encounter the inevitable randomly placed enemy, you won't have the fatigue necessary to fight it.

This game runs great, especially on the Steam Deck! I play it with FSR on and man is it beautiful. Only problem is the controls are a bit finicky since there is no native gamepad support. 

I have an absurd amount of hours in this game. I dont even know how many times I beat it as a kid but its been so long I've forgotten how much of a gem this was. I missed it, like finding a long lost cat. I've been gaming on this solely on my Steam Deck and I am slowly getting the hang of the controls. Im playing on hardest settings with no cheats/hacks/glitches. Just playing as a normal newb would play. I could easily get the warhouse key, steal that 650 platter, and so on but nahhhh. No need. You still get a ton from just doing the quests in the area.

I think I will beat this game on the Steam Deck, there are certain areas that have a lot of jitter and you hit like 30 FPUS, ultimately it is a smooth experience. Only in cities do I experience issues. I do wish and hope the Steam Deck improves the jitter issues, almost every game has jitter due to shader cache issues and the VRAM being stupid slow.

I really love this game, im going to beat it as a mage. Maybe even beat it again. I am enjoying the shit out of this, no mods by the way. I really, really hope Vortex integrates itself into the Steam Deck eventually as I definitely recommend avoiding mods for now as all methods are known to cause more issues than its worth. 

I absolutely recommend this game but only if you dont mind the old graphics, shitty code, and have already played the shit out of Oblivion and Skyrim.

I mean, really? This has to be some tribunal prank, what is janky about it? Please enlighten me, let me guess, is it the combat? Laughing my fucking ass off. What?

Swit I bet you also took the Engraved Ring of Healing and kept it to yourself instead of giving it to my homie, Fargoth. What are you going to do? Sell the limeware platter to a real one for one tenth the price because you have low mercantile and even lower disposition?
Even better is when they complain that Morrowind has no fast travel or directions, if you could read shit-ass comments on Twitter or Reddit you can read simple directions. And no fast-travel? Are you fucking serious? You can take: 1) The silt strider, 2) Boat, 3) Mages Guild, 4) Propylon Chambers, or 5) Teleport yourself (with a low level of Mysticism). Oh, but you complain that the map isn't revealed 🥺. It only makes sense you hadn't explored the world at all! What do you expect? Do you want it like OblIVion where you start the game and all the major settlements are already discovered? And you can fast-travel to them immediately? By all things unmourned that's just lazy and terrible game design. Oblivion only has one form of fast-travel where you click on the map, and press [Yes] and then you are there, there is no downside. Morrowind has 4 forms of fast travel (+1 if you have teleportation magic). And unlike your half-baked Skyrim and Oblivion you actually have to work for it.

And don't give me that shit where only boomers play Morrowind, N'wah I will have you know I have met countless zoomers who enjoy the game more than Skyrim and Oblivion, and these said zoomers all have higher IQs than these Skyrim and Oblivion zoomers combined, makes you think, doesn't it?

Morrowind is an RPG that shows its age, poorly. The game was and is great, some would say damn near perfect. Perfect, even down to the most minute detail. Its combat is extremely dated and clunky, game-play uncaring of your feelings, Compass (what's that?), and the bugs the glorious glorious bugs. Even still, Morrowind sets itself apart by offering almost truly limitless choices, for example:

want to kill entire towns? Go for it!
Want boots that make you levitate? Make them!
Want to clear out a dungeon and make it your home? Absolutley, if you've got the skill!
Want to smuggle moon sugar in a cats stomach? You bet!
Want to kill a major character and ruin the main quest? damn right you do.

It's things like this that modern games seem to avoid for the sake of fun. In actuality removing them does the opposite. RPG's especially single player are meant to take you, the player, on a fantastic journey.

I used the source port OpenMW (https://openmw.org) to play it, which is why Steam hasn't tracked my hours since I started a few months ago.

Anyways, this game is definitely still worth playing even as it's turned 21 years old this year. What really makes it work is that you're dropped into a very strange, alienating fantasy setting unlike any other, and you just have to figure things out about Dunmer society and culture for yourself while navigating the world, interacting with NPCs, doing quests, etc. You're essentially playing anthropologist, detective, and archaeologist just to make it in Vvardenfell. This uniquely intriguing setting which sparks the imagination and begs to be explored, combined with the lack of more modern convenience features such as quest markers (you navigate via following directions that NPCs give you) and instant fast travel (fast travel still exists, but through diegetic means such as Silt Striders, boats, Mages Guild teleporters, recall and intervention spells) really serves to immerse the player in the world presented here, even despite the dated technology. That's not even getting into the more RPG nerd stuff like character builds, player choices, and such, but there's definitely plenty of that here too, especially compared to Oblivion and Skyrim. You do have to pay attention to your build, since you need points in a skill to be effective with something, such as actually being able to hit your targets in combat. 

It's by no means perfect though. I found guild questlines to be quite underwhelming compared to the later Elder Scrolls games. There are too many goddamn cliffracers. I understand why the dice roll mechanics for combat exist, but it still can be frustrating at times. Also like every Bethesda game there's plenty of broken jank. Honestly this game's jank actually kind of adds to the fun, since you can abuse stacking potions indefinitely and certain spells to literally fly around the map at extremely high speeds while casting Kamehamehas from an effectively infinite magicka pool. At least, I was doing that by the end of my vanilla playthrough. It's not balanced by any means but it's fun that you're able to treat this game like a Super Saiyan simulator if you really know what you're doing.

I do recommend to play Morrowind if you're into RPGs, are a TES fan who hasn't gotten around to it yet, or just want to explore a fantasy world that isn't another derivative of medieval Europe. This game pioneered a lot of the open-ended, free form exploration that more recent games like Elden Ring and Breath of the Wild have been praised for.

I wanted to experience the lore and all that stuff. 
Damn, Morrowind is such a good game. It reminds me of playing old PS1 and PS2 games graphic wise and I love it. I also love how much better the story and immersion is. No quest markers might be confusing at first but then you talk to the people in towns and get more info and find your way around. The no quest marker thing also makes you want to explore things on your own more. I miss this so much from modern RPGs which just send you to a specific place and then you can fast travel back and get it done. 
I love how cool and unique each city is compared to Skyrim. 
I love how essential NPCs are killable but the game tells you that you created a doomed world. 
There's so much freedom. 
It's so sad that Skyrim abandoned the whole class, birthsign and attribute system. I know the start in Morrowind might be a bit hard coming from Skyrim but it actually makes for a unique RPG experience considering  the TES series was inspired by tabletop games like DnD. 
The only TES game I lightly modded with only the code patch (recommended to avoid some bugs) and the graphics extender.
I'd advise for the start to lower difficulty and read up some guides.

It took me many attempts to really get into it and im glad that I did, the game's strong areas are very rewarding. Morrowind is easily the most comprehensive RPG in the series. There is a large assortment of skills available, and many exclusive factions to join (or oppose). The world is super cool, the landscapes and architecture are very unique and interesting, and the regional lore is all superb, all combining to make the main quest probably the single best in the Elder Scrolls, among other things. 

However, the game is just as weak gameplay-wise as it is strong in the RP department. It tries to blend old school tabletop dice roll mechanics with real time control in a fully rendered 3D world which itself is fairly clunky, and the result is something highly frustrating (if not completely broken) in many areas. Your characters wont be able to hit anything in melee 9/10 swings until youve powerleveled to get your weapon skills and agility close to max, which entails hours and hours of grinding gold for training before you get to actually play the game; then even when melee combat does become at least usable its so clunky that its never fun. Stealth is basically completely unusable because the dice rolls break sneaking entirely, on top of not having poisons and other tools from the later games. Magic is the one archetype that is enjoyable at all, and there are no limits on it which means that magic based characters can end up being ridiculously overpowered, the complete opposite of the other two. Movement even with max speed is irritatingly slow for whatever reason, and the ability to jump might as well not even exist without using magic enhancements. Etc. Overall Morrowind's overly restrictive systems severely limit what kinds of characters you can even play despite the large assortment of skills and birthsigns and stuff, assuming you want to actually enjoy it, and the game feels like it's much more fun in theory than in practice at the end of the day. Morrowind is also one of the few games I feel needs a mod to be worth it; the default draw distance is absolutely awful and takes everything that's cool about the world away by only letting you see like 30 ft ahead of you, so the Morrowind graphics extender mod to push back the fog is a must imo.

TLDR, Morrowind is a game with some really amazing concepts that fails pretty badly at execution in a lot of places. I do recommend playing through at least once, but dont be afraid to look up guides to help build a character that will actually be fun to play and get them off to a good start so that you can sink more time into what you want to do. It can be a slog, but there are some things about the game that deserve to be appreciated and can be highly rewarding.",1476591244,1682708947,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You just stumble into areas and just immerse yourself into the landscape.

Other than that, crafting and so much more can be done. If you love older games, and to immersive yourself into games, this game is for you!

And maybe the graphics are a bit dated, but I highly implore that you keep the modding to a minimum to get the best experience. I only have some bug fix mods and a mod that improves the graphics but still keeps the vanilla ""feel"" of the game.

I know the combat is really bad and your character will most likely move really slow in your first playthrough. Eventually I just gave up in frustration and left a negative review warning other players not to play this game. I was wrong. I watched a couple Youtube videos on how to create an actually good character and how to enjoy the game. Then I read the manual that comes with the game. There is a ton of helpful information in there. Basically if you want to have fun in the game you have to be patient. You have to be willing to do some reading. A lot of reading. You're going to have to actually use your brain when you play this game.

And that's what makes this game unique to the newer Elder Scrolls titles. There's no hand-holding at all. You have to figure it out for yourself. But trust me. It's worth it. Once I figured out what I'm supposed to be doing, the game got a whole lot more fun. 

So I was playing it all wrong when I first got the game. I rushed into it without really learning anything and didn't have a good experience with the game. That's not how you should play Morrowind. Take your time. There's no rush. There's no pressure. Play the game at your own pace. Then you will really begin to appreciate the game for what it is.

Keep in mind, I circled back to this game after having played through Skyrim. The game shows its age (which one? Yes. The answer is Yes.) but I find that at its heart, it's not bad. Just come ready to read and take a BOATLOAD OF NOTES and you'll be fine.

Well, let's kick this off with the pros:
+ More control over your character build, compared to Skyrim. You have stats instead of Health/Magicka/Stamina. It feels more in-tune with what I expect and enjoy in TTRPGs.
+ You level up by doing things. Practice makes perfect, as the old saying goes. It's a neat notion. Level up 10 skills to gain a character level and assign stats, and the key stats for those skills will get bonuses if you assign points to them on leveling up.
+ The scenery is cool. I mean, it's a little bit like ""Fantasy Florida/Louisiana"" in spots, but the somewhat unusual sensibilities in the architecture and the giant mushrooms get a smile out of me.
+ The soundtrack. ""The Road Most Travelled"" is a classic track for a reason.

Alrighty, now the cons:
- Unfortunately, you have to level up by doing things. Killing monsters and fighting your enemies will ultimately only net you XP for the weapons you use, the spells you cast, the armour you wear when you take hits, and if you use a shield then maybe you'll get XP for blocking, if you succeed in blocking any blows.
- Leveling up your skills is somewhat slow, particularly to start.
- Good gravy, that's a LOT of reading.
- Like holy cow, SO MUCH READING.
- Some of the age shows. Things are a bit clunky, key mapping is a bit bothersome, and of course the right mouse button isn't bound to any secondary functions. It opens your inventory. There's no compass/objective radar on your HUD, which makes navigation a bit tricky.
- Ew, weapon and armour durability. Wish I had more insight, but unfortunately while this was a nifty idea on paper -- particularly back in 2002 -- it mostly just makes the idea of running around starkers and unarmed a lot more appealing.

It is an organic chemical of the catecholamine and phenethylamine families. Dopamine constitutes about 80% of the catecholamine content in the brain. It is an amine synthesized by removing a carboxyl group from a molecule of its precursor chemical, L-DOPA, which is synthesized in the brain and kidneys. Dopamine is also synthesized in plants and most animals. In the brain, dopamine functions as a neurotransmitter—a chemical released by neurons (nerve cells) to send signals to other nerve cells. Neurotransmitters are synthesized in specific regions of the brain, but affect many regions systemically. The brain includes several distinct dopamine pathways, one of which plays a major role in the motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain,[4] and many addictive drugs increase dopamine release or block its reuptake into neurons following release.[5] Other brain dopamine pathways are involved in motor control and in controlling the release of various hormones. These pathways and cell groups form a dopamine system which is neuromodulatory.[5]",1682277633,1682277633,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TES III is (at least from my perspective) the one true RPG which can call itself ""sandbox"". As many others already said, you are free to do almost anything you like and if you just use one offensive skill plus alchemy obsessively enough you will become more godlike in the late game than the Tribunal and Dagoth Ur combined. This game offers an incredible amount of possibilities of how to build and play your character and the balancing of especially the alchemy skill lets you acquire ridiculously powerful potions in mid- and late-game. And did I already mention the magic system? You can craft your own spells and enchantments as you wish, with a shipload of effects which you are free to combine as you like (You want a spell which deals 100 damage to yourself and kills you instantly? No problem!).

But wait, there's more: Even apart from the incredibly diverse game mechanics the game offers a sh*tload of lore. There are a couple of dozen books in the game with up to ~50 pages which provide detailed background information about the world you are playing in and its lore.

In the early game, there is one thing you need though: patience. Morrowind has no fast travel, you are dependent on public transport like boats, silt-striders and the teleport service provided by the mage's guild. Additionally, there are NO quest markers, you actually need to listen to directions given by quest givers and such. In my personal opinion, this is one of the strengths of this game but it can get annoying at times (especially when I looted another ruin and became over-encumbered again) - in any case it makes this game one of the most immersive RPG experiences you are about to encounter!

Last point: it does have quite dated graphics, but that's actually not a problem because of the load of mods accessible via Nexusmods for example. All in all, the immersion, lore and sometimes even funny game mechanics make this game worth a try at least!

First of all, get a Telvanni cephalopod mask, which has the most enchanting points in the whole game, and only sells for 50 gold in Khuul, and whatever clothing armour and robes you can find. These are all different layers of clothing so you can put them on all at once. Also if you can find any non enchanted amulets use those too. Now once you get your Enchanting level high enough, you'll have an option to enchant an item with a constant effect, so as long as you have the item on, the effect is active. Enchant every piece of clothing you're wearing with Fortify Intelligence (you can get this by getting any fortify attribute spell, I just buy orc strength from the merchant in Ald-ruhn) and then check your magicka bar. It should be very high at this point. Now make the most broken spell you can think of, and make sure that it's below your magicka (depending on the clothing that you got and enchanted you should be either at or near the max limit) and there you go. You are now unstoppable. I tried this with fortify strength instead and managed to kill Dagoth Ur in one hit. (while he was still in ""god form"")

[H1] the meat and bones [/H1]
Now I bet you are wondering, ""why is there an asterisk there? Are they going to-"" 
yes, the answer is yes I'm going to go on for a bit [spoiler] sorry not sorry [/spoiler]. The simple thing is: this game is old and it feels old. The graphics are more than dated and the combat is very RNG dependant  which makes it feel even more dated. If these things sound like they will put you off the game, it probably will. However, if you can get past this here are some of the big pros:

1.) Builds: if you've only played skyrim you may be surprised to find how many more skills and stats there are in morrowind. In skyrim you just have health magika and stamina. Conversely in morrowind you have Endurance, speed, strength, willpower, personality, luck, agility. Each does a different thing and building for one will change your experience massively. To compliment this Morrowind has so many skills.
To name just the ones that didn't make the cut to skyrim:
medium armour, spears, acrobatics, armourer, axe, blunt, long blade, short blade, athletics, mercantile, mysticism

2.) Spells. Ever want to fly around because walking is boring? learn the levitate and soar across the skies. Want to cripple a target  and make them unable to do anything learn drain attribute spells. 
""What if I want a spell and it doesn't exist?"" you may ask, there is a system where you can mix spell effects and adjust all the important bits like duration or what it targets. Even enchantments have more depth. You can enchant with passive effects or active effects; want to have a set of cheap hide armour that summons a daedric armour when worn? You can do that. Want to have armour that causes a big boom when activated, it can be done.

3.) The world [spoiler] wait haven't I already made this joke?[/spoiler]: ...So do you know how half of the things canonically in Skyrim aren't in the game skyrim? Like the minotaurs, dreugh, flying whales, talking draugar, etc. well Everything in morrowind is in game. Want to see giant mushroom trees? Sure and there are mad anarchist wizards who grow them artificially to live in. Want to see Vivec city, city of Vivec where a the ruler holds up a giant meteorite (turned prison) with their divine powers? Well you can. 

Speaking of Vivec
Vivec pre-godhood was always struggling to find a self, they were born as both male and female and struggled to decide on which they wanted to be (which is something [via my own IRL biases] find very...relatable). Books use he and she showing how they never really could decide. With the power they gained they could change at will to one or the other and this instilled a determination for freedom in Vivec which informs their personality.  Vivec is just one character. Many characters are more interesting than in skyrim, some are evil but do good or do evil but for good reasons but in the end they feel less like cardboard cutouts stuck to quest vending machines.

4.) Player choice (see that faction, you can join it): Morrowind is very open almost to the point of being a sandbox. Every NPC can be killed or interacted with. Common bandits can be conversed with and you can kill the main villain without even doing a single quest. There are many factions who all bring something unique to the (proverbial) table.

The Telvanni are anarchist wizards who are less xenophobic than most in morrowind but do engage in slavery but do everything by ""might is right"". The telvanni argue that if you manage to murder your direct superior that you must be better suited to their job since you beat them.

Redoran are the honourable house. They fight with blades and well crafted armour, Despite their honour it is hard to rise in their ranks as a non dark elf especially a beast race due to entrenched xenophobes who will only let you rise up if you can eliminate them or prove they gain more from helping you

Hlallu are the profit based house. They are the house with the most N'wah (foreign people). They are generally quite open minded but there is an obvious problem of corruption. One of their leaders harasses anyone trying to get personal and intinate asking for a kiss and insisting you call him ""uncle"".

Then you have some of the more minor factions (who all have quest lines) such as the Imperial temple who want you to spread word of the divines (since the dark elves are more keen on worshipping other dark elves [the tribunal]) or how about the tribunal temple who want you to follow the words of the tribunal (mostly vivec). You can join the mages guild, fighters guild or even the Impeiral army. There is only one main faction that isn't available, the Sixth house (the antagonists), which is sad since their leader is quite the likeable guy (even if he does need to be stopped).

Additionally you can become a vampire or werewolf and these I have a mixed feeling on. On the one hand it's cool that NPCs acknowledge that you are clearly a monster of the night but on the other you can't really play the game as them since every NPC won't even talk to you. There are also three entirely different vampire clans with different outlooks and beliefs.

5.) Immersive quest log: this can be a pro or a con depending on how you see it but I think it is better than how it is in skyrim. Every quest has a full journal entry which tells you what you are doing. There are no quest markers and instead you are told where to go in your journal. This is a good thing since it is immersive and leads to less zombie-like wandering towards arrows with no brain function but it can be frustrating when it goes wrong.

6.) Equipment: This game has way more weapons and armour to use. There is light heavy and medium armour along with multiple clothing layers that can be mixed. You have the following slots to equip armour:
-Head
-Feet
-Shoulders
-Undershirt
-Torso
-gauntlets/gloves
-Trousers/greaves
-skirts
-sash/belt
-robes
Each has weight and lets you make your character look how you want. additionally there are more weapons, to name the types not in skyrim: spears, thrown, short blades (like katanas), (melee) staff

So some Cons:
-This game is not balanced. You either adapt or you get destroyed. You will accept a quest to kill three rats and will die over and over again trying to kill the three rats.
-There is no fast travel so expect to do a lot of walking
-Obtuse stats and quests are aplenty

[h2] Would I recommend this game? [/h2]
Yes if you can put up with the age of the game. However... if you can't but it looks interesting download some mods to make the graphics pretty and the gameplay less RNG, I understand. Otherwise skip this game.

[H3] a quick note on Elder scrolls' future as a morrowind enjoyer [/H3]
Every Elder scrolls game has gotten less deep since morrowind. Every game skills are cut, armour is simplified and the stories have less impact and with less choice. I fear for elder scrolls 6. Bethesda has said that they aim to cut anything that isn't needed with each new game and to write stories with the ""Keep-It-Simple-Stupid"" method and that's terrible, it's an awful philosophy that will only ruin their games. 
what makes morrowind so unique is all of the depth. Dagoth Ur is the best villian I've seen in elder scrolls franchise and with miles better motivation and charisma then someone like Alduin or even Harkon. 
I fear the success of Skyrim might teach them the wrong lesson and they may make an even more one dimensional plot with none of the weirdness that makes the elder scrolls universe what it is and with near to no build variety",1640629293,1681224485,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Morrowind does not give you quest markers. You have to use *street directions*.

I remember there was a session of Morrowind where I got completely turned around looking for a wizard's tower and I ended up in a town I had no idea existed. I had to go into a bar and ask a dancer on stage where I was and how to get where I was going. Like a tourist. It was the most immersed I've ever been in a game world.

And speaking of Dagoth Ur, he is one of the most memorable villains in any RPG. The way he speaks, with his grandiose oratorical style, is absolutely mesmerizing. He is a true force to be reckoned with, and the final battle with him is a pretty sick moment in gaming history.

Do not make this your first Elder Scrolls game, the amount of reading optional material this game expects you to do to get immersed in its world is pretty absurd.

TES: 3/Morrowind as far as fantasy worlds go felt very interesting, I really loved the setting.
With its combination of religion, cults, and grand factions such as houses and a foreign empire, combined with the island your on which is inhabited by all manner of beasts, such as weird jellyfish things that are somewhat lobotomised for public transport, or all the pterodactyls that fly around the place, Morrowind is artistically quite great.

And as far as antagonistic forces go, I really liked how they present Dagoth Ur.
He's a man who has a constant presence throughout the entire game and piecing together the narrative as ya go along was pretty neat.

But the reason why I don't recommend the game comes down to everything else.
To put it briefly, the jank from this being released in 2002 is the least of its issues, but I will get into those issues all the same.

When you start off, you move PAINFULLY slow, if you are not running, you are suffering.
Even as the game went on, I still moved way too slow. The way I obtained a reasonable amount of speed was by just bunny hopping everywhere, the amount of distance you can gain as you level up via jumping is just ridiculous.

The combat too, is also terrible.
The RNG system they have for whether or not your hits actually hit your enemies makes attacks feel lame and weightless, and if your stamina is depleted from running everywhere, your hit chance is reduced by a fair bit.

I may have complimented the setting and antagonists earlier, but the characters you encounter are dull and undefined as characters.
The reason for this is because of how dialogue works, you have a list of topics to ask people and they give you either the specific result you're after, or very copy/paste dialogue.

Sidequests are bad, even the guilds and houses.
A lot of them are boring fetch quests that offer no narrative substance, but the amount of backtracking all these questlines want you to do is just absurd, it's boring.
Then there's escort missions, which are the absolute worst.
The pathfinding of these guys is god awful, they're slow and the rewards you get are consistently bad, aside from a pair of boots which you may or may not be able to wear depending on your race.
Top it off with very uneventful stories for most of their runtime and I just can't recommend doing as many of these as ya can.

Exploration is also very ehhhhh.
A lot of areas feel very copy/paste, and if you find an item for a sidequests before you stat it, well then you better not lose track of where you left that item. It just feels unrewarding at a lot of points.

And finally the expansions really aren't that great.
The enemies here are very spongey in comparison to the rest of the game, and when you're starting the game, if you don't progress in Tribunal, which you won't be doing at the starting level, you can be assaulted while you try and rest to restore your health. It's annoying and just messes with ya hard early on.
Tribunal's also just lame in general.

So yeah there's definitely some cool stuff here, and there are ways I could've mitigated some of these issues, but things like the lack of worthwhile characters or wasting my time will always persist.
Get it if you want more Elder Scrolls or desperately want to relive the 2002 PC game experience, but there's better games out there, even from the time this came out.",1680242842,1680242842,False,3,0,0.496461033821105957,0,True,False,False

I mean it, however, in a positive and endearing way. After playing something like Skyrim, it feels nice to play something this ""broken"" and unpolished. With so many liberties given, there are so many ways to break the game, and it's incredibly fun to do so.

The start is painfully slow and tedious, due to the fact that your skills get stronger ""exponentially"". You can hardly even hit anything at first, cast any spells, lockpick the simplest locks, and attempting to raise someone's disposition will only make them hate you, especially if during character creation you didn't get any bonuses to these skills. And when I say ""slow"", it's slow in the most literal way, since with low athletics, acrobatics, and a low reserve of fatigue you can only move at a snail's pace.
This is what had made me drop the game several times when I tried playing it in the past, until I finally was motivated enough to pull through.

Once you start to get going, though, you really start to get going. Once you get your acrobatics maxxed after spamming the jump button every millisecond for hours, you just start flying 5 meters into the air, and jumping from one Vivec canton to the other. When you get my favourite item, Boots of Blinding Speed, and find a way to use them, which I'm not even sure whether the developers actually intended for you to be able  to use them or not, the game just changes completely. You start gliding and jumping through Vvanderfell at a million miles an hour, and this kind of thing you simply cannot get in Skyrim (even with the same item, it's not even close).
I won't go into detail. but there's many more ways to break the game, which, again, make playing this game fun in a way that you can't really get in more modern games of this kind.

My biggest critique would probably be that the levelling process for many skills has not been thought through very well, which makes it incredibly tedious for some, and trivial for others. Especially since you don't get any experience on failed skill uses, you go from failing 10 times in a row on lower levels before succeeding once to get a little bit of XP, to succeeding every time and levelling much faster, which does not really make sense for skills to be easier to level at later levels than earlier ones.
And some skills, even when succeeding every single attempt, are much too slow to level, so the best way to level becomes to simply farm tens of thousands of gold and look for a trainer.

Despite its flaws, and sometimes thanks to them, I strongly recommend playing this game at least once. It really is a great experience, and the game felt nostalgic without having played it in the past, simply because it represents an era of video games that is long gone.",1679609224,1679609224,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Here you are not some random hero facing the world. You are a loser, a weakling, a nobody. The game does not want you to have fun. The game wants you to suffer and you have to fight against it. This starts from character creation, where you basically need to study or at least look up a guide before you can hope to have a somewhat less unpleasant experience. There are so many factors to consider just by picking a race, sex, class and birthsign. This will affect your stats and skills and you really need to think this through. Morrowind does not ask you: What do you want to be good at? Morrowind asks you: Where do you not want to be completely helpless?

Let me illustrate this with the basic attributes of which most will be ""too low"".

Strength: If you have too little, you will barely be able to carry anything but the clothes on your back. You will also not do any damage with weapons and run out of fatigue in an instant.

Agility: If you have too little, you will get hit a lot and also barely hit anything yourself.

Endurance: If you have too little, you will be killed instantly. Also health per level up is dependant on this attribute, so you really don't want to be low on this one.

Speed: If you have too little, you will walk horribly slow. There are some fast travel options, but they are far apart. You will do a lot of walking, so slow speed just means lots of downtime between the fun bits. But it's not relevant for combat, so it's a safe option for ""too little"".

Intelligence: If you have too little, you will barely have any magicka to cast spells.

Willpower: If you have too little, you will barely succeed on casting any spell. Also you will run out of fatigue in an instant.

Personality: If you have too little, nobody likes you. But you're an outlander in Vvardenfell, so nobody likes you anyways. Safe option for ""too little"".

Now that you have determined in which ways you want to be crippled on a fundamental level, it's time to figure out in which ways you want to be crippled specifically. Namely you have 5 major and 5 minor skills. Major skills start at 30/100 and only require 75% of the default experience to increase. Minor skills start at 15 and require 100% experience. All skills you don't pick here will start at 5 and require 125% of the default experience.

Now how does that cripple you? Anyhting below 50 is basically trash. With racial boni you can get some major skills to be almost acceptable, whereas everything else is a pain. So you want to have the weapons, armor and spell schools you use the most as your major skills in order to even do anything. Also in Morrowind, you do not learn from failure. Everytime you miss a swing, you have learned nothing about wielding that weapon. Everytime you fail at lockpicking, you decrease the durability of your lockpick, but did not learn anything about lockpicking. Everytime you fail at a potion, you wasted the ingredients. Everytime you fail at a spell, you only wasted mana - which does not regenerate naturally. As the success chance of everything you do is based on your skill, your minor and even more so miscellaneous skills are very hard to increase without spending gold at a trainer. You only get to pick the skills where you want to be the least trash at.

Of course everything gets better, once you start levelling, right? Nope. You level by increasing any 10 of your major or minor skills. Each skill is linked to an attribute. The more skills per attribute you increase, the more the attribute increases at level up. You may only pick 3, though. Don't spread your activities out too much. However, to get the highest possible increase to an attribute, you need 10 skill upgrades there (including misc). That means to turn your loser into a little less of a loser, you should preferably increase twice as many of the hardly increasable misc skills -> get a lot of gold and spend it on trainers. Sure hope you're not a mage, otherwise you might lack the strength to even carry enough valuable loot back from your exploits.

Now that we have established that you are a loser, you will also find that you're horribly poor on stamina. If you move, you will lose fatigue. The lower your fatigue, the lower your chance of... well, anything. Don't do things when you are out of breath. So once you moved through the empty, boring world to the tomb or mine you have a quest at, make sure to just afk for a while. While it is realistic, it's just a massive waste of time. Just as the slow walking or the incredible amount of failures when trying to level any skill other than those you're already quite good at. Funny enough the best skill to level is your amor, because you will be very good at getting spanked. But don't forget to keep some repair hammers on you. Armor and weapons lose durability quite rapidly and the worse state they're in, the less will they protect you and the less will you hit anything with them.

To top it all of, the writing and sound design are a mess. Quests are boring and generic. Dialogue is copy pasted everywhere to the point that the attitude of one NPC can change completely within two related textboxes. And absolutely nothing beats the good feeling of an NPC telling you how thankful they are for your help in the textbox, while the voice line pretty much tells you to piss off, outlander.

Morrowind has not aged well. It's clunky, the dice based gameplay is boring, there are a multitude of factors on every single dice roll that you should all have an eye on. Your chances will automatically decrease unless you actively wait. It might be a great experience for those that enjoy wasting time with tedious, mundane tasks, but for anyone who values their time, it's a pass.",1679434010,1679434010,False,2,2,0.449063241481781006,0,True,False,False

My first impressions were: This game is slow, ugly, and boring. There was something almost charming about how much people praised this game so I constantly came back to try to understand why they love it so much. After a few failed characters, sometime in 2019 when I had a grand total of 10 hours, it just clicked. This game is super buggy, game mechanic heavy, and extremely broken in many ways, BUT that's what makes this game so good. You can do dumb stuff like hit enemies so hard that it breaks them and your weapon. It's extremely entertaining in the sense that you can really do whatever you want in this game. Wanna move really fast? Make a spell that negates 95 points of spells for a single second and equip the boots of blinding speed. What about that last 5 points? It makes the game a little darker, but being blind actually makes you more accurate. Wanna jump across the entire map? Go ahead just have levitate on standby. Everything is stamina based for success rate, but now that you have no stamina what can you do? Good time to repair equipment since the formula divides rather than multiplies.
It's so good in the sense that it never restricts you and knowing the ways it's broken somehow makes it more immersive?? I don't know why but it really does.
Even though I make fun of it a lot this is genuinely one of my favorite games. It's not for everyone, but if you want a buggy mess of a game, this is definitely worth your time.

Out of their fortresses they came with golden ballistae that walked and mighty atronachs and things that spat flame and things that made killing songs. Their king was Dumac Dwarf-Orc, but their high priest was Kagrenac the Blighter.

Under mountains and over them the war with the Dwemer was raged, and then came the northern men to help Kagrenac and they brought Ysmir again.

Leading the armies of the Chimer was the slave that would not perish, the Hortator Nerevar, who had traded his axe for the Ethos Knife. He slew Dumac at Red Mountain and saw the heart bone for the first time.

Men of brass destroyed the eleven gates of the Mourning Hold and behind them came the Dwemeri architects of tone. Ayem threw down her cloak and became the Face-Snaked Queen of the Three in One. Those that looked upon her were overcome by the meanings of the stars.

Under the sea, Seht stirred and brought the army he had been working on in the castles of glass and coral. Clockwork dreughs, mockeries of the Dwemeri war machines, rose up from the seas and took their counterparts back beneath, where they were swallowed forever by the sea.

Red Mountain exploded as the Hortator went too far inside, seeking the Sharmat.

Dwemeri high priest Kagrenac then revealed that which he had built in the image of Vivec. It was a walking star, which burnt the armies of the Triune and destroyed the heartland of Veloth, creating the Inner Sea.

Each of the aspects of the ALMSIVI then rose up together, combining as one, and showed the world the sixth path. Ayem took from the star its fire, Seht took from it its mystery, and Vehk took from it its feet, which had been constructed before the gift of Molag Bal and destroyed in the manner of truth: by a great hammering. When the soul of the Dwemer could walk no more, they were removed from this world.

Resdaynia was no more. It had been redeemed of all the iniquities of the foolish. The ALMSIVI drew nets from the Beginning Place and captured the ash of Red Mountain, which they knew was the Blight of the Dwemer and that would serve only to infect the whole of the middle world, and ate it. ALTADOON DUNMERI!

I played through a good chunk of it, but ended up just feeling bored, lost, and unimmersed. I had some fun and I definitely would not call Morrowind a bad game, but it just felt sluggish. Essentially my two main issues boiled down to dialogue and movement. I like the idea of moving slowly and building up speed over the course of the game, but goddamn does it make me want to kill myself in practice, like holy shit it is agonizingly slow. Dialogue wise, I actually really like the unique dialogue options, but each NPC has like five hundred default dialogue options to the point where it feels impossible to find NPC's who have anything worth listening too.

I have the theory that is is likely the best game Bethesda ever did and everything that came afterwards its just a repeat of what they achieved here. The side content ranges from fetch quests to some okay and interesting stuff, but what tops it all is the main quest, there is a sense of discovery not only exploring wise, but in a narrative sense as well!

The story is also tied to the sense of progression and leveling up, you start as a prisoner who is sent to work as a spy by the emperor, and there is a mystery you have to unveil, since you are a spy, you have to make a cover identity on your own, and the game tells you to level up and do side content to get better at what you do, there is no weird sense of urgency like in Cyberpunk where you are dying and it just feels off when you want to explore, or like in Breath of the Wild where they say Ganon is about to break free and you are collecting dragonflies for a girl and her sister, Morrowind gives you the perfect mood to explore and it only gives you the information you need at the final of the quest when things are about to go wild, besides you can still play after beating the main quest when there is no imminent threat anymore, you can wander around aimlessly and make your own story! Live your own fantasy life!

Morrowind also features a more natural and realistic depiction of the chosen one narrative, since this time you have to convince people and go through several tests instead of being told you are the one and being believed as such by others as a matter of fact, you have to win it, you have to convince them with actions, mere words don't do, people are very apathetic about the prophecy because naturally they don't believe it and just want to see results from you, people in Morrowind are all about to see to believe, and weirdly enough, even when it reduces the power fantasy factor, it makes the story feel a lot more real.

The lore is amazing and everything you hear about the Disappearance of the Dwarves is just neat, it is the kind of cryptic stuff that scrambles my brain, the mystery about the real truth of the death of Nerevar, that weird wizard dude that clones his wives, the cult and the use of the Kagrenac tools by the tribunal and Dagoth Ur, it's just so good, it's all so good. It is one of those stories that makes you to compulsively play nonstop so you can find out the truth!

Also, no quest markers whatsoever. I first felt it was frustrating not knowing where to go, but Morrowind taught me about how rewarding the sense of exploration can be, and the sense of freedom that comes with it, no compass telling you where to go, its all about your own story, you get clues and get to discover things, beautiful things, scary things, unbelievable things. For my second playthrough I completely disabled the map because I just realized I love feeling lost, I love being lost so much, there is an inexplicable joy on me in not knowing where I am and being in a place for the first time. And while there are some procedurally generated games with no maps, having manually handcrafted locations make the exploration feel more special, because there will always be something interesting to discover, it is the story related content and dialogue based questa that other exploration games can't offer with procedurally generated quests.

Also, as most Bethesda games, it does have a huge modding community, there are mods that can even duplicate the size of the map, all with handcrafted locations!

The gameplay is fantastic too, there are just so many things you can use to achieve your goal, sure, the RNG combat is weird at first, the stamina use when walking is weird too, but the more you level up the more satisfying it becomes to hit more frequently, you can either specialize in long blades, or you can use stealth, the magic system is vast and full of possibilities. I was sad first when I used all my Icarian flight scrolls and I couldn't find any on the game, but then I learned you can do a spell to increase your jump and reduce your weight and boom, I was able to make a bootleg icarian flight spell myself, it is all about those little tricks and things you can do, the abilities, the possibilities that just add to the repeatability, the ability to levitate between cities, have you seen that wind bombing glitch people use on Breath of the Wild to jump really far way? You can do that on Morrowind, no exploits needed, all legitimately part of the gameplay! There is also using the voice of the emperor to charm others, command creatures, paralyze your enemies! Become a master alchemist and destroy everybody with the most dangerous motions known to man! It is just all so good, so so good!

Some of the lore was taken along with for the next games, but, I feel this is the only game for me worth exploring. I do like the nordic inspired landscapes of the next releases and I like Lord of the Rings until a certain measure that you find in the next two games, but I haven't felt the drive to explore them when its approach feels so soulless, and while Oblivion and Skyrim are the definition of what I would call generic fantasy, Morrowind's world is creepy and alien, it is scary and wonderful. The steampunk inspired Dwarf ruins, the construction in Sadrith Mora and the closer islands, the open maze that can be Vivec city, the houses made of stone and the manor district of Aldrun, the skeleton warrior filled castle of Firemoth, the altars in the Sixth House bases, the master index forts, that bonelord between the lava I found in a cave raiding one of my trials, it is all so good, so good!

While Daggerfall aimed at a sense of freedom and size with the procedurally generated world, Morrowind uses the manual approach and gives you locations that are all lovely handcrafted one by one without cramming up so many things in a small space, still giving you a big land to wander around and sight-see!

Maybe adding routines for the NPCs would have helped a lot to make the characters less static, but I tell you that what this game achieved is really really special! Morrowind is the joy of being lost and discovering a place for the first time, to discover something beautiful or incredible after hours of walking, to find a lost fella and help them along the way for then discover the witch that cursed him was actually in the right, Morrowind is about dying, about fight your way in, Morrowind is about having an adventure, and it is one of my favorite games right now.

First of all, the skills system is quite atrocious on how they influence your character. If you're making use of a weapon, your weapon skill level is literally the percentage chance of the attack hitting.
If your skill is level 30, 30% chance of the attack landing. If it's level 5 (the level non major and minor skills probably will be), 5% chance of hitting the attack. 
There's also the factor that the target may dodge the attack too but that's something else. Training low level skills on a trainer npc by paying gold helps ease this, by making so you can try grinding those skills other ways.

As for spells, they have something similar to the weapons hit rate, but in this case, it's the chance of the cast being successful.
Gladly, the chance is mostly related to how powerful the spell is, and the level of the skill that governs it, so you can grind the skill by spamming the spell while using a bed to rest, and maybe you can get it to 100% chance of success (depending on the spell).
Regardless of wether the spell you're using is weak or strong, it will always increase skill level progress the same way.

Also, there is no natural Health and Magicka regeneration in this game. If you need to restore your character health and magicka, you need to make your character rest.
The problem with this, is that there is a chance that your rest might be interrupted, but the biggest problem is when it's interrupted by a Dark Brotherhood Assassin.
Those guys appearing so early in the game is like the developers wanting to punish the player. But... If you manage to kill them, their loot give quite a good amount of coins.

The movement of the character is waaaaaay too slow. Running makes the character considerably faster, beside still being too slow on the lower levels. The character gets somewhat faster as you level up Speed and Athletics, though, but not that much.
Also, you will need to conserve stamina, since it will be necessary for several things, like interactions with npcs, fighting monsters, and even for chance of successfully casting a spell. You can even get your character knocked out if you try fighting someone without stamina, so beware.

Also speaking of combat, the hits have impact. You can feel that the target of your attacks is hit by the attacks, and you can see them being knocked back, or even falling on their knees upon being hit. That's amazing. I don't know why on the future games, the characters fights like rocks with weapons, but here, feels more like attacks are painful.

Rich in dialogue the game seems, but it's also a really confusing and laziness inducing dialogue system.
They made quite a lite version of the text wall World of Warcraft npcs give to you when you talk to them, but alongside that, there's a system where you can pick keywords your character know, and ask the npc about them to see what they have to say.
That can easily get overwhelming depending on the npc you're speaking to, and how many keywords you learned.
After some time of gameplay, I begun ignoring generic looking dialogues, and only investigating further dialogues that starts differently.

The world of the game doesn't really seems that big, but due to how slow your character moves, it will still be a journey. There's actually lots more to see while exploring the world map, than you see on Oblivion and Skyrim, since this game has also some minor villages and other points of interests.
Also, there's no fast travel other than by hiring from npcs to go to other cities.
Also, pay attention to signs, to see if you're going the right direction.

While playing this game, I also noticed the trend on Bethesda games, of making so some monsters begin appearing on the world after certain level. I don't actually like that, because feels very odd. Like, starting from level 3 or 5, you begin seeing Cliff Racers everywhere, when they didn't existed before.

The dungeons of the game are actually quite challenging, and I mean that mostly because you'll probably need to fight against the rng on your attacks to win. The loot itself is like the best of all Elder Scrolls games I've ever played. It feels rewarding to explore a dungeon. The only problem is that they don't respawn.

The game features quite a good number of equipments that aren't present on other games, like Spears, and their own skills. There's also equipments like Shoulder Guards and Gloves, but I have no idea why they split them between left and right.

And, also quite a good number of skills to make use of. I am able to make a naked khajiit character, and because there's skill for Unarmored in the game, leveling it up made my character a lot better at surviving.
Also, that skill doesn't affect only naked characters. If you want to make a warrior that only uses cloth armor, go ahead.

By the way... Little side comment but... Did Bethesda forget to make underwears for Khajiits and Argonians?
Seriously, they have literally no piece of clothing when naked. Even the Female ones doesn't have any clothing on their chest. Just commenting btw.

And, there's also the bad skills, like Sneak, which not only is nearly impossible to level up naturally, but also extremelly risky too.

There is a great number of spell effects here, with interesting effects too. There's even a spell effect that allow you to Levitate in the air. Yes, you can fly in this game with that spell. That felt so amazing when I tried out that spell. And the potions are quite useful aswell, but I think their effect could last longer.

Factions seems to take a major role here, with several factions you can join, and each of them having quests.
The most interesting fact is, the Fighters, Mages and Thieves guilds, have quests on all cities they have a base on, so if you get quests from Balmora FG, you can also get quests from Vivec FG. And the devs actually invested their time making those quests, so it's worth doing them, and rewarding aswell.

So far, the game itself is great, and I plan on playing more.
What is sad, is when I think of TES IV Oblivion and TES V Skyrim, and imagine the many cool things this game has, that those games didn't implemented. Even more TES V, since it dropped most of the features from earlier games, and turned into some action rpg, with rocks fighting each other.

If it wasn't for the problem with the Skills system and the Walking Speed, the game would be more accessible to new players.
Well, I hope you try grinding their characters a bit, and end up finding out why this game is great.

So here's the quick review: Get this game. Mod the ever-loving hell out of it. Enjoy it, because this game is one of the reasons we don't get games like this anymore.

Now that I've covered that, it's time for a deep dive. Morrowind is one of the most jam-packed clunky messes of a game that has ever been published in the history of time. Don't believe me? This hulking mass of story is nearing twenty years old and people are still discovering little secrets that they never noticed before. And that's saying something, because even Skyrim can't hold up to the layers of depth that this game has to offer. Mind you, that isn't to say that the execution is particularly stellar. This is a game of upmost patience over anything. It's ancient, it barely functions by modern standards, and it requires actual reading. You know, that thing you're doing now, only I haven't scattered my review across a countryside and handed you a quest to find them and assemble them into a cohesive narrative. And even when intense amount of reading isn't required to play through parts, there's still so much to uncover. You can literally take weeks scouring parts of the map and still not manage to find all the intricate (if pixelated) details that have been strewn about.

With all of that pontification out of the way, there's some serious flaws that need to be addressed, and that's really what my reviews are known for anyway.  First off, the biggest issue: Bethesda has made a disgustingly lucrative career out of making spaghetti-coded nightmares. I'd go so far as to cite this game as the beginning of the trend. Morrowind is a hot bed of trash in terms of how awful the bugs are. And there's no modern auto-save feature, so if you aren't diligent about saving (and having multiple saves), you can be completely stopped by a game-breaking error in coding that won't let you proceed further. Seriously, it's a disaster.

The second thing to note is that the overall game-play structure is a bit of a nightmare. Where the bugs don't kill you, the awkwardness of the game's structure might. There's no perceivable logic connecting the UI and the skills you have access to are... troublesome. If you aren't careful at character creation alone, you'll be against a wall of being hilariously bad at using a weapon. Or spells if that's your fancy. And on the other side of that, the spells and weapon damage become absolutely absurd once you've gotten skills up to a satisfying level. And before you ask, physics are insane here. You can force enemies to ragdoll off cliffs just like latter installments, and that's still wildly entertaining.

Now, the third and final note is that there are a lot of mods for this game. Don't hesitate to use them, as some of the quality-of-life mods that have been created by fans turn this clunky old title into a genuinely thrilling experience. Just be sure to follow the instructions for the mods you choose or you’ll be downloading files that do nothing. Given that the base game can run on some of the least updated of systems, there’s no reason not to see exactly how many mods your potato engine PC can handle without fully cooking some Au Gratin potatoes.

What? You’re still here? Go buy this ancient game and have fun messing with it already. Sheesh. You’d think that I didn’t just lay out enough reason with all that previously spattered information to convince you already.",1677445401,1677445401,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was always a great memory, and after I moved on to Oblivion and Skyrim, I was a bit afraid of tarnishing that memory. A lot of people kept singing the praises of this game, but we all know how niche communities work: everything seems to be better in the olden days. So, while I was trying to mod Oblivion (again), I noticed just how nurtured the Morrowind modding community was. I knew about the overhauls and the total conversions, but the modding scene for the vanilla game was as extensive as in the other games. So, I started reading about it.

What I like the most about Morrowind mods is that, sure, you can go ham with them as with other Elder Scrolls games, but Morrowind is a game that was so perfectly yet precariously balanced atop a massive heap of interlocking systems, that adding much more of anything on top kinda ruins the experience.

You see, this is a game that lives and dies by its systems. Be it the spells system, where you can create your own spells tailoring how powerful and how lasting they are provided you have the coin and the magical charge, or the soft skill system, where everything is learned through practice (or trained if you have the coin), or the persuasion system, where characters will reveal their darkest secrets and give away their precious possessions if you're charming enough (or you have the coin for a bribe),,, Morrowind never compromises in how far the player can go with them.

You might notice all of them have the word ""coin"" somewhere. Because it's absolutely true. Gold will solve all your problems, pretty much as it should be. You can murder everything that stands in your way and sell the materials, weapons and armor of your foes, or you can slink about stores stealing everything that isn't nailed down, or you can craft insane potions and enchantements to sell at crazy prices... Everything can net you some drakes, and after you amass sufficient wealth, you can break the game.

And breaking the game is immensely fun. It's very clearly a game that knew how its systems could be exploited, but also knew how that is part of the fun, if not THE fun. Everytime you outwit a problem, an obstacle, or an inconvenience through the use of savvy game mechanics loopholes, you don't fell like your abusing or exploiting the game. You feel like Morrowind is excitedly telling you ""Great! You found another solution! Awesome!"". And it's so immensely rewarding to be able to play a game in your own terms and still have it be fun, that I feel all the fame this game has is totally warranted.

I didn't know it when I was a youngster, but now that I have a better way with words, I realize that's precisely what I love about this game. It's a game with no real artificial boundaries, just how far the systems can stretch. And they can stretch REALLY far. An absolutely unique experience.

Closing, the game has humongous amounts of content. 52 hours, I have on this Steam playthrough. And this is only Guild content and half one Noble House content. I haven't even made the Main Quest nor the DLCs. You WILL get your money's worth. The original combat is what has aged the worst, with your skill determining chance to hit, not damage, and that can make fights take forever and be rather frustrating. While I love everything else, combat has certainly aged like milk.

Luckily, there's a mod for that.

And speaking about mods, here's my list. Rather purist (except for combat), and the game looks and feels wonderfully:

From one side I enjoyed the world of Morrowind and all the history, cities, and characters that I managed to meet along the way. The game has rich lore and we can see that the devs put in a lot of effort on this one.

The game play itself was good as well. I played the game on Steam Deck and in my opinion the game should be in the status of ""Verified"" rather than ""Playable"" as I had no problems with it, nor did I have to make any changes to the default control settings either in-game or for the Steam Deck. The game did freeze up on me once or twice during my playtime but the game is stable on Steam Deck.

The problem I have with this game is the progression blocker that might appear depending on how you build your initial character. During one of the story missions, you have to recover an artifact from an area that has ghost enemies in it. At no point does the game ever explain or highlight what do you need to do hurt those enemies so after searching the internet I discovered you either need an enchanted or a silver weapon.

The thing is that you can't use any silver weapon, it has to be one that specific to your build, so for example if you have low skill points in using long weapons your weapon won't hit the enemy (even if you can see the weapon going through the enemy's body) and since I wasn't going for the magic build/user I didn't have any of the Enchanting skills.

Overall, I would recommend the game, but be careful when building your character and where you place the skill points into as this is important at the start of the game.",1677240557,1677240557,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

first of all you need to read a small novel amount of text by the time you ''talked'' to everyone in first city (if you consider vikipedia style text boxes with pages of info are dialog), not counting the books and notes. you'll be showered with 10's of, ancient roman or sci-fi sounding hard to remember names while doing it.
 now i'm not against reading in games. pillars of eternity is one of my favorite video game  and it is basically an interactive book.   but it is presented so poorly. you need to pick and every option (which is ever extending) in ''dialog tree'' to see if the npc you are talking has any original line in it.
 i dont know about whole game i only played 6 hours but i dont think this is an rpg, in a sense you have no choice to do anything but quests tell you to do. 
  for example i started mages guild quest and to become aprentice i needed to do the quests of one npc which is sabotaging another aprentice's project and i didn't want to do it i talked to everyone in the guild selected every ''dialog options'' but none of them had any options to disrupt sabotage itself or telling on the quest giver. i had to act in only one strict manner to complete the quest. i saw hundreds of videos and posts on internet about how skyrim was dumbed down elderscrool experience. but remember feandal's quest on riverwood, the love triangle one you could have turned on both quest givers or choose to help either of them. it is an rpg you make choices it effects the world. not in morrowind i guess.
  i can write about annoying fatigue system which even the official manual suggests that you cheese it trough resting for an hour instead of waiting it to regen or how no fast travelling/teleport and restricted carry weight makes you bactrack alot.  or fucking alchemy system....
  look i just played gothic 1 before trying this which released before this game. i'm not some zoomer who can not play an old game. 
  i think in 2023 where we have so many great games to play that even if we give all of our waking hours we would die before trying even 1% of it, morrowind isn't a good choice to spend your time on.

Morrowind basically gives a journal and updates your progress on quests and where to go but never tells you where to look. This can result in very rewarding conclusions when you find your destination yourself, or frustrating moments getting lost when there's no fast travel, and some clunky combat where you're not sure if you're missing because your skill is low or the hitbox is wonky. Fights can be very basic but the weapons are varied like broadswords that work most any way you use them, spears that don't chop well so you're expected to move forward and back in a thrusting motion, or katanas that only work with chops and swings. Compared to Skyrim's barebones weapons where swords tend to swing quicker and hammers tend to do more damage generally. This also applies to birthsigns where you could have a free stun ability per day, a decent lock open, shrug off most magic attacks, or challenge yourself with a heal spell in exchange for vulnerability to fire.
Back to having to navigate the world yourself, Oblivion you mostly want to get to the next green field, meanwhile the volcanic landscape and Dunmer buildings feel so alien. Imagine having to walk across Skyrim except you come across deserts and mud cities and dwarven ruins. Again while the archaic travel system is annoying you're never somewhere not interesting. You walk into a mine where they gather eggs from these worms that are scattered across the place, just an alternative to thieves dens and crypts patrolled by bone walkers.
The game is far from balanced, it's famous for breaking if you get deep into enchanting and especially alchemy once you have a merchant who can always hand over fortify intelligence items. This is more of a bonus since there are plenty of ways to get powerful items and just explore at your own pace. Consider this, Skyrim will make quest characters immortal just so you can always finish the game, Morrowind just makes sure you know the main story is screwed if you murder someone important, you're free to make mistakes and use high level weapons to feel powerful, just like you can craft spells too powerful to ever use if you're not paying attention. The game can be difficult but if you play loose with stealing and learn where certain items are and understand what skills you'll need early when making your character you can roll through it easy. It's not for everyone and again exploitable to a fault, but if you can get into it there's some surprising depth that later Bethesda games are missing.",1676283019,1676283019,True,1,0,0.505508959293365479,0,True,False,False

There were decisions that changed the creative direction of the game. Those decisions that made a smaller more controlled world for better or worse, is what led to Morrowind. The game has many flaws, early game combat mechanics have not aged well. No one likes the flying assholes. That being said, you are doing yourself a huge disservice to not dive into this game headfirst and immerse. This is one of those games that TRULY sucks you in. You won't have quest pointers, but the decisions you make really craft a unique adventure. That itchy open world feeling you get after the intro scenes in oblivion and skyrim are far different from the quest you are given in Morrowind. The amount of guilds and factions are quite a bit more numerous than later entries, and there is a near endless supply of fun mysteries and dungeons to explore.

Breast is just a term for the upper chest area in general, no it isn't insensitive to Argonians. You know just as well as i do that some Argonians most absolutely do have breast. Anyway these ashlanders rocked up on me and began asking me questions like how do you say mongrel dog in old Aldmaris, and how do you say ""i am a god"" in Akaviri. Obviously being a God and also having been born and raise speeking Aldmaris I answered the first question immediately. The second question however was much more difficult, I have never seen an Akaviri. I know that shirtless crackhead who gave you you're orders for a while was an Akaviri fanboy, one of those blades weirdos but i'm 90% sure he doesn't actually speak Akaviri. The invasion happened after my time, and i'm not a fan of the Akaviri anime people keep speaking of, in anycase I wasn't able to answer this question so they beat the fuck out of my legs with chitin maces and threatened that they would be back tomorrow for more questions. I heard them mentioning they worshiped the great language owl. I am terrified Nerevar, I'am scared of what these cultist might do. I havent left red mountain in weeks, which was alright at first I have been just playing League of Legends but i'm starting to run out of food and the ash vampires are worried about me, but I know those green owl language cultist are out there and i know they are going to come for me and beat the duck out of my legs again.

I decided to play Morrowind after hearing many positive reviews and being a fan of other Bethesda games like Skyrim and Fallout. Going into the game, I was expecting an immersive and expansive world with interesting characters and a rich narrative.

Morrowind is an open-world role-playing game developed by Bethesda Softworks and released in 2002. Set in the fictional island of Vvardenfell, the game tasks players with taking on the role of a prisoner who has been released into the world by the Emperor and must fulfill a prophecy in order to save the world from an impending disaster.


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Morrowind features an open-world sandbox-style gameplay, allowing players to explore the island of Vvardenfell and complete quests in any order they choose. The game uses a point-and-click system for movement and combat, which can take some getting used to but ultimately feels responsive and intuitive. Players can choose from a variety of races and classes, each with their own unique abilities and skills. One of the standout features of the gameplay is the ability to use magic, which can be customized and combined in various ways to create powerful spells. I did encounter some bugs and glitches during my gameplay, but they were infrequent and did not significantly impact my experience.

[h1]Story:[/h1]
The story of Morrowind revolves around the player character fulfilling a prophecy to become the ""Nerevarine,"" a savior figure who must stop the return of the demigod Dagoth Ur and prevent the destruction of the world. Along the way, players will encounter a variety of characters and factions, each with their own goals and agendas. The pacing of the story is fairly slow, but I found the world-building and character development to be well-done and engaging.

[h1]Graphics and Sound:[/h1]
Morrowind has a unique and distinctive visual style, with detailed character models and a vibrant color palette. However, the graphics are somewhat dated by modern standards and may not hold up well for players who are used to more realistic graphics. The sound design is solid, with a memorable soundtrack, although voice acting in this game is reserved for the important characters, most of the game is told through text.

[h1]Replay Value:[/h1]
Morrowind has high replay value due to its open-world sandbox gameplay and the ability to create multiple characters with different races and classes. There are also many side quests and hidden locations to discover, as well as multiple endings based on the player's choices. Overall, I would definitely recommend Morrowind to fans of open-world role-playing games and those looking for a challenging and immersive experience.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
In conclusion, Morrowind is a classic open-world role-playing game that offers a vast and detailed world to explore, interesting characters and a compelling story. While the graphics and gameplay mechanics may feel dated, the depth and replay value of the game more than make up for it. If you're a fan of Bethesda's other games or just enjoy open-world RPGs in general, Morrowind is definitely worth checking out.",1672783245,1675863378,True,3,0,0.532710254192352295,0,True,False,False

I am not as high on some aspects of the game as other people may be, granted; it released in 2002 (features being incredibly aged, some downright unplayable to a lot of modern audiences). There are plenty of quests or locations not as poignant or expansive as a lot of people might claim, but I think this game is greater than the sum of its lesser parts. I think ultimately, Morrowind excels in its well-thought world-building, tremendous main story beats, and stand-out art direction.

Honestly I wished Daggerfall and Oblivion had the kind of side content this game and Skyrim has, it would make it top notch games. 

I am not a fan of how the map, quest, and fatigue system works, I ended having to use console commands to make it better for me to play and get used to, and it was a difficult introduction for me to play, no joke, but the more I played, and the more I dedicated myself to play, the more worth it got, can't say enough about this game.

Morrowind is a very special contribution to the Elder Scrolls Series, especially being the game that set the precedent for later games. The world feels alien and full of mystique, and even though the graphics are dated by today's standards there is still a lot of beauty to be found in the landscape. Each item and asset has its own unique style. There is something different about the world, It is obviously very much inspired by medieval times but it is fantastical and alien and not so stiffly rooted in reality. The map may be smaller than later games, but it feels vast due to the limitations on fast travel (I have 157 hours in the game and still have not traversed the entire map. But I also like to take my time). A very interesting choice was to have ""fast travel"" in the form of various transportation systems, which really keeps the immersion. You can pay a fare to travel by boat or silt strider, etc., and each method of travel has a specific route that they follow so oftentimes you must jump from port to port. With Morrowind, it feels like you are a PART of this world.

The gameplay is very unforgiving towards newcomers (much like the people), but once you level up it feels a lot more balanced. Morrowind very much leans into traditional roleplaying aspects, with many actions being ""roll"" and ""chance"" based. The lower your skill, the less chance you have of successfully performing an action (lockpicking, blocking, attacking). With each successful ""roll"", you gain skill. There are also no quest markers, which can be confusing but also greatly rewarding. You must pay close attention to your journal and to the directions that people give you, which sometimes may be a bit misleading. In this way you are not just checking off quest markers and blindly following it to the next location, you have to do a lot more problem solving and exploration in order to achieve your goal.

That being said Morrowind is just one of those game that you will get lost into. The main draw is its world and nearly endless depth it has to offer from it mechanics, lore, geography, characters, and quest which all tie these things together into a singular experience.
As an open world game, the game shines as it provides alot of incentive to explore. The lack of quest markers make it so you will have to explore and learn the lay of the land to get around efficiently. There is a great variety in it landscape with many different biomes and different cities/ towns with their own culture that stand our from the rest. There are many different joinable factions that often have competing interest which naturally leads to inter faction conflict often not seen in other Elder Scrolls games. The rewards it has to offer are immense and the quests you go on to find such rewards often will be unique to you as the game does not hold your hand on where you go or how you choose to complete your objectives. I don't think I ever played another open world game with such intricate systems that ties so well together to make such a small world feel like a gigantic place with endless opportunity to have fun.

As a RPG, like the other elder scrolls games its very free form with how you build your character. Arguably the leveling is better than both of it successors as it allows for more free form build that due to the amount of skill that stress the traditional melee,magic, and stealth archetypes to where hybrid classes are very easy to create so every character you make feel unique. Since there is a fixed difficulty of the world, the game starts out pretty rough and you will die alot! However due to that fixed difficulty as you level you really feel like you character grows in power finding new weapons, armor, spells, etc feel like a genuine treat as it makes your journey that much easier and allows you to take on even more challenges. Morrowind is most beginner friendly to combat classes as it is relatively easier to level those skills. The games magic system is fantastic as there is so much freedom in how you can use magic to solve problems. Magic spells, enchanted items are an essential part of Morrowind and why it makes the game so special. Alchemy, enchanting and especially spell crafting are amazing tools that make nearly solve any problem if you are creative enough and it rewards players who pay attention to the games systems. Stealth on other other I would say is the only thing that isn't changed much from other elder scrolls games. I would not recommend going stealth in your first play through as I found it to be harder to get into for first timers. 

Overall Morrowind is a rabbit hole that I preface by saying !CAUTION! you might get completely lost down as you sink hundreds of hours exploring the world and exploring the all possible character builds in one of the greatest RPGs of all time and one of the greatest open world RPGs. The game has aged like wine, and provides an incredible contrast to many modern open world that sacrifice so much for convenience and streamlining that they lose something along the way. And that is a strong sense of almost childlike mystery to the world, begging to be explored and making you feel that  your adventures feel truly like that; an adventure, personal to you and not having your hand held like in other open world games that feel like a trip to Disneyland.

short version - there are 3 groups of people
Skyrim fans - yung´ uns who dont know better
Oblivion fans - which isnt the same game as Morrowind, its good but it doesnt really compare
Morrowind - what can i say im a Morrowind fanboy

 
TLDR
I got this game as a package deal when i bought my first 3DFX Video Card - back when we had flinstone cars.
It lay in my drawer for about 2 years. Then i tried to play it for lack of other games obviously.. back then internet was only for a chosen few and gaming magazines were only surfacing. So i didnt have a clue as to what i had there. One day i decided ima dig through the at that time walls of text and really give it a go.. Took me about 3 months to finish the game and boy oh boy it was the best experience.. i still play it from time to time, mostly to explore and try things i havent yet.

The game is nearly unplayable without patching and optimizing the graphics due to the games heavy reliance on visual markers and landmarks for doing quests and the aforementioned fog makes this nigh impossible without going through the tedious time consuming process of fixing the graphics (removing the fog and optimizing building meshes via mods).

Morrowind is the last unfiltered Elder Scrolls experience. This game does so many things better than others in the series while requiring players to read and understand the world they're in to progress. I love each Elder Scrolls game for different reasons, but Morrowind is special. Quests are not guided by markers, instead you have a detailed journal which gets updated with automatic notes. These notes give a general path to proceed and require you to be engaged with the story. The inventory/spell/equipment menu is better and more responsive than any other Elder Scrolls game which in my opinion became clunkier slow (without the assistance of mods). You can open your map, inventory, spell menu, and equipment, all just by right clicking and everything is intractable and movable. 

Morrowind doesn't give care if you're the main character or on a quest. If you're exploring and piss off a Daedra by saying something they don't like one might cancel dialogue with you by saying ""After I kill you, I will r*pe your corpse. Don't worry, I'll be gentle."", and then proceed to spawn a corpus beat and beating you in the face with a Daedric axe. 

The main story of Morrowind is intense. You are the Nerevarine, a subject of the local Ashlander prophecy which is destined to kill Dagoth Ur, who is corrupting the minds of the people in Morrowind. As you progress through the story more and more corrupted Dark Elves start getting afflicated. You are commission by a member of The Blades to stop this threat.

The biggest complaint, mostly due to it being the first problem everybody experiences, is attacks and hits missing. Even if you're standing right in front of an enemy, with a low skill your attacks might miss, which can be incredibly frustrating for a new player. This obviously gets better and better as you level up but I can completely understand why a new player might think the game is buggy or broken from this experience.

The coolest part of Morrowind is it is the only Elder Scrolls game to have truly 3D game play. This game features levitation which even becomes a requirement to complete the main quest. The Telvanni wizards live in tall fungi towers, and as they're wizards you can only explore the hallways by levitating up. This translates into the rest of the world through caves, dungeons, and other towns. After you master a levitation spell or have an enchanted item you can fly around a city or volcano to find your destination.

Morrowind GOTY includes two DLC's, Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Fans of Skyrim will recognize Bloodmoon as it's Solstheim (Dragonborn DLC). I won't detail too much, but you're able to build the city of Raven Rock which you visit in Skyrim with the assistance of the East Empire Trading Company. Both of the DLC's add a ton of value to the game and are full of interesting lore and decisions. I can't get into the details of Tribunal without spoiling too much, however you gain access to two cities which includes a intricate sewer system. You're able to engage with the Dark Brotherhood, Tribunal Temple, and Gods themselves.

The guilds in Morrowind are done perfectly. They require specific tasks relevant to the guild and in order to receive a promotion your skills in the related areas must be met. In Morrowind, you won't become the Archmage unless you are an actual master mage. This is the same for the Thieves & Fighter's Guild. A unique part of Morrowind is the Morag Tong. The Tong are an assassination guild which operate within the law of Morrowind as they have 'writs' which allow them to legally execute people. This guild is by far the most interesting because even if caught by a guard, displaying your writ allows you to freely walk away. Another unique group in Morrowind is the Temple.

Similar to Guilds, Morrowind features ""Houses"", which each have their own intricate story lines. Each House has their own style of operating, ranging from political warriors to homicidal rogue wizards who live in desolate fungus towers. You can choose whichever you wish to join and can gain rank and prestige. Each house also includes a compound you can build from the ground up which operates as a base.

Magic in Morrowind is better than any other game in the series. The amount of spells you can use is incredible. There's simple stuff like mark/recall, where you can instantly teleport back to any point in the game you set, and conjuration where you can summon a huge variety of creatures. This includes enchanting as well, as you can associate spells to items and utilize this same spell list. Every magic related mod I've found for Oblivion/Skyrim is just trying to achieve what vanilla Morrowind offered.

Equipment in Morrowind is once again the best of any Elder Scrolls game. You can wear layers of equipment which offers a huge array of loadouts. You can wear a shirt/pants, put armor on top of this, and then wear a robe over all of this. Armor is split into pieces: helmet, shoulders (left and right), hands (left and right), chest, waist, legs, boots (left/right). You can also wear two rings and a necklace. So in Morrowind you can wear 16 pieces of equipment at once, all with their own unique enchantments. This doesn't include weapons or shields.

Oblivion and Skyrim have nothing on the Morrowind experience. Unlike Skyrim, there are many, many ways to play this game (other than stealth archer). Unlike Oblivion, your choices actually matter. Joining one faction might actually lock you out of another.

Pros of this game compared to other Elder Scrolls games:
- 3 armor classes (light, medium, heavy)
- wear clothing underneath, robes over armor (so many equipment slots!)
- more than 3 weapon classes (blade, axe, blunt, marksman, and spear - yes, this game has *spears*, aka the most commonly used weapon across all of human history, across the globe)
- you can ascend to divine status in power (become literally unkillable or invest all your points in strength so that the moment you hit someone your sword actually breaks on their skull)

Cons of this game compared to other Elder Scrolls games:
- you need a brain to play it (no map markers, you actually have to *read* journal entries)
- cliff racers

I asked my N'wah Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my N'wah wife had died.

I'm not going to fawn over it like some fans do, I'll shoot it to you straight: This game is not for everyone. The combat is dated and clunky, even more so than Oblivion, The game does not tell you much: It has no quest markers; you have to look for clues yourself and think a little harder. If a quest tells you to go to a cave, your journal will say ""Its so far north of Such and Such town, over to the bridge, turn southwest and head into the hills."" And you'll have to go looking, which is only made more arduous because running (which isn't that fast to begin with) costs fatigue, which you need to save for a fight.

All in all though, if those are pains you think you can deal with, there is no better game for you than Morrowind.

Edit: You DO NOT need mods. I’ve seen multiple people say that, but it honestly is not true it is quite easy enough without them. Yes, combat can be excessively frustrating and stupid at times, but all it takes is practice or money. (Which is easy to get if you have a few invisibility potions or the Moonshadow ability; use it and loot the treasuries in Vivec. You could also sell items to the museum, steal them back, and sell them again to the Mudcrab Merchant.) One of the early East Empire Company quests requires an unexpected skill in hand to hand. Most people seem to think that you have to spend thousands of septims to train this skill just to proceed with the quest. HOWEVER, most, if not all, factions have hand to hand trainers, and you only need about 20 skill level. Also, if you’re a vet and are just looking at these reviews for fun, try being a khajit with a hand to hand major skill. It’s quite fun. Even if you don’t like the genre, give it a shot! If you follow the main quest right off the bat, it gets boring fast. Try something else for a while, like the thieves guild, and save the main quest for later when you’ve got better gear.

It´s an opaque pile of clunk that wards away any potential enjoyers by carefully making all of its gameplay mechanics just barely ridiculous enough that they seem totally unfair and arbitrary.

Never being able to hit anyone even when they´re standing right in front of you? Having to walk (literally walk) everywhere? Getting your strength sapped until you just straight up permanently can´t move? Getting attacked by a guy with a dagger that paralyzes you for 5 seconds per hit? There´s plenty of bullshit in the game, but the true goal of Morrowind is this:

Don´t complain about the bullshit. Embrace the bullshit, learn how your enemy shamefully fucks you over, then copy their strategies, develop them, and learn the art of using a spell to permanently lock an enemy in place, stand 2 meters away from them and mercilessly poke them in the face with your spear while they swing their 1 meter long sword at you in vain. Embrace the subtle intricacies of stacking 5 different weaknesses onto one enemy and doing like 8000 damage in one hit. Study the ways of alcoholism to reach levels of power so great that you can hit an enemy so hard, both he and your weapon will explode.

Ultimately, the more you learn about the mechanics, the more you learn how to break them, and that is basically how to play Morrowind.

Some people would have you believe this game is for 150+ IQ gentlemen, but who it´s really for is persistent dumbasses who will keep trying until they learn how to absolutely bend the game over their knee one day.

The game isn't just buggy, it presents a different kind of ethical gameplay system in INTERPRETING it's bugs. Was this intentional? Did the developers mean for you to push this or that? Can you avoid the temptation to cheat when it's simply so easy? Interpreting the game's systems intent and trying to stay in the intended limits of the game is the most rewarding experience to me but even then, I'd love to lock Todd Howard in a room and ask him if they really wanted me to achieve 100% CE reflect armor, get variable but permanent strength bonuses, farm golden saint souls, have my merchantile LOWER the sell price yet make money trivial by simply buying and selling the same items. Did they mean for armorer hammers to restock on vendors based on how many I SOLD them, not how many they started with? 

The graphics can be brought up to roughly oblivion level (which to me means never wanting to play oblivion again) but you have to be real careful with your mods.

No other game has managed to alienate and entice as much at the same time, coming from modern ""RPG""s, the first 15 hours of the game feel purpose built to frustrate and alienate the inexperienced, in what other game are you expected to explore a vast over-world map with a ""running"" speed slower than cycling uphill? Or punished so brutally for a poor character build that countless would-be fans quit after dying to a Mudcrab right outside the starting zone, even once you've got your character built in order, and yet, those who make it past those tedious first hours and rewarded with one of the most immersive and richest role-playing games to date.

Being the first role-playing game I ever experienced, Oblivion holds a special place in my heart, and in many ways it's an inversion of Morrowind's mechanics and design philosophies, Morrowind doesn't have quest markers or particularly subversive narratives, because the game designers intended for the exploration to be part of each quest, Oblivion did away with hit failure chance and replaced it with damage (which scales with the difficulty slider) because the designers wanted even the worst builds to still stand a chance, Morrowind was set in the alien Vvardenfell and spent a great deal of its efforts on world building and it's thoroughly detailed factions, whereas Oblivion was set in the familiar Cyrodil and did away with the naunces for simpler, yet recognizable archetypes. The end result? Morrowind is a game that baffles newcomers but breeds obsession in veterans, Oblivion is a game that fascinates newcomers but is utterly idiotic to veterans. 

I think this is why so many Morrowind ""elitists"" exist, and so many embittered Oblivion/Skyrim fans fail to get into this game. I don't blame them, Morrowind is an enthralling game that is overshadowed by the mechanically absurd Oblivion, and completely shrouded by the laughably shallow Skyrim because at the end of the day, Morrowind just isn't fit for the modern RPG audience, and despite that, I don't think there is a single thing wrong with Morrowind's mechanics, hit chance, spell failure, no map markers, slow walking speed and no fast travel is genius once you figure out how it all fits together, and just how much was lost in the transition to Oblivion. 

Despite this, if you've tried and failed time and time again, then it's okay to use console commands to raise your speed attribute, and it's okay to occasionally use the wiki if you're lost, as your understanding of the game's mechanics improve, you'll eventually learn how to work these systems in your favour, and you'll be off to enjoying the greatest Elder Scrolls game that will ever be made.",1673219801,1673220058,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

This game an absolutely repellent, frustrating, obtuse mess with dire gameplay (especially at the start), and it took me years and 4 attempted playthroughs to decide it was worth my time and commit to a full playthrough. When I did though, I got into it very much and I didn't realise I had put over 100 hours into it until today; it was like Stockholm syndrome. As much as I feel like the game hates me for having the audacity of playing it sometimes, it is very fun, and exploring the various areas and missions is interesting for the most part. The loot progression feels satisfying too, you can eventually become godlike to match your jesusy prophecy, especially if you abuse the alchemy system which is incredibly easy and something I absolutely did.

However it didn't even help that much towards the end and especially the DLCs which have horribly balanced enemies. Speaking of horribly balanced enemies! Every wizard you meet in this game, if they are an enemy, spawns a zombie at you immediately which has an attack that drains your strength, which effects your carry weight, and when you get hit enough you are essentially just pinned in place, and if you're not psychic enough to have brought potions of restore strength, you're fucked. You need to load a save. This is one of the most god fucking awful design choices I have ever seen in a game and if critics at the time had run into this then bethesda would not exist today, but I digress. I did have a great deal of fun with morrowind, and I beat it and its DLCs (why is solstheim just a huge flat plane with like 2 interesting things?) AND its thrown together guild quests (like the majority of the morag tong, fighter's guild, and temple quests are just ""GO HERE - KILL HIM"" deals, a thing people praise this game for but shit on fallout 4 for which I'll never understand). 

All in all I'd say this is a bad game with good qualities, it does not hold up to today's standards and you need to mod it a bit to get it to run on modern hardware properly, and when you do get it working the gameplay is 80% slowly trudging from place to place. If you're looking to get into the elder scrolls series and somehow haven't played skyrim yet, get that instead, it's objectively the better game in every aspect (as much as the weirdos that champion this game would try to convince you otherwise, they're blinkered by nostalgia, pay them no heed.) but do pick this up on a heavy sale when you can because once you get into it and I mean REALLY into it there's fun to be had, you just need to try and get blood from a stone, so to speak.",1673139232,1673139232,False,3,0,0.473522007465362549,0,True,False,False

This game, if you can get past the dice rolling for hits, is really fun and easy to cheese with things like blinding speed, but also immersive in a way Oblivion just wasn't for me. 

I'd say in the elder scrolls series Skyrim came closest to capturing just the feeling of immersion and escapism, because both Skyrim and Morrowind somewhat and especially for Morrowind depart from Oblivion's standard fantasy feel, though I will say that Oblivion is at the very least unintentionally funny, and its writing is definitely superior to Skyrim's, but its ambience just can't match that of Skyrim and Morrowind.

The province of Morrowind is one of the strangest and most alien-feeling places in gaming, while also being completely believable as a real place due to excellent execution.

The gameplay and progression are a complete circus where you can put paralysis on your weapon, which freezes your enemy in place, letting you hit them again and reapply it before it wears off. Or you can just use magic which deflects all physical attacks. The only catch being, the enemies can do all of that as well. I was once attacked by a low level bandit with a dagger which paralyzed me, so I could do nothing as he hit me again and again, reapplying the paralysis each time. It took him about a minute to kill me, and I couldn't do anything at all. When I reloaded my save, I managed to get the first hit in, so I could do this exact same thing to him.

Luckily, the game included a wonderful piece of software: The Elder Scroll Construction Set, thus within a few years of heavy modding, the game became playable.

If you are going to play TES III today, I would recommend at the very least the following mods:
- Morrowind Patch Project (MPP) - tons of bug fixes.
- Morrowind Code Patch (MCP) - unless you like your games to hang randomly.
- MGE XE - so you can play at 1920x1080 or higher resolutions.
- Living Cities of Vvanderfell - puts the ""I"" in ""AI"".
- Herbalism - makes resource gathering interesting.
- Speed and Stamina or Run Faster - the original walking/running speed is just too bloody slow.
- Better Dialogue Font - you want this if you use MCP/MGE XE.

So [i]after all the modding[/i], this is what you can expect:
[b]PROs:[/b]
[list]
[*]Open-ended: ignore the boring plot and do whatever you want! You can explore the world, join factions, be a mercenary, a burglar, an alchemist, a merchant, whatever really. Play the way you want.
[*]You can build your own class, mix and match skills, racial abilities and so on. Play the character you want.
[*]No hand-olding, no babysitting. Finally an RPG where you don't spend most of the time following a bloody arrow or looking for the guy with an icon over its head. The map isn't already explored for you, the journal is not a list of quests and objectives, but rather a list of notes and clues.
[*]With all mods and expansions, the world is really huge and varied. Jungles, rocky mountains, icy islands, misty forests and more!
[*]Dungeons are really well crafted.
[*]The athmospheric music keeps you in the right mood.
[*]Even though the graphics are dated, visuals are still pretty good.
[/list]
[b]CONs:[/b]
[list]
[*]Despite the mods, many NPCs still are unblinking statues who are either bolted down or walking in circles all the bloody time. This is a step backwards from Daggerfall, and especially annoying if you are playing a thief. Suppose you break into a shop in the dark of night, anticipating the riches you will find in all those locked, unattended chests and... instead you find the shopkeeper there at the counter. Motionless. Unblinking. Running his business 24/7 (better than a Tesco Extra!).
[*]The plot is trite and boring. You are the chosen one and must save the world. Again. The world just can't stay saved for a while. Do yourself a favour: ignore all that rubbish and go exploring, or join a faction, or anything else.

wanna make a nuke spell that deals 100 damage every second for 10 seconds? you can.
wanna utterly break the game by stacking potions? you can.
wanna kill every NPC in the game? you can, hell, you can complete the main quest if you kill most important NPCs except for one. i managed to become the leader of a house by killing the other members and proclaiming myself as the leader.
the game rewards you for exploring dangerous areas, you can get near end-game armor at level 1 if you rush to certain dungeons.
if you find a way to cheese an enemy without breaking the game you should do it, because the game won't hold back and if the enemy can, they WILL stunlock you with a sword of paralysis that lasts 10 seconds and keeps re-applying every hit.
this is the only game in TES games that made me want to read the books that were in libraries and sold in-game because the lore got me hooked.
now for the people who don't like the dice roll mechanic, there are mods that make every hit land(it kinda makes the game easy so try to adjust the difficulty a bit higher), i also recommend installing morrowind graphics extender too(not necessary if you use openmw), morrowind code patch and fair magicka regen.
other than that if you are a new player i advice you, read, if you want to not miss as much make sure your desired weapon/spell skill is leveled up fairly enough(40 is good, you can get this much in the character creation with by choosing it in major skills) and for pure melee players when you level up try to get +5 agility each level up and in no time you will barely miss any attacks, and last but not least, GET A RESTORE STRENGTH SPELL/STACK UP ON RESTORE STRENGTH POTIONS, you will know why when it happens, i don't want you to go through my pain.

If this is your first time playing, you'll probably be turned off by the chance-based combat, and I don't blame you. Just remember that this was made to be like an infinity engine cRPG (i.e baldur's gate), but first person. keep that in mind, and the roll-to-hit combat will be a lot more palatable.
When I played this on my dad's xbox as a kid, I'd always get to balmora and then just refuse to do anything story related. This game allows you to go off script and kill story npcs, which I used to think was the funniest shit (and still do).

Everything is more challenging and takes more time, and, no fast travel being present, (excepting boats, siltstriders and mage guilds) you may get bored of walking the same paths multiple times. 
However, as a whole, Morowind gives a great feeling of adventuring, a great feeling of character building and a great feeling of heroism!

I remember going to Wal-mart as a teenager and buying this game from the $10 PC games section after my best friend showed it to me. Our home computer couldn't run it yet (didn't know that when I bought it) so my brother and I saved up for a new video card that would allow us to play. I was so excited when the video card showed up.

The world was massive and so much fun to explore. Discovering rare artifacts like ""The Boots of the Apostle"" or ""The Sword of White Woe"" was a highlight of my play experience.

Playing the game now, it feels very dated. But I still really enjoy it. My favorite way to play the game as an adult is to create a character and give myself rules for how that character would act. I'm currently playing an ""honest"" Nord that won't kill (unless provoked) or steal. It forces me to change up the way I normally ""exploit"" my own knowledge of the game when making a new character.

And the game can be easily exploited. It feels like cheating when you understand how the mechanics work and where to find all the good loot. Creating rules for myself as I play (to avoid exploiting the game a bunch) has helped me enjoy the game again.

1. [u] OpenMW  [/u]

OpenMW is an open source port of Morrowind that fixes game-breaking bugs, adds additional graphics options, and in general improves the stability of the game while being incredibly easy to set up and use. 

Whether you're playing vanilla (which you should for your first play through) or modded, there's not much reason not to use it unless you're a vanilla purist or something.

2. [u] Don't be afraid to experiment with making new characters. [/u]

Morrowinds tutorial can be finished in just a few minutes, so if you make a character and you're not enjoying the race or class you've chosen, you can quickly make a new one until you find something you enjoy.

I would also recommend not using any of the default classes and just making your own, don't put skills you're not going to use in your major skills, that's advice for experienced players to min-max.

Also, do NOT take the iron dagger unless you're going to sell it. It's a trap that makes people think the combat sucks when they put long blade in their major skills and wonder why they miss with a short blade. If you do make a short blade build, you can buy an iron short sword in the starting town store that outclasses it in every way.

3. [u] Beast Races. [/u]

Beast races work very differently in Morrowind than they do in Oblivion or Skyrim. They can't wear closed face helmets or any kind of footwear, and are naturally disliked by most of the other races. 

While these aren't issues late game players have to worry about, new players may want to avoid them as they can make the early game more difficult.

4. [u] Early on you will miss a lot of your attacks. [/u]

Hit chance in Morrowind is affected by primarily two things your characters skill with the weapon and your fatigue. You shouldn't run into a fight exhausted swinging a weapon your character has no knowledge of how to use, and wonder why you can't hit anything. 

Later on, when your skill with a weapon type gets in the 50 to 75 range, you'll be landing most of your hits at high stamina.

If you play a mage, you don't have to worry about hit chance, but instead spell cast chance. If you choose any of the magic schools for your major skills, you will start with a few basic spells related to that school of magic (alteration, for example, lets you start with water walking) with a near guaranteed chance to cast them.

5. [u] Learn to manage your fatigue. [/u]

Unlike Oblivion (where fatigue mainly influences melee damage) and Skyrim (where stamina is only used for power attacks and sprinting), fatigue in Morrowind affects basically everything you do. Such as your chance to cast spells, chance to hit, ability to talk to people, and even your jump height. 

Early game, you should always be careful to manage your fatigue while exploring if you think a fight might be coming up, and carry a few potions to restore it during fights. Late game players can create constant effect enchantments to restore fatigue even while running and jumping.

6. [u] There are a lot of ways to get around Vvardenfell. [/u]

If you've played the later Elder Scrolls games (or most other modern RPGs) you're probably familiar with fast travel systems, and you've probably also heard that Morrowind has no fast travel systems, which isn't entirely true. While the game has no map screen to point and click to where you want to instantly travel, there are a lot of other ways to get around. 

Silt Striders can take you to most of the major cities on the map; boats can take you to most of the islands around Vvardenfell, and the mages guild provides teleportation services to all of their guild halls.

Then there are the mark and recall spells that allow you to mark a location and teleport to it at will, and the spells and scrolls for Almsivi Intervention and Divine Intervention (both of which you can buy in the Seyda Neen general store early on) that instantly teleport you to the nearest Tribunal temple and Imperial chapel respectively.

7. [u] Getting lost isn't always a bad thing. [/u]

At some point in Morrowind every player will end up getting lost, whether it be due to the odd vague directions or just being stuck in the wilderness without an easy way back to a town. This can be frustrating, but most people can agree they've experienced the adventure that this usually brings. 

As an example, in my most recent playthrough I took a Fighters Guild job early on to help someone clear a Dwemer ruin in the Molag Mar region. I somehow got lost and ended up walking into a Dwemer ruin that was home to a powerful vampire clan. After lots of running away to rest, dying multiple times and barely managing to beat the vampires, I searched the ruins to find one of the two pairs of daedric boots, the best heavy armor in the game.

This is something I chose as an example of the game's systems working together to provide an honest adventure completely independent of the developers design. If this was Oblivion or Skyrim, I wouldn't have gotten lost because I always have a map marker pointing to exactly where I should go. I wouldn't have had to explore, and I wouldn't have mistakenly stumbled into that ruin.

8. [u] Don't be afraid to break the games balance. [/u]

Sometime near the end of the game you'll get to the point were you end up 2-shotting most enemies you come across and you won't be challenged by much apart from literal gods, a daedric prince, and the odd werewolf maze. But I don't see this as a flaw of the game that needed to be desperately fixed like it was in the later games. Besides, if you think it's getting too easy, you can always move the difficulty slider across a bit (even if it gives me PTSD because it reminds me of Oblivion's level scaling).

To me, Morrowind is almost asking for creative players to take advantage of all its systems in unpredictable ways to break the game in two. Like using a 1 second levitate on target spell to instantly make Cliff Racers fall to their death, or creating a 100-point fury spell that gives me the legal right to murder anyone I want for, you know, general use. 

My favorite is enchanting armor with constant effect shock damage on self, which I then sell to merchants who equip it because of its high value and instantly die, allowing me to take everything in their store.

[u] The End. [/u]

That's it. I was listening to Young Scrolls while writing this. I only really wrote all this because I adore Morrowind and wanted an excuse to give it a positive review.

my advice for being able to enjoy morrowind: before you start, go through the controls and change them to something more familiar, then install the unofficial code patch. once you start, make sure to pick a weapon type and stick with it. remember that your hit chance is tied to stamina, so always enter combat with a full bar and always keep stamina potions on you. that's all there is",1670989862,1670989897,True,23,0,0.726763546466827393,0,True,False,False

But the ""soul trap"" glitch makes me so strong that I just do as I please with this game and i love it. It's called the soul trap glitch but in reality any 1 pt target spell without an area of affect will work. Basically, in the spellmaker, if you attach any spell to a 1 pt target spell (without area of affect,) and aim for either the ground, or a wall, the other spell besides the target spell will become a permanent effect. Just dont hit an NPC with it. With the fortify attributes spell you can fortify any attribute to the thousands, and effectively faceroll the entire game. 

This game feels like it made to be exploited. I'm sad openMW doesnt include the soul trap glitch, but I guess that makes sense: it's not an intended feature. 

You can also fortify skills. For a while I would fortify personality permanently to anything greater than 2,000, but that would cause hostile NPC's to not attack. So I decided to leave fortify personality (with the help of Morrowind Code Patch) to a single, fortify personality 2000 for 1 second spell, which allows me to control when I need that personality boost. But the same could be achieved by using the 'fortify skill' spell to fortify your mercantile to over 400, i believe.

The Morrowind Code Patch also allows you to make spells stronger than 100 magnitude, up to 500 magnitude. Making a 500 magnitude levitation spell allows me to zip across the map, at what feels like faster than sound.

 fuck skyrim and oblivion sucks too.
important note:
people complaining about the ""alchemy loop"" are just idiots. make a few strong potions and keep them for later if you enchant (which you will eventually). people complain that enchanting fails repeatedly even at mid and high levels. the answer to this is to make at least 3 items enchanted with fortify intelligence 100 for 3, 4, or 5 seconds and (preferably) have a spell with fortify intelligence 100 for 2 seconds. cast all items, cast the spell last and then menu. most useful enchantments excluding constant effects will easily be done this way even with enchant skill ~35.
the rng combat could be better and the leveling system could also be better.
there is a window with text that pops up instead of listening to the npc drone on with the exact same voice as half of the npcs (like in skyrim). the text dialogue is much better. I cannot stand waiting for an idiotic npc to say the same stupid fucking line every time i talk to it.
also only random loot is leveled, which is great. npcs are not scaled to your level which is also great.
what the fuck is the point of leveling up if every npc in the world will always be your level????? stupid. fuck skyrim.

Pros.:
- Interesting story. It has many details, names, characters. And the twist that the protagonist is becoming the prophetic figure. For the time, it was a very smart decision to justify why the protagonist is cool, getting stronger and finally fights the antagonist.
- The world. It looks dull and boring. But Morrowind has interesting backstory, many characters for interaction, nice locations.
- There is a variety of paths to play the game. Also, Tribunal may be interesting as well as Bloodmoon. They expand the story.
- Main theme is legendary.
- Memes based on the game are awesome.

Basically, the coolest thing of the game is the story and world building. 

Cons.:
- The game is VERY outdated. The pace is slow, too much grind, the game literally forces you to grind, finish many alternative quest lines to actually do something in the main one. The Fifth and Fourth trials are trash - all that running around with stupid quests and begging to be named Nerevarin...
- Upgrading and lvl systems are trash too - you start the game jumping all the time to boost the skill. You have an alternative of training but it is costly. Need more money from the quests. Main quest line money making is unreasonably low. So, you HAVE to go around and finish as much as you can do.
- No fast travel. People tell - you need to explore the island. Screw the island - the huge chunk of it is just dusty, ugly ashlands. Bethesda did right when switched to fast travel (that I highly criticized for years).
- Too many boring quests. Dumb bring-take.
- The character is very slow regardless of your 100 speed.

There are more cons. The game is just outdated with its expansions. Better to play Skywind (when and if it's released) which should be adapted for the modern standards. This game is AWESOME and it WAS awesome. But its time passed long time ago. And for those, who remember playing it being 14-16 - too late guys.

Its unworldly yet familiar atmosphere blends fantasy, sci-fi, and metaphysical mysticism into an utterly enthralling game world. The depth and complexity to its world are both unrivaled. 

As for RPG elements, Morrowind is still the supreme example across the RPG genre. The sense of progression and the reward of learning the game, both mechanically and literally, is just unrivaled anywhere else. Your growth feels organic and compelling: you arrive in Morrowind an ignorant and sluggish foreigner. It is difficult to even move around. However, after a hard learning process, you become intimately familiar with the land around you. You learn its geography, you move more gracefully, and you are able to utter divine mantras to teleport at will. 

The mystique and wonder of this game, the idea that anything could await you at the bottom of that tomb or dungeon, is possible because it truly was a labor of love. Rather than holding your hand, Morrowind explains how its game world works through NPC dialogue, in-game books, and subtextual story-telling. What you do with it determines what you get out of the game. The unleveled world and hand-placed loot and enemies keeps the world exciting and dangerous. 

You can be whatever you want to be in this game and it will take your mind to places you never imagined. It is slow to get into, but that's for a good reason. The failed incarnations of the Nerevarine who gave up or died are the players who were unable to meet the challenge Morrowind demanded from them.

In the Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, you play as Bethesda employee Michael Kirkbride as he attempts to keep himself awake for 2 weeks, in order to write all of the game’s lore. On your journey , you will:

- Fail to stab a worm
- Eventually succeed in stabbing a worm
- Move at the pace of said worm to your various destinations
- Meet Caius Brosades, the most attractive person on nirn since Lamae Beolfag (at least, according to Molag Bal)
- Take part in the Lego Movie’s funniest joke
- Rob a jewellery store of its cool space ring and defile some corpses (at the same time!)
- Create potions so powerful that you can vanquish any foe almost immediately
- Still get insulted by every man, mer and beast under the sun for being too weak.
- Perform sexual favours for your higher ups, in order to rise the ranks in your company. Based on real life Activision policy.
- Catch rabies from an elephant priest
- Usurp the godhead
- Not really that last one. it would be cool though, right?
- Achieve CHIM every time you die apparently
- Meet the God-King of Ukraine, Vivisection
- Have rape threats made against you. That is not a joke it can actually happen in game what the fuck.

Truly a diamond in the rough, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is the only game in the Elder Scrolls series that places you in a unique fantasy world, the rest of the games unfortunately place you in a carbon copy of the LOTR universe, with no differences or unique ideas at all.

If Elder Scrolls VI is not just Morrowind 2, I will be furious.

Nothing drastic, just a few things to scale the graphics for modern screens, a few bug-fixing packs, and maybe something to improve FPS and increase the view distance.

The soundtrack is absolutely magical, and I feel like this is the core component that helps you travel to Vvardenfell and feel as though you're part of something, despite the not-so-immersive graphics. The music is truly soothing when it needs to be, and while the combat music isn't quite as good, can certainly pump you up when it needs to.

The graphics... well, it's a 20-year-old game. I need not go over the technological revolutions and progress that have taken place since then. That being said, it was a big leap forward for its time, and I believe the way the world is designed holds up to this very day.

The worldbuilding is something else. The quests, the NPCs, the story...

If it's your first time playing, I highly recommend using OpenMW. It's a more stable engine, with a few QoL upgrades (like saves being sorted by character), whilst keeping the original experience in-tact.

Also understand that you live and die by your build. Many first time players pick up that little iron dagger in the census office, and are baffled to why they can't hit anything, when in Oblivion and Skyrim you could pretty much pick up anything you found. If you don't have Short Blade as a Major Skill, you WILL NOT hit anything with Short Blades; this applies for everything in the game. Your skill level is a representation, in role-playing terms, how efficient your character is at utilizing that skill. If you've never done public speaking or don't understand Vvardenfell economics, how will you cut a great deal? That's represented by a default level of 5. But if you've studied or have knowledge regarding those topics, that's also represented in a higher skill level of around 40-50.

Weaknesses in your character build create interesting problems that require you to think outside the box. You won't be struggling for durability with a combat specialization, but it comes at the cost of the many allures magic brings with it. Magic and stealth builds typically won't struggle with opening locks or traversal, due to levitation, teleportation and speed amplification spells, but combat specs will need to think about the options available to them. They can lightly dip their toes into magic as a major skill, so they have a bit of utility, or they can purchase scrolls as a gold sink alongside training. On the other side of the coin, magic builds need to think about how they're going to survive the early game, as mages are usually made of paper, and alchemy is usually a staple of such builds for the purpose of making gold to afford training and spell-making (easily the best mechanic in Morrowind). You're always planning, prepping and building your character's adventure, from the moment you start character creation to the moment you're assaulting Red Mountain to defeat Dagoth Ur. And it is utterly enthralling.

The Elder Scrolls is a strange series of games, as each consecutive game in the franchise slowly loses and bleeds features and design philosophies with each release. Morrowind lost things that Daggerfall fans loved, Oblivion stripped concepts that Morrowind players kept coming back for, and Skyrim took it further by being so wholly unrecognizable to even die-hard Oblivion enthusiasts. And inevitably, if the trend continues, Elder Scrolls VI will alienate the Skyrim audience by further eradicating any semblance of ""Role-playing"" in an ""RPG"". None of these games are bad games by any stretch of the imagination. Dated, perhaps, but the philosophies are sound. But it just goes to show there's an untapped market for people craving a genuine sequel to Daggerfall, or Morrowind, or Oblivion, with the design elements refined, focused and improved in modern engines, instead of throwing out ideas from game to game.",1669155855,1669156030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- You choose to walk VERY slowly or sprint (also slowly), which depletes your stamina, now your character is useless since the chance to succeed on ANYTHING (hitting, casting, talking...) is governed by stamina (wtf)
- You fight enemies on the way, mana does not regen after you cast spells
- Now out of mana and stamina
- Try to walk away from enemies since you can't rest but also can't fight without mana or stamina
- Rest finally
- Attacked on rest
- Use stamina/mana fighting it
- Rest again
- Success, I can keep walking
- Go into bland dungeon
- Fetch item
- Walk back, repeating the whole process of walking here

What's also great about Morrowind is you have a ton of possibilities in making unique spells and enchantments and it doesn't hold your hand which makes quests engaging and rewarding as you really need to pay attention.
Also it allows you to be genuinely evil if one so chooses, something later games took away in large part. You can sell a slave to a rich guy and save them, accept payment and leave, or even kill them both if you so chose. So many RP possibilities.

Story is interesting but takes a while to get going and quests are often boring fetch type stuff with no payoff. Takes forever to progress as well.

I painstakingly modded this game to be a bug free graphically enhanced vanilla experience, but the game-play is still just awful and indoor spaces are extremely generic and empty of interesting things, also copy and paste NPCs with nothing interesting to say make it frustrating trying to find unique dialogues and quests that aren't there. I understand how the gameplay system works with saving stamina, just isn't fun for me and always annoying.

So I cannot recommend this game unless you're a very specific type of person who wishes more so to read lore books the whole time, doesn't mind spending a lot of wasted time in a game grinding, and who can entertain themselves by making their own story rather than rely on the flood of generic quests, empty indoor spaces, and hoardes of copy and paste NPCs with nothing unique to say.

This is by far currently the best TES game. Yes you can remove essential NPC flags from Oblivion and Skyrim however you can kill all the main characters in Morrowind and still BEAT THE GAME without cheats. Yes you have so much freedom that you can strong arm your way to rolling credits there is even a entire different quest line for those that want to walk the lands kicking butt the whole way through. Oblivion was the start of the downturn of TES because they installed ""the bumpers on the side of the bowling lane"". There is no quest markers pointing a carrot in the direction of your next quest. When you get told to go somewhere in Morrowind they will tell you ""North of this village pass another village, a fort, go through a ravine, pass another fort, then turn west across the river into the city"" like you would be told directions IRL. This leads you into a whole new world of discovery. The magic and enchanting in Morrowind in comparison to Oblivion and Skyrim is so much better that i cannot even think of a comparison to give justice to how much they gutted and watered down the system. Want to make a spell that lets you fly through the sky, while launching custom crafted magic missiles that explode into a 50 foot radius of Fetus Deletus in the form of omni damage you can. It won't be a cheap spell but that doesn't matter what matters is you have the freedom to do it. The lore this game has written in books is enough to make the Barnes & Nobles dwellers blush. Yes the graphics are outdated, and the combat is old school so you need to adjust to it you are right it is a old game, however that is what makes it a gem this game does not play like the shareholder endorsed cookie cut no child left behind coated watered down garbage that we have grown accustomed to be spoon fed. This gem was made before a bunch of old out of touch non gamers entered the meeting room with the dev's and said ""these games are too hard, they are not casual enough for everyone we need to add the equivalent of a airport landing strip's light markers towards objectives, and these mechanics are too complicated we need to gut it out and give them a system so simple a 7 year old could use it"". 

TLDR: The game is dirt cheap, and is probably the closest you will ever get to a D&D campaign you can play solo without a DM. Give it a try if you want to see what games where like before EA pooped on the whole market making games trash.

The AI can be predictable and prone to error. The landscape can be dull and unimaginative. And obviously the graphics are nothing to write home about. But somewhere under the archaic structure lies a gaming experience that the later games failed to capture; the adventure. While I believe that Oblivion and Skyrim made huge strides in areas that Morrowind falls flat on, because of the advent of instant fast travel and objective markers, the game broken down to its core is reduced to getting a quest, quick traveling to the nearest city, going to the quest marker, killing enemies or getting an item, quick traveling back to the quest giver, get loot, then find the next quest; albeit in more interesting settings. But in Morrowind, you are a detective. There are no arrows point you to your destination, you need to do the research to discover your destinations. You need to talk to people and learn what they know, do jobs for them to gain their favor, or bribe them for information. They tell you what directions to go, or where you might find what you are looking for; but never does an omniscient red arrow hold your hand and take you to your destination, save a rarely provided mark on the over world map. Need to find an artifact in a dungeon? You have to explore the dungeon for it. Quest giver wants a specific book? You have to track down the bookseller who has a copy. A riddle that reveals your destination? You have to solve the riddle, or find someone who can help translate it for you. It is a beautiful ballet of social interaction and adventuring. The skills in Morrowind were more varied and customizable as well. You could create your own unique spells that do a range of different things. You could enchant items with numerous different abilities. Armor pieces were individual so you could mix and match different rare armors and enchants. It was a more analog approach to creativity. Unfortunately because of it's era, while these mechanics are interesting, they are not pushed to their full capabilities due to the constraints of technology at the time. If there were to be a recreation of this style of Elder Scrolls game, where you do the leg work, you talk to the different people and learn their customs, you decipher maps and riddles and ancient books, you get access to tons of skills to be able to really make your character uniquely you; it would be a beautiful and immersive world worth revisiting many times just as people look back at Morrowind and sing it's praises still.

Morrowind has a fairly slow starting to the game if you aren't familiar with it, but there's so much to do in this game, most Elder Scrolls Games are like this.

I've only beaten the game one time, never felt like I needed to again, but I was only able to do that on one of my later characters.

Due to my computer being dogshit, I gotta use OpenMW to make the game run good and to fix a few bugs in the game, i would highly recommend using openmw as the base game is buggy as fuck, the usual with bethesda.

Morrowind was my 3rd ever elder scrolls game after Skyrim and Oblivion, and Morrowind always sticks out in terms of its mechanics. (not being able to hit anything.) and the level system doesn't feel too cheesy like in skyrim.

The only reason skyrim comes close to Morrowind in terms of personal enjoyment is its storytelling, while Morrowind has a deeper lore, skyrims is told much more fluidly 

Soundtrack is bopping like in other TES games with the main theme ""Nerevar Rising"" being the first main theme to use the iconic TES melody that has been used all the way up even into the teaser trailer for Elder Scrolls VI.
As it is the first rendition of the iconic melody, its not as grand and epic as skyrims orchestral army praising dovahkiin in dragontounge, but its simple and nostalgic, much like the game itself.

there's a stereotype that all morrowind fans are late 80s/early 90s kids who scoff at anyone who enjoys the modern equivalent of their favorite things, but morrowind actually predates me as a conscious person by a couple years. in my personal opinion, morrowboomers are too harsh on skyrim and skybabies are too reluctant to play morrowind.

If you're reading this review wondering whether or not you should buy morrowind, I urge you do. It may take you some time to get used to, especially if you've played Skyrim or Oblivion with its more simple mechanics. it took me about 4 new games before I actually got used to it but after you get into the groove, it becomes and enthralling experience.

Morrowind is a superb game, despite its age, it holds up in 2022 as one of bethesdas greatest.

Morrowind to me is pretty much the best TES game other than a heavily modded Oblivion or extremely modded Skyrim if you like old school RPGs.

Morrowind has an absurd amount of mods that increase the graphics to be more modern or add lots of content (Soltha Sil Expanded is [b]AMAZING[/b], there's mods that adds an entire new continents, etc), so you can make this game look beautiful or even better if you want to. Those who have played Oblivion or Skyrim know the deal here, but Morrowind has a lot of great content made for it since it's an older game.

It's only gotten better as the Morrowind Script Extender exists, and now people are doing things like proper Necromancy and such that weren't possible before.

The amount of freedom you have is pretty unrivaled. You can make spells that completely break the game, like make your character fly so fast the game crashes from loading too many cells at once (at least on older PCs, and I think there are mods to help fix this). It takes a long time, but you can do it.

That said, if you don't like old school mechanics like having to find stuff manually in the world based on directions and not having an arrow navigate you everywhere you'll hate this game.

The combat system is mechanically terrible, as unlike Oblivion & Skyrim it is based around hidden dice rolls. This can kill your vibe hard.

If you know you'd like this kind of game, I'd recommend it to anyone who knows that. But for most people, it's gonna be iffy. It's an old game, that does things in an old way. It does not hold your hand. Some may like that. Most won't, nowadays.

Yes it has it's flaws and combat it's difficult to grasp for a newcomer. But with a helpful guide on understanding how to play this game you could even become a God at the end.  
I haven't played Morrowind in 4 years and I've returned to this game and started a new game, and I cried when I went to the city of Balmora because of how nostalgic it looked, I started playing this since I was 16 and had no friends, back then I dedicated a good portion of that year to this game since I didn't had anything worthwhile on this life, I also started playing Oblivion and I've played Skyrim before Morrowind, but this game is something else, it's very calming. 
Oblivion also has a special place on my heart because of how goofy it is, that game brought joy and this game brought peace. 
Idk, I think one of the major factors on why this game is peaceful even tho the combat can anger someone is the music.
Anyways I recommend Morrowind if you don't care about the graphics, because this game sure looks old, but that's the charm of it. Go get a good guide on how to play the game and just give it a try, Skyrim it's just a part of Tamriel, explore a little further.

EDIT:  I have finished everything in the game now (or at least anything that I've found that wasn't broken) and I would like to reiterate that I do not recommend the game solely for it's bugs and instability and not for anything else.  I like many of the old fashioned RPG mechanics of Morrowind over it's successors and for instance got by just fine without quest tracker by following the NPC's directions (except when they were occasionally too vague or just completely WRONG.)

Before I elaborate further, I would like to state that I rate the game AS IS and not after it's been (fan)patched/modded because I don't think that's really a fair assessment of the product.  If a game requires to be (fan)patched and modded to be ""good"" i.e. to become something different because it could not stand on its own legs, then it simply isn't.

I'd say the bugginess of Morrowind, like many of Bethesda's games, can sometimes be very comical if they weren't so often frustrating.  I know it's an old game by now but Bethesda hasn't really improved much since this release in terms of playtesting and fixing their buggy games.  If most of the bugs were fixed or at least not essential to the functioning of the game then I'd not only give it a recommendation but would rate it highly.  The bugs are so numerous and sometimes significant that you practically *must* patch the game yourself unless you are just a glutton for punishment or something or don't mind leaving things unfinished.

I remember because they'd never missed a birthday of mine before, and as an already sentimental kid I was sad that they may not make it in time for my birthday, but I accepted it. At least they were okay and nothing bad happened to the car that it injured anyone or even put them in danger, which was news enough for me to breath a sigh of relief. They took a greyhound the rest of the way home and they got home just mere minutes before midnight, and they had a big gift to give me: An Xbox. With the Xbox was Morrowind, which I played on a brother in laws PC at the time and loved.

Since that time when we set it up and my parents insisted to celebrate my birthday past into midnight and marvel at this GIGANTIC system, I've always found time to come back to playing Morrowind no matter what platform I was on. Being able to do what you want in a crazy open world right after the tutorial area including thieving and messing with the locals with saving/loading was something so rare to me those days as a Nintendo kid. 

As a small 16yo (I'm an adult standing at 5 feet tall now so, yea), it was insane attempting to grip the giant Xbox Duke controller in my hands, learning to play the game on console. But it stands just as good back then as it does now. Sure, there were major improvements in games in the decade and a half to come in UI, storytelling, combat, and graphics. That to me doesn't change the fact that this game is filled with amazing stories, memorable moments, memorable places, hilarious quotes, and a near infinite amount of fun you can have playing different characters in completely different ways. 

Fast-forward all the way to today, and you can play it just as it was so many years ago or use mods to slap an AWESOME fresh coat of paint on it brought to you by some of the most dedicated fans to a series there have ever been for any games, let alone Action/RPGs. Can't stand the graphics? Covered. Think it's stupid you can miss when you clearly just hit that cliffracer visually? Covered. Granted the fans didn't make the original game, but they've more than made up for that with all of the independent time, effort, and heart that has gone into modding/fixing up Morrowind. 

Whether you got it back then when you were 16 and said, ""This is friggin' awesome!"" or you're 16 now and modding it to look like your newer games from today saying, ""The game slaps!"" the honest truth is you're going to experience something that practically every person has when first experiencing Morrowind. And that is this -

The game is SUPER fun. Also there is reading. SO much reading!

Well worth the wait as I got it at a deep discount. Here is the true rundown: Okay...Arena is wack AF!! Controls are horrible and gameplay sucks big time. I get it though as Bethesda was getting into the games in the 80s so the graphics were never gonna be great for an 80s game in comparison to today. Daggerfall expanded but still wack AF with the same issues with controls and whatnot. What was kinda unique about Daggerfall was the detail into the backstory of Tamriel and Cyrodill and all the various provinces or places like Slyrim and the Black Marsh and it went into more detail of the story of the Septim bloodline which was cool; good lore! Also with Daggerfall, the fighting sequences and controlling to swing a weapon was umm...uniquely annoying. Here comes Morrowind! An honest breath of fresh air (or that ""new car"" smell). Good detailing, good gaming...definite inspiration for some stuff they added in Skyrim. Tedious at times as far as some stuff like drinking potions and whatnot but still cool. Not as deeply detailed or story rich as Obliviion which I think is the best one out of the Elder Scrolls series. Again as with all Bethesda Softwork games, they have mad bugs even after decades of the game being out and you need to do some research into some mods or configurations for better gameplay like keeping it real: in Oblivion, you have the dreaded A bomb which is an animation glitch that happens for some people when their character reaches level 41 or after 250-300 hours of gameplay with a single character if you are playing on the PC. Stuff like that pisses me off and makes the game unplayable at times so note this and try to find a fix which they do for the animation glitch for oblivion (Wyre Bash-but you gotta download Pytheon and I am not too proficient in coding to be doing all that or you can use OAF which is Oblivion Animation Fixer which both are on Nexus Mods webstite) Whew!

The setting is wonderfully unique and strongly detailed with great writing and lore fleshing it out which I find to be the biggest factor as to why I love this game along with the legendary soundtrack. The combat is ok, very clunky but nowhere near as bad as many claim since the hit chance is relative to whether your character's class is skilled at said weapon type and/or magic, that being said it is more than valid that the combat is outdated cuz it really is although its also bearable, speaking of magic, while it is at its most diverse here on par with Daggerfall, it does have a bit of a learning curve to be skilled at using magic although its the most exploitable and can make the game significantly easier if you know what you're doing, I absolutely love how they handled magic in this game compared to others which I will say I'm big on playing as casters in most RPG's I play. While the graphics are definitely outdated as well, they have a strong charm to them and with how the landscape and creatures look in Morrowind, it somehow holds up since the land of Morrowind is quite surreal by nature although character models especially don't look good and no amount of mods will fix that honestly. One criticism I've seen mentioned very often besides graphics and gameplay is how there's very little voice acting (a lot of it is actually cut content if you wanna install mods to restore it but I personally haven't tried them) and how all dialogue has to be read with no voice over which is a criticism I don't find to be that valid since stories are usually supposed to be read, not told and even then the writing in this game is amazing to the point where you probably won't even care about the lack of voice acting the more you read the dialogue. Morrowind has a genuinely awesome main quest, if you simplify it, it is a ""chosen one"" type story but the twist on it is unique and very well done since it's not initially revealed to you and the main villain is iconic (not gonna spoil the story even though this is an old game but I'm gonna be assuming you haven't played it) and even the side quests are well detailed. Also there are no quest markers at all, you have to consult your journal for directions on where to go to complete quests which they do give you good information with directions for the most part but if you get lost just consult the UESP wiki. As with every Elder Scrolls game before Skyrim you can choose a class or create one giving you a good amount of replay-ability and there's the usual factions being Mages guild, Fighters guild, and Thieves guild along with the three Morrowind specific factions which each require a different playthrough being House Telvanni (my favorite of the three), House Redoran and House Hlaalu each with their own sets of rules and ideologies but the rest I won't go into detail. For a first playthrough at least install the Morrowind Code Patch and Morrowind Graphics Extender (known as MGEXE) to make the game more stable and look a bit better while keeping the game vanilla but that being said the modding community is still going strong for this old gem of a game, I also strongly recommend getting Tamriel Rebuilt since its adding the mainland of Morrowind into the game (the base game is set on an island of the province but its not the entirety of Morrowind) and the content of Tamriel Rebuilt is very much in line with the main game although far from finished but what is there is amazing. I beat this game for the first time in 2020 and its a superb game (as you can tell by my hours I absolutely love this game a lot) so if you like surreal fantasy settings and old school RPG's with the freedom of an open world, get Morrowind with some mods.",1663631022,1663631022,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of those games that you are going to have to study for like you are taking a test in school. Despite the additional effort though, I promise you Morrowind is worth it.

Graphics: 7/10 Taking into consideration the time period it was released, it's graphics where pretty standard.
Gameplay...
     Leveling Up: 9/10 In Morrowind, you need 10 subattribute levels from a player chosen governing attribute to Level up. Each skill has a ""Governing Attribute"", you can increase your governing attribute up to +5 times per level. To increase the G.A simply increase the subattributes levels ten times. (For instance, Destruction, Conjuration, Enchant and security are subattributes that come under Intelligence, the Governing Attribute)  

Fighting 8/10 So i might be a bit biased here, but I personally enjoy the old-school fighting mechanics. It needs to be said that many very much dislike Morrowinds ""Hit chance"" mechanic. The ""Hit Chance"" mechanic basically functions as a replacement for actually dodging at higher levels (if you focused on the skills which increase it, that is.) 
  The rest of the combat is much like that of future ES games.

I started off with Oblivion and played the other main series of Elder Scroll titles, but I like this ES the best and is one of my most favorite games to play. Vanilla mechanics are tough enough for many gamers nowadays, but having dated graphics and animations tend to discourage potential players from even trying in the first place.

If you're new and willing to learn to play a (likely) more difficult game than you're accustomed to, I recommend installing a few basic mods: Yuki's bugfixing mod(s) and some graphic replacers to modernize the look of your game. There are various tutorials on Youtube that demonstrate how. Afterwords, I suggest watching some of the videos in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLobdprIgcqJ82TKnySC6yIzP9CO9ixyz_ for a greater understanding of Morrowind's mechanics.

At the end, you'll have a game you enjoy looking at with increased stability and a handy dandy cheat sheet of videos to reference to understand why your 0 fatigue, 10 shortblade character can't kill a mudcrab with the handy dandy dagger presented at the beginning of the game. 

I know some peeps might recommend playing it with only the bugfixes for the atmosphere, but tbh if you prefer higher quality settings on other games you play then graphically overhauling this game is the same thing.",1662745483,1662745483,True,9,0,0.602596580982208252,0,True,False,False

There are thousands of NPCs. More than Skyrim and Oblivion combined. By virtue of the text based dialogue system. And there are SO MANY QUESTS.

Morrowind doesn't hold your hand. It gives you a set of systems and lets you do whatever you want with it. If you want to make a spell that permanently increases your speed by the hundreds, you're perfectly free to. Heck, you can even summon a sprawling army of daedric monsters for yourself, if you become powerful enough.

The combat takes some getting used to. Keep your fatigue full, and don't engage enemies that are clearly more powerful than you, and you'll be alright. Using ingredients, spells, and potions to give yourself the advantage is very under rated. Use the things the game gives you!

The variety of enemies and encounters is really staggering. In any random cave you're going to encounter something different. Sometimes it's a troupe of dagger wielding cut-purses, the next one could be a wizards secret lair full of beast from the daedric realms.

The sheer amount of lore and world-building is top notch. There are hundreds of books to read, and every NPC will give you some detail about the world. So many of the books will increase your skill levels as well.

Making quests and dungeons for your friends to play is so easy with the creation tools. Todd Howard himself even released some tutorials on using them around 20 years ago.

The music and atmosphere are second to none. Lush forests, rolling green fields, lively swamps and mires, craggy badlands, snowy wastelands. Even magical mushroom forests. All accompanied by the most beautiful soundtrack you'll ever hear in your life.

The variety of ways to role-play is very inviting as well. You can be the merciless ""murder hobo"", or you can be quite regal and pacifistic. All ways to play are viable, and it only takes your skill and knowledge of the game to be who ever you want in Morrowind. You can eventually get a house and decorate it with your adventuring spoils.

The modding community is thriving. The dedicated discord server gives you the utilities to start making and sharing your own, and they have marathons and contests to participate in. Such a lovely community doing some great work.

Seriously, this is in my top 3 favorite games of all time. You'll be hooked on Morrowind for hundreds of hours.

Однако игровая механика предлагает ограниченный выбор маршрутов, и до некоторых локаций с их помощью добраться невозможно.

Graphics (6/10): I know at the time that these graphics were incredible. However now it's low-res, low-poly, and always has a dense fog around to help the game run on computers of that era. There are, however, mods that can fix most if not all graphical issues, making it much more pleasant to look at.

Controls (9/10): Pretty nice and responsive tbh. WASD controls for movement, right click to go into the menu, space to interact, left click to attack/cast, E to jump, even has customizable hotkeys like Oblivion and Skyrim.

Gameplay (7/10): Fun, but flawed in some regards. Combat is... weird... when you attack you first whittle down their ""fatigue"" (stamina) once you get through that, THEN you start to get to their health. Movement at the early game is [b] S L O W [/b] trying to walk between any two destinations is like running a marathon, especially since the fast travel doesn't work like it does in literally every other TES game. you can only fast travel using transportation such as boats or silt striders. That all being said it has some redeeming qualities, the fast travel at the very least IS immersive, and that's something they try very hard to do, they try to make the game very immersive, and I think they've succeeded mostly. Combat, if you can deal with not being able to hit the broad side of a barn for the first level or two, is pretty fun, and being able to construct your very own custom spells and equipment is amazing!

Music (10/10): This game has an amazing orchestral score that is honestly a joy to listen to. Do I prefer ambient music while I'm walking around? Yeah. But does the epic orchestral soundtrack make trekking through Morrowind more enjoyable? Most definitely.

Stability/Bugs (8/10): Oh Bethesda, how I love your many bugs and glitches... thankfully there's only one you'll really have to worry about, and that's from the ""Tribunal"" expansion. Essentially, despite the fact the assassins SHOULD only fight you at higher levels (>=5 level I think) after waking up from a rest, they can do so at any level. So if you're playing this, try disabling Tribunal for a while until you thing you're ready, or just save before each rest.

Overall (8/10): An overall solid early 2000s RPG, which has stuck true to it's D&D inspired roots. It can be clunky at times, and the visuals have aged poorly, but at least one of those I know can be fixed by mods.",1662157289,1662157289,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I end up having to install several mods just so I can RUN the game, which is a incredibly frustrating process, because as I go from page to page trying to understand the tech speak the mod creators use while having literally no understanding of what they are saying, all I can think of is how FUCKING RIDICULOUS it is I even have to do this. For as great of a game it is, I genuinely don't think it's worth the hassle and frustration of getting it running. 

HOWEVER once you do get it running, it is one of the most indepth and incredible RPGs I have ever played, with an almost incredible amount of freedom, and feels incredibly fresh compared to all the quest markers I get in things like Oblivion and Skyrim.

I played it for 15 minutes and I was so in pain i unistalled the game. two years later i decided i was gonna play it all the way through and not stop as I wanted to play it to the end JUST once. I should've listened to the boiz. they warned me. for this, mr g you get an MGR favour for putting up with my breakdowns.

where to start, well like an STD exam lets starts with the positives...

now lets move on to the negatives

no but for real it has a few good sides, the adventures guild and some of the main quests are almost enjoyable. they have some interesting characters and whilst I prefer a blend of voice acting and written dialogue, I kinda liked the dialogue system in this game with the exclusion of when a character suddenly feels like an film student trying to explain the shocking twist in fight club to his date 1) you are talking too much and 2) you are scaring me. 

lets get to the negatives here and HOLY FUCK IS THIS GAME JANKY AS SHIT

I'll forgive products of their time unless its worse than half life 1 and the game im reviewing came out 6 WHOLE YEARS LATER. lets start easy, the combat. my god. its awful. and before someone types ''you have to level that'' bull shit my guy. i was a level 70 long blade with a daedric sword losing to a fucking rat. the combat is so ass you'd think it was made by rockstar. not only that but magic is bullshit, some enemies give u a teeny tiny love tap and some one shot u like you're a fucking kennedy. speaking of enemies good luck travelling anywhere in the open without being gangbanged by 50 cliff racers like its a karma rx shoot. they fuckers are everywhere and they are the most annoying things in the game.

 the audio, dear good the audio. to make sure i was right i looked it up and skyrim/oblivion have hour/multiple hour long tracks that alternate. i swear morrowind has two and they just loop every 5 seconds driving me crazy. not only this but the audio for attacks, its like slamming a soldiering tool down your urethra and turning it up to maximum by accident. its so jarring i stg i got jumpscared more times than playing RE 2, not to mention, i turned off all sound and this jarring ass hit sound still plays. i had to beat the game with audios devices unplugged. I'm not gonna say anything about visuals as thats unfair to comment on.

but, i can say something about building layouts, they have three designs. wooden, mushroom and stone. and holy fuck do they all look the exact same. i found myself getting lost in trader shops...TRADER SHOPS. i hated the design of the caves, just plain black rock meaning that after 20 minutes of being lost i'd need to use TCL to find my way out and even then, still took way longer than needed.

this game is just such a big shit show youd think aoi yuuki just finished filming a 4 hour scene and you know what, id rather role around on the set of GEN - 021 than play this game again. 

also im sorry, is a quest marker so hard to implement, no im serious cause directions wont cut it. one quest said go west until you reach the mountains and then head north, when i found the location it was directly north of the camp, not west to the mountains, just north.

also the quests overall suck. talk to this guy, travel for 20 minutes find the next guy, talk. travel another 20, come back. talk, travel 20 again and then rinse and repeat. worst offender is the horrater quest, everyone is essentially at opposite corners of the map but dw once youve done one family, YOU HAVE 2 MORE TO GO. this shit i with fast travel would talk like 10-15 minutes, but that quest alone took me around two hours. 

(also needed a mod so the screen was big enough for me to see literally anything)

this game also will just crash and pray to god you saved otherwise you will lose like 2 hours of progress and that means endless walking and talking, id have to panic save every 4 minutes to make sure i lost no progress. 

also the final boss is just boring. hard and boring. he is way to strong to not be insta killed by and i had to pray to RNJesus that i could slip by him and destroy the heart. took me 20 minutes. should have taken like what..4? fuck i mean alduin isnt an amazing boss fight but at least he offers something to get excited about. 

im glad a played the game so i know what it is but i dont have to touch it ever again.

it sucks because i can see the passion others feel for this game and the passion that the devs put into it. its all there it just can't survive in this day and age, and even back then i doubt it was much of a favourite comparing against other games of the time. i really wanted to enjoy this game, there were moments early on when i started learning the system and found myself enjoying it, but it felt like the second i started enjoying myself i got bitchslapped and told to stay in my lane. this game was probably a gem when it came out. but to me, it just sucks. if you like the game, good for you, you see something in the game that i just don't and im happy for you but it isnt for me. 

now if you don't mind, im gonna play yakuza 0 pretend that i never played this game

i figured i wouldn't like Morrowind much. starting the game i thought the UI took some time to get used to, the graphics were dated, combat was too difficult. nevertheless, i pushed myself knowing while i can just look up guides & watch playthroughs, i will miss out on insignificant quests & NPCs that are often not discussed yet are the very things that make open world games so special. 

i'm so glad i tried to keep on playing. TESIII, although set on an island and not a whole province, have so much to discover. i feel like there are so many more NPCs, & most if not all of them have more dialogs than any Skyrim character i can think of. to me, that is what makes Morrowind such a good game - the amount of lore you will have to read to progress through the game.

[*] don't hesitate to look up guides to help you figure out your way in the game. & if you're not a noob like me, then your journal helps.
[*] you will miss so much when fighting you will wonder if you're really using your weapons at all. each time you level up, it'll get slightly easier, & by endgame you'll walk in any dungeon absolutely plundering through it.
[*] get the spells [b]Mark[/b], [b]Recall[/b], [b]Divine Intervention[/b] & [b]Almsivi Intervention[/b] ASAP. 
[*] be nice & don't steal a merchant's stuff unless you don't plan to trade w/ them ever.

Oblivion ruined everything with the leveled world where every enemy gets stronger as you get stronger and ruined the leveling system. Skyrim threw Stats in the garbage entirely but I still find it more playable than Oblivion, which in my opinion has the worst RPG elements of the 3D rendered Elder Scrolls games (which is scary because Skyrim has barely to none RPG elements), but Oblivion is a fun setting and world and fun lore implications.

People who rate Morrowind poorly based on the combat have a poor imagination, but I can't really blame them. Your ability to land melee attacks is greatly dependent on your own stats as well as your enemy's -- when you miss point blank, that is simulating that perhaps your character isn't an expert swordsman or your enemy sidestepped the attack. The word ""simulating"" is very important because there is no physical dodge animation nor sound queue. In my ideal world, an Elder Scrolls 6 would throw the Skyrim perk trees in the garbage, reintroduce skills, classes, attributes and dicerolls, but add significantly more feedback to a missed attack or failed action. With the greater technology of today, surely they could figure out a good way to show that an attack was glancing or an enemy sidestepped. 

The diceroll combat like I say is greatly dependent on stats. You can almost look at your weapon skill as a percent chance to hit, but it is also affected by other factors such as your own attributes, an enemy's attributes and skills, and spell effects. This gives a really genuine sense of progression that I just do not feel in Skyrim or Oblivion. The potential for attacks to fail makes successful attacks more gratifying. As your character lands more attacks, you skills level up. As your skills level up, your character lands more attacks. It's a feedback cycle that simulates your character being a breathing being in the world who is actually progressively getting more skilled. It is much more satisfying than putting another perk point into my One Handed skill so I will deal 5% more damage with One Handed. 

Many reviewers say the combat is terrible. The combat is terrible in *all* of the 3D rendered Elder Scrolls games, including Skyrim. Dark Souls, Skyrim is not, and every character you make regardless of what race you pick feels exactly the same due to the lack of attributes and classes. Morrowind's replayability to me largely comes from the wide array of characters you can create when building a class, you can actually create varied characters, and the main story quest line has potential for ambiguity and player interpretation. 

Shipped from Cyrodiil a prisoner, the player has just been pardoned of their crimes and told to follow orders lest they be marked a treasonous deserter. They are recruited into the Emperor's service, the missions given to the player are steeped in mystery right from the beginning. No quest markers means you will have to use that big organ between your ears to decide where to go based on written directions from the natives. The player doesn't even know what their objective is for about a half dozen quests into the main story, and then when a trusty superior offers some explanation to the plot, it just thickens.

The island of Vvardenfell is diverse in regions from marshes to grasslands to dry ash and volcanic lava rivers. The landscape is covered in hillsides and dotted with abandoned ruins of the mysteriously vanished Dwemer, shrines to Daedra lords, caves which house bandits and monsters, and ancient Dunmer burial crypts defended by the spirits of the honored family dead. The creatures of the land are very alien looking, not your typical wolves and bears. The cities are huge for a 3D Elder Scrolls game that isn't Daggerfall, the people have interesting things to say (even if different people of the same profession have very similar things to say, I'll take it over non-important characters in the later games having literally 1 dialogue option). The land of Morrowind, to me, is so much more intriguing and creatively cared for than the medieval setting of oblivion or the viking setting of Skyrim. The warriors of Vvardenfell craft their armor from tough bug-hide instead of iron. Many Dunmer wizards magically coax giant mushrooms to grow into the shape of living quarters and grand lodges. A main source of food for the native Dunmer is eggs -- not chicken eggs -- but eggs laid in subterranean caves by ugly creatures that the menial ""egg miners"" depend upon.

All of this combined with the ability to create varied custom spells, a long list of spell effects either forgotten or ""outlawed"" in the future, a culture well defined and unique, a slew of wonderful in-game books detailing topics from history to rumor, some portrayed as fiction and some portrayed as non-fiction. The native religion has many books dedicated to it, often conflicting -- you will have to decide for yourself what to believe.

You will have to decide many things for yourself, but the signposts will point the way.",1661320775,1661321109,True,52,4,0.758443653583526611,0,True,False,False

I still like it better than Skyrim. The rumors are true. It's an old game but a classic. Somehow it just works.

You can quickly see how Skyrim evolved from this original game, and where they went wrong - by focusing too much on graphics and fighting and boring weapon upgrades. This original game is much more interesting even with low graphics and little voice acting. I feel like I am exploring and meeting people and doing things - not just looking for weapons and scavenging for parts and upgrades - which is basically the entire experience of Skyrim and Fallout 4... hours upon hours spent at work benches, and scavenging for supplies. So boring.

So far this game has none of that. I like it. Despite the low poly graphics I'm actually fascinated by the environments and creatures I'm meeting. It's alien, unique, interesting.

This game is comparable to Fallout New Vegas, another classic. So far so good. I'll report back if anything changes.

So today, I just finished Morrowind. It was my first experience in the world of Tamriel and I have to say - it truly exceeded my expectations. Believable, interesting, diverse world full of books, tales, stories, fractions, clans and so on and so forth. I never experienced such a complex world building from any video game before. 
It's completely wild how you can dig deeper and deeper in terms of lore and the world around you. It's just up to you. It's possible to spend even 200h in this 20 years old game just wandering around and learning about it.

Yet, I wouldn't recommend it to the younger or less patient players. This is not only an old game, but old minded as well. Very little voice acting, RNG based combat, outdated mechanics and graphics. All these things you have to keep in mind when giving Morrowind a try. There are some mods of course, a ton of them actually. I personally wanted to play vanilla Morrowind so I didn't take a look at them. I had a blast playing it even without any mods so it is also possible of course.
I absolutely adore this world and how strongly RPG based it actually is.

Game mechanics are very complex and flexible. With the proper tools you can make yourself jump across the entire map or 1-hit anyone in the game, all without any mods. Just alchemy, spell making, enchantments and mixing up all the different things together. It's not easy and obvious, but possible.
Unfortunately the game is not very polished at some aspects so you won't escape from using console commands from time to time, for example to remove an NPC blocking your way (simple, useful command ""RA"" resets NPC's position to their default places) or to force journal update when finishing some quests because the game didn't notice you actually finished it.
Luckly tho, those are well known issues, commands are easy to find on the internet and the availability of console ingame makes it difficult to actually get stuck somewhere.

The GOTY edition contains two expansions - Tribunal and Bloodmoon.
Tribunal is magnificent, it connects with the main plot, the Mournhold (fortified city which is the main place of action) is a very nice, cozy yet dangerous place, filled with useful or memorable NPC's and makes you wanna come back to it and explore it further and deeper (and there is much to explore!).
Bloodmoon on the other hand is... rather over the top. Looks like the development team wanted to raise the difficulty, but they did this in the most pitfull way - throwing at you tons of enemies everywhere, hit-sponges with no reward of fighting with them. Bloodmoon takes place on the island of Solstheim.  You are getting there at the end of the game (doesn't make any sense to go there earlier), your character is already packed with useful items and maxed-out skills, so being forced to fight tens and tens of large health pool enemies is just a chore at this point. But besides that it is something new and refreshing, it keeps you going even after spending 100h in Vvanderfell.

I was afraid of Morrowind. I thought it would overwhelm me with its sloppiness and outdated mechanics, but I truly had a lot of fun with it. It's a very unique game, definitely one of these games that can make you fall in love with it. There are just no games similar to Morrowind.

Fun game
Great story
Nice leveling system
Lots of items and dungeons in which to get them
Great MMO combat system
Apparently better than Skyrim in multiple ways(i've never actually played skyrim)
Moddable!!!(Check out Micky D on YouTube for a whole plethora of modded Morrowind videos)

Cons:
The game is a really big RPG, so it takes about 200 hours to finish it. The DLCs of Bloodmoon and Tribunal add to this.
You can get overpowered items very fast, so it kinda takes the fun away from it if that happens(one example being the Umbra Sword)

Morrowind is certainly a game any fan of the series should try. While not offering the same feeling as ""starting it all"" that Arena offers, it does offer a similar feeling. That being the feeling of the change of the guards, holding aspects of the previous titles and cracking the door open to aspects of the newer titles. But, let face one matter upfront, the matter of direction. A common complaint seen from those coming from titles after Morrowind regards direction, or the seeming lack of it. Being that Morrowind offers no visible quest markers, some may find the written direction to be tiresome. It is simply a matter of opinion. Now, with that out of the way (and before this turns into more a Morrowind speech box), I'll leave you with the simple recommendation of: get it if you hold any interest, for it is truthfully worth the investment.",1486337846,1660154592,True,3,0,0,0,True,False,False

Instead I'll prefer to say that this game runs pretty well in modern hardware, having used Windows 10 to play it. Although it will need some pretty easy-to-install mods in order to get the best overall experience (as well as widescreen support). Thus being: Morrowind Code Patch, MGE XE and Better Text Fonts.

If whoever might read this is in doubt of this purchase, I will highly recommend to give Morrowind a fair chance. It's more complex and harder than the next entries of the series, but the immersion is sublime.

Its combat system is horrible. Despite being first person it determines hits based on ""dice roll"" style random generation. in addition, most enemies have a huge pool of health, so at early levels it will take up to 20 minutes to kill even normal enemies. enemies attacks cause massive damage, so you'll die in only a couple hits, even at high levels. stamana and mana are also very limited even at high levels, and all attacks require quite a bit of either. if you encounter more than one enemy at low level, you are gaurenteed to die.

normally i don't judge the graphics of older games as long as they look good ""for the time"", but the character models and models for the levels are extremely archaic even for the year this game came out. for a comparison, by the time this game had come out, silent hill 2, metal gear solid 2 and final fantasy X had come out a year earlier. this game looked bad back then. to make it worse, the art direction is TERRIBLE. EVERYTHING is brown. brown dirt, brown buildings, brown mushrooms, brown animals. even the concept art shown on the loading screens is brown. the only things that aren't brown are the elves, they're a horrible shade of blue grey.

the main story isn't very good, its just a normal ""destroy the demon king"" quest, the kind you've seen a million times in better games like dragon quest, but without the charming characters and locations that those games have. some of the dialouge is good, but most of it is copy and pasted generic lines that every npc in the game spouts. some of the lore is interesting, (mostly because the lore writer literally locked himself in a room and got high for a week and wrote down everything he thought) but for obvious reasons most of it is nonsensical, has no impact on the lore of the later games in the series, and is misinterpreted by the fans. (they do things like say that a character, an elf named vivec, who only ever lies to your character and leads a cult is trustworthy when he talks about the setting and its history) really, you might be better off reading the lore off of a wiki, all the notes and characters that talk about interesting things are so spread out that it would take days just to get all the interesting parts of the story, even with as few as there are.

your character moves slow, even at the maximum natural speed, so it takes forever to go anywhere, and combined with the dice roll combat, means that it takes hours to do even the easiest of quests. I skipped most of the side quests, and only did the minimum nesissary to complete the base game and one of the expansions, and it still took over one hundred and sixty hours. in retrospect i should have given up when it got boring, but hindsight is 20/20 and I had heard so many good things said about the game that I wanted to see if it ever got as good as people said. it never got good. I wanted to like it because I liked the others in the series, but theres nothing really likable. I don't even hate the game, because when I look back on playing it all I remember is bordom.
that's why I have so much time in this game. because when I gave the game my time, the game didn't respect my time. Don't waste your time like I did, Don't buy this game.

A quick edit: I forgot to mention that this game has an incredibly toxic fanbase. Its the second worst group of fans I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with, after Fallout New Vegas.",1658837881,1659904484,False,2,1,0.452147692441940308,0,True,False,False

I bought it bc I was bored out of modern RPG handholding and was told this one is more challenging. And actually it really is. The journal system is like the perfect balance between the obscure FromSoft quest system and the babymode EA/Ubisoft system. It creates a feeling of immersion I wish more modern games would have. 

However, the stat-based combat system and sluggish pacing/exploring ruined the game for me. I really don't mind old graphics since it has its charm but the ""game feel"" of that one is teeeeeeedious. It should not bother you if you're into CRPG, or tabletop rpg inspired video game, but for me it quickly felt like a chore compared to ARPG I usually enjoy. 

That said, I must say that the gloomy, weird dark ambience is really neat. Same for all the ES lore this game provides, if you're into it this game is a goldmine.

I didn't manage to get properly acquainted with the game until several years after its release, I couldn't stop playing it after I did. I don't know if people will find the game as interesting by today's standards, but it still plays great. Different, but great.

Morrowind plays much like an old style action RPG game, where RNG plays a very prominent part. Combat is one of the areas in which this is very noticeable, as enemy and player attacks have a chance of missing for no visually justified reason. Early on, when your skills are low, you are very likely to miss most of your hits, but as your skills start improving, you will slowly see more and more of your hits connecting. For me, it took a little while of getting used to, but now I find it an endearing trait of a bygone era that adds to the unique flair of the game.

The game also encourages a more attentive mentality, as most of the dialogue and quest information is relayed in pure text. There's quite a bit of voice acting, but the vast majority of dialogue requires good ol' reading. There are also no map markers to aid you in where to go next. You have to stay smart and check the journal for your latest entries or ask around towns for more information, which I found to be very engaging.

I also just wanted to show my support for not just this franchise but this game in particular. With how much I have played this game, Bethesda has frankly earned my money more than once.

I have done everything, literally everything. Every area, every quest or task everything, multiple times. This game is not as approachable as the later games in the series, it's still loaded with the signature Bethesda bugs, although much less in this game than in Oblivion and Skyrim and there are MANY community made patched which can make the game nearly flawless and bugless.

Mods: On that note of community made content, the mod library for this game is MONSTEROUS and truly incredible. You can change the game in any way you want. Tweak the graphics and game play things you don't like, add content and characters and stories and entire islands if you want. Give yourself homes and powers and on and on and on. Modding this game is easy and awesome. 

Story: Which one? There are many of this in this game and many many of them are great. Side stories that are open and obvious or hidden and told through incredible environmental story telling. I love them all but this of all the Elderscrolls games has the best, in my opinion, main questline story. I won't say more but leave it to you to experience it yourself.

World: I wish more than anything would go back to their approach with this game with the others in the series. Morrowind is the most alien and unusal of all the lands of Tamriel. It's fascinating and interesting and every part of it has personality and it's own look. From the area within the great ghost fence to the noble homes of the noble houses, some which require spells like flight just to explore (and yes you can straight up fly in this game). There is so much to see and explore. Pick a direction and go and you will find something interesting in no time flat. Just be careful, this is one of a few games where they will let you break the game. Literally, you can get quest items before you get the quest and sell them or kill important NPC's. So, save often and keep a lot of old saves. It will warn you sometimes when you are about to break the game, but not always.

Skills/Abilities/Progression: This game uses a skills used based progression. The more you do something the better you get at it. Literally everything too. Want to be better at running, run more. Want to be better at jumping, then jump more. Want to be better at sneaking, spell casting, using clubs, using shields... you get the idea. You get skill points in each area eventually adding up to 100 and you can be a master of all. You level up and get base ability point, HP and MP increase every so often when you level your skills up enough and you can pick what abilities you wish to focus on by spending ability points when you level up with multipliers applied to the abilities if you upgraded associated skills. For example, use a sword a lot and you can increase your Strength by 3 instead of 1 for a single ability point. Lots of skills to pick from and you can even pay for training from trainers who are EVERYWHERE to give yourself a boost. Although the cost of buying higher level training is insane sometimes and higher level trainers can be harder to find.

Melee Combat: Ok.... so this is the games weakest point, it's kinda bland. There are mods that make it more interesting but by todays standards, it's nothing exceptional. It's good enough and won't in any way put you off the game, but it's not something to write home about. Basic directional attacks, charged up versions of those and some shield bashes... and that's really it. But this game is old, what do you want from me? It was good enough for its time.

Spell Casting: Basic and super dynamic all at the same time. Its as simple as click and cast. No charging or combining of spells like in Skyrim, BUT you can make your own spells that have an enormous amount of control over what they do and how they work and you that makes the spell selection nearly endless with the range of things you can do with those spells far out pacing any of the the Elder Scrolls games that came after it. With some light modding this spell system is the best the series has to offer.

Lore: Don't get me started.... 2nd to none. Period.

Characters: Really there aren't many main characters who are present start to finish aside from yourself and you are very much a blank slate. Be who you want to be. Tell your own story. Make up your own background and personality. It sounds basic but I actually wish more games took this approach. I love it. Makes you really feel like a wandering hero (or villian) who is on a massive quest through a huge alien world.

Summary: Just get it. You won't be let down. It's my #1 favourite game for a reason.",1659464553,1659464553,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a great game! Even without mods(other than unofficial patch) it holds up to today's greats in my humble opinion. I might even add especially up against today's greats. Who are now all social media hubs that also wanna hold your hand, and where the studios spend all their time and energy on multiplayer instead of ironing out great story and conflict.
That having been said, Morrowind thrusts you in the world of the Dwemer province Morrowind where there is a prophecy of an Outlander who comes and is the Neravar. Able to overthrow all the woe that's plagued the land. The best part about that whole premise is that the inhabitants of Morrowind usually HATE Outlanders, especially the Camona Tong and their leader. It just makes the entire premise that much more amusing. A essentially you're the dirty transfer student rags-to-riches story where you do enough favours and grease enough palms to finally achieve something in this place. That's obviously nowhere near the whole story, but just the premise. It still has the typical ""Daedra conflicts"", ""Fascist Pegging"" and ""Racist crap"" that the franchise is known and loved for, lol.
If you've never played Morrowind and love ARPGs I'd give it a good go.

Otherwise your game will be buggy, foggy, and have an annoying interface. Mods can fix just about all the annoying problems with this game's mechanics if you so wish, and there's even one that adds (at this moment) half of the mainland of Morrowind with inhabitants, cities, quests, and so on. 

This is one of the three good TES games (the others being Daggerfall and Skyrim), and it stands between those two games in terms of mechanics and style. It has a better story than its brothers, to be sure, and its world has a great amount of depth even compared to the rest of the series. However, it has aspects that honestly make me recommend it last in that list. Combat is frankly worse than Daggerfall despite being nearly mechanically identical, since you will constantly be staggering from enemy hits (which now stops attacks) and get the odd look of weapons missing a target they are clearly hitting in 3D because of RPG dice rolls. For the first few hours you will be painfully bad at hitting anything unless you are a mage...but on the other hand mages kinda suck in this game unless you min-max them. You see, magicka doesn't recharge unless you rest, and you will probably only have enough of it to attack a single enemy or maybe two in between day-long rests (which can only be done when there are no enemies around), and unless you are a Breton or an Altmer and have one of the birth signs that give you extra magicka, you will have such a pitiful amount of magicka that it is just not practical. So you become an all-rounder, except if you don't PLAN your skill levelling carefully from the beginning you will have a way worse character at higher levels than you could because your attributes in this game can be increased efficiently only by using particular skills you want for those attributes (and not too much of any either). It's just not fun to have to think about, and it's not fun to have to use a spear or medium/heavy armour at the beginning to level up your endurance so you have enough health to survive no matter your build. Some of the quests are also incredibly hard to complete because you won't know where some tiny object is, or who you're meant to talk to, but in general they allow for a better amount of role-playing in how you complete them than you find in the other TES games.

All that said, the magic effects in this game are wonderfully diverse and can be used however you wish within your character's abilities. Be sure to try jumping over hills and whole towns in a single leap (and use slowfall!) for efficient travel at least once.",1659157045,1659157045,True,29,1,0.670716583728790283,0,True,False,False

It’s not a controversial opinion for someone’s favorite Bethesda RPG to be Morrowind. Having gone back to play it on a whim, and not having liked Oblivion nor Skyrim all that much – and definitely not having any love to give for the Fallout Franchise, I’m blown away as to how hooked I got playing Morrowind and ended up finishing my first, largely unmodded (MCP) playthrough at around 60-ish hours. This does include finishing Tribunal and Bloodmoon; As well as the entirety of the Mages, Telvanni and Temple Factions.

On the technical side, Morrowind, after applying the ‘Morrowind Code Patch’ ran fairly decently but did have a penchant to crashing when quitting the game, as well as on rare occasion during gameplay. Even then, this was not a big issue as the game tends to create a save right before crashing. I have no complaints about performance, nor did I encounter any blatantly broken quests. That being said, I did encounter a somewhat common recurring bug wherein upon jumping, I’d fall through the world only to be swiftly reset. With some more troubleshooting, I got the game to not crash even on exiting; Having since started another playthrough on OpenMW, I would consider it to be essential due to the raw quality of life it brings to running the game.

Gameplay isn’t quite as smooth. On a reasonably vanilla set-up (i.e. w/o OpenMW), the player struggles to not slide off even the softest slopes. NPC’s often get stuck and block your path. This is particularly bad with flying enemies, who seem to struggle lowering their altitude to attack the player, with the result being clown-cars of Cliff Racers behind me only to randomly swoop down to actually attack me.  I encountered invisible “walls” in certain dungeon architecture that I needed to console command through to progress. This seems to relate to your movement speed and/or the Levitate effect.

A big point of contention is the player progression and how the game handles combat from the start: Unlike newer entries like Skyrim, where the only factor of actually hitting the enemy, is your actual hitbox connecting, Morrowind functions more like a CRPG, in which each strike – even if it physically connects with an enemy model, still rolls a dice dependent on your skill and factors in your current fatigue. The same is true for any other skill in the game; Spell Failure, Bartering prices etc. - In the early game this can often result in weird moments where the player stands still for half-a-minute, just waiting for their fatigue to recharge to squeeze a little bit of power (or drakes) from their current situation. 

On the flip-side, despite a rough start where every encounter is incredibly dangerous; Travel is long and methodical; The game eventually switches to becoming an incredible power-fantasy. This is largely due to many mechanics being “broken”; Or maybe more aptly: Exploitable. It is incredibly easy to generate endless gold through merchant restocks; To create incredibly broken spell-combinations; Or to kill seemingly impossible enemies through the fact of stat buffs of consumables stacking infinitely. 

The game is, inherently, broken in so many ways that any player will sooner or later stumble across a way to become powerful. Brokenly so; Just by virtue of the raw numbers the game is dealing with. It’s stupid but also stupid fun that somehow still manages to feel largely ‘balanced’. For me, when I was going through the expansions of Tribunal and Bloodmoon, I started to get burned out by the trivial encounters only to get shredded during the final dungeon of Bloodmoon and having to fall back to pull exactly all these broken tricks I had learned, to figure out which was the appropriate way to get through it. And it kinda works. It allows you to focus, truly focus on whatever you want your character to be good at – to roleplay, and to support that playstyle through the myriad of peripheral systems that help make you powerful. 

I have fewer good things to say about the quest-design, which thins out substantially towards the latter half of the main quest; And more so during the expansions. Whereas in the early- and mid- game, where travel is not yet trivial, working with your journal to figure out where to go for your quests, and traversing Vvardenfell is an incredibly immersive experience, the game quickly devolves into what *feels* like filler quests. The best non-spoiler example is the obscene backtracking that is required during Tribunal and the apparent struggle of the game to anticipate the PC doing objectives out of order. I frequently had to backtrack to talk to an earlier NPC, just do trigger a quest-flag even when I had already figured out what I was supposed to do, or where I am supposed to go. 

Another good example is a series of late-game main story quests, that send you all throughout the different factions for a diplomacy plot – only for each of them to send you on varying levels of utterly petty sidequests, like finding a ‘dating partner’ – for a relevant NPC. This is a problem that is simply not avoidable. It is Oblivion’s Oblivion Gates. Or Skyrim’s Civil War. The part of the game that is supposed to give a feeling of grandeur, but is in effect just obnoxious fetch-questing. 

Quests, in terms of roleplay choices, tend to be rather straightforward – with the more sophisticated ones usually being a choice from siding with A or B in a given conflict. This is sufficient, as roleplay in Morrowind is better focused to your characters personal development, playstyle etc., but can at times be fairly sophisticated, such as two different factions’ storylines overlapping with one another and thus forcing the player to pick a side to avoid locking themselves out from the other; Or getting, once again, creative with the games’ systems. 

Naturally, as with most semi-modern Bethesda titles, Morrowind is extremely moddable – especially for graphics and sound-design. Furthermore, Morrowind’s modding community is extremely active and provides an incredibly amount of tools to make the process of modernizing Morrowind a surprisingly smooth endeavor. That being said, even out-of-the-box Morrowind has a decent look to it, helped by its unique setting. The music is among the best that I’ve heard, easily competing with entries like Daggerfall/Unity.


[u]TL;DR[/u]
+ Unique setting that is supported by sublime writing; Unafraid to tackle themes that would not be acceptable in modern games.
+ Incredible support of emergent game- and roleplay: Factions naturally competing with one another; Rewarding the player for engaging with peripheral gameplay systems (Spellcrafting, Alchemy etc.)
+ Thoroughly moddable; Thus offering an easily customizeable experience for any player.
+ Spears. Very important.

+/- Combat- and Interactions are closer to what may be expected from a CRPG: Any action is inherently tied to both dice rolls and your current fatigue which may hamstring your enjoyment until reaching higher proficiency in any skill.
+/- Extreme freedom: i.e. persistent plot-critical items, and all NPCs being non-essential, means that it is possible to softlock your progress.

- Recurring, albeit non-game-breaking glitches; Falling through map-architecture, getting stuck; Crashes under specific circumstances.
- Lackluster and repetitive quest design during the latter half of the main game and both expansions; No anticipation of the PC doing quest(-steps) out-of-order.

Morrowind is an amazing experience. If you can put up with its quirks; How the games’ combat works, it will provide you with the best synergy of Bethesda’s modern Open World design and an incredibly immersive setting. Despite feeling burned out myself by these same quirks, the raw charm keeps me having it installed and excited to play through it with a modded set-up, or a fresh character fantasy.",1658603332,1658605684,True,36,0,0.76137995719909668,0,True,False,False

I enjoy Skyrim, but vanilla is quite a bore unless you use a lot of imaginative role play and suspension of disbelief to achieve in your mind what the game doesn't allow.

I recommend that if it's your first time playing Morrowind, you play as close to vanilla as possible, use OpenMW to get better performance and stability, I've played for 5-6 hours straight without a crash, and I'm sure I could play for way longer without one. OpenMW is truly a work of love by fans.

When you get to play, take it slow, read the manual, maybe read a guide to understand how stats, leveling, and dice rolls work, once you do, you'll appreciate the gameplay a lot more and won't care to use a mod that makes you hit all the time like many people do nowadays to expedite their playthroughs (but if you do use such a mod, it's all right, just know that there's a deeper game in there that you'll be enchanted by if you take the leap). 

During your journey across Vvardenfell, use a physical notepad to take notes as if it were your game journal, rather than relying on the in-game one. A tablet with a pen works, or as a last resort, take notes in your smartphone or computer, but a physical notepad is just a much more involved and personal experience. Immerse yourself in the story, the mysteries, the detective quests, the unique setting, become your character as you think through your actions and start developing a story of your own, who knows, you might even write a book. 

Once you're done with vanilla, mod the heck out of OpenMW, there are some awesome mod lists, I personally recommend One Day Modernization from openmw-modding, it will take A LONG time to setup, but it is worth it if you are a fan of these experiences. Keep an eye on OpenMW's development, it is one of those fan projects that deserves all the support and admiration it can get, I wish Oblivion and Skyrim got a similar treatment just so I could play them for long stretches without getting that demotivating random crash.

Also, keep an eye on Tamriel Rebuilt, they're building the actual Morrowind map, the one you get in the game is actually the Vvardenfell district of Morrowind, the island surrounded by the Inner Sea. Morrowind mainland isn't in the game, and it's a bigger area, Tamriel Rebuilt has built more than half of it, and about a quarter is full of NPCs and quests, they say they might finish the entirety of Morrowind by 2030, optimistically, I'll be showing my kid that awesome work of love when it happens.",1658561467,1658561618,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Morrowind is a game where I both love a lot of aspects while hating a bunch of others with a passion. To get out of the way, the worst aspect of this game is the combat; The combat is heavily based on your proficiency with that skill and so is your hit chances, so the higher your proficiency the higher the hit chance, this makes the early game extremely frustrating. Another aspect i dislike are some of the quests; the majority of the quests can get very tedious since a lot of the objectives are very similar to other quests, especially some of the guild quests, and due to lack of quest markers, you can get lost extremely easily.  Even though i ragged on the game for the majority of this review, I actually really enjoy Morrowind. I love the setting of the game, it has such a mysterious atmosphere from the lived-in cities of  and Balmora to the countless ruins of a dead civilization long gone to the the eerie 6th house shrines. I love learning about the lore of the Vvardenfell, especially of the great houses, the lost civilization of the Dwemer, and tribunal temple and the god Vivec. The magic feels so good to use and customize, especially levitation. Overall even though i dislike a lot of aspects of the game, there's still a lot i really enjoy; I personally recommend you tried only if you can stand the outdated mechanics and want to immerse yourself in the lore.

For starters it isn't fully voice acted so you will have to read if you want to know what is going on in the game. The game could also be called less accessible to those who aren't big RPG fans.

This though does give the game more replayability especially since certain character classes are more suited for some factions than others. Also the factions you join will have an effect on how much NPCs like you. This is just some of the considerations that have to be made in game.

The gameplay is not hard at all, but the overwhelming understandment of the tabletop quirks and thinking is required. The game asks you to perform and use a lot of little things that bounce out of each other things. Having a low stamina means that you aren't able to connect your sword or run as fast as you could. Low stamina can even affect how well you perform at bartering or other tasks which the game doesn't explain during the gameplay. But once you know this, you start to pay more attention to it and keep that stamina bar full.

The quests are very basic and dated. No twists. Most of them being 'fetch this' or 'go kill this thing' type of quests. You make your choices on what kind of flavor of quest you want to make and to whom. Like the guilds and houses the Morrowind has, they give you buffs or nerfs on quests based on which one you decide to side with. In a way it's a good thing that you aren't master of all, but it makes it worse since you might get a quest that isn't something your character can do. ie. Playing a pure strength/endurance Swordsman and deciding to join House Telvanni or House Hlaalu.

This is why the game is hard of beginners or people who want to try this game out after Skyrim or Oblivion. but coming from Daggerfall this game feels somewhat lacking in elements which made Daggerfall more rich game. For example in Daggerfall you are able to climb anything or break down doors, meaning that rogue and fighter could still move forward without any investment to their class respected skills.

In Morrowind you are in a way forced to invest a small portion of your skill pool to security to get other side of the doors or chests. Same with levitation, it's very useful skill and progresses the game heavily once you learn how to use for 10 seconds. This also means that alchemy and enchanting are skills that you should be put in minor because of their usefulness in any class. So this means it's better to choose one main weapon, restoration, destruction, armor type and all the things above as minimum for decent character.

So as a final thought, pick this game on sale and play it, it's still a good game.",1658338325,1658338325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- For the most part, the writing is excellent. It feels like a realistic world wherein many of the quests are mundane, but not grindy.  It's a good balance that also lets the more fantastical main quest shine by comparison.
- They evidently didn't give a shit about balancing, which actually creates a nice feeling of accomplishment when you create a spell that positively breaks the game. As long as it works in a way that's predictable to the way the game systems were intentionally designed, I think the ability to game the game's systems is very charming.
- The set design is more unique than later entries in the series, and, honestly, most western RPGs
- The writing-heavy dialogue system, which allows things to be explained in a greater amount of detail. It also allows modders to create dialogue-heavy quests that fit in much better than they would in the later voice acted entries
- The dice-roll based combat system makes level progression obvious in terms of gamefeel
- The lack of fast travel allows for a lovely feeling of serendipity for when you happen to come across quest-givers in the middle of nowhere, which is pretty common in the early game
- Levitation

Cons:
- Standard Bethesda bullshit, you have to download an unofficial patch or (preferably) OpenMW to make absolute sure you have a stable experience. I know it was a bit of a hack-job because the company was about to go under, but they've had many successful years since then to fix their own damn game.
- The soundtrack is like half an hour long
- The writing-heavy dialogue system, if you really don't have the patience to do that much reading (or are dyslexic and just now picking it up for the first time)
- The dice-roll based combat system is going to frustrate you
- The lack of fast travel is going to frustrate you
- Vivec city

Recommendations for if you do decide to play this:
- Don't minmax your character, for the love of god. That's more for experienced players who like to suffer. Pick your class skills according to what you'll actually use, and then actually use the correct weapons, and your swing failure rate should be much lower, even right at the beginning of the game

Morrowind so abundantly obviously stands head-and-shoulders-and-a-full-step-ladder above the other entries in the Elder Scrolls series. The world design, the lore, the atmosphere. Those elements remain fresh and delightful far after the admittedly dated gameplay can tire a player. They draw the player into the strange forbidding world in spite of its hostility. These aspects have kept me coming back to it, time and time again, to experience a unique sense of wonder.

""Each Event is preceded by Prophecy. But without the hero, there is no Event."" Thus the game's opening cinematic begins. In most other games, the game's events proceed to give meaning to such a statement: the player knows that they are the hero. In Morrowind, that is not the case. Not at first, at least. The player, a prisoner ""born on a certain day to uncertain parents"", is sent from the Imperial City in Cyrodiil, to the island of Vvanderfell. Released, you are given a package, some gold, and told to find your contact Caius Cosades in the city of Balmora. And just like that, you are let go. You walk outside, you find a quiet village. In the distance further down you see a giant bug with hollowed out shell. The native standing in front of it offers his services to you: in exchange for a few pieces of gold, ride the bug to several cities and villages around the island, including your destination. The world does not get any less weird from here.

In your journey, you will encounter secret cults, abandoned ruins whose inhabitants seem to have vanished suddenly without a trace (they [i]have[/i], in fact, vanished from reality), quiet hamlets, wizards in isolated towers who definitely do not want you there, living gods, feuding nobility, and beasts and monsters that look nothing you have ever seen before. In Morrowind, Bethesda manages to create a world so captivating, so unique, I have never seen anything like it before or since. They certainly have been unable to capture the magic they bottled here in any of their later entries in both the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series.

Morrowind is my favourite game of all time. It's not the gameplay, or the story really. It's that I have never played game that created a world so captivating, weird, and utterly fascinating.",1595031742,1657677438,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

cant believe i havent reviewed this game yet 
after playing oblivion and skyrim i thought id get this game and see whats its like all the reviews say its difficult to get into but once you do itll be one of the bets games you've ever played 

to start of the games pretty dated graphics and machanics wise but this didnt bother me cuz it wasnt the worst thing id seen and with mods it can look pretty good the mechanics were very diffrent from the other elder scrolls id played

the first time id played i was overwhelmed and ended up quiting 4 hours in due to not understanding anything and not having any power at all i coudnt hit anything and when i did hit something itd be the power of a slap to the face. not having  a marker to tell you where to go just seemed dumb to me and it took me half an hour to finf the first dungeon your sent to for the main story than when there it took me another half an hour to find the damn puzzle box so i just gave up and played other games instead 

when i came back after my break i dicided to watch videos to help me in the early game id found a axe in a tree stump that was much better than my dagger and i did a mission to find out who murdered the tax man to get a bit on money after that i went to balmora joined the mages guild did the fist missions in the main story and than the game just kind of hit me and i started to fall in love with it the story was a real refrsher after playing the horrible oblivion one and half arsed skyrim story 

the dlc were great i think bloodmoon was miles ahead of the tribunal tho as it was a completly new area from morrorwind and id never played the skyrim dlc that takes you to solstheim so it was a new place to me the story was a blast 
tribunal wasnt as good for me due to the story being fetch quests but the loot is worth it 

ive made two charaters a dark elf mage and a redguard melle build the mage was loads of fun due to the spell system being amazing and more complex that the other games being able to jump a whole city is realy fun and also the best way to get around if you mess around with console by uping your strength and altheisism you can just the whole map
the mages guild was fun untill i found out about the tellvanni so i decided to join them its great how there is consequence to joining a guild as anther guild might go to war to with you depending on who you join like tellvanni and the mages guild or the fighters guild and the theives guild 

the mods to this game are amazing theres projects that are just flc like tamreil rebuilt witch adds on the rest of morrowind to the game its around half way done and has been going for almost 20 years i still havent played this mod or the mods from project tamriel witch are planning to add other provences to the game the same as beyond skyrim is for skyrim 


this is my favourite game of all time and im estatic that i pushed past the hard ships in the game 
this made me rellise how bad modern bethesda games are im just hoping that es6 can be as good as morrowind or even better

There's really too much to say about how good this game is. It will be difficult to get into and feel borderline boring at the start but as you get levels and slowly piece together how to play the game, it becomes extremely fun.

There aren't map markers but here's the thing; you don't need them. Not only because the NPC's give you directions themselves, also that Vardenfell is an extremely dense open world. It will feel massive as you explore it but you'll quickly come to now where everything is as you fill out your map. Before you're done with your first guild questline (of which there are around 8, I believe) you'll have a good grasp on where stuff is.

It's a learning experience and if you use the community for help, you'll pick it up quick. It's incredbily rewarding to do so though, as Morrowind has more nuance in it's questlines, their outcomes, and the choice and consequence of what you do in the world than Skyrim or Oblivion. This is mainly because of it's lack of voice acting, so you won't see this again likely. The world itself is also one of the most creative and conceptually interesting fantasy worlds I've ever experienced. It's totally alien, mysterious, and extremely cool to roleplay in.

Play it. Easy top ten for me no question.

Edit: In terms of mods if you're so inclined, Morrowind Code Patch and Morrowind Graphics Extender will modernize the game and give you many more options to tailor the visuals or fix up some gameplay issues.

Tamriel Rebuilt is working to restore the entire mainland of the province of Morrowind, as the base game only takes place in the middle of it. They're 1/3rd of the way there. The content in it is comparable in quality to the base game but less content dense imo. This project is around 20 years old

Project Tamriel was at one point trying to add all the other Elder Scrolls provinces, but currently is only seeking to add Skyrim and Cyrodiil within Morrowind's lore and world building. Meaning, their landscape will be totally different. There's a decent chunk of ""Skyrim: Home of the Nords"" available and an island for ""Province: Cyrodiil""

All of these can be found on the Nexus for Morrowind and I'd personally suggest them.",1656864551,1656865574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Tips for enjoying the game on a first playthrough;
  -  Atronach birthsign makes mages very difficult to play, save it for a second playthrough.
  -  Don't try to experience all content in the game with one character, mages shouldn't be doing thieves guild quests and such, it's made to discourage that behavior.
  -  Pick Mercantile as a Minor skill no matter what class you make.
  -  If the game has a seemingly impossible quest, it may be a trap.
  -  Clean your inventory regularly. NPCs will not do business with you if you have illegal materials (Skooma, Moon Sugar, Ebony)
  -  Use the transportation. if you have a printer, i recommend printing out a copy of the game map and making lines for the transportation available to you.
  -  Most importantly, USE OPENMW, this game engine is a little screwed in the head, and even modern computers may suffer performance issues without OpenMW, not to mention some major bugs that it patches, along with having a sister project which allows you to play multiplayer.",1656635633,1656635633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My character is currently in the Imperial Cult, but is also working with the Morag Tong (even though I’m currently killing a Morag Tong for Mephala). 
I’m also the Master of the Fighters Guild. 
I had to kill two leaders because they were scared I’d take their jobs. 
Well, I did, and their lives. 
Then I sold all their personal belongings for one drake a piece. 
Just to be as an asshole and remove them from all existence.

I’m also becoming unkillable. 
Nothing can hit me before I jab them with a fucking halberd. 
I sometimes take on dremora without a shred of clothing. 
Fuck ‘em. 
If they’re immortal, I want them to remember dying to a naked lizard.
I also can’t stop taking skooma. 
It controls me at this point. I just guzzle it and launch myself around like Superman.
I’ll just fly to the clouds and kill a cliff racer on the way down.

But my main goal of all is to kill Vivec. 
I haven’t started the story yet, but that motherfucker's dead when I'm done. 
I’ll use ‘em then kill ‘em while high off my ass.
A god dying to a drug addict.

Oh. And my house is a mess. 
I need to visit the mudcrab merchant soon. 
Nothing fits in bags anymore, so there’s just candles and books and weapons and human flesh everywhere. I walk in and it stutters trying to load everything. 
(Haven’t had a Dark Brotherhood fucker attack in there yet. Thank god there’s no physics engine.)
Also, this game can get fucking spooky sometimes. 
The mood in some places is so desolate and alien. Sound design in this game is awesome.

Oh yeah. I forgot to mention my guy kills people in public for literally no reason. 
I’ve done it so much that the game glitched and guards attack me despite having no bounty. I kill them in self-defense, so I’m good; but the world is slowly turning against me.
My own guild mates hate me because of all my conflicting guild memberships.
Fuck ‘em.
I do what I want.
And the Aedra still love me. I get free blessings all the time.
Basically I’ve made this game my bitch.
And I love it.
I haven’t felt this immersed in an RPG in a long time.

A big plan I have for later is robbing the vaults in Vivec.
I’m going to steal all the money and just give it to everyone who survives this Hell I’ve made.
I’ll kill all the Houses. We don’t need ‘em.
I’ll just let each town prosper and live in anarchy.
I don’t want to be a leader.
I want to be a dominator.
Having everything and literally giving it away is sheer bliss. I’ve got everything I need.
I’ll just die alone in a shack after a skooma binge.
And my soul will go on.
But my passion will rest here forever - in the land of Vvardenfell.

1, I played Skyrim first
2, I grew up in the 90's
3, I have only played for 3 hours at this time.

I really really enjoy Morrowind. I understand the graphics are poor compared to games like Skyrim, but it is a lot of fun. Morrowind is honestly very immersive to me.

Here is a short list of why I feel Morrowind is so immersive:

1, Quest log is a journal (which is written in the first person)
2, No quest markers
3, Speech is actually useful. Befriending someone can get you more info!
4, No skill tree (which some may see as a bad thing).
5, The list of skills feels really in depth.
6, character skills upon creation of my character had depth.

CONS.

1, Lack of options for character appearance.
2, Lack of spoken character dialogue.

morrowind is about 20 years old, but i didn't even touch this game until june 2021, so this review is completely void of nostalgia goggles. 

i immediately loved that the world map is a lot smaller than basically every other elder scrolls game ever, but still has a ton of depth in it and is still pretty big overall. i also loved how you start out in the middle of nowhere in a small town that isn't really important in the grand scale of the game, and from there you are able to go wherever and do whatever. you always hear stories of how a new player leaves that first town and basically starts an epic adventure that began with talking to a random npc in a random town, and i really didn't understand until i played for myself. having now put in close to 400 hours, i can say i've seen just about everything there is to see in morrowind, and i can say that this is in my top ten favorite games of all time. it is definitely worth purchasing, especially when it and oblivion are bundled together in a sale for a few bucks.",1629098770,1656315503,True,0,0,0.463320463895797729,0,True,False,False

Don't get me wrong, it's probably a great game and it probably deserves the praise but I just couldn't get used to so many aspects of this game. The graphics are not my issue and after a while, the lack of voice acting was also not an issue. It's primarily the gameplay mechanics. The player is slow, the lack of map markers is a personal issue of mine since I prefer my hand being held a bit in games, and most of all, the fighting is atrocious. Almost all of my attacks would miss and that got annoying very quick. You could aim directly on someone and hit 50 times and you'd be lucky if 2 of them hit. I get there are mods to fix this so maybe I'll return to it someday. I'm sure it was an amazing experience for its time and I'm happy for those saying it's great. Overall, I personally just couldn't get into this game because of how dated it was. Considering my PC can only run so many games, most being old, I got used to dated visuals. It's really only a few games like the first Witcher game and Morrowind that aged poorly.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.
Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

This game is amazing!  The sheer amount of lore that went into this game...wow.  The landscapes are beautiful, with or without the Morrowind Rebirth mod or whatever the newest mod out there is to change the scenery... I highly recommend that mod for the aesthetics.  You can visit Solstheim with the Bloodmoon DLC included in the GOTY edition, just like with TES: V Skyrim.  I personally don't care about Solstheim or werewolves in either game.  Vampirism is meh, but you are more resistant to normal weapons as a vampire...and there is that one ""broken"" vamp quest.

Not only does this game not give you any sense of direction for anything, but every quest is something along the lines of; ""keep going northwest till you see the green house. Therefore it will be the house above the blue house to the left of the brown cat."" The skills in this game are horrendous as well, as you have to upgrade your combat so your character doesn't miss with his sword. I don't get how you would keep missing, as all you have to do is just drop it on them even to hit them. It really puts your character in this regressed state, where they couldn't even get a blanket off if someone laid it on them. The areas seem pretty barren and empty, leaving you to just aimlessly wander around till you get killed in the swamps. All in all, I bet this was a cool game back in the day, where you could just sink hours into it getting lost going to the main story, but no one likes games like that nowadays. I want to actually know what I am doing, and be able to actually do something. If you want something to show you how great Oblivion or Skyrim is, I would say to get this game. The only redeeming qualities I see in this game, is how it was revolutionary for the time. I give my respects to the old games that walked so that games nowadays could run, but this game feels like torture if you aren't playing it like it's Fable.

That being said, tread carefully ye who have never played.

I don't like debating with people about why I think Morrowind is better than Oblivion or Skyrim, it's my opinion and it's one built upon my own personal experience with the game, and as such YOUR MILEAGE MAY VERY.

This game will feel immensely different than Oblivion or Skyrim, and if you are determined to jump in, then keep an open mind for when this game came out. There are countless videos on YouTube going into the nitty gritty of Morrowind versus Oblivion/Skyrim (it's a meme-worthy comparison), but those who love it do so for good reason.

I openly acknowledge that, while much of my love for this game is nostalgic, I find myself returning to it at least once a year and enjoying it just as much as I did in the 2000's. The depth of the lore, the alien-nature of the landscape, the mythical heights of the story, these aspects are unparalleled in other Bethesda games.

The gameplay itself is antiquated by today's standards, given it's combat is largely a Dice Roll based chop/thrust/slash system akin to D&D (with hit-accuracy often becoming the bane of player's existence). The magic system can be easily broken, resulting in low-cost OP spells. And while much of this can be corrected or amended through extensive modding (a scene that is still alive and active), the game will never run like its successors. The lack of voice-acting may also alienate many players familiar with Bethesda's iconic dialogue.

Thus, my advice to any new players is to approach the game from a story/lore perspective first. If you commit to ""reading the game"" you will be rewarded with a world that feels fully fleshed out, a world-building that was given immense love and effort. Talk to everyone, read every book, explore every nook and cranny. If you give the game your attention, it will give you an experience unlike almost every RPG.

My takeaway: I understand that Morrowind is an older title but even then it can hold its weight compared to titles that have come out more recently. That being said it is an extraordinary game but has its flaws in gameplay that can’t be ignored. I restarted this game twice in hopes of getting into it but I just couldn’t. In my very short time playing this title I came across an extremely buggy and slow moving world, combat that didn’t make any sense, and bulky long dialogue. If I’m reading between the lines I see an amazingly structured and beautifully created game. The story is great and the world building is out of this world! I just couldn’t bring myself to look past the dated mechanics and graphics which is my own fault because I can tell I’m missing out on something special.

You can create your own character, build your own class, and essentially play whoever you want to in a rich story filled world; if you don’t mind the old graphics and dated mechanics I would tell anyone to give it a go!

[u]Pros[/u]
[list]
   [*] Easily one of the most groundbreaking games in its generation.
   [*] Exploring is a very well made focus in this game.
   [*] Your choices ACTUALLY matter! It’ll shape how people interact with you and how your story progresses.
   [*] Soundtrack is amazing.
   [*] Story and world building is unlike anything else.
   [*] Character creation!
   [*] Class creation!
 [/list]

[u]Cons[/u]
[list]
   [*] The combat! You swing and swing and swing and you’ll never be sure if you’re doing anything.
   [*] Tutorial could be way better; it really just throws you in.
   [*] Dialogue in this game is bulky and hard to read/comprehend.
   [*] Very easy to get lost and even easier to just flat out not understand what you’re doing.
   [*] Older game = older graphics.
   [*] Mechanics and gameplay itself is very clunky and takes getting used to.
   [*] No quest marker; just pages of paper you have to read through.
   [*] So slow. Very slow. Extremely slow pace.
   [*] Voice acting has to be some of the most repetitive and boring I’ve ever heard.
 [/list]

[spoiler] I really didn’t realize that the sweetrolls were a running joke until I played the other Elder Scrolls games. If you’re a fan of the franchise I highly recommend. [/spoiler]

Then there's the cliff racers which look like small pterodactyl and they're everywhere on the open map they swarm you, you'll always end up fighting one your not even safe in towns or cities, the most annoying mob in morrowind you'll be glad when you're done playing because you don't have to fight them until you come back to morrowind,
There's little to no voiced dialog just idle chat that doesn't match 90% of time who you're talking to, there's voiced cutscenes far between, and some voiced dialog from the main villain, so from the most part you'll be reading alot unless you want to be lost since there's no quest markers so you'll be relying on your journal, the good thing is quest don't have deadlines and you actually have to try if you want to mess up your play session both with sidequest and main quest, 
this Steam version doesn't save your settings so you have to configure your in game settings everytime you boot up the game, the game can crash so get use to saving alot, and finally the window can crash and get stuck when exiting out after a long play session

There are so many review on Morrowind that I thought I'd share some tips for beginners instead, and adressing fanboy topics.

INITIAL REMARKS

I'd probably rate this game 8/10 or 9/10. Some parts has aged poorly, such as graphics and combat, but graphics can be improved. Combat is a simple hack and slash and use potions/magic like Diablo 1. Enemies gang up on you, the majority are closed range so just click that mouse button to your heart's content.

MYTHS FROM FANBOYS / TIPS FOR BEGINNERS

There are a couple of myths regarding Morrowind worth addressing. This is to prevent new players from being to deterred from playing the game.

- There is no fast travel
This is one of the most famous conceptions of Morrowind. Fast travel exist in Skyrim and Oblivion, but not in Morrowind, therefore it must be better and more immersive in Morrowind. NOTE: fast travel did exist in Daggerfall and Arena as well. The problem is that there sure is fast travel in Morrowind. Money is easy to come by, so the internal transportation system will never be too expensive. Quickly you'll learn to hop on over across the map to the major hotspots. You can travel by silt strider or ship, and even teleportation through the mages guild.
You always only have to travel one way. When you have completed your objective, simply recall spell back to the quest giver. This is well known, and just because you anchor yourself and then cast a spell, it is still very similar to fast travel.

- Magicka and health doesn't regenerate
Also not true. It is true in cities, but not in dungeons. When enemies are far away in a dungeon you can ""rest until healed"" to completely regain your magicka and health. The only place in the game I had a problem with this was in the Bloodmoon DLC in Hiricine's realm.
Because of this it is simple to cast recall when one is done with the quest their on.

- There are no map markers
""Here let me mark it on your map"" is a common line in Morrowind. You might not have a straight compass arrow pointing you toward where you're going, but you get a yellow blob usually close by. After that it is a simple matter of East-West-North-South from that yellow marker.
I have never ever had any major difficulty in finding where I'm going. The terrain is devoid of trees, grass and is in general flat. Openings in mountains are usually very easy to find, daedric shrines and Dwemer ruins are huge and easy to spot.

- Directions are confusing and the NPC lie to you so it is super hard to find your way
Also not true. I've heard of only two instances where directions are wrong, but this is not the case in the Main Quest and the guilds.

- You are super slow, but will get faster as you progress
Kind of not true. Most people have heard of the Boots of Blinding Speed. You can get these boots at level 1 and then never ever look back on being slow. At this point the slow speed is just gatekeeping for beginners. Get the boots, look it up on YouTube or something and save yourself from a terrible experience.

- You'll never hit anything
This is mostly true in maybe level 1-5 of the game. As long as you level combat skills fast (use trainers if you have to) the problems quickly go away. This is also a gatekeeping mechanic in that most experienced players would never keep sucking since it is not fun, and it is also a mechanic reserved for the absolute beginning of the game.

- Using a guide is cheating
I don't understand why Morrowind fanboys calls you a cheater for using a guide like UESP. They think that if you ever read a guide and don't just play this game blind you're a filthy cheater and will be a filthy cheater forever until the end of times. I'd say use guides for things to make your life easier such as finding the Boots of Blinding Speed, but not for quest directions (they are quite simple). 
   They pretend that strategy guides never existed when a game like Morrowind surely had a guide - included in the GoG version for sure - which is 419 pages long. Morrowind would also be covered in PC magazines at the time. Just because YouTube didn't exist yet, doesn't mean there weren't guides.

TIPS

- Use graphics mods, look it up on YouTube. MGE XE makes the draw distance better among other things which is a must.

- Learn how to make some easy starting cash in the beginning (use a guide)

- Use trainers. Trainers are cheap and can be found all over the 2nd city you go to; Balmora. Levelling up normally takes too long or you'll have to use stupid exploits.

- Do a guild after you've met Caius. I recommend doing Imperial Legion since they give you armor and weapons for free.

- Get the Boots of Blinding Speed as soon as you can, this should be your #1 priority

- Use guides when stuck.",1604591431,1654758568,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're going to try this game, I highly suggest using OpenMW even if you don't plan to use mods because the game runs a lot better on Windows 10 with this program and it stopped crashing on me. 

It's also a good idea to play around with character creation for a bit to see what suits you.  I did look at character build guides for some ideas, but it's not necessary because you can still become powerful even with an inefficient build.  Having a decent build does help out a lot when you're starting, however, since it will be easier to survive and do damage.  A warrior with supportive magic like Mysticism and Restoration was the easiest start for me. 

The lore and the worldbuilding is fantastic. Morrowind ranks up there with Planescape: Torment as having the coolest environment to explore in any RPG I've experienced.  You have weird mushroom buildings owned by eccentric wizards, ash plains riddled with diseased undead and incredibly annoying cliff racers, and lush swamps filled with all kinds of plants to use in alchemy.  It's amazing how well Bethseda was able to create different atmospheres with the game's dated graphics.

The lore also a lot more interesting than Skyrim's.  Dunmer culture is very alien compared to that of the Nords and Imperials, but their behavior makes sense given the harsh environment they live in and the guidance they received from certain Daedric princes.  Joining one of the Dunmer factions like a Great House or the Tribunal Temple is a good way to learn more about the world.  

The main quest is also really good.  While Morrowind's story doesn't involve dynamic, apocalyptic events like Skyrim's dragons or Oblivion's gates, there is a sense of creeping doom as you encounter more and more people and creatures that have been touched by the evil affecting the land.  Also, the role of Dunmer Messiah isn't given to you right away.  You have to prove yourself through numerous trials, which is a lot more satisfying than doing a handful of quests and quickly becoming the leader of the faction. 

I love Morrowind very much, though there are some aspects to the game that I didn't like.  Movement speed is pretty terrible for awhile until you train Speed to high levels.  Granted, there are enchanted items and spells to mitigate this, but they aren't affordable for awhile unless you know where to find valuable stuff.  I spent my first ten levels out of stamina most of the time because I couldn't endure having to walk everywhere.  Also, the dice roll combat doesn't mesh well with FPS mechanics.  A turn-based game will usually show ""miss"" animations but in Morrowind it looks like you're hitting even if you failed the dice roll.  This can be frustrating at low levels.  Lastly, NPCs will block you A LOT in hallways. Waiting for an hour clears your path most of the time, but sometimes you have to use console commands to reset their positions.  This was an especially irritating problem with the stairwells at Fort Frostmouth in the Bloodmoon expansion.

I could go on and on about this game, but this review is getting too long as it is.  Morrowind is a joy to play and I highly recommend it.

While not my first game ever (that honor goes to Unreal (1998), it was still the first one that truly opened up my imagination and was the initial catalyst of my creative writing abilities that would later evolve into roleplaying on the likes of user-made maps on Starcraft and eventually various MMO's. I engage in creative writing and roleplaying to this day and it all dates back to Morrowind.

When my brother got back from an unsuccessful attempt in the Air Force, he came home with an Xbox and… this. My recently passed mother often referred to Morrowind as having the best music she’d ever heard, and often watched me play in the earlier days. So the importance of Morrowind to me cannot be understated.

I used to claim that it took fifteen or more years to finally feel dated, but I binged eight hours of it earlier today and it still holds up. I unfortunately have long since lost any sense of wonder and discovery, having the muscle memory and just general memory of knowing where some of the master trainers were, hidden caches of gems, and the specific mechanics of high level enemy respawns that allowed me to farm high value-to-weight ratio gear to sell and managed to swim in hundreds of thousands of gold to mass-train myself quickly into Godhood before doing five quests. (For those curious; when you get attacked by assassins, follow that questline to the Mournhold sewers, kill what you can handle, sell their gear in the Bazaar, rinse repeat).

So for the newcomers, this is a twenty year old fantasy RPG. Attacks will commonly miss until you train your weapon up because there’s just an invisible back end mechanic that changes your chances to hit. Thankfully the leveling curve can be pretty smooth (as long as you know how to run away). Keep swinging at those basic bandits and mudcrabs, once you get a weapon skill into the 40’s and 50’s it becomes a lot easier.

There’s no map markers or instant fast travel, but there are spells to help (Mark/Recall, the two Interventions) that can help land traversal be much less annoying. Instead there’s a robust journal where you can look up key words alphabetically, and in a later expansion (with this very version) they gave us a functional quest log to help keep track of what you’re doing. 

It still has the usual staples of inventory management, gear, damage types, and so on. Even recent gamers won’t find themselves too abandoned to ye olde wastelands. What really brought Morrowind to the forefront of millennial gamer’s minds was the inherent weirdness of the whole thing. Vvardnefell’s biome is strangely varied. A volcanic mass in the middle, blocked by a ghostly gate to keep a powerful disease at bay. The west, swamplands. The south, an ocean with a Venice-inspired water-based city. The east, fairly even grassy plains and hills. All over you’ll find imperialistic, Roman inspired stone buildings alongside carved-out mushrooms and resin-based buildings with crablike imagery. It’s a wild place to be, and I highly miss going door to door in every town and finding out what’s in there. Or noticing that a path diverges slightly, and I always knew there was something cute tucked away.

Story-wise, it’s a fairly old school chosen one style but with a general twist. The idea is that you are the reincarnation of a long lost hero, but it’s not as literal as you’d think. There’s no ghost that speaks to you, no mentor that guides you as a spirit. He’s just not there at all. Instead you are guided down a path through political means to the point where you’re simply taking up the mantle, and in doing so you unite Vvardenfell against an enemy that wants to spread a forged disease to kill or enslave the world. The fact is you’re not really the “chosen one”, you are a hero that took the steps to help save the landmass.

Or don’t. If you kill an important NPC you get a message telling you to reload or “continue in the doom world you have created”. You can lock out some questlines but nothing truly stops you from continuing to play. It would take hundreds of hours to explore every tomb, cave, and quest.

So clearly, I’d highly recommend this game. Modding it is fairly simple if you think that may help the graphical fidelity, and it runs fine on modern machines through some resolution tweaking. I just feel that Morrowind is a must play for anyone interested in where some genres got some of their ideas, because Elder Scrolls was one of the first.",1654559669,1654611818,True,36,1,0.741902828216552734,0,True,False,False

I hate it, not for the gameplay, the graphics, the story, etc. etc. but for the fact it ruined the magic of Oblivion & Skyrim for me. Morrowind is one of the best games of all time, plain & simple. For being nearly 20 years old, it's easily the most engaging open world game I've ever played. 

There are no quest markers holding your hand guiding you through the big scary dungeons, you have to pull on your big boy pants and explore them yourself. Hidden areas are legitimately hidden, you have to search for them & constantly check your local map. You'll find hidden tombs & barrows tucked away in rocky alcoves, not shoved right on the main road. Speaking of hidden things, Morrowind is absolutely crammed with hidden gear, It's completely worth checking over & under everything in dungeons since there might be a hidden sword or pair of boots stashed away. There are a huge amount of small/unmarked things, too. Everything from encountering a shrieking man falling from the sky, to helping a bloodthirsty orc meet his end, and meeting a friendly crab who's more than happy to buy all your junk for full price. Also, the DLCs are both amazing, Bloodmoon is a little backtrack heavy, but it's great & Tribunal is just perfect. There's so much more that this game offers that I can rave about, but I hate overly bloated reviews.

Is the combat that great? No, to be honest, it's horrid. Unless you download mods or mess around in the command window, you're probably going to be using 1, MAYBE 2, types of weapons and armor your whole playthrough. And onto the biggest gripe I have with this otherwise perfect game: the Hortator & Nerevarine quests. These quests are absolutely miserable. You have to walk around to every single tribal camp & Great House spread across the whole island just to get them to recognize you as Nerevar reincarnate. Some of the quests you have to do aren't bad, others are full of pointless backtracking & huge dialogue trees. Easily the worst part of the whole game. Also, the game's default controls are beyond archaic, but it's nothing 45 seconds in the menu won't fix.

TLDR: Buy Morrowind, you s'wit. Also, the 6th House, the Tribe Unmourned shall rise again!",1654484452,1654484452,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
22320,116556524,76561198079455659,0,64,6072,0,6072,1654472216,"tl;dr: I would recommend anyone who likes classic RPG's play Morrowind. 

Pros:
+Incredible world-building that lays the foundations for future installments.
+Varied quests and characters with interesting outcomes.
+Magic is much more open to customization than future titles. Making your own spells is required at some points.
+Character progression that feels very tangible. Feels like an actual power fantasy past the midpoint, and you start from a weak nobody before progressing to a god.

=Classic RPG mechanics. Everything plays out like a more traditional tabletop RPG for better and for worse. Combat is dice rolls which can be circumvented, but it's not friendly to new players or players whose only experience is Skyrim.
=Travelling from place to place isn't easy and there is no fast travel. This provides a challenge for an otherwise basic thing that most people don't think about. Once you've ""solved"" travelling late game it becomes another annoyance.

-Combat is not deep. Once you get consistent hits at a high enough skill level it's all about spamming your attacks. Magic is similar and you can only use one at a time very slowly. Using spells for combat feels weak unless you know what you're doing. Magicka doesn't naturally regenerate while walking around or waiting and you need to rest and it's not always easy to do so in the middle of an adventure.
-The DLC's are tedious. Bloodmoon is filled with too many enemies that all have some form of magical reflection, and they are damage sponges. Once your strength gets high enough your weapons break too fast and Solstheim has no easy way to get repair hammers. The quests are very rote ""Go here, talk to person, kill thing, come back"" stuff. Tribunal is even worse with this and has a gigantic sewer system that is easy to get lost in which the game constantly expects you to navigate for every major quest. During my playthrough of the game I got major burnout while forcing myself through these two campaigns.
-Glitches. Bethesda is known for their funny bugs, but Morrowind's were never interesting to me. Just annoying. Even with a very high quality fan patch I ran into bugs and oversights that required a wiki walk and console commands to fix. Quests would sometimes become impossible to complete or remove from the journal without the console. Speaking of quests...
-Some quests are evil. A quest where the ideal outcome only has a 65% chance to succeed and you can fail through no fault of your own. The lack of quest markers is generally a good thing, but if you don't ask the exact right questions or the developers forgot to give you the right details then it is incredibly easy to miss what to do next.

Pft.  People are [i]idiots[/i]) I did get a kick out of this one.

I first played it back in 2003 or 2004, got the game of the year edition at Best Buy, could NOT get into it. The color palate just didn't work for me. Dispiriting. Gross. Just couldn't play it for more than a few hours, though I enjoyed the game itself.

But I got in a MOOD after downloading Daggerfall, and decided I wanted to play 3-5 again, so here we are. All in all, kinda sad I missed out back in the day. It has the main thing I like (and hate) about games back then, which is that it's BROKEN. When they created this whole world and all the ways with which you could interact with it, certain mechanics worked in such a way that if you wanted, you could just utterly dominate the whole system. In THIS case, it's alchemy. (Enchanting could've been similar, but they made it so freakin' impossible to get a success on really GOOD enchantments even with 100 skill that getting started with it became more trouble than it was worth, compared to alchemy, which is a breeze.)

If you know what I mean, you know, and if you don't, Google exists, so I don't need to waste space here.

Point is that they created a sandbox and left these things in practically as a reward. ""Want to get into our system and really play in this world? Then if you try, you can do THIS!"" It has the feel of playing a game as kids where you make up the rules as you go, and if you wanna do LITERALLY ANYTHING, then you can, you just have to think of a reasonable justification within the framework of the loosely-designed game you've created to make it possible. It gives the feeling of an experience you're joining in on, and not so much a packaged product that's like ""this time we've created very set, stringent boundaries to keep you WELL inside the box so you can't do that fun shit we accidentally let you do before."" You know, like later games in the series.

They're not BAD. They're just not as fun, and DEFINITELY not as fun in the same way.

Another fun thing that I didn't even realize is that your journal (OK, the journal is terrible) but it's not entirely to be trusted. I finished (according to the journal) one questymission thing and the last thing that transpired made me go, ""Huh. I bet this person I talked to earlier would wanna hear about that,"" so I went and talked to them on my own, the journal was uninvolved. And they were like, ""Oh, ho! That IS weird! Actually, maybe this other thing is going on,"" and suddenly I was off on a new thing that was still a part of the old thing, but I'd never have known it if I hadn't just decided to go talk to them.

In that way, even if things are generally more old-school feeling, the world actually does seem more responsive and even kinda alive than newer entries.

Anyway, I played it without mods for the base experience, and I recommend it. Right up until I beat the game and used my hyper-speed levitation potion to uncover about 95% of the whole map, and then it just crashed with no warning, so I'm uninstalling it now. I'll struggle through a crash when I'm working to finish the game, but fuck it if I'm gonna redo my random post-game stuff when it's not playing along.",1654463512,1654463611,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't let my hours deceive you, I got this game when I was 9 on the original xbox and played it for easily thousands of hours. My first play through was me going around slaughtering everyone and anyone in sight and ya know what's fun about that? The game let me! Morrowind is a game like no other and it's truly a modern marvel. You can quite literally do anything. Kill anyone, steal from anyone, levitate, punch someone until they're completely fatigued and loot their pockets! Make yourself completely invisible, enchant items and create potions that make you a borderline neigh unstoppable God! Get diseases, cry because you hear a cliff racer for the 849th time, join one of many, many factions and work your way up the ranks! Go on a quest and check your journal and realize it's really hard to find a cave in a bunch of hills with very vague directions or even with clear directions! I could actually keep going and listing all the cool things you'll be doing while playing Morrowind, but you could also buy it yourself and find out.

The combat system is a little odd at first and learning how it works is one of the harder aspects of the game as well as navigating the absolutely humongous map. I'm not evening talking about going to Mournhold or Solstheim which really give you almost too much to do. While I'm listing things that may be turn offs, check out mods that make the game a little more presentable and add decent QoL to the game because while it is a spectacular open world game, it has issues that will turn off most people due to it's age. Thankfully it's very moddable and it's easy to do.

Honestly one of my all time favorite open world games is Breath of the Wild and I don't think it could even beat out Morrowind for #1 on that list. I enjoyed the game so much so that my sister's all knew it and one even went as far as snapping my original Morrowind copy in half when I was a teen and I cried! Joke was on her though because I immediately got a GOTY edition and so resumed my love for this fantastic game. ANYWAY, buy it if you think you'd have even a smidgen of interest in it.

this is especially true for the grafics. with mods, you can still make this game look pretty decent by todays standards, but i always aim for that original experience in games and so i played it with completely vanilla grafics. morrowind was released the same year as gothic 2 and oh boy does that game kick morrowinds butt in the visual department (and basically in almost every other aspect as well, but that‘s just my opinion). 

morrowind‘s world is incredibly ugly and barren. for example, where you have lush vegetation, vibrant colors and very atmospheric world design with much care for detail in gothic 2, there are just flat fields with a rock and one or two trees or little flowers here or there in morrowind. In those areas that are especially flat and barren, there is a considerable amount of distance fog. Later there are some areas in the game that look rather atmospheric and interesting, and the interior sections are designed with a lot more care for detail than the outside world, but especially the opening areas of the game look just bland and outdated for the most part. the colorpalette basically consists of brown and dark green, any other color is barely existent in morrowind.  the artstyle is a pure matter of taste. since it plays on a vulcanic island, morrowind’s barren, insectoid aesthetics may be fitting, but i personally felt like i was walking over a giant ant hill most of the time. the worst thing by far are the blocky character models with animations so stiff that even the most primitive robot moves like a ballet dancing jellyfish in comparison. after about half a dozen hours your eyes start to get used to the dated grafics and then it starts looking not as bad anymore, but my first impression was a loud YUK! let’s face it: morrowind looks just ugly, even for 2002 standards and its world is muted and lifeless as hell. on top of it, changing the gamma setting doesn’t seem to do jack-sh*t and the game remains terribly dark in some areas to the point where you can barely see anything at all. the final nail in the coffin of its presentation is the music, which in itself is great but unfortunately drones on and on in an endless inappropriate loop that sometimes kills the whole atmosphere with unfitting musical background.

before you are able to settle in, you have to overcome at least 3 to 4 hours of the most inaccessible rpg gameplay i have ever experienced. the quest log is a jumbled mess that makes it barely possible to keep track of all your quests and kills any motivation for completing more than just the bare minimum to finish the main story. the npcs just crush you with literal walls of text (morrowind is one of the most reading intensive games i ever played) and the combat is the dullest, stiffest form of pure rpg numbercrunching and dice rolling without any actual strategy, skill or fun. The worst enemy however is the terrain. I constantly got stuck, especially in the narrow interior sections, and on the outside even the slightest bump is a chore to get over because of the floaty, almost completely useless jumping mechanic, which often doesn't let you climb the smallest rock or step. some of the locations are not only ugly but also incredibly confusing to navigate (Vivec!), and even if you know where to go it is most likely that your progress is impeded by the hundreds of times an npc blocks the corridor you have to go through or the buggy, sloppy world itself that gets you stuck in holes you can’t climb back out of or makes you fall through the floor. it doesn’t stop there with the technical problems though: after steam updated the game, it wouldn’t save my grafics-, audio-, control- and gameplay settings anymore, so I had to set them up again and again everytime i started the game. In addition, the game kept crashing repeatedly when i tried to reload my save-games. 
lastly, just like in oblivion and skyrim, the progession- and level-up system sounds good on paper but is a double-edged sword in practice: you improve your abilities not through spending skillpoints, but by just repeatedly executing the respective activities. what this leads to is that you end up constantly jumping everywhere instead of walking to increase your agility skill. you thought quake 3 arena was the king of bunnyhopping? think again.

now don’t get me wrong: even though Morrowind and I won't become best friends anymore, I can still see why so many hardcore rpg-fans absolutely love this game and think that it’s not only the best elder scrolls game, but also one of the greatest rpgs of all time. the freedom that morrowind gives you in how you want to approach it is basically unlimited and the underlying rpg mechanics are deeper than those of oblivion and skyrim combined plus the tons of lore in this game are a feast for those inclined to dig deep into it and read their a** off. what has aged severly on the other hand are its presentation, clunky controls and inventory and overall inaccessibility, that make morrowind appear much more dated than other contemporary rpgs of its time.
after a period of getting used to its gameplay I definitely had some fun with morrowind, so objectively it holds up decent enough as an rpg in 2021 i guess. however, for me personally, who really enjoys a good action-rpg now and then but overall spends more time with fast-paced fps games, it’s just not the right cup of tea in the end, and its two successors ended up much more enjoyable for me. Morrowind is radically different from Oblivion and Skyrim, so to anybody who expects an experience similar to those two: Consider yourself warned! 

Morrowind < Skyrim < Oblivion

I've probably have about 40 - 50 hours in the game (not to mention numerous hours modding it when I realized I didn't care for the un-modded game).

My thought is the same as when I first played the game when it first came out.  I find the game pretty tedious.  I just don't find the story that interesting (though I did find it interesting that you might not actually be the Chosen one, but rather simply a person who did what the chosen one was supposed to do which was enough to be called the chosen one) so I was left with combat and exploration which wasn't that good.

Honestly, the biggest issue i have is that this is a game that does levels based on using skills which is nice in theory, but just makes the early game tedious (i.e. trying to hit anything with low weapon score or moving with low athleteics) and the game is tough at the start until you either grind or get enough to get over the hump where things get tediously easy.  Since you learned through doing things, you didn't get xp from killing monsters and completing quests.  I soon found no point in doing either and the game quickly became a (bad) walking simulator. when I want what people consider a great RPG.

Not even mods to change combat or anything made the game any more fun (I had more fund looking for and installing the mods).

Maybe, just maybe, it would've been a little more enjoyable if you could walk/swim without groups of cliffracers/slaugther fish spotting you from what seemed like miles away, aggroing on you , and following until you waste killing them (or early on dying to them).",1653765258,1653765258,False,1,4,0.392120301723480225,0,True,False,False

It requires more effort to learn the game systems compared to Oblivion and Skyrim. But the game is much richer. Richer in story & world building, character options, questlines, and so on. No other game has so successfully presented a unfamiliar and detailed world that's truly its own. For instance, Skyrim's world is largely inspired by vikings. Not too much actually feels unique. It's really difficult to even pick out what real-world cultures inspired Morrowind. It's its own world. And the gameplay makes you immersed in this world. No map markers. Your quests are written down in your journal. This means you need to pay attention to things to complete quests--talk to the NPC and follow their directions, navigating and searching for your destination. 

There are many mods to update the graphics and such, as well as lore-friendly additions to the game (Morrowind Rebirth is my favorite mod for this).

Playing a class foreign to you would also help.

- Do not buy gear, only use what you loot from adventures(not shops).
- Do not use ol'scampy boi or Mr Crabs
- Do not make cheese spells. Levitate 1pt on target included.
- Do not use crazy enchantments
- With every lvl you gain, add 2 to the dificulty slider in game options

i love that this game forces you to navigate and find your way to places, understanding the worlds geography and routes it makes you understand and know the world so much better the just le funny gta waypoint trail following the dotted line, i hope elden ring will be the same way the 1 thing id love fromsoft to learn from elder scrolls is this, i love the atmosphere in this game and it has great enemy variety so many interesting enemies, skyrim barely had any in skyrim it was le bandit or dagur skelly, for such a massive game thats disappointing but morrowind is in here with dark souls quality enemy designs, too bad the combat sucks, and even tho i praise the enemy design there i like no big horrorifying cosmic being you come across, this isnt a flaw but i wish there was more big mini bosses you come across the world, skyrim despite shitting on it did this semi well, like morrowind i would at least appreciate 1 giant or 1 massive dragon, a random massive cthulhu squid in the waters, maybe these are there but i havent seen them so i cant confirm they exist, but this game already has great enemy variety and enemy designs that are so unique that this wouldve been a perfect addition, the music is a fucking banger i really love the tracks this game provides even more then skyrims, tho there is a few skyrim tracks that trump everything in morrowinds but generally morrowinds is better, now tho i havent used much magic in this game from videos i seen and clips the magic in this game is really fucking cool, the only game ive been interested in magic for, the settlements are top notched they are really unique and well designed, and sometimes this game can be genuinely funny too, the world building is a pretty great too, someone told me its better then dark souls and eh thats false but considering how little i cared for skyrims this one is impressive 
for what i dont like is for how cool this game is, sometimes it feels so fucking boring, its definitely the most boring bestheda game ive played, like somehow one of the best bethesda games and one of the most boring, wish dialogue had voice acting and the combat really blows, i dont hate the dice roll shit like skyrims isnt much better this applies to every elder scroll game so far, cliff racers, theres too many of them and they are annoying and waste my time, worst enemy in all TES,  

id say skrim is the adventurer game it feels like you are always on an adventure, morrowind is the navigater game 

there is definitely more to say but im forgetting things, all in all games a 9.8/10
its a game i need to come back to and do side quest like ive done every fallout and TES game so far, i know they are gonna be fire, 
the comeback:the economy in this game is kind of trash by the end of the game im swimming in cash and also shop keepers dont have enough cash for your late game items, simple fetch quest in this game are brilliant instead of walk to place grab thing walk back give thing to person its like get directions to thing, navigate to place, investigate where thing is and give thing, for some side quest what kind of does suck is the satisfaction of completing a quest there isnt much no climax and shit

Morrowind is a great game with a few notable cons:
Combat mechanics are flat out absurd
Many quests send you off on vague info or wild goose chases
Your character runs like hes got a shit between his legs
(Mainly just passage-of-time related issues though)

Exploring Vvardenfell is awesome regardless

I would reccommend getting a mod to fix the combat

  1, your speed at the start of the game is fucking atrocious, I know it gets better but good god you are slow, like so slow that it feels like you barely move. I understand this was a decision that was probably made to make you use the unique fast travel options, that I do like, but it still feels awful when you just want to explore around. It gets a lot better later in the game but it doesn't change that the early game exploration is going to be horrible because you move as fast as a quadriplegic.
  2, the combat is truly horrible, I get that it's mostly the lack of feedback but it still doesn't change the fact that seeing a sword phase through an enemy and do literally nothing is not fun, bows are even more egregious, you can hit someone with an arrow and the game just goes ""lol nah you didn't hit them fuck you"", I do love spell failure though, that is pretty cool and something I actually wish was in oblivion and skyrim.

The tone is more story book, rather than a realistic take on ""medieval"" Nordic warrior life like in Skyrim. Skyrim abounds in epic, dramatic and mysterious adventure while Morrowind is a bit more layed back, it is more sedentary and perhaps more introverted. Morrowind has a lot of subject matter though and those who play 5 to 10 hours into the game realise how much it has to offer. Another thing about Morrowind is the way it captures the time when it was made. There is a real early to mid 2000's feel about the game, bringing back a similar feel to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy made then, bringing also a shadow of the 90's exhilaration, adventure and fantasy. Besides this, it also brings with it an early to mid 2000's map feel about it too. Walking down into the swampy forest westward towards Gnaar Mok (apologies if I got the spelling wrong) has a very similar sense about it to the Tree House level map in Far Cry, which was made about the same time (this is somewhat of a horrifying level, I unfortunately have a limited experience of games in terms of variety).

-Your actions have a lasting effect on the world, so you have to think about what you do. Not many games nowadays are like that.
-Atmosphere is immersive and diverse.
-Character creation system allows for unlimited role play potential.
-If you want to do something, the game will let you do it. Guar-anteed.

CONS:

I personally don't have any problems at all, but here are some complaints that I hear, and call all be changed with mods, if you desire.

Here is where this game looses me personally though:
- dialogue is not spoken/voice acted 
- there are no quest markers/map updates when you take on quests
- the movement and combat in the game start off very clunky

I have tried on a few occasions to get into this game, I have put in the hours to level up weapon skills and experience some of the better quests in the game. But every time I speak to an NPC it feels like reading a wiki article rather than talking to someone. 

With quests in the game, I do need oblivion style markers for them, but it would be nice if the map revealed the location where they were referring to (like the city someone is in at they very least so I spend less time wandering aimlessly). Like I do not mind getting immersed into the world but when I wander for more than an hour and have not found the cave or the hall that the NPC I am looking for is located in it does where me down a bit. 

When it comes to be combat and the movement, I do not like how the stamina heavily affects everything you do. I feel as if I need to run all the time to make the game feel OK from the start. Running uses stamina, and if you have low stamina and get caught in a fight you're going to die. 

In the same vein, unless you level up your weapon/magic stats considerably you miss a lot of your strikes/magic attempts - which is very frustrating as well. 

For these reasons I usually default to oblivion or skyrim for my ES needs. Like I said, this game's world is amazing, the areas and quests are great, and I do recommend the game for RPG fans.

A game that if you kill the wrong person. you may forever 'brick"" your story because you can kill essential NPCs. All actions are based off dice rolls within the game engine.

Customize you character and skills. Major and minor skills dictate your levels. You truly need to build your character and plan out your late game build.

And as always, Soule's OST is brilliant and lends a real weight to the setting. 

I love TES IV and V (Oblivion and Skyrim, respectively) to death, but in my opinion the series was never more interesting than it is with Morrowind. The world, the culture, the people... everything in Vvardenfell is WEIRD, but it works. The main plot is full of intrigue and mystery, and winds its way through other questlines in a way that was never really achieved in the next two sequels.

The early game is ROUGH because of the less than ideal game design. Before I go into a long review of this game's flaws, I will state that this game isn't 100% awful. It's an elder scrolls game, and it has some cool features that others don't. I like the variety of weapons in the game (you've got maces, clubs, spears/halberds, various swords, throwing knives, throwing stars, bows, axes, etc.). I find the lockpicking sound effect very satisfying. I like being able to help free slaves and hold and actual candle or lantern for light. I think having doors and chests sometimes be trapped with magic spells is cool. The graphics are a bit scary and unpleasant (especially the way argonians and khajiit walk), but I can't fault such an old game for that.

LEVELING UP
God awful. For visuals, think of it as a logistic growth but the exponential portion of the graph is a lot more gradual. You level up by successfully perfoming skill related tasks such as: hitting enemies, being hit, persuading, using magic, etc. The problem is, when you're low level these things rarely happen because it's all RNG based and not skill based. So you're stuck in a position where you're stuck in low levels for an ungodly amount of time whilst not being able to do anything because you're low level but you need to do things to level up. I believe I was only level 3 after about 15 hours of playing. I understand some people see this kind of leveling system as ""realistic"" but when it's done to this degree it's just unfun.

COMBAT
Thoroughly unenjoyable and boring. It's layer upon layer of RNG, but not the fun kind like in Pokemon. What determines whether or not your hit lands and how much damage it does is a few different stats. First, your proficiency in the weapon type you're using, it's durability, and some of your general stats (like agility and endurance I believe) affect your odds of landing a hit. How much stamina you have left also affects these odds. What determines how much damage is done is which attack you perform with your weapon (which you have no control over). Early levels, which is a very notable portion of the game, is characterized by you furiously spamming your mouse button whilst practically kissing the enemy in front of you and whiffing 90% of your shots (and that's being generous). Also, every time you swing you lose stamina, which means the more you sit there and play mouse clicking simulator the less likely you are of actually hitting the bastard. On a more minor note, I mentioned how I loved the weapon variety in this game, but it's a shame I'll never be able to use any weapon type other than the one or two I'm proficient in because of this mechanic. I decided I wanted to branch out into the marksman skill so I took a bow and 40+ arrows and I deadass sat 1cm away from a low level creature and proceeded to not land a single arrow point blank. It was a relatively large creature too. 

NPCS
Meh. Just meh. Most of them recycle the same dialogue that everyone else says but, unlike Skyrim where you at least get to hear some decent voice acting, it's all written. For some reason they often sniff at you? Also unlike Skyrim (or Oblivion), don't bother running towards a guard and expecting their help if you're being overwhelmed by an enemy. They'll watch you die. To my knowledge, there's no available followers in the game outside of certain quests, in which case they're temporary. They're not horrible but the other elder scrolls games I've played are much better in that regard.

CAVES/AREAS
For how few and far between they've been for me, they're disappointingly small with little reward. In Skyrim, Dwemer ruins can be annoyingly large. In Morrowind, the Dwemer ruins I've found are smaller and have less enemies than the small/medium sized caves in Skyrim. They're not that fun for me. 

GENERAL MECHANICS
No fast travel, outside of some ships/creatures that can take you to nearby towns. Wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so goddam slow or if there were horses. Personally, I don't enjoy having half my gameplay be walking back and forth on empty paths.
No quest markers/The Journal. I understand the fun to be had in figuring out where to go for a quest via directions from NPCs, but sometimes they give shit directions. I take more issue with the quest log or jounral really. It's not a bad idea, honestly I think it's a little cool to have your quest related gameplay logged in your character's journal. What I don't like is having to flip through and scan 30 pages to try to find that one quest you put off for a bit because you didn't have time or were too low a level to complete. It's annoying.

Will I stop playing this game? I wanted to but I keep coming back. What can I say, I'm a Dead By Daylight player, putting up with unfun mechanics is in my blood. However, I would not recommend this game over Oblivion or Skyrim. Morrowind does have a few cool traits that I would like to see in future elder scrolls games, but the overall experience I've had in morrowinf vs skyrim and oblivion is just embarassingly unfun.",1651469767,1651469767,False,0,0,0.326790899038314819,0,True,False,False

To better understand the place I come from when making this review, let me give a brief overview of myself and gaming experience. I am 30 years old at this time, and I have spent 95% of my life playing video games (and tabletop RPGs). I am not new to crusty graphics, janky mechanics, or complex UI elements. I play a lot of RPGs with a lot of dialogue and/or downtime as well as a lot of unforgiving games. I have more patience than most people. I have pushed through many segments of games I didn't like or found tedious because the game itself interested me.

Within the context of when it came out, it was an ambitious game. This review is aimed at people who might be looking to try this for the first time, and likely with less patience than myself. My feelings are more nuanced than can be easily conveyed via a 'Pro' and 'Con' list, so I shall go into details about the primary aspects of the game. Disclosure: I used the Morrowind Code Patch and many visual mods. I made zero efforts to alter the base gameplay beyond default options checked in the MCP.

The base visuals of the game have a good, clear art direction. They are definitely aged. The overwhelming amount of mods available can make the game look very nice. Visuals are usually not something to judge a game negatively for unless the art style itself is distracting or otherwise not well done.

In terms of audio the game is fine. Audio quality on what few voices there are is good, and the sound effects do their job. The music will get repetitive very quickly. What music there is in the game is most certainly good. Not playlist-worthy, but it's good. With how repetitive it got I ended up playing my own music for large portions of the game.

Lore. Important in games, infinitely so for RPGs. Morrowind has a lot. Tons of dialogue to read, and countless books. For those interested in TES's world this is definitely an area that does not disappoint. The presentation leaves a lot to be desired. I am no stranger to reading. I do prefer voices NPCs and a voiceless PC in games, but I was not turned off by the lack of the games voice acting. I was put off by how a lot of the lore is conveyed. The dialogue system is cumbersome: You can choose from an ever-growing list of keywords to discuss with NPCs who will then give you information and more keywords. There are many cases where you can ask NPCs about topics that result in no new information at best, or weird character breaks at worst. The dialogue system makes it tedious to go through topics and makes conversations feel disjointed/unnatural. More importantly, for people that like important story elements conveyed in a more straightforward or condensed manner, and leaving the superfluous elements for books and the like, the lore will definitely be harder to digest. It is definitely something that can be dealt with, but the journey for lore tended to be tedious to the point I spent more time reading wiki entries than shuffling through various NPCs and books.

Gameplay. This is where the game aged the most. Melee/ranged is dice rolls based on stats. Even if you shoot an arrow at the enemy, and see it physically intersect with the character model, the dice determine if it hits or misses. At low levels you will miss most all attacks. By the end game for me, I missed rarely. In games like Xcom and Pathfinder it works for me. Here? It's jarring. and it detracted from the game. In Pathfinder (and Xcom and similar things such as positioning matter greatly in combat. You can use the terrain and abilities to supplement hit %. In Morrowind, other than potions/spells, there is no way to mitigate low %. Mid-end game melee and ranged combat is you standing in front of your enemy and left clicking until they're dead. Dodging isn't a thing. End game for me was taking every opportunity I could to skip enemies and having zero issue fighting anything I couldn't.

Magic combat is possibly better, but as someone that wanted to play melee with magic as a supplement I found it to also fall short. You can fail to cast a spell if your skill isn't high enough, and you rest to get back magicka. There was a MCP option to enable magicka regen and, while I wanted a mostly vanilla feel for my playthrough, [i] I regret that choice and would highly encourage using it even if you make no other changes. [/i] Even at the endgame with 100 in every stat I could cast so few spells that I never used magic. Potions are a thing, but carry weight is something I struggled with through the entire game. For the magic I wanted to use, no regen was awful. From a combat standpoint I have to assume it's better if you have a high chance to cast the spell, but at the end of the day the offensive spell variety is not great either. The supplementary spell variety is a lot better, but it feels like you must be built for it from the start.

You level up when you achieve 10 increases in your chosen Major or Minor skills. Based on how many times you leveled up in a Major, Minor, or Miscellaneous skill, you can apply three stat bonuses ranging from 1 to 5 to your primary stats that the skills are affected by. Leveling a skill(s) that only affects one or two stats means inefficient levelling, which means weaker character, and it simply becomes a very tedious, chore-like experience to improve your character.

Travel takes a long time. The world is big and you move very slow. There are cities which have fast travel services to other specific locations, but you will do a lot of travelling in between. Nothing interesting ever happens when do travel, too. NPCs don't have routines or scripting. They stay in the same spot forever until you kill them, they are used in an escort quest, or they are moved for a main quest very rarely. Once you've walked a path once that path is the same every time other than far, far too many enemies (especially the flying Cliff Racers which are more plentiful than stars in the sky).

So many quests in this game amount to travelling to a location, grabbing something, and then coming back. You can break a lot of games down to such simple terms, but games usually have engaging gameplay to make quests worth doing. Or fast travel to mitigate tedium. The fact that Morrowind has none of that turns a cool aspect into a slog: No quest markers. NPCs tell you directions. Sometimes, these directions take you far away. Despite the dialogue system implying the idea that you may be able to ask locals about the nearby cave, you can't. Morrowind is huge. A lot of terrain is very same-y. NPCs don't give good directions and for some quests you might even get no directions. An idea that I would love in a game where I loved the combat or could travel quickly. An idea I have actually enjoyed in other games. In Morrowind? By the second half of my playthrough I dreaded any quest that didn't explicitly tell me where to go. Worse when most places don't matter. Is it realistic to find a cave that only has a bandit and some boxes of dirt and bread in it? Sure. Is it fun? Not particularly. Especially not after the twentieth time. Most places have nothing of actual value or interest inside at all. It just wasn't worth it for me to explore halfway through. The magic system lets you create all sorts of cool items, but you will rarely find such items in the plethora of caves and ruins that pepper the landscape.

All in all, I enjoyed Morrowind enough that I finished it, but that is where my appreciation for it ended. I saw what it tried to do, and inspired, and I respect it greatly for that. But in this day and age, especially as an adult, I don't find the poor implementations and tedious nature of it's systems to warrant a playthrough for people with far less patience and time than myself. I agree it was a wonderful game for the time. Not so much for 2022.",1651398718,1651398718,False,19,5,0.58863520622253418,1,True,False,False

You'll get used to the graphics but the sheer variety of stuff you can do in this game is insane. In skyrim they took out like half the skills and spells and weapons which is a shame. SPELLMAKING IS SO GOOD. 

What is also interesting is that the world feels HUGE but it isn't. the actual map size is quite small compared to other rpg maps but because you walk almost everywhere it makes you feel immersed in it and makes everything so much bigger, on top of that you dont have markers like all these newer games, you actually have to LISTEN(or read lol) what people tell you.You will be given instructions on how to reach places for example head north of this place until you see a rock cairn and then head east until halfway between these two palces and then head north north east until you reach this big tree where the dungeon will be on your left. That't the level of instructions you get given it makes you feel like you are actually there cause you not just walking towards some marker thats floating in the sky after skipping through all of the npc's dialogue.

 Also this game makes you earn your title. skyrim you literally can sit in a tower and watch gaurds kill a dragon for you and BAM you the dragonborn and a thane of whiterun. In morrowind you try claiming you are special/chosen one and no one believes you until you do like 50 billion quests and then people still doubt you, the only time someone will say ""oh its the neravine"" (idk how to spell it) is once you have finished the entire main questline which took me 30 hours and keep in mind i got a daedric katana at level 1 and i only finished the main questline at level 20. and thats with me using console commands to teleport places after i finished the first 5 trials (cause horator and tribe stuff was kinda boring for me at least) but that second part makes it seem real and hilarious. The prophecy says the chosen one has to have fullfilled certain stuff but you havent yet so you go around bribing officials and earning their favour so you can be called the neravine which is very immersive and hilarious.

This was the first time i played a game that gave me this feeling of exploration, and i was stunned by it, 20 years later, i still feel what it was like discovering these places, the species, the ambiance.. this game had everything to trap me into it.

Sure the graphics got old and Fargoth's face still haunt me ^^, but i just love it so much <3

To new players, this can be a little disapointing at first, but this game is mostly built like paper roleplaying, what i mean by that is that your actions are likely to fail, so for exemple, fights will not be as dynamic as skyrim.

EDIT: IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, thanks. :D

Firstly, IGNORE MY LISTED PLAYTIME!!! i had this game before i had steam. I've probably spent literal THOUSANDS of hours on this game.  but tis in the past. i booted it up just so i could write this review out of sheer obligation.

I write this review with a lot of heart because this is the game i played growing up.  its the game that got me really playing other games.  IT ALL STARTED HERE, for me atleast.  this is also where my Bethesda obsession came from. Time has passed and the graphics arent as nice as some of the newer products around but this game will forever hold a special place in my heart.  now i know you might look at this and think skyrim or possibly oblivion, good titles, but they lack a special something i cant quite put my finger on that morrowind had, their classic orriginal.  sure the voiced dialogue is nice in skyrim and oblivion, but theres SO much less dialogue in whole...  Infact if you go chronilogically in time from morrowind to oblivion to skyrim you'll find that the dialogue only gets more and more scarce.  infact this dialogue scarcity is the biggest lore-breaker and almost ruins the later, newer games for me.  you could ask an npc about almost anything relevant and they had CUSTOM TAILORED dialogue to say to you based on your personal gameplay, in infinite ammounts.  Oblivion and skyrim just doesnt have that.

another thing i really enjoyed, but others might not; is that this game, unlike skyrim or oblivion, doesnt hold your hand.  some find it offsetting that theres no map marker, or that the game lets you kill essential characters, but i enjoy this.  such handholding is lorebreaking in my opinion.  This is a game built with AMAZING lore, one could say its its own little universe.  You are just dropped into this little world and explore. much like skyrim and oblivion (which i continue to compare this game to), the content overall is still so endless, you could get lost forever.  dont let the last generation graphics get to you.

If your a fan of the Elder Scrolls series just know that it all really started here.  gaming for me personally as i know it started here.  if your an Elder Scrolls fan and you dont mind old games with old graphics please get this.  if it goes on sale your insane not to, but i dont regret full price. especially at its 'current' full price these days 20 years later.

12 out of 10

EDIT: I was 8 when this game came out, now im 25, thats wild to think about lol.

UPDATE FOR COOL PEOPLE (MODDERS): i said id never come back but... i did.  HUGE TIP if you wanna play this game with better graphics, extremely far view distances, widescreen support, etc. then please consider downloading Mod Organizer 2 and looking at the Nexus modding community.  With due dilligence, patience, and determination you can make this game look INCREDIBLE once again in 2020.  I am shocked the morrowind modding community is still so alive and making NEW THINGS even now.  It will be exceptionally frustrating and time consuming, and take a few days depending on how ambitious you are.  you may want to cry by the time your almost done getting everything together, but t'will be only tears of joy when you see how wonderful 2020 Morrowind is.  Game engine will still has a few major disadvantages (prone to crashes) but MUCH MUCH MUCH is fixed, improved, optimized, and made better with the right mods.

RECOMMENDED GUIDES/RESOURCES FOR MODDING:
I used: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/fokn8i/morrowind_2020_remastered_mod_list_by_coldmod/
also looks promising:
https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Morrowind_graphics_guide

With any problems you encounter and cant understand USE THE INTERNET. Nexus community is also a HUGE help

also google ""SkyWind"" (morrowind in skyrim engine) fan made AMBITIOUS development coming out soon (will require both skyrim and morrowind).  you can mod while your waiting on this to become a living thing, which is actually pretty close to being so O_o.

Unfortunately the steam version of Morrowind no longer comes with the good old ""Construction Set"" find it here and use it to recreate the game as you see fit!

The number of skills, weapons, magic, and armor classes still blows oblivion and skyrim out of the water on variety, if you can get over how brutally mundane the success chance calculator each strike or spell cast has. if you're a nerd like me who demands a challenging game that doesnt hold your hand and you've gotten bored becoming a multi-class god in oblivion and skyrim, come take a step back to a simpler time in gaming history with Morrowind. The replayability alone on this game is reason to try it. there are so many secrets waiting to be found. you will actually be excited when you come across a piece of ebony or deadric armor/weaponry because its actually rare. the legendary weapons/items are actually worthwhile to carry around with you. you will likely struggle maintaining your health, stamina, and magicka levels without practicing alchemy. you can break the game with a combination of alchemy and enchantments, but will find you are going to have to play the game normally in order to achieve godhood eventually. in the meantime you will appreciate the difficulty of each encounter because there is no guarantee that your spell is going to cast, or your strike is going to hit. pay attention to your stamina levels. going into caves and fortresses are actually fun, because the items you can acquire you will actually use: alchemical components, magical components, etc. there arent boxes full of health and magicka potions before every ""boss"" battle; youre going to have to enchant and/or brew your own stat regeneration items yourself as there isnt a reliable source for such items. disease and blight will have a significant effect on you, and you will want to have the ability to readily cure yourself, unless youre fine dropping some items on the ground because your strength stats took a hit, and then you have to limp away to go to a shrine for cleansing. some enemies can permanently damage some of your stats and will leave you stranded in caves with 0 strength stats; you will learn which enemies to fight at a distance..... if you can. dont expect to be a super sneaky powerful 1 hitting assassin wonder, this isnt skyrim. if you're a mage class, you will be horribly squishy; levitating away from enemies and perching yourself in a nook will save you butt more times than you care to admit. 
I love this game; the first time i played it was back in 2004, and is easily the game i have spent the most time in. ive made tens of characters and im still not bored. i just came back to playing this after a 5 year hiatus and its even more fun since i found out about modding the game to look a little more pretty.
theres a mark and recall spell that functions as a neat form of fast travel; there are silt striders and boats that can take you certain places, but you may have to jump between the two to get to a certain place. the mages guild can also teleport you between guild locations, but other than that, youre going to have to hoof it with minimal waypoints on your map. actually paying attention to dialogue and your journal will be necessary in order to guide yourself to each destination. I love this game because of its hardcore elements. this isnt a game you can easily play on cruise control; youre going to have to work for it, and theres going to be a lot of encounters youre going to have to abandon and return to at a higher level with better equipment and more potions; youre not felling any dragons with a couple axe swings in this game, youre gonna probably die once or twice to a blighted cliff racer because you ran out of stamina and none of your strikes make contact. 25% of your outside battle encounters are probably going to be with these glitchy gliding critters, and you will hear their dumb little screech in your nightmares.

- Huge depth and freedom with a truly unique setting. Very easy to get sucked in and get lost in the game, whether you choose to follow main or faction quests, do your own thing, or even really delve into the game's mechanics.
- Really big enemy variety, huge well-crafted areas with nooks and crannies designed to test a range of character builds.

- The game is not voice acted so dialogue is implemented through trees. I think that allows a much bigger range of different options.
- Fast travel is limited in this game to transportation nodes. I think that really draws you into the world as you need to learn your way around, or navigate by landmarks.
- Both the above two things are major factors for players to consider. It might be a positive for some and a negative for others.

- There are some major flaws with this game though. The levelling system is confounding, the fatigue system is intensely frustrating and the game is still a little unstable if you're not using OpenMW.

I started Morrowind around this time last year. I only ever played the one character I started with, so I bore witness to the beauty of this game's progression only once. Let's talk about it.
The start of Morrowind is purposefully very rough and limiting. You walk slow, you die in very few hits, most of your attacks don't even make contact with the enemies, your spells constantly fail, etc. There are universal systems in Morrowind that impact all living things in the game, including you, and at the start, you are at the very bottom of those systems. Everything is working against you, and even a single bandit is often too strong for you. This forces you to get creative. Those universal systems dragging you down effect the enemies too. Your fatigue is too low so you miss everything and fail spells? Drink a fatigue potion, and find a way to lower your opponent's fatigue so they fall over a bunch and miss you. Tired of getting stun-locked by paralysis enchantments enemies have? You can stun-lock them too. This concept extends to out-of-combat activities as well; creativity is rewarded above all else. Tired of the blind effect on the boots of blinding speed? Make a spell that resists 100% of magic for 1 second, then put on the boots during that 1 second. Blindness resisted and now you get to go fast all the time. Skill training too expensive? Make a potion to temporarily lower the skill you want to train to a very low level so it's cheaper to train up. 
This ideology of clever solutions being the key to victory is instilled into the player from the tutorial. There's a quest in the first town where you find the secret cash stash of a local wood elf, steal from it, then return to the questgiver and split the profits. But why would you want to split it? Just don't turn it in and you make 150 more gold.
Just outside of the first town, a mage falls from the sky, dies, and drops scrolls of icarian flight. These boost your acrobatics skill by 1000 points temporarily, and let you skip the early-game trek to Balmora, but you'll die of the fall damage. I won't spoil it here, but there's tons of clever solutions to subvert the fall damage. 
The game's progression is the most satisfying I've ever experienced, as you slowly but surely turn the systems that were plaguing you on their head and twist them into strengths, all from your own ingenuity alone. This progression and ""breaking"" the game is supported by the game's story and themes as well, but we'll get to that later.
The world of Morrowind is my 2nd favorite in all of fiction, behind Xenoblade of course. An issue that fantasy games often run into is a disconnect between the character and player, as the player knows exactly what to expect out of a fantasy setting, while the character is often experiencing the dragons, undead crypts, and corrupt kings for the first time. Morrowind fixes this problem by making the island of Vvardenfell truly alien. The majority of the island is volcanic ashlands, rocky coastlines, and fungus-infested wetlands. Ash is a weather in Vvardenfell. Giant jellyfish float throughout the sky, the main food supply is the eggs from 9-foot long subterranean insects called Kwamas, meaning mineshafts are the equivalent to farms on this island. Tree-sized mushrooms are more common than trees themselves, and pterodactyl-like cliff racers permeate the hills of the game. People make their homes and cities out of the fossils of long-dead giant crustaceans, creating a wholly unique architectural signature of the region. Instead of horses, transportation between cities is handled by 30 foot tall, 6-legged insects called Silt Striders, and the people of Vvardenfell burrow into their backs to create a place to sit. The world is truly alien to every fantasy setting the average RPG player is used to, and that fixes the problem of the disconnect between player and character. You're in this together. I'd compare it most to something like Spirited Away where both you and the main character are getting lost in this weird, scary, alien world together and both have no clue as to what lies around the next corner. You and your character are experiencing the weirdness as one. 
The game did the Breath of The Wild structure 15 years before it was popularized. At the center of the map is Red Mountain, and at any time you can go up to it and fight the final boss. It's entirely possible to beat the game in a single sitting if you want to. The main story and questline instead serves the purpose to build your strength and give context to the events happening. This structure means there is absolutely nothing the player does that is a waste of time. Every single action you take serves the purpose of preparing to storm Red Mountain, main story or otherwise. Morrowind is about gaining power and becoming the prophesized, godlike figure of the Nerevarine who will save Vvardenfell from the wrath of Dagoth Ur who lies at the heart of Red Mountain. There are two paths to godhood in Morrowind. The first is following the main story, uniting the ash tribes and great houses, etc. The second is the path that your items and stats will lead you to. The game respects your intelligence enough to let the player decide which path to follow, and both fit the game's themes perfectly. 
Morrowind is all about Gods and historical myths. Every piece of info you are told about the battle of Red Mountain thousands of years ago is contradicted by another version of the story told by someone else. Nobody has an exact idea of the events that set the game's plot into motion, and that's on purpose. People having different versions of the same historical story makes it more believable. The game's text-based dialogue system helps it tell such a complex story, as they don't have to pay voice actors to read the hundreds of paragraphs. You're supposed to piece together each bit of info you're given and find your own justification to storm Red Mountain. By doing so, are you defying fate, or are you abiding by it? That's up to you to decide. Are you the prophesized reincarnation of the Nerevarine, or are you a self-made hero breaking the circle of hatred set in motion thousands of years ago? That's also up to you to decide. It's only fitting that Morrowind has the biggest mid-late game powerup in Bethesda's history to make you really feel like a godly figure. Breaking the game is encouraged by the plot itself. God I fucking love this game.",1640039095,1650332129,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Came back to it a few years later while I was in highschool and had a much better time of things but I wouldn't play for very long or get very far in. I play a lot of it now after figuring a few essentials out for myself, discovering UESP wiki and finding a few video's on youtube about a handy dandy mod to clean out a lot of bugs and fix some things that would cause crashes which made the experience a much smoother one.

So I would say that this game isn't for everyone but if you are willing to give it some attention and understand that you are playing a game with a closer  resemblance to a TTRPG than an action game then you'll have a grand time with it. 

Holds up pretty darn well for a game as old as it is and the mod community is a great one. If there is an element of the mechanics you dislike there is generally a mod to get around it, but I would recommend learning how to play the game vanilla first, if you don't like your first character you make, you don't have to stick with it, throw things together until your character is good at what you want to use.

1. The music. Especially the main theme and the game knows it. It will play it over and over and over again. And then it will play it one more time. And you'll end up humming along.
2. The setting is incredible, you have never seen a game like this before. Probably. 
3. The story and lore

Cons
1. Graphics are crappy.
2. Gameplay. Oh the gameplay. Playing this game is a patience exercise.  Fighting is like, well, if someone hides a rock inside one of their palms, you have more chances of guessing the palm right than landing a hit on your opponent. At least when beginning the game. No fast travel either. Want to go in the other side of the map? Just put a rock on your ""walk forward"" button and sleep for 5-10 minutes. What will happen is, you will probably be killed by a worm of some kind, and you'll have to start over. No tutorials either, with the only exception being, ""here's 10 bucks and a toothbrush, now find out why the world needs saving and if you survive come tell me so I can send you away again to save it"".

 

Summary
If you played it before and you are feeling nostalgic you will like it. If you are interested in the extremely unique setting and deep lore, story and characters and open world exploring but don't mind the horrible graphics and gameplay and the CRAPPIEST BATTLE SYSTEM MECHANICS EVER EXISTED then you will like this game. Just play it inside a sound proof room - maybe a music studio - if you have the option, so that other people can't hear you scream at your laptop.

The villain and other important characters are captivating and intriguing. I think it’s fair to say that Morrowind also has the greatest villain.

Having said that, I thought I would hate this game and would either be bored, lost, and/or frustrated at the mechanics because of how Oblivion was.  None of that is true because this game is absolutely incredible! 
The graphics are better than I thought, and I actually like them better than Oblivion (albeit my PC is low/mid tier.) 
The combat isn't as bad as it's made out to be, especially after you have leveled your character into which style of combat you prefer. It's like old school Diablo but FPV. 
I haven't encountered many bugs other than getting stuck inside walls or floors which since downloading the unoffical patch I haven't had a problem with. 
There is no fast travel or quest markers which I think is an upgrade to Skyrim seeing as you have to engage and immerse yourself into the game more. You are given accurate directions and goals and the Silt Striders aren't too scarce so you actually don't have to travel on foot a ton. Part of the fun is searching for what to do next by having to investigate an area where you know you are suppose to be but need to find whatever it is you are tasked to do. 
The campaign is less cinematic like Skyrim, and more lore and dialogue based. Less voice acting means more text, but I feel this fleshes the world out a lot better than you can do with heavy voice acting. 

Overall (for the amount I've played so far) I rate Morrowind 8.5/10 and absolutely recommend it to any Elder Scroll fan looking to deep dive into the world more.

Take away the graphics and the outdated combat, and it's the best RPG. The Main Story had more quests and content than the modern writing of the recent Assassin's Creed games, Battlefield, COD & even Cyberpunk 2077. And then you have the 2 both great DLCs of the game. Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Just holy shit. I really liked Tribunal more than Bloodmoon because of the new weapons like Trueflame & Hopefire, just godly weapons for the Nerevarine. And more interesting and fun characters, even new Gods. I felt like I'm spiritually connected to the Neravarine and Morrowind as a whole. Just a blast. Bloodmoon was really great too but I didn't quite like the quests as it got quite repetitive throughout the game. Still an awesome story line and great characters though. And after you complete the main quest for Bloodmoon, the secret ring called ""BlueDev's Ring of Viewing"" was an awesome touch to the end of the DLC. And the fact that it can only be found after you've finished the main story and DLC, but it's hidden in a dead Cliffracer's mouth in the Skaal village. Just awesome. You don't find easter eggs like these in modern games anymore. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is one of the most enjoyable fun classic RPGs out there.

music is fantastic however some of the music tracks dont fit some areas like walking around and it could be playing something very upbeat when ambient music would be better fitting.

the world looks so good and feels very atmospheric, especially when it starts thunderstorming or it gets foggy.

People who say the graphics are outdated. i do agree on a technical pov but games these days are using different art styles and even using janky old school graphics like morrowind, plus i think morrowinds graphics add charm. sometimes super realistic isnt the best.

If you want a classic rpg where you take your time, read allot, enjoy levelling up stats, slow burn… this game will be up your alley. its great buuut i would have to say not the best elder scrolls game.

But when you find your groove you'll have an awe-inspiring, memorable, almost incredible RPG experience. Incredible because there's really no game quite as grand even 20 years later.

Its scope is both broad and deep. It simulates a large and long D&D-like campaign crammed with dungeons, towns, monsters, and intrigue. There are overlapping political story lines with hundreds of named NPCs, many with their own personal stories, and books brimming with lore. There are skill, weapon, magic, and alchemy systems that outdo the complexity of AD&D's Dungeon Master's Guide. And there's an impressively comprehensive UI to manage it all. All of that is packaged in a remarkably open-ended sandbox that engenders many opportunities for emergent gameplay. Go anywhere that interests you and see what happens. It will often be pretty cool and quite dangerous. Many quests offer little direction beyond giving you a goal, leaving a lot of room for creativity and cleverness. And it's impossible to complete them all in a single play-through, as your role-playing choices and sheer coincidence truly do determine your path. You do you.

That said, not all the content is wonderful. There's no dearth of dreary back-and-forth fetch quests that still plague the open-world genre to this day. Indeed, [I]Morrowind[/I] giveth with one hand and taketh with the other. Alas, it may very well demand more than it delivers, because it doesn't miss any opportunity to rain on your parade. At times it feels deliberately [I]anti-fun[/I]. The most glaring example is dialog: I've never experienced ""conversations"" with NPCs as tedious as they are here. They are just long, clickable lists of repeated topics with repeated answers. So, immediately a central component of the game is awful. Similarly, journal entries—which are how you keep track of quests—are logged in the order you discovered them and there's no way to search them. Sure, that's how ""real"" written journals work, but, seriously? In the late game you'll have hundreds of pages of practically unusable text. Online wikis are the reasonable, immersion-breaking workaround. And then there's combat: you can sometimes do the 1st-person dodge-attack dance, but more often than not the outcome of battle depends on the roll of the die and it's a boring clickfest. The Bloodmoon DLC is especially rife with repetitive random encounters.

When it comes down to it, [I]Morrowind[/I] plays as if the developers were so focused on the comprehensiveness of their world simulation that they left play-testing as an afterthought. Unless you thoroughly patch it, mod it, and use the debug console, [I]Morrowind[/I] is hilariously broken. For example, it's a very common occurrence for NPCs to block you from moving or not being where they're supposed to be. Your only recourse is to load a save or run the ""ra"" (reset actors) command in the console. And you can easily break a quest line by, say, killing an important NPC by mistake or selling a crucial item to a random merchant. Imagine being 50 hours into the game and having to go back to a save from 20 hours before. You can fix most things with the console, but is that ""fun""? It's a miracle that this game passed any quality assurance at all. Oh, and no playtester complained about the unbearable slowness of walking? Really? Without the ""Run Faster"" mod I would have stopped playing after an hour. The core of the gameplay loop is walking to places. Back and forth. Again and again. A lot.

I did have many memorable emergent moments in my play-through, such as when I knew a powerful companion would betray me and so made sure to weaken him by purposely walking through a dangerous crypt where he would suffer a lot of damage. Then, when he turned on me, he was weak and beatable. That was fun. But, often such moments happened [I]in spite[/I] of game design. For example, enemies cannot follow you through level doors. So it's always possible to run away, rest and heal, and head back to the action. It's an anti-immersive mechanic. Multiply this example by one thousand and you'll understand how [I]Morrowind[/I] plays. Cheesing is inherent.

And so despite my thumbs up recommendation I suspect that [I]Morrowind[/I] is not for you. Its many flaws are, perhaps, fatal. But if you're patient and open to the workarounds then you will be rewarded in spades. It's a masterpiece buried under a mud flow.

I was someone who was never able to get into Morrowind, and I think it's unfortunately very clunky and outdated in many ways, the gameplay is very lacklustre by modern standards, but the gameworld is absolutely incredible and is more than enough reason to sink your teeth into this game. It will seriously suck you in - a home away from home. Think of it as a novel brought to life.

Honest thoughts:
[list]
[*] The biggest plus of Morrowind is how completely open-ended its systems are. The fact that you can simply do SO MUCH means you can experiment and break the game in any-which way you choose. Breaking the game is incredibly easy to do, so you'll probably come up with your own rules to decide what's fair or too broken to keep things fun. Experimenting with different classes and exploring different game mechanics will give you so much to keep your mind occupied if you're interested in approaching a game in different ways.
[*] The gameplay is extremely bland and outdated and will be a barrier for many new players. Now, I personally don't mind it, but it's undeniable that the biggest issue with this game is it simply feels boring to play if you just want to follow the quests. Navigating the world is extremely menial, and finding ways to keep the game fun will be your biggest challenge. If you just run through the game swinging at things, honestly I think this game is quite bad. Turn the difficulty up, experiment with enchanting/alchemy, play with limitations on your character. Create new characters and find fun ways to approach the game. Exploration is what makes this game good.
[*] Skills are a bit of a mess in this game. There are many skills in this game, some are very easy to level, and others are very hard. The issue is that most skills other than mercantile level up based on SUCCESSFUL attempts and does not consider magnitude. This means spamming a 1 magicka spell gives you he SAME EXP as casting a 70 magicka spell. The other flipside to this is that skills are actually HARDER to level at a low level than at a medium level, bc you are more likely to hit an enemy with a higher weapon skill. Experience does scale a bit, but level is actually the FASTEST between levels of about 40-70, and is slower outside those ranges. So, leveling is essentially completely broken and you can level up VERY fast or slow depending on the skills you choose. 
[*] Character creation & specilization. Even though the game gives you the option of class creation, honestly, I feel as though this game much more strongly favours specialization than hybridization. Pure characters are stronger early, will progress more easily, and will have no issues reaching the highest ranks of their respective factions. If you play hybrids, progression is much more difficult and less rewarding, and your character might not have the right skills to advance to the highest ranks of your faction. This can be overcome with gold & paying trainers but still, it feels like making 1 character for each archetype is the ""intended"" design.

[/list]
Conclusion? Morrowind is a Sandbox RPG. If you plan to just play the story and do quests, I think you will have a pretty bad time honestly. Morrowind is a game that FORCES you to explore its systems, it rewards a curious mind and you will have a GREAT time if you simply go on adventures looking to understand more about how the game works. Make broken potions, punch the shit out of everything and get 100 Hand-to-hand in like 2 hours. Create high magnitude jump spells and jump halfway across the map. Create spells you think are fun. Learn about enchanting and try to craft your own enchanted items. Questing and gameplay is not the main attraction of Morrowind - let yourself EXPLORE and get absorbed into the world, then you'll never want to leave.

Tired of trying to get immersed into a game through reading outside lore and listening to NPCs with only two lines of dialogue?

Morrowind is the game for you!

MAIN FEATURE TO ME IS MAGIC -- YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE ANY SPELL YOU WANT, SO LONG AS YOUR CHARACTER KNOWS HOW TO CAST IT (and you have the in-game moneys, or a spellmaker REALLY likes you)

It features:
*Very Thorough Character Creation, if you so choose. Also a standard questionnaire should you prefer.
*ACTUAL STATS -- you can level athletics, and MOVE faster, acrobatics and JUMP higher
*ACTUAL STATS PT 2 -- Unlike most games, leveling things actually changes stuff for you. Damage changes with skill, Persuasion changes with skill, movement speeds, regens, crafting/repair/enchantment is increased by SKILL not by some odd purchase system like the one Skyrim makes you use that is incredibly, frustratingly limited to essentially nothing (for magic users).
*Ridiculously story-rich NPCs (compared to today's standards.. which are.. incredibly lax)
*NPCs set in a world they belong in -- no more random -VERY- out of place characters. If they seem out of place, they've got a damn good reason for where they are.
*Some incredible bartering -- you can set your own price, and NPCs don't have to say yes to you
*NPC relationship statuses -- you can get people to like you through quests, favors, or simply manipulating them
*A much closer to realistic armor setup -- pauldrons, gauntlets, different kinds of plate, all sorts of leather and things
*WEAPONS -- Ever wondered why there are no SPEARS in any of the Bethesda games? ME TOO. They exist here, among other forgotten weapons
*If you get OpenMorrowind, the game runs MUCH better than anything I've played from Bethesda
*IT'S MULTIPLAYER (after OpenMorrowind, and a multiplayer addition. EZ)

ISSUES:
*Game runs on basically D&D but if your DM isn't forgiving on your checks. Starting is rough -- if your character can't use a weapon, it will take A LOT for them to figure out how.
*Graphics for pretty much anyone would be an issue I imagine. My response? Go to Nexus and get OpenMorrowind, grab whatever all updated skins you want for your own world to come closer to life. Also OpenMorrowind is a complete rewrite of the engine, so everything runs SO FRIGGIN GOOD
*You'll probably be alright when you first start, and then get SO INVESTED IN EVERYTHING THIS HAS TO OFFER YOU MAY LOSE TRACK OF TIME -- IN WEEK-LONG PERIODS

To elaborate on what was mentioned in the issues -- D&D with a rough-ish DM.
To deal damage
First you have to hit,
Then pass armor check,
THEN you can see how much you hit it for (Weapon Damage+Damage Types+Character Modifiers+any Buffs/other).

So if you're stabbing at a crab with the dull+rusty butter knife you (might have) found on the table at the beginning, you're going to have a hard time 
1 Puncturing its shell
2 Getting the knife in far enough to actually hurt it at all

If you're trying to slash at it... I really don't think you're getting through that shell unless you are just REALLY GOOD at slashing... or maybe you roll a D20, who knows.
(If it's the knife on the starting table, the knife does have a note asking someone to sharpen and clean it so ye it's gross)



TL;DR

The Good
Amazing game from a long-gone era. Plenty of updates to bring it almost completely up to speed. Base game is amazing, mods/updates only make it unfathomably good. Character creation is important for once AND OH MY GOODNESS THE MAGIC YOU CAN DO
Also Skills actually matter and change gameplay heavily

The Bad
Really, Really rough starting out if you don't pick a character and stick to it -- you want to be a spear wielder? GET A SPEAR, your character likely can't swing a sword/mace/etc very well.
Graphics suck without help (Get OpenMorrowind, seriously. Everything's better, as it's a complete engine rewrite).",1646558429,1646559282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The lore goes deep, the combat is something to get used to but VERY fun, and the writing, atmosphere, and soundtrack are absolutely stellar.

In short, if I were to compare Morrowind to Skyrim, the Morrowind would win. Skyrim is so much more polished and mechanics are newer, graphics is so much better, yet, I was really missing something... something that only Morrowind have.

This is a culmination of hard work, commitment and by far the best character and quest writing the series has seen. This game doesn't hold your hand, it doesn't give you quest markers, you have to train and build a good character that suites your play style. If you don't read or don't like to, this game will require it. It will require a basic understanding of lore that is established in the game. If you read the lore books around the game and love to in a games lore you will have even more fun with this game. Understanding why you're the nerevarine and the consequences of your choices you make as such are very rewarding. The combat system is dice roll based meaning you can just swing and hit, you train by use so when you level up that skill you're more likely to hit, magic is wisdom based and intelligence is your magika pool. It is also dependent on skill in specific arts schools of magic. Everything about this game is super detailed and thought out. A few mod recommendations for first time players who want to give the game a face lift and fix some bugs that already exist in game. MWGXE (Enhances graphics and details of the game, extends script for other mods to use) Morrowind code patch (fixes bugs) Morrowind Purist Patch (restores some content to the game) That's it, very easy to install and run while keeping the game close to vanilla as possible.

Although I did not start on Morrowind or one of the earlier titles I 100% recommend this game to anyone who loved Skyrim or Oblivion.   Although Morrowind is very diffrent from Skyrim it still has the same sort of charm even through its buggyness and quirks and for anyone coming over from Oblivion the best way i can describe this game is a Hardcore version of Oblivion.
One of the few negatives of Morrowind would have to be the movement and combat.  They are very choppy and irritating at first but start to feel better after a little bit of playing.   The never quite match oblivion and fall somewhat short of Skyrim.

Deep lore. Interesting cultures. Fun magic, enchanting & alchemy systems. Memorable characters. 
The good feeling of becoming stronger, getting better gear, and overcoming challenging enemies is immense. 
There's nothing like coming back to the mines by Seyda Neen and one-shot eviscerating the scribs that paralyzed and killed you at the beginning of the game (after you attacked them unprovoked...). 
Or going into some dank, dark cave and finding a hidden piece of loot tucked away in a place that has likely been seen by not many others.
There is also a huge amount of mods to alter the game to your liking - some even adding whole other provinces to the playable area!

Of course the game does have its flaws. A couple notable ones for me are:
Some of the mechanics are archaic (despite some gate keepers standing by them) - but if you don't like them, as mentioned there are a plethora of mods to change the game to your liking. 
And a lot of the faction quests end with [spoiler]the guild master challenging you to a duel for the top rank[/spoiler]. But lame promotions are pretty standard for the Elder Scrolls series.

I would have to preface that it's not an accessible game, a lot of stuff you can find to be rather obscure, and while I love the Journal, it could use a bit more work as well. The game is filled with dice rolls, instead of just bigger numbers over playtime, it's consistent, in line with a lot of classic RPGs, but it's sometimes to its detriment. Persuasion skills are greatly uninteresting to level up, but their usefulness is great, you won't get persuasion checks, the characters will grow more positive toward you, either permanently through admiring, or temporarily through intimidating, you can also legally kill someone by taunting them into attacking first. It's something that covers entire design behind morrowind, a lot of stuff is insanely practical and sandboxy, whether it activates funny adrenaline chemicals is secondary. The chance to hit being the diceroll in a fpp game is infamous, but it's just an obstacle as any other to work around, pay to/or train your weapon skill and agility, and you will be hitting over 90% of the time, or go for a mean hammer, that can stun an enemy once it hits, so hit chance is less of a concern, or go for magic and alchemy instead. Magic is the ABSOLUTE BEST element in morrowind, like with anything else, you level it up by use, increasing your spell success rate, progressively letting you use better stuff, sounds simple, but YOU CAN MAKE YOUR SPELLS, you can adjust target of the spell, duration, radius, strength etc.. You want to make a stupid strong jump spell that lets you fly through the map? Go ahead. Levitate? Be my guest. Invisible + strength buff? Freshly served. Alchemy works on very similar principle, but instead of gathering effects permanently by purchasing spells, you gather ingredients that are gone after you use them. If you go really in depth, you can catch monster's soul in a gem and enchant your items manually too. You can level up armor types effectiveness, or level up unarmored to become a monk that doesn't have to use repair tools for his own skin. You can level different weapons skills, or go unarmed, where your damage to enemy stamina is more important than initial damage to their health.
You want to be a brawler that pulls out a hammer to finish an exhausted enemy while they're on the ground? Nothing besides your patience is stopping you. There is also a lot of technical limitations since the game is so old, as well as bugs that are probably partly due to hardware being much better than the engine would anticipate. For me the most annoying is getting constantly stuck in geometry, I tried as hard as I can, but I never found a fix for that.

Graphically it was insane for its time, now I still think there is a lot to like, especially the atmosphere of the gritty marshlands and ash wastelands, lots of weapons and armors look really neat, even if they lack pixels and polygons. The worst looking part for me is definitely animations, lots of them are still and ugly, especially the first person ones. There are some mods that adjust animations (I really like the one that uses 3rd person anims in 1st person), but no massive overhaul to every animation the game has.

Sound is pretty good, a lot of sounds are very recognizable, though they do lack a lot of variety, you can hear it almost immediately, with how repetetive the footsteps sound. Something that didn't age a day is the music, I am not that surprised they remixed main theme of morrowind, in the Skyrim theme, as the melody really gets stuck in your head. A lot of exploration and battle themes sound beautiful too, after countless hours you might eventually get tired of them, but you might eventually want to get back to them too, they have really outdone themselves.

The story is also pretty nice, sure the prophecy of defeating ancient evil is nothing original, but all the stuff around it is so fresh and intriguing, the lore is so rich that I am still astounded to this day. The backstory behind the tribunal, the 6 houses, the ashlander clans, the clockwork city, ghostfence being built, dwemer ruins. The all kinds of weapon and armor artifacts, having their backstories not in item description, but in actual books on them, that you can find previously in the game.

All this combined is mixed into a game that is one of the absolute most immersive and addicting experiences I've had with games. It has a lot of gameplay shortcomings, but I can hardly think of any games that are as rich as this, besides maybe some mmos that were around and developed for years. I can't recommend this game to any average Joe really, the edges are so rough that it easily scares off a lot of people, but god is it one of the pretties diamonds underneath, that I've ever seen.",1643184518,1643184878,True,0,1,0.48706933856010437,0,True,False,False

Tons to do, tons to see, you can play it any way you want.  Great mods modernize if you want,  or you can kick it oldschool and play it like its 2k2.  

I really love the leveling system.  Just do want you want,  as you practice at things you get better at them.  If you don't like something,  You aren't forced to do it.   It gives you way more level's and power than you would ever need to complete the game (and both of it's expansions)  so you can just play away.

It does have some balance problems.  The first level or two just about anything can kill you.  Don't be afraid to run away.  Late game you are uber-powerful and nothing can touch you if you know what you are doing.

The Duke of Scamps came while the banquet was still underway, and Molag Bal looked on the seven pennants with anger. The King of Rape had become necessary and therefore troubled for the rest of time. His legions and Kh-Utta's fell into open war, but the children of Molag Bal and Vivec were too elaborate in power and form.

The Duke of Scamps therefore became a lesser thing, as did all his own children. Molag Bal said to them: 'You are the sons of liars, dogs, and wolf-headed women.' They have been useless to summon ever since.

The holy one returned at last, Vehk, golden with wisdom. His head found its body had been tenderly used. He mentioned this to Molag Bal, who told him that he should thank the Barons of Move Like This, 'For I have yet to learn how to refine my rapture. My love is accidentally shaped like a spear.'

So Vivec, who had a grain of Ayem's mercy, set about to teach Molag Bal in the ways of belly-magic. They took their spears out and compared them. Vivec bit new words onto the King of Rape's so that it might give more than ruin to the uninitiated. This has since become a forbidden ritual, though people still practice it in secret.

Here is why: The Velothi and demons and monsters that were watching all took out their own spears. There was much biting and the earth became wet. And this was the last laugh of Molag Bal:

'Watch as the earth shall crack, heavy with so much power, that should have been forever unalike!'
Then that stretch of badlands that had been the site of the marriage fragmented and threw fire. And a race that is no more but that was terrible at the time to behold came forth. Born of the biters, that is all they did, and they ran amok across the lands of Veloth and even to the shores of Red Mountain.

But Vivec made of his spear a more terrible thing, from a secret he had bitten off from the King of Rape. And so he sent Molag Bal tumbling into the crack of the biters and swore forever that he would not deem the King beautiful ever again.

Vivec wept as he slew all those around him with his terrible new spear. He named it MUATRA, which is Milk Taker, and even the Chimeri mystics knew his fury. Anyone struck by Vivec at this time turned barren and withered into bone shapes. The path of bones became a sentence for the stars to read, and the heavens have never known children since. Vivec hunted down the biters one by one, and all their progeny, and he killed them all by means of the Nine Apertures, and the wise still hide theirs from Muatra.

The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.",1452665450,1642938806,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The depth is unparalleled and after 30 hours, I haven't even begun to scratch the surface. Morrowind is the pinnacle of the Elder Scrolls series.

Skyrim will tell you ""Go kill this person"" and give you a quest marker showing you how to get to the target.

Your target is in Tel Mora, go north until you reach the fallen tree that looks like the lovechild of a guar and a kwama, then go south-southeast for 11.5 minutes.""

This is what Morrowind is. A bundle of contradictions. A riddle wrapped in an enigma, in the form of a computer RPG. And while most of the time this would make the game a waste of time at best or an outright insult to the player at worst, with Morrowind the whole ends up being so much more than the sum of its parts.  

The graphics are laughably dated (though mods can greatly improve it) yet an impressive (especially for its time) shot at an immersive 3D world. You begin in this world as ludicrously weak, feeble and slow, yet can become almost Godlike in power long, long, LONG before that stage of the game where you're actually supposed to be Godlike in power. There is a main quest and a story line in there somewhere, but that's not really what Morrowind is about. 

Morrowind is really an RPG sandbox, and the real game lies in finding the numerous ways to work around how otherwise completely useless your character would otherwise be. There are many such tricks, and the effects of discovering them are dramatic. 

This might not sound like much of an asset, but Morrowind manages to get away with things that would be laughable and frustrating in most other games. This is the enigma of Morrowind. It's like your favourite old T.V show or movie in how its numerous flaws actually make it better rather than worse than it otherwise would be. 

I could throw a Ming vase off the Empire State Building, and the end result wouldn't be half as broken as Morrowind is. But is it ever FUN!",1638072678,1642139871,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So all that I will say, is that this game is worth buying if it seems interesting to you. And even if it seems only kinda ok, know that there is a whole world of alternative content for you to try.  This game's modding community has been active since the game released - it is nearly 20 years old and a lot of the largest projects out there are tied up in this game.  It inspired tons of people to be creative and the results are nearly endless.

Even if you find the game to be fairly unenjoyable, if the play feels good to you/tolerable, then this world of things has a high likelihood of giving you some really good stuff.  

What is most interesting to me, is how the game's lore figured in to how all of this developed and continues to develop.  Players were inspired by its unique aesthetic and cantankerous nature, and some decided to take concept art and development materials and make them real.  This is a game that, in its own way, has not stopped development.

Currently, Tamriel Rebuilt exists as a project to recreate the mainland, which expands the game by several orders of magnitude, and it is actively being developed and even remastered at the same time.  It is expanding the game with careful attention paid to keeping up with it's aesthetic and grounding everything deeply in the already established lore. It is literally about three times more game at this point freely available to you.  

There are several other large scope projects like that, where you can download what's been made and expand the game.  OpenMW exists as a project to build a new engine from scratch, one which doesn't have the shortcomings Morrowind's engine did. It too is being actively developed and can be followed very closely.

In other words, this game in particular has a very unique additional aspect to it that warrants your attention even if the game itself is merely fine.  You may well find through the modding community, that this becomes one of your favorites because you really can customize it in just about any way you want.

The tools to create your own things, or edit the game itself are freely available.  So if you play and find a particular mechanic is troublesome, you can change it, and just flat out make your game more enjoyable.  You can go as deep as the devs did with it, and that is a rare and special thing.

I can't recommend the game enough, both because of everything I've said above, and because it genuinely is a unique and special sort of game.  It was made with care, by genuinely nerdy folk.  If you're into roleplaying, like actually playing a role and living it out, this game serves as the bedrock for what could be the most interesting and personally enjoyable experience you have ever had.  Because you can make it yours.",1641442717,1641442717,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Got lost trying to follow Mage's Guild's bad instructions to a dungeon. Found an escaping slave called [b]Reeh-Jah[/b] on the road, and the story I got to experience with this naked Argonian was legendary: 

We found a cult town and my friend [b]Reeh-Jah[/b] casually stunlocked their leader. After a tiresome swim in a river to avoid the same cult town's residence revenge, we finally found a town and I made a good profit, right after beating up a local slaver. In all the chaos I forgot to take the Sift Strider to the next village, so we had to walk past a vast Argonian slave farms we couldn't liberate, until we got to Vivec. 

One boat to Ebonheart and [b]Reeh-Jah[/b] and me already had to part ways. It was actually very sad moment, I grew to love this ex-enslaved gentleman. We fought so many random encounters, bandits and slavers along the way, but in the end we realized we couldn't liberate all the slaves of Morrowind together, and then... End of the line. Goodbye, [b]Reeh-Jah[/b]. Just as we evaded your slavers, you had evaded my heart.

He was placed exactly so that if I go through the most direct route, I will see all of this and get to experience an emergent story. Morrowind is seriously a different type of game than what came after.

This isn't an outlier case, either. Quests are laid out with the world in mind, it's intended to be this sprawling world, and it forces you to experience it. There's no fast travel, although you can pay for rides between towns. You have to discover all these dungeons yourself, with questionable directions that force you to find new places, and solve the issues that arise along the way, or sometimes run from your troubles with your new Argonian boyfriend.

I'm saying this because this seems to be a reason why people are somewhat scared of the game but it's nowhere near as bad as you'd think and you can definitely get over it if you want to try (if you don't want to thats fine but it is really not that bad).
As well as this the combat problem of the attacks being a dice roll are not a big problem either, it can be a bit frustrating at the start but after a few hours you will have upgraded your attacking skill to a point where that is not a problem. Again, this seems to be something which scares many people, but once again it's not as bad as you'd think.
If you liked fallout 3 or FNV or skyrim, you'll like this if you want to get over both of these problems which you may experience at the start. All use bethesda's three cycles of exploration, combat and scavenging (I know FNV was made by obsidian but the use of the creation engine means these three cycles still remain) and while in all of bethesda's other games (meaning not FNV) those three cycles are the best part of those games, it's here and only here where bethesda's writing and quest design reaches a point of quality where it really is the best thing in the game (perhaps other than oblivion but I haven't played it yet). 
Morrowind is the peak of bethesda's capability to create stories and quests at a good and consistent level and this along with Bethesda's other trademarks; a brilliant world, Great Exploration, Great loot and Satisfying Progression means that it is one of the best RPGs ever and I definitely recommend it if you can get through those teething issues I discussed earlier.",1641206932,1641206932,True,5,0,0.571477651596069336,1,True,False,False

I don't recommend this game because expectations have changed over the years and a lot of the mechanics in this game just don't make any sense to people who have played modern games. The interface is clunky by today's standards and it requires too much time investment to understand the game world.

That being said - this game allows so much freedom to the player character while keeping the world state plausible. You can kill the god everybody worships, or work alongside him - some people will hate you and others will love you. You can make mortal enemies with hundreds of people you've never met simply by joining a guild. There are longstanding racial grudges and a variety of religions that will either love you or try to kill you based on whether or not you progress their prophecies.

This game also has some broken mechanics. You can make potions that make you better at making potions that make you better at making potions. Then you can sell those potions for more money than all of the vendors in the game have combined. You can enchant your equipment to make you permanently invincible to physical attacks.

I could describe this as feeling like a single player mmorpg.

No fast travel, no quest markers. Just a journal to read quest tips in, lots of people to talk with to get clues and travelling by foot, boat, teleportation or silt strider, make this feel like a truly large world, with epic scale.

It doesn't spoon feed you anything and makes you work for it. The combat is based on percentages, so yes a rat could beat you 1:1 if your rng rolls suck, but when you level your skills and come back for vengeance, it makes it all the sweeter.

The melee classes are easier, but once you finally start looking at using magic, making potions, gaining that understanding of the systems and overcoming that steep learning curve feels like it truly pays off.

This is a janky, graphically aged behemoth of a game and a fine example of what games seem to have been striving to move away from, in order to attract a larger player base, for better or worse.

If you feel like an epic adventure, don't mind putting in the work to understand the systems and then crafting goofy spells, where literally jumping between locations is much quicker than walking or taking transportation, this game is for you. Just don't expect it to spoon feed you (there are lots of guides/tutorials out there if you do need help!).

For a game released in 2002 it looks reasonably good and can be improved through mods fairly easily. The soundtrack is timeless and was composed by the now legendary Jeremy Soule. The game can be punishingly difficult for new characters and players who are more familiar with now industry standard game mechanics of health and mana regeneration, and not understanding how strong of an impact the various stats in the game affect everything you do. It doesn't matter if you happen upon some legendary weapons and armor; If your skills are low, most of your attempts to swing a sword or fire an arrow will miss entirely, and your armor will provide very little protection. The game also does little to hold your hand. Don't expect quest indicators to point your way to the next objective or prevent you from breaking the story line, as it is entirely possible to kill characters that are vital to progress the story, effectively ending your playthrough of the story. At least it does notify you afterward that you have broken the story. The story is definitely worth experiencing. If you don't mind a challenge and some of the tedious actions of the game systems from that time (like no indicators saying a container is empty and individually dragging items stack by stack from your inventory to a container), it is worthwhile to visit Morrowind and experience some of the history and events that are later referenced in Oblivion and Skyrim. The large number of books in the game are worth reading as well if you haven't already read them in more recent Elder Scrolls games. You also can meet the quirky author of those scandalous books, ""The Lusty Argonian Maid"", Crassius Curio. If you are looking for a RPG with a wide range of customization (except character models, which are limited without mods), an interesting story, a great soundtrack, and difficulty that will keep you on your toes, why not give Morrowind a chance?

Morrowind removed many of the rpg systems from its predecessor, Daggerfall, but it is still leagues ahead of any of the games Bethesda has released since. This game is the origin of the warp in the west, because the developers didn't want to pick a canon ending for Daggerfall, or account for all of the branches that would be caused by allowing players to import saves, as well as a significant amount of the rest of the Elder Scrolls lore.

The combat relies on skill-based dice-rolls to determine whether you hit your opponent or not. This system was also present in the prior two games, Arena and Daggerfall, but unlike Morrowind they were sprite-based, so it wasn't jarring then. There are mods to change this so that the dice-rolls determine the amount of damage inflicted, as in later games, but I recommend you suffer through the vanilla experience at least once.

But not everyone has the patience to sift through mod lists, read guides, and wrestle with loading conflicts. So how does Morrowind hold up without mods? Is it still worth playing?

Well, I'd say it is, if you can get over two things.

The first is the graphics. I mean, just look at the screenshots. They're very outdated. The texture are low resolution and low details, the characters, creatures and geography are sharp and angular. The color palette doesn't help either ; most of the environments are some combinations of dark green, light and dark browns, beige, and grays. Which is appropriate for the setting, but still contributes to a generally unnappealing look.

The second thing is the quirks that come with it being an old school RPG. You've probably heard about the combat system, which uses hit chances. This is a perfectly fine system for turn based or even top down RPGs, but for a first person one, where you can plainly see your weapon go through the enemy, it's very jarring when it doesn't do anything. Not to mention that, at the beginning of the game, you are going to miss [i]a lot[/i]. Especially since the game doesn't give you a lot of explanations (hint : fatigue matters a ton. Don't fight when you're tired).
It's not the only thing, though it's probably the most well known. Some skills are much more useful than others, some are surprisingly hard or long to train. It's difficult to be a mage without some prior game knowledge because the magic system is complex and at times confusing (and your magic reserves don't recharge naturally, you have to use potions or sleep). Sometimes, an NPC will wander into a doorway, and you'll have to wait until they decide to move again to be able to go through.  The map has squares to indicate locations, not different icons by types, so if you are looking for a city you can't tell at a glance what is a city and what is a ruin, you have to mouse over each one and check the name.
And so on. There aren't some huge problems (though some people understandably can't get over the fight system), but a bunch of little annoyances that are a symptom of the game being (nearly) 20 years old.

So what are Morrowind's strengths? Why do I say it's still worth playing, if you can get over my previous two points?

First off is the setting. We're all used to the typical high fantasy fare, your enchanted forests, great roiling plains, snowy mountains peaks, and the like. But Vvardenfell, where the game takes place, isn't like that. It's a volcanic island. There are marshes, ash-covered wastes, rocky cliffs, and coastal wetlands. Weird plants grow all over, some mushrooms are bigger than trees, some factions make their houses in the shells of long dead gigantic crabs while other literally grow their towns from mushrooms that they then hollow out and live in, not to mention the many ruins of other civilizations  dot the landscape and also look strange and distinct. The locals use giant insects as means of travels, and have ""mines"" dedicated to raise another species of insects for their eggs. Some fighters use equipment made of chitin, or bones, or shells.
Point is, despite the aged graphics, Morrowind gives you a setting that looks weird, exotic, and disorienting, and that makes you want to explore it.
Another strong point of the setting is that it's believable. The factions and the people interact with each other ; cities have very distinct styles depending on where they are ; people react to your actions ; and so on. Joined the Fighter's Guild? Well they and the Thieve's Guild have a beef, so if you want to be part of both it'll make things harder for you. Joined one of the Three Great Houses? Well the others will like you even less than before. You get the idea.

Then there is the freedom. Both from a gameplay and from a story standpoint, Morrowind is a game that lets you do whatever you want. There are many skills that cover a big range of weapons and magic, as well as mundane abilities like trading and talking, so you can build a character that fits your style. And the story never nags you, at least until toward the end. Heck, the first important character you meet on the main quest outright tells you to go out and explore the world, do some things and grow, before coming back. There might be consequences for going somewhere you're not supposed to be, but if you really want to go there, you can. Same with NPCs ; you can deal with them however you like.
The mortal-turned-god, who lives in the temple of the city that bears his name? In a modern RPG (like this game's sequels), you would have to wait until the associated quest progresses enough to meet him, and then you could only talk to him. In Morrowind, you can pick the lock to his temple and stab him to death if you feel like it. It's going to be hard, and the game will outright tell you you probably should reload a save because you just broke the main quest, but you [b]can[/] do it, and if you're fine with having a broken main quest, then the game won't insist.

And finally -and this one might not be an appeal for everyone, but for those it is, it's a big one- there's the power fantasy. At the beginning of the game, your character is weak. I distinctly remember my first time playing the game, where I was wandering about with no idea of what I was doing, and ended up being killed by a fish in the waters of the starting town. A [b]fish[/b]. (in my defence, I was weakened as I had just fought a crab). But as you progress, you become steadily more powerful. And eventually, you become [i]very[/i] powerful. Your skills improves, you hit more often and harder, you get better equipment. You learn new spells. You start destroying enemies that would have killed you before. And that feels GOOD.

And that's before you start messing with the game's system. Once you understand the game well, how stats interacts with each others, how magic works, and so on, you can break it apart. Fixed loot? That means you can get there at the start of the game and get an end-game weapon at level 1. Enchantment? You can completely destroy the game's balance with homemade stuff. Travelling? Who needs a boat when you can jump mountains. And so on. Again, this might not be appealing for everyone, but for some people (like me) there is a special satisfaction in poking at the game's rules and abusing them for your benefit.

So yes. I would recommend Morrowind. It's still a great game, even without mods.
Altough even if you don't want to mess with mods, I'll still recommend installing the unnoficial patch, at the very least. This is an old game, [i]and[/i] this is a Bethesda games. There are [b]bugs[/b].",1640531457,1640531457,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The average gamer of today will find it hard to get into this game no doubt, mainly because of the copious amounts of reading, exceedingly crappy combat and the worst of it all: lack of clear directions on where to go next. Perhaps people can move past many of Morrowind's archaic design choices but this last one is where you actually start to lose players.

No quest markers, just you, your map and your journal. It's a fantastic feeling when you successfully follow the directions NPCs give you, but the problem comes when they start to give you extremely vage directions. Most of the time you get detailed directions like ""go west and when you find a signpost, turn left"". That's manageable, but when it's crap like ""Uhhh yeah, just go southeast bro. It might be in a different direction tho"", yeah good luck with that.

For people that really want to get fully immersed, directions are not going to be a problem, you can just walk your days away and explore to your heart's content. But Bethesda knows that most gamers are busy people and have places to be, so it's no wonder that quest markers are a staple of all open world games these days, few people will choose immersion over convenience after all.

There's also no easy way to fast travel to previously visited locations, but this is just a small inconvenience in the early and mid game. It's only a matter of time for your character to go from lowly peasant to omnipotent god, happens in every single Bethesda game and Morrowind is no exception. My orc barbarian started with a humble pair of legs that were not particularly good at running and ended up being able to fly all over the map at high speeds. So yeah, travelling the land is not a big deal, in fact, is one of the best aspects of the game. Morrowind is such a vast and peculiar place, everything looks foreign, almost alien. Not your typical fantasy environment by any means, which can only elevate exploration.

Combat can be a little frustrating, your attacks are going to miss a lot until you raise your agility or your weapon skill,  not a big deal either but everyone that plays this game for the first time goes through this: you start the game, create your character after several minutes of careful consideration, try to kill your first mudcrab and stand there completely dumbfounded as you witness your character miss every single one of their attacks. And that's just the very beginning, don't even get me started on enemies that drain your atributes...

So ok, we managed to learn how the game works (not really), what's left? Well, thankfully, an stellar main quest that delivers a very interesting story. My one gripe with it is that becoming [spoiler]Hortator and Nerevarine[/spoiler] is a huge chore if you choose to go through with those quests but otherwise everything else is pretty good.

I played The original version of Morrowind (bought at Walmart in 2002).  Modded it and created mods for it. Played it until the CD got errors.  Got the steam version.  Spent a good day doing modding and once again fell in.  Steam hours listed do not reflect the actual hours I have played.  I know it's over 1000 hours and could be much higher.  I currently use OPENMW (with lots of graphics mods) and those hours don't show on Steam.  

SOME GENERAL THOUGHTS:
The combat sucks when you start a new game. Your starting speed sucks, so learn to enjoy the scenery.  Alchemy is OP as is Enchanting.  Sneaking? not so much. There can be a grind but there are ways to avoid most of it. There are many guides, both written and on Youtube.  Graphics is dated but can be enhanced through mods.  The landmass is large, you will get lost.  The game WILL NOT hold your hand and you can freely walk into areas above your pay grade.  Save often.  There are more NPC's than in most games. That said, there is NO quest marker, and most dialog is not voice acted so you will be reading a lot of dialog. NPCs will lie or be mistaken in their directions and you will get lost. Save often.  The methods of making an optimum build are not obvious, or required.  While fast travel like in later games (from the map) is not implemented, the various water ships, guild teleports, stilt striders and other methods of movement are viable substitutes. 

WHY I RECOMMEND:
The main quest is a good story.  There are a lot of step and fetch it quests but there are some memorial quests, too.  The landscape is unlike any of the other Elder Scrolls games and captured my interest.  Mods are still being made although you MAY want to try your first play through plain vanilla.  If you played Oblivion and Skyrim, you owe it to yourself to try Morrowind for the lore, the experience, and perhaps the completionist in you.

I had already put in around 3,000 hours in on my Nintendo Switch and I was ready to see what else this series had in store. I've played for about 91 hours and gotten a decent ways through the main quest at the point of writing this review and I have to conclude that Morrowind is the better of the Elder Scrolls series, character creation is far more thoughtful and deep than in Skyrim and not every quest ends in violence, unlike in Skyrim where nearly every quest involves delving into some dungeon, slaying a bunch of weak enemies, slaying the dungeon boss, and getting some amount of loot to either equip to your character or sell once you're back in town. Those kinds of quests still exist in Morrowind (And again, not every Skyrim quest ends in violence either), but with Morrowind, the amount of violence you engage in is mostly dictated by you, the player. Sure, some npcs have to die for the story to progress and some npcs have to be kept alive for the story to progress, but with the smaller quests, i.e. most of what you'll be doing, your hand is rarely, if ever, forced.
And at the end of the day, isn't that what a roleplaying game is about? Being in control of your character's actions? To play out the role you wish your character to have? I would think so.

After playing hundreds of hours in Oblivion and thousands of hours in Skyrim I decided to finally play the highly praised Elder Scrolls 3. So don't think this review is blinded by nostalgia. But after finally playing it for the first time I quit after a couple of hours because I didn't know where to go haha. Where was my way point? Why am I not hitting anything? I finally decided to come back a few months later. Then I finally realized how great this game is. Sure, there's no way points but Its actually kind of fun to have to follow directions to a place you've never been. I think games have kind of spoiled us with that feature. The rpg elements blow Skyrims out of the water. You can level up just about everything. You want to jump over houses? Find some scrolls and level up your acrobatics!

It is the only game in the franchise where the main quest actually hooked me. Whereas Skyrim and Oblivion have upfront and frequently present threats to the fate of the world, Morrowind's main questline is much more of a slow burn, giving you plenty of time to ease into the plot, learn the political climate of Vvardenfell, and learn lore that directly pertains to the main plot. Most of the main quest avoids the typical Elder Scrolls dungeon crawling, instead asking you to travel to different cities or camps, meeting people and fulfilling a series of prophecies, which plays into Morrowind's somewhat archaic dialogue system. The faction quests always start out seeming like meaningless tasks, but end up forming a larger arc that carries a purpose in the larger world. Smaller side quests usually succeed in either leading you to something obscure but important, or are just entertaining.

In terms of issues, well, there's plenty. First and foremost is the vanilla combat. To modern gamers, the idea of swinging a sword at something and just missing is asinine. It's a system rooted in the concept of AC and saving throws in D&D, but doesn't translate well in this format. Luckily, there are mods that rebalance the game so that you can swing weapons and always hit with them, like later Elder Scrolls games. Second is the fast travel system. Most people exaggerate this issue. While you can't open a map anywhere to travel to wherever you want instantly, getting anywhere you want is never difficult, and you have a lot of options. The silt striders, boats, guild guides, and gondolas transport you for a small fee. Almsivi Intervention and Divine Intervention can transport you to a town instantly. Recall does the same but to wherever you last used the Mark spell. There's also a propylon system that is hard to use unless you've installed the master propylon plugin, but is still another option. The problem of having to memorize all these systems can be lessened by a mod that shows a transport map when you go to a transport NPC.

Overall, what I think really matters is how a game makes you feel. And for me, Morrowind was an invested experience. Fulfilling the Nerevarine prophecies made me feel powerful, even though I knew I was just following the story's script. There were interesting and memorable characters. There were hard times of exploring ash-ridden volcano slopes, and there were fun times of getting an extra-comfy pillow as a reward for finding a crashed ship full of pillows. I will always treasure this game despite its many flaws.",1639453110,1639453110,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main quest is interesting and the lore surrounding it is well explained in dialog and some reading material mostly provided on the journey. The dialog isn't voiced but it has a topic system which provide a lot more possibilities to share information with the player instead of needing books all the time for detailed information. There is also a massive amount of quests it's over 400 which provide a lot of things to do, it's more than Oblivion and Skyrim. Guilds have a ranking system and requirements but also reside in multiple towns so it feels more organic to climb the ladder because it also comes with some benefits later down the road. Character progression is more complex than its successors but not by much to be overwhelming and everything is viable even on higher difficulty but it might take longer to kill something in rare cases obviously. The world is varied in tone and ambience with different environments so discovering the world is often interesting. The two expansions Tribunal and Bloodmoon are good their main quest was fun and for tribunal provide additional content somewhat attached to the main story of the game. 

While main quest is fun most of the rest of the numerous quests do tend to feel more on the errand side given that the topic system could be utilised a bit more in-depth when investigating for some quests. Additionally some quests give very little to go and sometimes the directions given are rather vague and you end up wandering around making up 75% of the time spent to find the location for the quest. It comes to the world map which won't mark every discovered locations but only what the game deemed most important so finding the way to unmarked locations can be tedious at times and it also doesn't help that it's really zoomed out and cannot be zoomed in at all. Another problem is most dungeons have an identical entrance to most others so it's always needed to go up to the door and verify because there is no compass like in Oblivion and Skyrim here. The problem with dungeons is how they are most of the time very short and repetitive, no unique enemies, no interesting loot, no particular interesting quest to go with it or anything really to make them stand out even a little and the different types are few so as much as I enjoy dungeon crawling this is more about quantity over quality. A lot of time is spent finding your way around and given the lack of points of interest and unhelpful tools to orient yourself I'm confident a sizeable portion of my playtime is going in circles to reach quest locations so I recommend looking at uesp interactive map to avoid that. The game is most probably more buggy than the other TES games I've played even with mods to patch things up I still had quest that couldn't be completed most of the time because I didn't do things in order or in a specific way so my usage of the console commands was much more frequent in Morrowind than Oblivion and Skyrim to debug my way out of problems. Pathfinding is some of the worst as well, doing escort missions was gruelling since they also walk very slowly and can easily not be able to walk the seemingly normal path you do so it takes patience for those. I had numerous crashes despite having only the bare minimum as mods but most were after 300 hours played so maybe it was something in my save.

In conclusion, it's a good game truly for anyone interested in RPGs or The Elder Scrolls games maybe not so much to someone that is not too deep into the genre but the old-school side isn't hard to deal with and I have a hard time playing 90s games these days just to give an idea. I strongly recommend getting at the very least the code patch and MGE XE on nexusmods just reading the instructions in the description should be enough to install them it's easy and quick to fix many problems even if only trying to seek a vanilla experience for a first time with the game. My personal score is 8/10 it actually took me 400+ hours to do everything I could in the game with a single character but I tend to take my time with video games.",1639077959,1639077959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Seriously though this game is a blast. However It is very frustrating at times and it very much refuses to hold your hand throughout like the Elder Scrolls games that came after it which means in summary you have no fast travel no quest-markers and no solid direction for the first part of the game. 

All in all its a great game but do not expect it to be easy or forgiving and if this sounds like fun than go ahead and try it.

I first started playing Morrowind in 2004, as a bright eyed and bushy tailed 10 year old homeschooler. I had no idea what an RPG was but I had heard about them on the news reports covering the war in the Middle East, so I felt pretty qualified to play this game. What unfolded was a love story that would span two copies of Morrowind GOTY (turns out when you play a game religiously on Xbox, the disc can die) and two annotated maps, and would shape my future disappointment with just about every RPG that I would play.

Morrowind is Elder Scrolls for crack addicts and people who wake up ready to be heart. It's brutal, unfair, beautiful, deep, rich and also, with a wave of a magic wand and a proper soul trap on target, completely broken. Imagine spending 200 hours fighting through Vvardenfell, fighting to rid the land of Dagoth Ur, to restore order to Solstheim and uncover a deep conspiracy in Mournhold, only to start a new game and realize you could become a God (how can you kill a god?). To accent the struggle and strife of getting one shotted by a werewolf with 600 speed and 1000 acrobatics is an opioid I hope to God you can ingest in your system. 

I don't know how Morrowind will hold up for you today. I grew up with it. It reminds me of simpler days, of mystery, excitement. I think if you buy this game and go into it looking at it as a time capsule of when game design was simplistic yet deep, rich and engrossing, you'll be blown away. If you go in hoping for a AAA title with beautiful graphics and your typical voice actors, you're going to rage and head back to Skyrim Anniversary Re-Release V2. This game changed my life, as cringe as that is to say. It opened my imagination and showed me how powerful games can be, and how they can inspire us artistically.

If you're on the fence, jump in. It'll be brutal at first but stick with it. Raise your agility and luck, train in your primary weapon skills so you're landing hits, and then read your journal to discover a land full of intrigue, danger and, most of all, beauty.",1638569239,1638569239,True,1,0,0.493403702974319458,0,True,False,False

This is, in my humble opinion, the Elder Scrolls game that set the bar for RPGs. It's a world rich in lore and adventure, that is significantly more dangerous and less watered down than Oblivion and Skyrim. This game doesn't hold your hand, and actions have consequences. Be who you want to be, go where you want to go, and let the story of the Nerevarine and Morrowind unfold before you.

Engine: when you first start of modding the game, you need to make a choice, a very important one, do you stick with the vanilla engine or go with openmw? Both are good ways of playing but the vanilla version with no setup is far worse than openmw, most people mod the base game so I will focus on that, you need at least 3 mods

Mods: vanilla morrowind is quite outdated and it doesn't take a genius to understand so, these mods will help with the frustration you may encounter at the 480p resolution, 5 feet/meter view distaance, or any other annoyances you may have

1. MGE XE allows modern resolution support, cool shaders, and more, it's what most people use, just run the GUI executable included and adjust the settings
Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102/

2. The Morrowind code patcher is required to make mge xe work, just run the executable included and tick/untick the options you want or don't want and then click ""apply chosen patches""
Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510/

3. Patch for purists is a bug fixer, unzip the contents into the data files folder, it has an esm/esp, nuff said
Link: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45096

This is what I use to play the game but openmw has an installer which makes a lot of these mods obsolete for openmw, that being said, openmw does not have compatibility with mwse lua mods although in the next version, they plan to add support for it in the next update, but it's in it's very, VERY early stages, so the choice comes down to what you want

Do you want an easy setup or are not interested into mods? go with openmw

Do you want better mod support for your needs? Unless you don't mind a weird setup, go with vanilla

P.S if you chose either, be prepared to stick to it as openmw does not support vanilla save and vice versa, my parting words on this review/guide, or are experiencing any issues, comments are allowed, and if you do buy the game, welcome to Vvardenfell",1638395619,1638395619,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I don't think there will ever be a day when I 100% this game. 40 hours in and I haven't even touched the main quest. There is something great about a game that tells you ""You suck, get good."" before even starting the main story. It makes you feel like you belong in this world and that the quest were not specifically made just for you the player. There is so much to take in this game and unlike the other elder scrolls, any sort of cheep advantage you can get over your enemy, you should use otherwise you might not make it. Don't expect to be a super powered MF'r until you put in the work. There is so much content in this game that never made it into the other elder scrolls. Not having fast travel is awesome albeit at the cost of a headache trying to find which strider and boat to ride on. But something about that makes it so much more immersive than pulling up your map and magically ending up where you want to be. Fret not though if you want to travel fast on foot, take a strong levitation spell and the boots of blinding speed and you will be flying across the map in magical fashion. Never in my life have I felt more like a wizard in a video game. And for those that can't stand the combat because you miss every hit, just train. If you actually listen to what quest givers tell you and pay attention, you will be rewarded with help and items. This game is not as unforgiving as it may seem, you just cant be lazy. The Journal can be a bitch but I never had any problems completing a quest as long as I took the time to read what they were saying and went through all dialog options. Just don't get too much on your plate at once. One quest at a time. Worst comes to worst there are so many great guides that I can't imagine anybody having a hard time with this game unless they have a single digit IQ. Highly recommend you download at least the Graphics Extender if playing on a modern system. Which brings me into mods. This game is 100x times easier to mod than Skyrim or Oblivion, and most mods work with each other well and will not crash the game. The community is still putting out new content on Nexus. That should tell you the longevity of this game. Truly a masterpeice. The world is so fleshed out and so alive it feels like a real place that just far away from here.

I played this for a very long time back on Xbox and I will say the PC version isn't as polished the great part about PC is that you can mod out most of those problems. It has an amazing story and a super cool world. It easily took my #1 spot back in 2017. Its not for everyone I can say that, coming from Skyrim I was used to playing games in autopilot...cant play morrowind like that. Morrowind makes you think a little bit but not so much to the point where it feels like a chore.

My first true elder scrolls experience was Skyrim back in 2011, and as much as I loved skyrim, I eventually started to crave more... So naturally I looked back at the older elder scrolls games. First I started with oblivion, while the atmosphere was amazing and the world felt very alive, it was marred by an incredibly broken level scaling system, that, when I initially complained about, I was told that I have to min-max to circumvent this and make sure I get a certain amount of endurance on a single level up, and put all the skills I actually planned on using as miscellaneous skills.

That was fucking dumb, and you bet your ass I didn't play it for very long.

Now moving on from oblivion I decided to try morrowind, originally I couldn't get into it, a lot of things put me off, but eventually I made a character build I was comfortable with and had a blast, I chose a preset class and went to town, she was an acrobat who could zip around all over the place jumping away from combat only to poke somebody in the face with a spear afterwards, Eventually I fought dagoth ur, killed him, and completed the main story quest, but I hadn't even begun to scratch the surface of what this game had to offer, so I made a new character... And eventually I made a character with a custom class.

That custom character utilized magic, and that's where an entire world of wonder was opened up to me, I chose magic specialization, made my character's strengths both intelligence and willpower, then proceeded to take all the magic based skills as majors and minors, with unarmored slapped in there also for the hell of it, took atronarch sign because alchemy is a thing and I could just craft magicka potions. What became of it was something truly amazing, the spell making system gave me the freedom to make whatever kind of spell I wanted, and eventually my mage got so damn powerful that I made a single spell that fortified my mercantile to 900 and was able to convince a merchant that a rock I found outside of balmora was worth the entirety of his stock. It's an incredibly system and one that I wish was included in the later installements, especially in skyrim where magic was gutted entirely and became progressively weak the higher your level went.

Despite having started with a game later in the franchise I was still so drawn to this because of the sheer amount of freedom that was offered to me at character creation, eventually I found myself pouring hundreds of hours into it, several hundred of those hours aren't even displayed on steam because I started using OpenMW, which I highly recommend you use if you plan on playing this game, sure you don't get access to script extender mods, but you really don't need them, the game holds out on it's own without adding unnecessary bloat to it, and you get a launcher that is 64 bit, supports modern hardware, and has an amazing level of stability that bethesda could only wish surpass.",1638237232,1638237481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Edit: I still fully stand by what i wrote above, but i found the game was better than i first gave it credit for. World is really good, best main quest of an elder scrolls game, exploration CAN be fun, but sometimes is really not when too little direction is given, and the story telling is just really good honestly. HOWEVER, there are several major problems with this game, in terms of the mechanics, which is why I have no shame in calling Skyrim the better game, because that can be enjoyed for its mechanics. You know the drill, shitty combat, shitty walk speed, difficulty can be absolutely horseshit, especially in the tribunal expansion. My solution to this is to choose redguard at the start of the game, spec into long blades as a major skill, use a long blade, instead of the shitty dagger at the office and use console commands to give yourself a tolerable walking speed and carrying capacity.",1556211572,1638210840,True,0,0,0.206764981150627136,0,True,False,False

It doesn't have voice acting. For me that is a good thing. The reason we have so few options these days in RPG's is because they will not put in that much voice acting.

I must have over a thousand hours or more between my original PC boxed copy, the Xbox version and most recently OpenMW. While it undoubtedly shows its age at this point, underneath the dated graphical exterior is a deep, engrossing RPG with real player choice and meaningful character customization.

 While the quests you're sent on often aren't much on their own, the context and overarching narrative of them primarily serves to make the player feel like a part of the world. And what a world it is. This is the Elder Scrolls before all the rough edges were sanded down, when the lore was weird and wild and deep and not everything was explained to the player. 

It truly feels like you're a stranger in a strange land, and while Vvardenfell may be smaller than previous Elder Scrolls games it's far, far more detailed and much more alien. With OpenMW's graphical enhancements this can still be a startlingly beautiful game, which is a credit to the strong art direction.

So I am the most biased person to write a review for this game. I have bought it three times (once on Xbox, once as a PC disk, and once here on steam). I love this game, and always will. No this game isn't perfect, it is old school in so many ways, but if you take the time to learn it, maybe watch a guide just to get you started, it is a rich and rewarding experience.

First, and foremost, this game has a lot of ""annoying"" things about it that modern games have done away with that you will need to get used to, or potentially mod out. Things such as a slow walking/running speed, magicka (mana) not regenerating over time require you to rest, weapons missing most of the time if your skill is low, stamina draining as you run, no fast travel other than through in game services such as boats, no quest markers, etc. etc. This will be an immediate turn off for many people. I play the game completely unmoded, but have found ways to deal with these problems in game (such as using the ""Boots of Blinding Speed""). The modding community is great for this game so if you must you can mod it right away to make it more accessible.

But why would you go through this effort for this game? In my opinion there are 3 things this game does extraordinarily well that make it worthwhile to play even today. 

1. You are a stranger in a strange land. You don't fight dragons or trolls or other familiar creatures from fantasy. You fight nix hounds and dreugs. No rolling hills of english country side here, instead swamps with giant mushrooms and ash lands where people live in giant crab shells. It is a setting unlike any other. 

2. The world building and story. There is basically no voice acting in this game (except like one or two lines per race), its all done through text. And the writing is pretty good. It draws you into its strange world, the strange customs of the Dunmer, the history of the tribunal, and it doesn't beat you over the head with any of it. You explore and encounter it naturally, organically and the people act like it. The open world means you can explore many of the smaller niches of the game or go through the main story. I find the main story great.

 3. It doesn't hold you by the hand. I think this is a positive thing, as you learn not only the mechanics of the game but the world of Morrowind, it feels rewarding to get a handle on things, it feels rewarding to find secrets and learn. You have to struggle to understand, make an effort in a way games don't ask of their audience anymore, but they reward you for it.

So if you can get past, or even get invested, in the old school, don't hold you by the hand gameplay, there is plenty to love about this game and it is well worth it.",1588280130,1637339903,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The open game world can be traversed freely and contains numerous settlements, unique flora and fauna and wastelands. There are different races, organisations, and even in-game books detailing the world’s history, religion and politics.

It does have 3D graphics and an open world, but for modern tastes, the game is unpolished, ugly and rough around the egdes. More than once did I get stuck on a certain section of a dungeon and had to push myself repeatedly to get through. There were a few bugs with saving the game too, though I was able to fix them by deleting corrupted files and starting over with progress largely intact.

The leveling system and character skills allow for a wide variety of different playstyles, even if some are more practical than others. Personally, I find it to be one of the best in any video games I have played. Morrowind has 27 different skills, which are developed further by practicing the skill. While leveling up you increase your character’s fundamental attributes that are separate from your skills. This sophisticated system reminds me of tabletop RPGs, and is not the only area of the game obviously inspired by them.

Joinable guild questlines are more believable than in many other games (such as Skyrim), as you will slowly work your way up the organisation by first doing menial tasks and then proceeding to the more serious quests. This balance helps you feel that you’ve progressed further once you have gone further in the questline. 

Conversations are in the form of written dialogue, and while in a sense it takes from immersion, it also allows for more intricate dialogue in character interactions. Most NPCs are useless statists, but it also means settlements are more believable when having a larger number of inhabitants. But it is somewhat annoying that NPCs are walking encyclopedias and you need to scroll down a long list of conversation topics to find the proper one.

Albeit being composed of only a few tracks, the soundtrack to Morrowind is excellent and helps immersion.",1637298457,1637298457,True,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

Lets see... so you played Oblivion and Skyrim? Fine, now throw everything away you learned from them, because Morrowind is different, you filthy N´wah.
Care about graphics? Get out, stupid S´wit.
The entire Character System relies on Numbers, you do better in everything the higher your stats are. Acrobatics make you jump higher, Alchemy makes your potions better and is important for knowing what effect for example crab meat has to begin with. You wont hit anything with your bow when your marksman skill is too low and so on.
You get no Quest Markers or fast travel, instead you have to ask for directions and pay to get a ride to the next city if you dont want to walk.
Guild Membership doesnt guarantee Promotions on a regular basis, you have to meet specific requirements to get them plus, membership in certain guilds might lock you out from other ones. And dont think you would be done with a guild after three or four quests. 
tl;dr: Guilds make you actually work for your profit.
Level offset like in Oblivion or Skyrim isnt a thing here, you can get even the best gear right away if you know where to look for it and how to get it. Naturally, this means, there are areas where you get murdered instantly if you dare to show up as freshly arrived prisoner.
All in all, all the work you put into your character pays off as it gives you later on that sweet, sweet hero feeling, You become strong and filthy bandits are always filthy and wont show up in ebony armour like in Oblivion.

But you may ask, what comes after you spend countless hours on bringing down the sixt house and becoming Dark Elf Jesus? Well, in Mournhold you get to take on a demi Goddess and on Solstheim a Daedric prince. And even after that there are still countless places to go and secrets to uncover.

1) Download mods. Please do not play this without them and expect a great experience. Don't turn yourself away from the game right away. It's nearly 20 years old at this point, the game could use all the help it can get.

2) Take it easy. There's no wrong way to play. There are certainly ""sub-optimal"" builds for your character, but that's the fun of the game. You want to swing a big ass mace and cast spells in light armor? Go for it.

3) Don't look everything up. The directions that the NPCs give you for a quest are given that way on purpose to encourage exploration and discovery. Taking the long way to your objective is infinitely more rewarding, both in material rewards as well as in the enjoyment you'll get from this carefully constructed world. That leads me to the next point.

4) Look up, look down, look all around. There's loot behind tapestries, under pillows, behind beds. EVERYWHERE. Most of it is a little gold or potions, but some of the best items the game has to offer are hidden in locations you'd never go to normally. Harking back to point number 3, explore. It's a vast open world out there and the island of Vvardenfel holds many secrets at the tops of towers and depths of the many caves.

5) Ask the community. Morrowind has a fan base stretching back 20 years now. If you need advice or just want to learn more about the game, we're here. If you have a second monitor, I usually watch Lyle Shnub's Morrowind Mondays playthrough while pitter pattering my way around Vivec.

With Skyrim getting yet another release, I feel like there's no better time to look to some of the older games and appreciate them for what they are and embrace that lost sense of storytelling Morrowind has to offer.

I'm not trying to sell you on old school, paper-and-pen mechanics. Many of Morrowind's design choices frustrate me such as chance to hit, fatigue, day-long magicka regen, an incredibly slow leveling system when done without exploits and virtually barren merchant gold for how many >50,000 gold items you'll end up collecting in your inventory. Which is compounded by low encumbrance and lack of a proper player home to store and display collected items. 

No, when I say it set the tone I mean the thematic consistency, the rock solid writing, the subtle hints as opposed to ham-fisted orders. The sincerity of the alien world despite its oddities and zany interactions. The explanation for basically everything. This was sorely missing in both Oblivion and Skyrim, and I fear for the future of TES if the Pavlovian formula of ""don't ask questions, just loot and shoot"" continues.

Those aside, there's some things that I'd say put it just a little above Skyrim - custom spells (but I'd say Oblivion does this better), custom class creation, and an NPC that lost his pants down by Gnisis.

Day 1- Downloaded the game.

Day 1 - Played the game and realized the resolution is set to the year 2002.

Day 1 - Downloaded a resolution fix mod.

Day 1 - Finally played the game.

Day 1 - Choose Dark Elf and begin my journey into the vast lands of Morrowind.

Day 1 - Spend an hour taking spoons and cups, made 40 to 50 gold coins off that. Feeling lucky I decided to do some missions after taking a break.

Day 1 - Launched the game 2 hrs later saw that there was no save file present in the game. Because I didn’t manually save my game last time I played. Screw you modern games with your auto-save system.

Day 2 - Installed the game again. Decided to play as a Red guard, if it’s not dark, then all in on black.

Day 2 - No mini-map or objective marker. Journal said I should head north to the city of balmora. I ended up in Ebonheart, which is a castle in the south.

Day 2 - Then I decided to go north but ended up getting gang-banged by group cliff racers. Turns out, the time I spent walking from one destination to another, I was collecting cliff racers over my head.

Day 2- Survived the battle with cliff racers, because one of the stolen cups was a bottle of cheap health potion. 

Day 3 - Found a cave, freed some slaves. Hit their master with my inexperienced Axe skill, I got rekt after two heavy blows to my head.

Day 3- Auto-save took me back to the entrance of the cave. I decided the noblest thing to do is - 
* Free the slaves 
* Not to be seen by their master.
If they get captured, it will be their fault for not finding a better hiding spot.

Day 4 - Encountered a rat, took me around 5 minutes to kill it. Out of 40 blows, only six landed. Googled, why is that? Turns out you can only use a weapon if you are good at it or every swing is a guaranteed miss.

Day 4 - Learned that my red guard has a long sword. I mean to have experience wielding a long sword.

Day 4- Now I can kill rats in 15 swings. And 8 of them will land.

Day 5 - Ended up in Balmora (20 hrs of running from cliff racers and killed by fish). The main mission was to head to a Dwemer ruin and steal a cube.

Day 5 - Made it to the ruins, stole the cube. Found a locked door but I lock-picked it. My red guard was also good at thief-ing.

Day 5 - Gave the cube to the guy and he gave me a key that can unlock a special door in the Dwemer cave.

Day 5- went back to the cave and spent the next hour looking for a door that could fit the key. Got annoyed and googled the location of the door. Turns out it was the same door I unlocked the last time. One of the comments on the forum said ‘Much of this game is about nothing’.

Day 5 - With the Seinfeld theme playing in my head, I decided to join the fighter guild. One of the missions was to kill a person in Balmora. So I did, after a while, I noticed that nobody was using that home.

Day 5- Now I am the owner of the town’s murder house. Once you dispose of the body, the home feels brand new.

Day 6- I am stuffing my new house with stolen cups and figuring out which way is west of my town.",1635921986,1635922336,True,37,40,0.747359871864318848,3,True,False,False

Morrowind is way too good, and most importantly, way too unique, too remarkable to be skipped in favor of Oblivion or Skyrim, and remains an extraordinary RPG to this day. Yet it definitely makes you appreciate the improvements that later games brought to the series more.

As most people agree, TES III gives us a rather weak game-in-itself, but also gives us an incredibly strong game world and even more incredibly strong lore for this world. That's what makes it so immersive and memorable, that's still what makes it stand out from most of the modern RPGs. Morrowind is deep, but very flawed: it is massive in scale, but technically limited to be visually and perceptually believable; its game systems are ambitiously designed, but its gameplay is not implemented well, which makes playing the game for dozens of hours tedious, repetitive and unrewarding. The world is inimitable, and the lore that gives so much life to this undynamic and barely inhabited terrain is still mostly unparalleled, but the main and side quests that should give us the motivation to explore and live in this world are not that engaging, with the word ""well-written"" reserved only for a dozen selected quests out of a hundred.

First acquaintance with the world, its strange look, its miriad of people to meet, books to read and systems to learn made it highly exciting. But the combination of weak gameplay and unsatisfactory quests made late-game exploring a chore, a tedium. In its purest, the Main Quest is written well, it really made you engage with the world, believe in what's happening within its realms, think deeply about political and philosophical implications that the lore makes. Aside the very best of the side content, however, only the start of the Tribunal expansion managed to revive this deep interest in me, with the quests being considerably more consistent in their quality this time around, and the gameplay becoming suprisingly challenging with the tougher enemies. Regretfully, Bloodmoon (except some of the attempts in making a few tough enemies that aimed to destroy even high-leveled characters) was mostly unsuccessful in engaging me with a new set of people, lands and quests: occasionally interesting and peculiar, but not engaging. Morrowind mods are great, for their time Morrowind mods were almost genre-defining... but I only used a few of them to enhance the look and fix some aspects of the gameplay, never to experience something different than the original game intended. I wouldn't like mixing the modded experience with the original playthrough experience: I would wish for the memories about this game to remain pure and unaltered.

If there is a single 10/10 element Morrowind, it is undoubtedly a masterpiece of a soundtrack by Jeremy Soule. Ironically enough, it might be the only decisive thing that made me finally play this game: I simply adored licensed Harry Potter video games OSTs, and in no way I could allow myself to miss listening to any of Jeremy Soule's works. Previously I thought Morrowind was too old, too obsolete, too ugly to play in a current day, I thought I could simply start my TES journey with Oblivion and listen to Morrowind's OST on Youtube instead... But with almost every soundtrack, the context in which the music is played greatly enhances the music itself, as well as the thing it accompanies. Without the music of Jeremy Soule, Morrowind's world is dead, static, uninhabited. But the music created the most unique bond between me and the game: it made me feel different every time I hear the sounds of  ""The Road Most Travelled"" or ""Silt Sunrise"", ""Over the Next Hill"" or ""Caprice"", ""Shed Your Travails"" or ""Peaceful Waters"", ""Blessing of Vivec"" or THE theme song to rule all the theme songs, ""Nerevar Rising"". Not a single exploration song is close to simply ""listenable"", ""passable"": every single mentioned song is fantastic, magnificent, enchanting.
As the game itself, the Morrowind OST is outstandingly unique: to an experienced ear, its composition sounds a bit.. raw, unrefined? The transition between instruments, between melodies sounds.. a bit unpolished, clumsy? Occasional melodies, the sound of some of the instruments might sound.. naive in their simplicity? So many instruments presenting so many melodical and harmonical levels - that's the magic of Jeremy Soule. Specifically, that's the magic of the early Jeremy Soule, when his music often sounded unexpected and strange, but thematically coherent and smartly arranged, beatifully ambient, but overwhelmingly powerful and dynamic.

Regrettably, Bethesda had little experience in handling game soundtracks at this point, so the OST was treated as a short list of randomized tracks on repeat. For such a long journey, for hundreds of hours of gameplay, it's simply impossible to not turn the music off at some point, just to save yourself from getting too accustomed to it, from overplaying it to death. It's a mistery why for Morrowind OST Jeremy Soule came up with more of an album of amazing songs, rather than an extended soundtrack that supports and accompanies you throughout the long hours of the game; why there are as many battle tracks as there are exploration tracks, when in reality only 1% of the game you are engaged in a battle, while 99% of the game you are engaged in exploration. Most likely, it's the inadequacy in Bethesda's requests for what a video game soundtrack they ""envision"", because clearly, at that point, they never heard of extending a track to fit into a long segment of exploration, or categorization to play different tracks in different areas of the world to create a different thematic feeling of these areas (the only thing they managed to accomplish is cueing battle track playlist when an enemy is engaged). What's more to say: originally, ""The Road Most Travelled"" was simply called ""Main Theme"", which is what it definitely sounds like, with its build-up and clearly defined leitmotiff which is then built upon, and which is definitely why it is one of the most memorable tracks in the OST. And ""Caprice"" was originally ""Ending Theme"", which is what, again, it definitely sounds like, and why it sounds a bit out of place in exploration tracks.
Jeremy Soule is without a doubt capable of making a long extended soundtrack that supports and accompanies the game, in creating themes for different areas and locations of the game world: he already accomplished that on noticeably long Harry Potter OSTs (time to finish the game was 10-20 hours compared to a 100+ of Morrowind hours, but they still have bigger soundtracks with more individual themes and pieces), and he would keep accomplishing this later with Oblivion and Skyrim. He even envisioned the original purpose for many of the tracks, which he integrated into the compositions and arrangements... But Bethesda was ignorant, blind and deaf to be able to make it work any differently than a randomized playlist on repeat that plays inside and outside, in settlements and in caves alike.

I can't overstate how much the music enchances this game, I can't praise enough Jeremy Soule for the feelings it invokes in me. I can't believe so few people discuss and analyze the soundtrack by Jeremy Soule; the most that people accomplish is comment on how ""heartwarming"" it is, how ""very nostalgic"" it makes them. Thankfully, Morrowind's OST was never a simple nostalgia to me, I see it for what it is: an astounding achievement for game soundtracks, an immense source for deep feelings, a masterpiece that put Jeremy Soule on a map as possibly the greatest auteur of the video game soundtracks. Similarly, Morrowind itself is not a nostalgia game, it's not just a game that made some design features that later games shamefully ommited: a one-of-a-kind RPG with an unmatched depth of lore... which I wish more games tried to match.",1617998143,1635016377,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There is not a reliable fast travel system, and the map is very poor. This makes getting around frustrating.

The game has much to do outside the main story, with numerous factions, and decisions that create new opportunities while cutting off others. So there is also replay value. 

The game has numerous aedric and daedric artifacts. Many of which are not obtained through daedric quests and are obtained by killing or robbing the current owners.

The biggest stumbling block isn't the graphics, but how obscure yet important certain stats are in the game that can lead to an experienced player to become a God within the first few hours of the game, or lead a new person to founder hopelessly against the mud crabs around Seyda Neen. Combat can feel terrible if you don't dump starting points into agility and use a major skill for a specific weapon. Movement is slow without a high speed stat or a small handful of items in specific locations. Spells constantly fizzling out because you barely have any points in willpower, and then magicka doesn't regenerate without resting, etc etc.

This isn't to say that Morrowind is a bad game. Far from it; it has a fantastic setting, lots of interesting people, a great main plot to get invested in, and the world is littered with huge power ups that are a delight to find, especially since they will retain their effectiveness throughout the game and aren't tuned to your level just to be discarded for a random trash weapon 5 levels from now.

If you want to give it a go and don't know anything about Morrowind, I highly recommend reading a few guides for how to build out a character and some locations to go for equipment and quests to make the first few hours smooth. The start can be rough, but the journey is absolutely amazing and still stands as one of my favorite games to experience.",1633986274,1633986274,False,9,2,0.543691515922546387,1,True,False,False

In fact, the game has many advantages over Bethesda's more recent titles that I'll summarize for you quickly here.  To get the most out of this review, you must be at least slightly familiar with Bethesda's more modern offerings, so consider yourself warned.

1. Weapon Skills Make Sense - In Oblivion, the only melee weapon skills available are blade or blunt.  That's right, your shifty rogue is inexplicably just as skilled with a massive claymore as he is his tiny daggers.  Or get this: Skyrim ""improved"" on that system by making it just one handed or two handed weapons.  Now your dagger is functionally equivalent to a mace.  Morrowind didn't screw around with all that nonsense.  Weapon skills are divided into sensible groups that don't give you a migraine when you stare at them too long.

2. More Weapon Varieties - I won't even go into detail about how the later titles have watered down the weapon selection.  Just know that Morrowind will let you use crossbows, halberds, glaives, shurikens and the like with no problems.

3.  More Armor Variety and Skills - In hindsight, probably should have mashed the last two categories together, but hakuna matata.  Bethesda's latest stance on armor is that there are just two options: heavy or light.  Morrowind offers a medium armor category for those who want the best of both worlds.  There's even an unarmored skill that protects you without any armor at all, for all of you Chuck Norris wannabes out there.

4. Murder Hobos Rejoice - In Morrowind, feel free to shank anyone at any time, for any reason (or no reason at all).  The later titles make ""quest NPCs"" unkillable for some infuriatingly annoying reason.  Morrowind will give you a warning message that you may have just screwed up a questline in case you want to reload an earlier save, but ultimately doesn't stand in your way of killing your bosses, guildmasters, or the gods themselves.

5. Get Lost - After Morrowind, all Bethesda titles feature an onscreen compass with waypoints.  This admittedly makes completing quests faster, but sadly, also more boring.  To get things done on Vvardenfell, you actually have to pay attention to directions.  I know, I know.  It sounds dangerously similar to using your brain, but trust me; climbing Red Mountain through the ash wastes and turning west when you see the Ancestral Tomb is a lot more fulfilling than ""follow the arrow until you bump your nose on the objective"".

6. Magic is Magical - I'm the first to admit that I love the visuals on Skyrim's flame spell, but... the entire magic system just seems so lacking!  Morrowind's magic allows you to levitate through the air, detect the where the keys to your cage are hidden, teleport across the world, and so much more!

Rare stuff is Actually Rare - Level up high enough in Oblivion, and pretty soon every bandit and his grandma are sporting supposedly super rare glass armor, to the point that it quickly become pointless to pick up.  Not so in Morrowind.  If you want the best gear, finding it in the first place may become a quest in and of itself.

Just Realized that I Quit Numbering my Points - Diseases are terrifying in Morrowind.  Sure you can get rockjoint just as you can in Oblivion and Skyrim, but on Vvardenfell, this is just a lowly common disease.  Adventurers also have to worry about the much more deadly and difficult to cure blight diseases, and the incurable ""Corpus"" disease that turns honest folk into undead abominations haunts everyone's darkest nightmares.  That vampires and werewolves lurk in the hills is just a given.

10 or something - There is precious little mollycoddling in Morrowind.  Frankly, there are many quests that you simply can't handle at low levels.  Later titles scale a lot with your level to basically make it safe for you to go anywhere, but carelessness will quickly get you an early grave in this Bethesda title.  If you hear that there are Golden Saints guarding a daedric shrine, you'd better D*MN sure you're ready before you go skipping in that hellhole.

Anyway, I'm tired of typing.  There's a ton more redeeming qualities that can make this the crown jewel of your collection, but honestly, aren't you sick of reading when you could be adventuring?  Quit stalling n'wah!  Don your ringmail, pick up your spear, and seek out the nearest silt strider.  Join the throngs of desparate souls who seek to still the howling winds of the blight storms, heal the rift between shattered factions, and maybe even bring back a measure of sanity to their own increasingly compelling nightmares.

Morrowind will be unforgiving to new players who don't know entirely what's going on, and there's some things that should've been adjusted, but there's plenty to love.

One thing is the environment, some may take issue with the fact that it's so unique and that there's no typical fantasy environment in it, but in the end, that's what every other elder scrolls game takes care of. There is plenty of depth to the story, and lore included in this game alone, and its many quirks may discourage some, but learning to love them will lead to hours of time lost playing this game. 

However, I do not find it to be without flaw, you absolutely need to know what your build will be before you even make it, which will hit first-time comers the hardest, because they probably won't know the difference between long blade and short blade, they don't care about mysticism, they just want a cool story, and a fun game, and there's nothing wrong with that. The whole chance-to-hit system may work for some (I just deal with it whilst playing), but it certainly makes early game harder, and your fatigue lowering chance-to-hit with the lower it is can hurt hard when you're travelling across Vvardenfell. Another thing is that there's no quest markers, you'll have to remember directions, or look a lot of things up. I also want to say that not every location has a spot on the map, so you'll need to be available to go around a lot.

In the end, the story, environment, and absolute immersion make this game amazing, it's just playing it that hurts. However, for every mechanic you don't like, there's three mods that fix it, and the same probably goes for story.

It was early 2004...I had just taken a permanent lunch break from my crappy job, I was living with a slob of a roommate, we ate ramen, I was using a credit card to get by and I was bummed out. I heard about Morrowind from a friend, who sold me when he said ""It's kinda like GTA in a fantasy setting"" (he was so dumb), I bought it used for about 10 bucks that day, popped it in my Xbox as soon as I got home and began my journey...

The addiction took hold immediately, ""fuck the job search"" I said to myself, as I also skipped some showers and meals. My routine was as follows: Wake up at about noon, play Morrowind for about 14 hours, sleep, repeat, with a few quick breaks in between of course. I was hooked.   

Morrowind amazed me to say the least and took me away from the BS that was life. Sure, some could say I was a ""loser"" during those 2 months but I didn't care and I don't regret it one bit, Morrowind was the greatest experience I've ever had with any form of art or media. It took 3 long years before I found near the level of enjoyment from a video game-(there was Fable in late 04 but it was short lived)-that I had in Morrowind, which was Runescape (believe it or not), but nothing has came close to the love I had for Morrowind. 

I persevered through the game freezes (losing hours of game play), starting over with different characters because I couldn't make up my mind which race I wanted to be, playing entirely in the 3rd person view, and that huge and incredibly annoyingly hard to navigate city (Vivec) while the characters, the level progression system (the sense of getting better with every step), the huge open world, the graphics (often moving the camera towards the sky at ingame night to look at the stars),.and the incredible music, sucked me in. 

The possibilities seemed endless with this game, as I could do whatever I wanted (ohhh shiny! I'll take that!) and there were surprises around every corner...I'm just casually walking along and all of a sudden someone falls from the sky and plops on the ground, ""what the hell just happened?"", I search their body, find a journal, then find out that now deceased character has a bit of back story as to why they ended up falling from the sky. Later, I jump up-(no climbing in Elder Scrolls!)-a mountain only to find a lone orc on top wearing badass armor I so desperatly want to have. ""Can I take him?"" was the question I was asking myself. It was these types of discoveries that made Morrowind so different.   

Most of the time I would ignore the quests and just roam the world to see who or what would pop up. Silt Striders were for ""wussies"", I thought, as I spent hours traveling the land on foot, making sure to occasionally jump or swim to level those acrobat and athletic skills. Often I was ever so swiftly r a p e d by a blighted Cliff Racer.      

Something this fun had to eventually come to an end, I couldn't stay in Morrowind forever.

After 2 months, the journey...was finally over...It happened on a Friday night...I finally decided to go out with a few friends, after they begged and had somewhat of an intervention for me. I finally became unglued from the game for a few hours. I ended up having an awesome night, hung out with friends I considered brothers, met a pretty chick, and it was then I realized living in the real world wasn't so bad and that it was time to make it better for myself.

It's almost as if Morrowind played a part in my transition into full blown adulthood, something I didn't want to face yet, even though I was of age. It was time to let go of the carefree days of being a kid with little responsibility. Morrowind was the grand finale.

The rest is history. I got a new crappy job a few days later, moved soon after (minus the slob roommate), and began dating the girl I met that night. I revisited Morrowind about 4 years later (PC physical copy) and sunk another 80 hours into it, but it didn't hold me as it did before, so that was it, I was done, I walked away never beating the game. It felt like it already served it's purpose back in ""04"".

Although sometimes I deeply miss the characters (Fargoth), the world, the music, and 2004, I can say that I am, for the most part, done with the game, a closed chapter of my life, but I'll always have extremely fond memories of Morrowind. I enjoyed Oblivion and am currently playing Skyrim SE & ESO, but they can't compare. Nothing can compare to Morrowind.

I look forward to Skywind and I watch the Morrowind store trailer once every few years for that nostalgic trip, and just hearing the main theme song damn near brings a tear to my eye. Like most people who have experienced a most joyous event, my time with Morrowind in ""04"" evokes pure happiness. 

Even if it meant that my character's end game was to be deleted from existence after being brutally fisted by a lowly scamp (of all things), I would still relive those 2 months in a heart beat.

After typing all of this, I feel the urge to play it, but I'm spolied now with Skyrim's improved engine, and I know the experience can never be the same...2004, unemployed, young with my whole life ahead of me...Those days are long gone...but I'm thankful to have had such an incredible experience.",1482542686,1633065128,True,683,55,0.943289816379547119,67,True,False,False

But I was always curious about those other games out there and decided to slowly move back. And the one thing I've found is that the further back I go, the more and more I enjoy the games.

Morrowind feels special and alive in ways I never thought a game of its age could pull off. Yeah, its absolutely filled with flaws, but the world felt so alive and unique that I wanted nothing more than to fight past those flaws and master the game, flaws and all. It felt great to improve at the game and to figure out how to bend its weirdness and nuances to finally work in my favour. I actually bought this game originally on Xbox, but decided to rebuy it here on Steam because I heard the PC version is more stable.

Yes, it is. And boy am I happy I can finally experience Morrowind without the issues I had on the system I previously owned it on. If you're a fan of just Skyrim like I was, I wholly recommend Morrowind. This world is amazing and feels special in a unique way other Elder Scrolls games just can't quite reach.

Based on the information provided, can you guess what game this review is for? What's it about? What kind of game is it?

Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.

In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.

Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?

I'm still on my playthrough, just finished the main story and am now tackling the DLC. 

Now, what I will say is that I'll recommend this game PURELY for the magic alone. If you build your character well, you can literally become god. You can fly around, raining fire from above on your enemies. You can create your own spells, allowing you to damage enemies however you like, calm them to prevent them from attacking, command them, the list goes on. You can create nuke spells that cause an explosion of whatever spell you want in a maximum of a 50 feet radius. You can create Jump spells that allow you to jump super far and high. I've just scratched the surface of the magic system here.

Not only can you cast spells, you can enchant weapons, clothing (overpowered) and armour. You can create essentially rapid fire magic by enchanting rings with different spells and cycling through them. You can create constant effect spells and have your attributes go into the 100s. Your enchantments can let you run incredibly fast and jump incredibly far. Not only that, but alchemy is incredibly overpowered, allowing you to skyrocket your Intelligence into the tens of thousands, basically enabling infinite spellcasting. 

I don't have much to say on melee combat since I haven't exactly played as a melee character too much. Sorry.

I can comment on the story and the world itself though. I was never bored of the story or the lore of Elder Scrolls. It was really interesting throughout, and when I got to the final boss I was genuinely nervous. I like how the game doesn't end after defeating the main antagonist. The world changes and characters react to what you've done and the things that you've accomplished. 

I'm not a good reviewer by any stretch of the imagination. I've barely even covered anything with this review but I encourage you to buy this game if you're into role playing games. Its just fun. That's all I can say.",1599163542,1632254962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Check out the engine redesign for this game (the overhaul project).  It updates the game to the Skyrim engine and boy does it look great with those graphical upgrades!  They are also working to continually develop it.

Story:
☐ It's like all the crappy developers in the world got together and made one big pile of crap
☐ I'd rather eat worms than play this
☐ It is average
☐ Only thing missing is ""Capt Picard""
☑ Literally regarded as the best story of all the Elder Scrolls games made thus far

Music/Sound Effects:
☐ Consists of a water bottle, a drumstick (with no drum), and a fly buzzing in a jar
☐ The Walking Dead appreciate the sound effects and game
☐ It's okay, but nothing to write home about
☑ Ok, so maybe John Williams didn't write it, but it's still outstanding
☐ God Himself wrote the musical scores and effects

Graphics:
☑ See the Overhaul project that seeks to continually improve the graphics in the game.

Price:
☐ Save your money and buy a car
☐ Get a bicycle and then buy this game with the money you saved from buying the car
☑ Just get a job at McDonalds, work 2 hours, retire, and buy the game

Overall rating:  8/10.

Are they a savior, or a just a random adventurer? With a story that is inspired by Frank Herbert's Dune, this masterpiece of a game pokes fun of the idea of a hero of prophecy.

The world of the game is HUGE. Different factions compete for power on the island, so if you join a faction, it might make you hostile towards other factions. Each faction has it's own quest line. You can choose to join 1 of 3 Great Houses, and at the end of the quest for your chosen house, you can build your own Stronghold, complete with vendors and guards. And of course there is the main quest and a slew of side quests.

While the main quest ends abruptly, the story continues in the Tribunal expansion (which is included). And in case THAT wasn't enough content, there is the wintery island of Solstheim to explore in the Bloodmoon expansion.

The combat is an older-style of D&D dice rolling. At the start of the game, you are very weak and will struggle to hit rats. The world feels lived-in. Powerful enemies hide in dungeons, ruins and caves all across the land. And if you try and fight them too soon, they will stomp you. The world is filled with the corpses of adventurers like you.

I keep trying to give it second third fourth fifth tries, thinking if I go into it with a fresh mind and dumb down the difficulty it will be more enjoyable. It is not. Morrowind is a game that deserves nowhere near what little praise it gets. Short form of my complaints:

-Pickpocketing is insanely broken and too many early quests require some form of it.
-Combat is tedious with continuous missing since it is probability base not skill based. This is true even at full energy bars.
-Quest tracking in this game is a nightmare. The journal is disorganized and haphazard.
-Trying to find anyone or anything is a nightmare. Asking for directions to a place can get you lost when east really means north and a tiny bit east.
-Traveling anywhere is painfully slow. Even when sprinting which you don't want to do since it takes your stamina bar so if you get attacked you'll miss more than normal.

Basically this game is several good ideas executed in the worst possible manner. Even if you understand the flaws and mechanics of the game it is more of a chore than entertainment to work around.

I enjoyed it so much when I was younger, sitting with my original Xbox, when Halo 2 got boring, or nobody was online at 4 am. I have lived and breathed Vvardenfell, in many ways. Still to this day I have that intro memorized, and all of Sedya Neen's quests as well. I have fond memories of the things I've found, and I'm still finding things in game to this day, or exploring the odd cave I never did before to find relics and treasure... but the game is dated. It FEELS dated. It LOOKS dated.

Highly suggest if you DO play this, look up OpenMW, which updates the game's engine, and provides some modern functionality we are used to (like being able to delete saves actually inside the game, rather than opening up root folders), or toggle to sneak. It only allows Morrowind (that you already own) to play in a more updated fashion, and does not change any of the core mechanics. (It also takes a bit to customize.)

I say play it... especially if you have played it before. Get it for $5 and feel good about your younger years, or to understand where something like Skyrim started from. I'd also say understand that the mechanics (especially combat) are based on older ideas of dice roles to hit. You. Will. Miss. You will miss A LOT. 

If you have never played before, you are going to have useless skills. Combat is going to frustrate you if you just run at enemies expecting to be able to overpower them. You are going to have skills that accidentally over level you based on what they do, and how they work. You are going to find magic (especially if you are moving backwards from Skyim/Oblivion) to feel really bad at times, especially if your character build at level 1 didn't ""allow"" for magic. Early game is REALLY hard to get through. The ""meat and potatoes"" of the game doesn't really open up till, like, level 3-5, like, ya know, most dice dependent games (Pathfinder, D&D, etc), so try and keep that in mind when playing. Also keep in mind that you will EVENTUALLY feel like a god, and kill literal gods.

The story is very intriguing, but this game was made before fully voice acted NPCs. The good thing about this is you get a lot more lore, and dialogue is a lot more engaging. You can follow up on leads and keywords, and it most of the dialogue actually flows quite naturally, and manages to avoid lore-dumps. 
There are some quest lines that have messy conclusions, but they're all mostly quite interesting and fun.

The gameplay is super involved. Elder Scrolls has, through it's evolution, seemed to devolve into a hack and slash action game. This is not that, this is under-the-hood dice rolls, D&D mechanics. It makes it difficult in the beginning, especially if you're not familiar with D20 type games and systems, you'll be wondering why nothing seems to work ever. The payoff is that once you've levelled up your desired skills, you pretty much become a demigod. P.S. Don't ever neglect fatigue (which really should've been called stamina). 

At this stage, running this game with the original graphics, while mind-blowing for 2002, looks very dated. So follow Nexus Mods' Morrowind Graphics guide and you'll make this game look ten years younger. 

The sound effects are quite basic, and some, like the magic sound effects, are downright corny. But the music is spectacular. I haven't looked at this game since its release, and i didn't realise that all the loveliest pieces of music from Skyrim were actually written for Morrowind (probably i'll soon find out they were actually as old as Arena)

Bottom line, if you're an Elder Scrolls, RPG, or D20 enthusiast, definitely play this game at least once the whole way through. Morrowind transcends merely being a historically significant video game, it is still a barrel of fun. 

TRIBUNAL DLC:
Absolute trash. It takes all the worst things about the base and puts them on steroids. 

You are confined to one (albeit quite large) city and it's sewer system. Most of this game takes place in a cave, so it's very boring. Most of the above ground parts take place in one complex or another, and they're quite laberinthian. I don't know who wanted more places like Vivec, but that's what this is. So there goes the open world. 

The main quest is on rails, it feels like you have no agency, there's only one way to complete anything, and all the hard earned respect you've earned from single-handedly fixing Vvardenfell is irrelevant. So there goes the role playing. 

A lot of the new enemies are damage sponges. This is the most boring way to make a game more difficult. It sucks the fun out of fighting, it just takes so long to kill things. So there go the intricate battle mechanics. 

This is the Elder Scrolls DLC version of kicking a not-yet-dead horse to death.

BLOOD MOON DLC:
A refreshing return to what Morrowind does best. Wide open expanses and being pestered to death by cannon-fodder critters. You've got a main quest, and a long subquest, both of which are branching, both of which are fun and have exciting story lines. There's also some lovely new music.

The only downside i can see in this expansion is that a lot of enemies are still bullet-sponges. This is wholly unnecessary as the they already pose new challenges with their differing fighting styles.",1617792672,1630332250,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I want to point out that I am not biased by nostalgia since I played morrowind for the first time only last year and after playing skyrim. I just genuinely love this game despite all the rough edges. 
It may be hard to get into at first (the first 5 to 10 hours are a real pain) but after you get used to it and you understand the different mecanics it feels very good, it's really not that hard once you overcome the first few difficulty spikes.
I definitely recommend playing it for fans of the series just because it has such a nice ambiance and Vvardenfel is a joy to explore!

Also I am running this with an RTX 3070 and 4k 120hz TV with freesync. It does a weird dimming flickering occasional artifact, gives me headaches. Not sure exactly what the cause is. My regular Asus ROG gaming monitor quit working so I can't test the difference.

The game graphics are potato, it's an old game but at the same time the mechanics are familiar if you played Skyrim before. Play it for the story, not the graphics. You will get bored otherwise if you're not excited to do a lot of reading.

I'm positive I've spent thousands of hours total on it, and I never get tired of it. It's very old now, of course, so there's lots of ""missing features"" that we take for granted nowadays. If you're new to the game, this can be off-putting. Things like very limited fast travel options, the fatigue system making you miss hits and fail spells, no compass markers, and vague journal entries. You also start the game incredibly weak, and the first enemy on the way to the first main quest location (veterans know who I mean) will murder you easily if you go there right away before leveling and gearing up. Hang in there though, seriously. Once you get past all of that and get used to the game's systems, it's such an incredible and extremely unique world to explore. There's about a million mods now if you want to improve the graphics or add features, but I prefer the original experience.

But what i warn new players is that you can't play it expecting it to be Skyrim, because it definitely is not. My review will be mainly going through the pros and cons, and slight comparison towards Skyrim.
General Gameplay:
Its hard. of course you can adjust the difficulty, but even when its set at medium, it can be so frustrating. Which i think is great. you start the game off with your character you're so weak. While at first it can be an extreme put off, it is so rewarding being able to one hit cliff racers. and you get to feel unique with your character also. its extremely difficult to level all your skills, without exploits or other methods that aren't playing the game normally. Whereas in Skyrim, you could master everything with a lot more ease, making you feel strong from the get go. When you decide to be a thief in Morrowind, you actually feel like your skills are more attributed towards that sort of build.
Combat:
Its ok, its very frustrating at times. Every attack is based off your fatigue, even magic, so when you run out, you start chugging potions or just spam until you hit. The enemies themselves are cool, not cliff racers, but they can get old quickly. but either way, it was nice to see such unique creatures. Fighting them can be annoying, but once you build up your agility, strength, whatever, it can be really empowering. but it can grow quite dulling after a while. 
Quests:
Quests aren't the strongest i admit. for roleplay, they're really good. when im in any guild, i actually feel like im participating in that guild. But a lot of them seem to go ""kill this person"", ""retrieve this"" or a mixture of the two. the main quest, to me, is the only quest that feel ""unique"". While each quest can be unique in some fashion, a loot of them seem to fall into the previously mentioned categories. But it is really fun to play them without quest markers, it makes yous feel more like an explorer, but a lot of the time, the information needed isnt enough to find the location. And a lot of quests conflict it seems. i had to fix a few where i killed a certain person i wasnt supposed to, or even opened a container and it stuffs something up. I know a lot can be fixed with the MCP, but i didn't play with it. this is a review of the raw game.
Guilds:
i actually feel that the guild system is better than skyrim's. Having to actually have my skills at a certain level before i could make an advancement was really fun, and it made me feel like i actually earned the position. The quests aren't that exciting. at some points they actually seem interesting, but they mostly feel tedious. But instead of being the ""chosen one of every guild"" that skyrim makes you, Morrowind makes you feel like a regular member of the guild, which feels really nice for roleplaying. In some cases, the game forces you to stick with a guild, rather than join two that conflict, (thieves guild and fighters guild for example), but this can be worked around
NPCs:
arent that good. A lot of them feel like copy and paste, with no real unique personality. of course this happens in a lot of Skyrim npcs also, but it seems a lot more in Morrowind. There seems to be a repeating male and female voice for each npc, and you only hear it while they idle, or see you. The lack of voice when talking is understandable, but not exactly enjoyable. And it seems that even with a high disposition, a lot of ""negative characters"" will make mean remarks towards you, but once you enter a conversation it become ""how's my favourite person on the planet doing?"". and even when you've met a character, they make remarks that they dont know you. but there are some great unique characters, like uncle crassius or Ahnassi. Also obtaining a high disposition is too easy, and ruins the fun of relation building i suppose.
Skills:
each skill requires 100 points to level up, until 100 without enchanted gear, or other bonuses. so a lot of skills that a while to level without exploits, but it has a nice feel, sometimes. there are a variety of skills which help for roleplaying, and make your character feel unique. Choosing a main and minor skill helps towards this also.
Magic:
I love spells in this game. you can only cast really good ones when youre truely a master wizard. it feels a lot better than skyrim. especially how you can create spells, its really cool. however, creating spells (good ones) requires a bit of  gold, and you need to ability to cast them. which is a bit frustrating especially when youre leveling a magic skills, but you keep failing your spells.
General game mechanics:
everything works from either your fatigue or luck, and its quite frustrating. even if its more realistic, you have 3 oppotunities to fail a pickpocket. lockpicking, pickpocketing, and other skills seem to work heavily on luck, which is a bitch to level up. i can't say these mechanics are better than skyrim ones, pickpocketing is really similar to skyrims i guess, but i prefer lockpicking. sneaking is fine, i suppose, but i never felt any desire to sneak through a dungeon. enchanting and spellmaking early game arent that fun, but further on they become more worthwhile. Becoming op isnt that hard, i admit. some quests just give you some really good gear really quickly. or just finding it isnt too hard. talking with npcs is uncomfortable, especially when you have like 50 topics, and you dont even know if they have the one youre looking for. its quite messy. the journal log is fun to see this stuff added, but the way quests are situated aren't that neat, it takes you probably an hour before you realised youve just picked up a quest. the topics help, buuut they dont always include the information you want. looking for someone? asking everyone for their name, but they dont have it? too bad then. 
Conclusion:
Morrowind is definitely a development from Arena and Daggerfall. It is a really good roleplaying game. in terms of role playing, its 100x better than skyrim. but i don't exactly feel the same satisfaction from completing quests that i do in Skyrim. it doesnt exactly feel ""fleshed out"". i dont know how to explain it better. The graphics are from early 2000s, so i dont think theyre necessary to mention. However, it does feel like an elder scrolls game, with better aspects than skyrim. But in total, i feel Morrowind is better for role playing, and skyrim for story telling. I do recommend that you try it out. Downloading a couple of mods like MCP is worthwhile to enjoy less bugs. and try not to intimidated by the morrowind cult, yes you're allowed to enjoy skyrim, oblivion, whatever more than Morrowind. i prefer Skyrim, but i can definitely tell why people love this game. And i hope that many give it a try.

0 skill (5 skill) takes decades in real life time to get good - no seriously
it is kind of based on a D&D system with that THAC0 bull shit. 
if you have low skills, the only way to train it, decently is to buy skills off expensive trainers.
if you attempt to train it by exploring. it will take at least 10 years of gaming time.
why ? because when you try to attack anything at all, it runs a chance game, if you win, you hit, after taking into considerations a shit tons of stuff. level 5 marksman vs a scrib = 1 hour of play time good luck....
the fk up part is because you NEED to make a hit + dmg maybe to get progress in the skill. 
0 skill = no chance to hit = no chance to gain progress. 
this is like have a baby try to scrap your skin off at close combat range and even your baby CAN AND WILL do damage to your skin after a while. IN THIS GAME. 1 in maybe 200 arrows will hit. 1 in maybe 200 swings of your weapon will hit. forget this game. try skyrim instead.

For many, Morrowind is THE game. But why is that? As someone who grew up on Oblivion, I never saw the appeal of the strange and sometimes archaic mechanics of Morrowind. That was until around 2015. 

Ah, 2015: Witcher 3 is dominating the review boards, Bloodborne has elevated From Soft to new heights and you’re in college unsure of what you’re doing with your life. (Maybe that last one was just me) Regardless, dead center in that ""it isn't possibly going to take 10 years for another Elder Scrolls is it?"" I found myself hungry for that ‘Elder Scrolls Experience.’ Having cut my teeth on Oblivion and Skyrim, Morrowind seemed...different. But I wanted different, so I gave it my honest try.

 It was a much harsher game than my modern mind was accustomed to. Filled with a lot more reading, less direction, and generally less hand holding than I had ever anticipated. I vaguely remember that first play through at all, but I can say that I remember leaving it torn. On the one hand I had genuinely enjoyed my time—though admittedly I missed huge swaths of content—but on the other the game didn't quite ""do it"" for me. Why that is, I couldn’t quite say. Maybe it was the lack of voice acting or the weird animations. Regardless, I went back to Skyrim and continued to do so every few years whenever I needed that Elder itch scratched. Oddly enough I've never gone back to Oblivion, but that's a story for another time. 

Fast forward to 2021. I'm in a lull between moving and finding work and need something to occupy my time. I go back to old reliable, Skyrim, only this time it's different. It all feels...shallow. This was strange. Granted, it had been roughly 2 years since I had last played the game and I had played MANY wonderful titles in that span. But still, I was confused. How could Skyrim feel this way? It seemed that no matter how many mods I installed I still wasn’t feeling ‘it.’ I was distraught, until I began looking online to find I wasn’t the only one who felt this way. 

Now you can call it maturity. Your mind hits 30 and suddenly the things you used to like don’t quite feel the same anymore. This isn’t true for everything but as I replayed Skyrim this year, I realized something. Skyrim, as an RPG, is one of the most barren experiences you can have. While a beautiful sandbox and playground, Skyrim doesn't give one the FEEL of an RPG. It doesn’t FEEL like anything you do matters. Nothing is really earned, and the world feels far too static for all the monumental changes you supposedly make to it. The story is shallow and the most memorable character, Ulfric, is an antagonistic racist with a tragic backstory. This is cool, but why is he the only one worth mentioning outside, maybe, Paarthunax? Where are the deep interesting characters? The engrossing story? I craved these most of all. I craved choices like those in Dragon Age Origins or Fallout New Vegas. (Although admittedly you won't find those in a Bethesda game outside of mods). Even still, I wanted to feel that what I was doing in the world mattered, but how?

Enter Morrowind. Remember it? That game with 20 years of tweaks, mods, and graphical enhancers to allow even a noob to the series an honest shot of enjoying it. Despite my initial reservations, I followed a few tutorials, watched a dozen videos, and booted up the world. To my amazement, I was in love. Almost instantly all those problems I had with Skryim were rectified. Instead of shallow quests I had deep pools of factions just waiting to be explored. All with deep lore and interconnectivity. The Great Houses ALONE are better than the entirety of Skyrim’s faction pool. Master Aryon, Uncle Crassus, and Arthyn Sarethi are each memorable in their own right but what about Divath Fyr or Vivec? The Last Dwemer or the re-awakened Dagoth Ur himself. Morrowind, if anything, has the best main story in the series. It’s worth it for those things alone. The game boasts over 10 factions and a main quest that  doesn’t force itself on you but instead rewards you for playing it. While there are tedious bits, by the end of it you genuinely feel like the reincarnation of an old hero. Countless dungeons, quests, and people to see and talk to along the way. The culture of Vvardenfell unfolding before you. 

That’s what it’s all about really. The world. The world FEELs like something. It feels alien. Fresh despite its age. Couple this with mod projects like Tamriel Rebuilt of Skyrim: Home of the Nords, and it can be an almost overwhelming amount of content. Something comparable only to the Mount and Blade community (which I am also a huge fan and member of). As someone who has played games since 1996, Morrowind has immediately vaulted itself to the top of my 'Greatest of All Time' lists, something I never expected to happen. But how is this possible? Honestly, I’m not 100% sure.

Morrowind is not a perfect game, no matter the lore, story, tweaks, and bug fixes. There are CTD’s, graphical glitches, and quest chain breaking bugs.  Couple that with one of the worst combat systems in 'modern' gaming (which relies on dice throws that the game never even bothers explaining to you) and you have a recipe for unhappy gamers. Those who can look past the jank, will have a good time. As a veteran of games like Stalker, Cossacks and Mount and Blade, I am well familiar with these concepts. Those who are more accustomed to streamline/polished experiences may have a harder time. I’m not saying your miles won’t vary. In my most recent playthrough I had 3 crashes in roughly 70 hours. Not bad. A couple quest bugs but nothing console commands couldn’t fix. But it’s important to be aware of these things going into it. Remember: F5 is your friend. Use it often. 

I’m not really sure where this review was going, or where it went. Hopefully it gives you motivation to give Morrowind a try. If it steered you away, well, at least you were informed. I can’t promise a constant smooth experience. This is a Bethesda game after all. But I can promise that if you can accept the learning curve and walls of text then you will be welcomed by a wholly unique and fun experience. They really don’t make games like this anymore, and that includes Bethesda. Many of the people who worked on this game haven’t worked at Bethesda in years and once you play through Morrowind it’ll become all too apparent. Do yourself a favor and give it a go. It really is a relic of days gone. A reminder of what the series could have been and, in some ways, the first in a long line of modern 3D RPGs. A Classic worthy of it's laurels and its criticisms. 

But I’ve talked long enough. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a scroll of Icarian flight with my name on it. *phwnnnnn* HRNNNNNNGHHHHH! AHHHHGHHHH! *crack*

*Fatigue! Fatigue in morrowind is more than just stamina, it effects your chance to attack, so don't make a fatigue and agility low build, because, like my first character, you'll find you can't even hit a rat.
*Another Important thing is Speed, as it literally controls the speed your character walks and runs at. I recommend having athletics being a minor skill, because it will both increase how long you can run, and, as it levels up, it will increase the amount at which your speed can be increased when you level up. When levelling up you can only increase 3 attributes, (like speed, strength, intelligence), and the amount you can increase them depends on how many skills that are governed by the attribute you increase. Sounds complicated, and the maths probably is, but once you start playing, it just means if you want to increase your strength, try using an axe, if you want to increase your endurance, try a spear (it tells you which skill is connected to which attribute in game).
*Before you mess with files, it is generally important to start the game first, maybe even make a character and see what the instantly noticeable issues are (at the normal resolution the game is off the screen for me, I still haven't used any mods, I just change the resolution).
*If the settings are reset after you reopen the game, you'll need to set the games .exe files to run in admin mode, this is done by: going to your morrowind folder and for both Morrowind.exe and Morrowind Launcher.exe, right clicking, going to properties, then the Compatibility tab, then ticking ""Run this program as an administrator"".
Once you've made it so your settings are saved, you can edit the controls to make it more like more recent games if you want (E is use, space is jump, so on), but generally the controls are pretty standard.
*If you open the game and in game nothing works but the mouse, but when tabbing out the keyboard still works, you just need to restart the computer, and you should be fine (its annoying, but there's nothing else you can do, as far as I know)

I hope these tips help! I'm still quite new to the game and I found getting it working quite annoying, but getting through that was worth it. That being said, I likely got some things wrong so I recommend watching a few videos and reading a few guides, and I'll allow comments for when someone with 10k+ hours sees these and goes ""god, that is awful advice"".

That was one of the first sentences I read when I played Morrowind for the first time several years ago. It was my first real exposure to the Elder Scrolls series (I had played the Daggerfall demo a long time ago but didn't have the chance to play the full version further at the time). I remember the feeling of awe, the sensation of freedom and perfect worldbuilding present in the game and the way its music, plot, characters and land hooked me in.

Morrowind is the third game in the main (numbered) series and in my opinion the best, but some of its gameplay aspects will be more difficult to be accepted by the modern audience of Skyrim and Witcher 3. Its combat is much closer to RPG rules, requiring die rolls to hit instead of always hitting - and the same for blocking. Magic is extremely slow but powerful if one has the time to prepare and the game can be easily broken if the player knows where to invest the character's build.

Whereas Oblivion had the standard fantasy land and Skyrim the nordic pastiche, Morrowind was something else entirely. Its peoples and cultures were and still are unique and none today have come close to building such an alien world in a mainstream open world RPG.

There are community-made add-ons called mods that greatly expand Morrowind for the returning player that wants something new or the new player that wants a more modernized experience (look it up) or play it vanilla as it should be, at least the first time around.

I played an enormous amount of games since finishing it a long time ago and have restarted it again and let me tell you, it still sits among the top pretty comfortably.

Interestingly, there is a reverse-engineered open-source port of the game done by fans that apply modern functionalities to the binary with minimal hassle (widescreen, filters, stability) called OpenMW. Be sure to check it out, but refer to its mod compatibility if you want to use any.

As a Bethsoft game, you should be fully aware that it is armed to the hilt with stupid glitches. But if you can get past those (or mod the majority of them out) and survive the outdated graphics, you will find some of the best lore and video game storytelling of all times.

Pros: STORY, Story, and story (and lore); Many spells, including the ability to levitate and make your own spells; Many quests and ways to define your playstyle.

Cons: Glitches; Graphics (they really haven't held up well); character customization (appearance wise);

Neutral: There is no fast travel, and there is no map with markers showing you where you are supposed to go. These are standard staples in today's massive world games, but I am not calling it a con, because it was part of the way it was meant to be played. I also am not calling it a pro, because I know not everyone will be happy about it.

At the end of the day, I strongly suggest a play through of Morrowind, especially if you enjoy its younger siblings Oblivion and Skyrim. It tells a better story than both of them combined, and sets the stages for a lot of what you see in the 2 games by fleshing out Nirn.",1628265510,1628265510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Yes, you do have to mod it a bit for it to have a coat of paint that looks at least on par with Oblivion, but it's very easy to mod. Just get MGE XE, the code patch, script extender, and then whatever mesh and texture mods you want. It's well worth it. The story feels like it was done with much love and care, while the game still has all of it's Bethesda-y, Scrolls-y charms. Not quite as silly as Oblivion, but still loving it. The first hour or two is going to make you feel like disintegrating from the difficulty curve, but once you're past that it's very good! Glad to see the specifically-tailored custom classes as well, that's something I really liked in Oblivion that I didn't realize I missed when I had played Skyrim as my first Scrolls game. You can even put a description for your class! It may seem just like a small thing, but little lore and roleplay details like that really make this more of an RPG.

Both of us were really into the Elder Scrolls and RPGs in general and we were talking for a few hours when she suggested that I come over to her house one day. I agreed and we set a date and time that weekend.
When I showed up to her house, her parents weren’t home and she answered the door in her swimsuit, which I thought was weird because she didn’t have a pool. I asked her why she was in a swimsuit to which she responded that she just felt like trying it on. “Okay.” I thought. So I went up to her room and pulled out my laptop, then proceeded to show her my Morrowind character for the next hour or so and tried to sell her on how great the game was.

the problems

morrowind isn't a ""hold you hand"" game much. as soon as you get into morrowind your on your own. there is a guide at the start but its a small one and once your outside its ""make your own way"" deal. should also point out that there's no waypoint markers so you have to use directions and talk to npcs who know the way and use the map.

speaking of there's no fast travel in this game so there's a LOT of walking. you can make an alternative with strider's and intervention scrolls but be prepared to still walk a lot.

the only other thing i can think of is the combat. combat with weapons uses a dice roll mechanic so be prepared to miss a lot. there are ways to reduce it but it will always be there so prepare for fights carefully.

if there's more ill put them here otherwise its still a great game and worth playing. especially if your an elder scrolls fan.",1627191017,1627191017,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay takes some adjusting to if you're used to Skyrim or Oblivion but it's worth it meeting the author of The Lusty Argonian Maid in the flesh (and being forced to strip for him as part of a quest), flying through all space and time with the Boots of Blinding Speed (and walking at an absolute snail's pace without them), and getting to interact with living gods (who may or may not have murdered you in a past life)",1626889828,1626889828,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Despite this, there are a lot of frustrating parts of the game that sour the experience terribly. The combat is infuriating and dreary rather than exciting and action packed. 

When you want to hit a target, you first have to aim, which makes sense. Whether you hit or miss is completely up to chance, even if you are completely on target. The amount of damage you do is also quite variable. The worst part is that there is no difference between the sound of you missing because you did not target the enemy properly and the sound of you missing because of chance. For the first couple of hours, I legitimately thought the game was broken. 

Even worse is the movement. I appreciate that their are limited ways to fast travel in this game, I think it is really cool. Walking on foot and exploring in Skyrim was an amazing experience. Walking around exploring in Morrowind is not an amazing experience. It is a slow, drudging, soul sucking experience. You move SO SLOW!!! Around 70% of my time in this game has probably been spent walking. The game does offer numerous fast travel options, but they are not available everywhere and you'll still need to walk at a snail's pace through dreary, generic wasteland to get to the next adventure.

This game has a lot of good things about it. It can be legitimately beautiful at times and the story is interesting and gripping. It has gotten me invested almost two decades after its release. The game really shows its age though.

As for whether or not I’d recommend it, I’d recommend playing Oblivion or Skyrim, but not Morrowind.

If you’re ok having to navigate everywhere manually, and have attacks miss even though you physically hit the enemy, and don’t mind the occasional technical difficulty given the game’s age (first time playing I got stuck in a wall in less than a minute of being given control of my character), then maybe this is for you, but I couldn’t get myself fully engaged and feel that Oblivion and Skyrim have a lot more general appeal to offer.",1626742104,1626742104,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

-Okay-ish story. Characters are believable in their motives. 

- combat is arguably better than the newer installments. (It's like rolling in real-time)

-Magic is FUN. 

-Really good UI that let's you see all your status without clicking 20 menus. 

-Vvardenfell has multiple biomes to explore. 

-Cons     

Traveling sucks! Even late game speed and spells makes it boring that you have to go through the same empty areas full of Cliff Racers. Major cities are a maze. I don't know what happened here, but the starting area and the towns near it are so much better that the major ones. Even the NPCs joke that they get lost in them, it's not fun to go back and forth to do fetch quests when 90% of your time spent on the quests is traveling.  

-Directions suck, a NPC will tell you to go North, you go there and search for an hour and find nothing. This doesn't happen once, even the game's WIKI says the directions are wrong in-game.

-Guilds don't immediately make you leader when they meet you (*cough* Skyrim *cough*) and you actually have to rank up in them, too bad they're also 90% fetch quests till something fun happens. 

-Main story is ""okay-ish"" like I said, the thing why it's also in cons is it forces you to do what the game wants. Like you have the option to kill a character but you fail the entire main questline and there's no point in playing. If you persuade main quest characters they still force you to do their errands (unlike side quests).  

-DLC's were boooooring. (And even interfere with your game if it's your first time, since they drop super expensive items).    


-Nothing to spend money on, I ended my playthrough with 300k coins and never thought I wanted to go to a shop to upgrade, all my high level items were from just exploring. I stopped even looting late-game.  

Game becomes super easy after level 10, I can only think of 3 areas that were of any challenge late-game.  


Dungeons and shrines are copy-pasted (they have cool rewards in some of them, but it feels like a chore when you do them for the 50th time).

]Will my life end when the Last Sun rises tomorrow?
Only 9 Gods and the Empire know the answer to this question!

When I talk about Morrowind, I'm talking about the game that won my heart and gave me the love of the RPG genre!
I can say with confidence - after many 10-20 years of playing different RPGs - that Morrowind not only remained in my heart as a great and pure love, but also became the best RPG in the entire existence of this genre!


[h1]Plot:[/h1]
The success of a good RPG is storytelling! After all, the story that we see on the screen of our monitors, we read like a book, and because of how versatile and rich it will be, it will depend - whether we want to reread it again and again even after many years! I can really say that the plot of Morrowind is an amazing story that you will want to re-read many times and replay over and over again to find out all the possibilities, subtleties and trifles that we might not have noticed when we first read it - passing the game! Even after 15-20 years, we will remember the detective story, where we not only learned the secrets and arcana of this World and unraveled the tangle of intrigues, but also assumed the role of the savior of these Lands from the ancient cult and ancient Gods who wanted to destroy our World.

[h1]RPG system:[/h1]
Many games that call themselves RPG forget that this system must be quite large and to a certain extent difficult for the player, so that the study of this whole system is like learning mathematics from the multiplication table to matrices and other more level elements - algorithms that will add up to a single picture of the existence of this virtual world!
You will get the opportunity to make a character level 100, pump all skills to level 100, learn hundreds of new spells and abilities and create 1000 types of weapons, scrolls, potions, giving you the opportunity to create your own unique character leveling system and unique tactics of life and victory against evil!

I managed to get level 105 in one of my playthroughs, can you do the same? :)

[h1]Virtual world:[/h1]
I would like to separately note this wonderful romantic world in which you just want to live!
Even when you reach your maximum level in the game and complete all tasks: main and side quests.
There are very few games that have such a rich and saturated world, filled with many small details that fascinate you and imbue you with the magic that exists in our real world, but which we simply do not notice due to the fact that we rarely look at the stars above our heads!

[h1]Graphics:[/h1]
When the game appeared, I was very delighted with this graphics, which I saw on the screen of my 17-inch monitor, and then on the screen of the 19-inch monitor, which I bought a little later (when I played the game for the second time). Even when I ran this game on the formats of the new 28 inch 4K monitor, I saw the same beautiful picture that I saw many years ago! At the same time, I understand that these are graphics - the game does not give a widescreen resolution, since it is old, like good wine, but over the years it gets better and is filled with a large bouquet of flavors, notes of nostalgia for my soul!

[h1]Music:[/h1]
This game has amazing gentle music that will caress your ear throughout the entire gameplay!
Even when you're done playing this game, you'll want to download the album of this music and use it as a divine serenade before bed!
When you have children (or maybe they already have), then you will want to put this music as a lullaby for them, so that they can feel the taste of beautiful and high art from childhood!

[h1]Bugs:[/h1]
This is the saddest part of all that I wrote above, but I can't help but write about it!
Yes, there are many bugs in the game, it's pointless to describe all of them, but I want to say that some of them add more hardcore to the passing of the game!
As an example - my favorite bug - there is a destroyed Daedra statue that asks you to restore it, and in return you can get a unique Golden Sword, the most powerful sword in the game!
The whole point is that from the beginning of the game, a timer starts, and if you do not have time to accumulate 5.000 gold in the first 2 weeks and still get a couple of rare elements (and this is very difficult to do), and then start restoring this statue with the help of a master sculptor , then you just risk not getting this wonderful sword!
That is, if you play this game and do not do everything quickly enough in 2 weeks, then, of course, you can restore this statue, it will talk to you, but it will not give you this sword! This is just a bug that was made by the developers and which, most likely, cannot be fixed, probably after tens of years. And there are a lot of such bugs in the game. Studying every bug and every subtlety of the game mechanics gives you more hardcore in terms of passing the game than any difficulty level that you will increase in the game!
 This is the unique game in which bugs make the game not worse, but better many times over, and therefore it becomes one of the best RPGs for a real hardcore RPG gamer!

I recommend anyone playing on PC today use the Morrowind Graphics Extender to enable distant terrain. There are also some texture and mesh replacers out there that are quite close to vanilla but look much better. I think after all these years these graphical mods are kind of necessary.

You will have to overlook some old and clunky designs, you will have to understand that your to hit percentage is based on skills, not on physically connecting, and until you hit like mid-level with your weapon skills a lot of your attacks will miss.

But it's worth putting up with all for the freedom this game gives you. Freedom in how you explore, which quests you do, which factions you back, freedom of play style, freedom to make your own spells, enchant your own gear (and there's more of it here than any other Elder Scrolls game). It's a big, alien world that I really enjoyed exploring.
