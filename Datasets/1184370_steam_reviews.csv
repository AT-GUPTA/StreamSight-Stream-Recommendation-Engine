Party member gets dominated, kill the succubus that did it, still dominated, kill everything else, archer fighter kills last enemy with first shot, last 3 shots automatically go into the dominated witch with no way to stop it, -40 HP, dead. This is after directly casting a Protection from Evil on the dominated party member. It's supposed to give another save against any charm/compulsion on the target and also ward summoned outsiders. But they left out 2/3 of the Protection from Alignment Spells. The best 2/3. In a story hyper focused on Alignment. I guess they couldn't figure out how to make it work. 

On a random encounter while trying to sleep against 3 nothing enemies. 

Great AI. 

Great action interface.

Playing on Normal difficulty this time. Tried 'Tabletop' first time. They call it tabletop but they only paid attention to the parts of the books about building characters and monsters and dice mechanics and completely ignored the vast majority of the DMG about how to balance an adventuring day or making the game fun. They also disregard the existence of the entire school of Divination magic and the important part it plays in the tabletop. 

You don't scout or scry, you run in, die, then reload the save and buff accordingly then go in again. And hope one of your party members doesn't get dominated too close to your archer or they are gonna start eating arrows.

Got to level 11 or 13, only level 7 this time and I think I'm already done.

First three levels you're going against low level cultists. Except they all have class levels and scimitars with keen buffs. Give them NPC levels in Adept or Thug and clubs FFS. Not a bunch of build-guided, optimized crit fishers.

And, somehow, it only gets worse. By the time I was at the quitting point on my first run my martial were only hitting on rolls of 18+ with every buff I could muster while getting completely eviscerated in a single turn by whatever mini boss we found in some random hallway or cliff side. My Arcanist had full int dump, greater spell focus, arcane reservoir to boost DC, only lands spells if they roll a 1 on the save. Casting anything that allows SR and you might as well just be pressing the spacebar on that character. Ray spells have to hit, bypass SR, and they have to fail the save. You will go against enemies with SR higher than you can hit on a CL check with Improved Spell Pen, save bonus higher than your DC with Greater Focus so they only fail on a 1, and a Touch AC through the roof from massive Dex/Deflection bonuses. You have to get 2 nat 20's and they have to get a nat 1. Good luck hitting that 1 in 8000.

I love the broad range of customization you have for your character, especially being allowed to import custom character portraits, but I can't stand the limitations the game imposes on you. 

You get to pick a ""Mythic Path"" on top of your main class and it gives you some cool chosen destiny that can further enhance your story experience, but some of them are just so bare-bones compared to others, it's honestly incredibly frustrating. If you wanna play ""Devil"" or ""Golden Dragon"" you barely get anything, but then the game goes out of it's way to beg you to pick ""Angel"" or ""Demon"" which... why give us 12 options if you wanna just shoehorn us into the base 2?

The cast is pretty enjoyable, I rather love the banter between party members, though I find the romance options as bare bones as some mythic paths. You have so many cool party members and you're stuck choosing between dating either the most boring or the most psychotic. 

The crusade and the overworld was a really cool improvement from the last game, but these HoMM-like crusade battles were really underdeveloped and it makes me wonder why they're even there.

""Ambitious"" is a good keyword here. What's done right is done SO very right and other games could stand to learn from this team, but what's done wrong gets so bad it's made me rage quit several times before I ever manage to finish a run.

It's pretty good now. Most (if not all) of the technical stuff I complained about has been fixed. The other stuff has been worked on. It's still not a perfect game, but it's an ambitious game that definitely achieved what it set out to be.

* TLDR *
Not recommended in its current state due to pervasive amount of bugs unless you're a fan of the series/ruleset. Dialogue has illusion of choice, but in reality you will be railroaded to serve greater powers that you don't want to, irrelevant to mythic and dialogue choices. Use mods on the nexus if you still want to play and value your time to try and fix this half-broken game. Once the game is fixed it will be an OK game, in my opinion, but not good.

This game is like Kingmaker, its predecessor, in this regard: I want to enjoy this game, but the game tries very hard to make me not enjoy it.

Pretty buggy in its current state. Some mythic paths don't even get unlocked until basically the end of the game (GD), which shits on the RP in CRPG, while others are fleshed out from the start (Lich). Dialogue is mediocre in my opinion regarding your interactions with the main/companion characters, but the main story plot is pretty cool though. Gameplay is still spam grease/stinking cloud, buff the ever living shit out of your party, and steamroll through the fights with your martial classes, even on core. Unfair might be different, but why would you want to play unfair in the pathfinder ruleset.

The Pathfinder ruleset seems like it opens a lot of build diversity, but when you realize 80% of the subclasses are garbage, you still need the big buffs (Haste, Heroism, Size Modifiers, etc.), your party will basically look the same no matter the playthrough, baring some minor differences like swapping a rogue with a magus or doing AC dodge tank instead of STR shield tank.

Metagaming still encouraged, not explicitly, but if you don't know the mechanics of some abilities, which buffs you NEED, and how to counter certain enemies, you will get booty-blasted by the game, even on normal, and will need to google a bunch of shit in order to progress. I was already used to this from Kingmaker, but there is a BIG learning curve that you have to get over and some areas will blatantly be overtuned and harder than other areas just b/c. *cough* Blackwater *cough*

Crusader management and the minigame suck dick. The kingdom management was universally hated by the Kingmaker audience but it was brought back in lite version. Why? Did they listen to the 3.86% of people who liked it? It was fucking terrible. And the ""chess"" minigame is really just a timewaster. Gotta wait a week to get more units to get higher strength army to kill higher strength demon armies to get some shitty relic that you don't even know what it does and probably never will because you have to wait 5 days like 3 times to get an actual relic that you have no idea what it does until you get it. The minigame itself is boring too and devoid of any skillful decisions, just spam archers and shieldbearers with some hellknights/infantry and you're done. Thank god there's a mod to skip it. You also can't disband crusade armies, so you'll end up with so many that the list goes off the top of the screen.

Pretty unoptimized. Have a 2080 super, which is good for most game (not spending the money for a 30 series with the scalpers lmao) and it chugs in some areas, usually the population dense areas. In some of the later fights where you and the enemy are buffed to super-mega-giga mode, the game takes a hit too + you can't see shit because you have mirror image, displacement, and legendary proportions while most of the enemies have similar buff loadouts. They really should tone down some of the spell effects. The secret demodand area in the abyss was so bad. There were like 6-7 guys in a tiny house all with the aforementioned buffs just swinging wildly. Its times like those you realize how obnoxious some of the buff/spell effects are.

Poorly explained engine mechanics, like the how the camera position affects the Abyss city's floating islands/houses is either not explained at all or buried under text. Didn't even know until the very end of that chp. Interesting mechanic and makes the setting look cool and alien in theory, but just made the city that much more aggravating to explore in practice. Also made the city even more laggy than it currently was.

Despite all this, the game is still somewhat enjoyable. The story, while the dialogue can be utterly stupid and shoehorns you into doing one thing for all paths, has enjoyable and memorable moments and you can do some pretty interesting builds if you metagame and google OP natural weapon builds or w/e. But I feel like at this point I've just developed a sunk cost syndrome with this game and feel like I have to complete it since I'm lvl 17 and close to beating the game, but I don't even really want to play the game anymore.

* EDIT *
I respecced in chp1, and now I am unable to even pursue GD mythic b/c of a fundamentally game-breaking bug even though I went out of my way to do the side quests. Considering they only just put out the notice (I've been reading it can break saves the past few days but haven't paid them any mind), it's pretty unacceptable for a $50 to be this broken, not taking into account my disagreements with the writing in some areas.

BUGS:
[list]
[*]I was stuck on my mythic quest b/c the event didn't proc for ~5 hours of playtime in chp3, which locks you from progressing the main quest.
[*] Constant visual bugs with Aeon mythic path seeing glowing constellation around invisible NPCs.
[*] Quests fail on chp advance even though they aren't marked for failure (Sosiel companion quest).
[*] Quests either fail or don't complete so your forced to continue without receiving rewards (Storm Peaks, Attack out of Nowhere)
[*] A few visual bugs that are completely game breaking (Grass objects floating and lighting being incredibly jank) in some maps.
[*] Dimension door bugs out in the abyss city on some platforms and teleports you to a completely different part of the map.
[*] Can't skip some skeletal merchant random events. Infuriating when you're traveling to do the puzzle quests.
[*] Random crashes. Had 2-3, can't remember, during 60 hours of playtime.
[*] Some cut scene animations will play on repeat that often have sounds attached to them, causing you to go insane from the loud ass noises on repeat until you re-load the area. (Vellexia final event)
[*] Can't loot the extra weapons off the mobs with more than two hands.
[*] Characters phasing through some of the map geography and buildings. Saw most of it in chp1.
[*] Campfire dialogue doesn't even play most of the time.
[*] Leveling up my mythic path crashes my game with the new update. (9/14)
[*] Respeccing, something that is free, easy, and accesible, irreversibly corrupts your save.
[*] Some bloodline paths (Bloodrager) don't give the correct passive buffs. (Natural armor AC)
[*] Lategame secret paths are straight up bugged and don't function correctly.
[*] PLENTY of other bugs that I simply couldn't remember due to the sheer number of them. Game loses polish HARD starting in chp3.

+highly customizeable characters, from race to class to stats etc.  
+You can dual wield.  Yes, even torches.
+Good amount of weapon variety.  Spears and throwable spears i dont see often.  Both can be dual wield as well :D
+can switch between turn-based and real time.


Cons:
-Not as interesting characters I've seen like in DSO1/2 and BG3.
-Story could possibly be meh

Neutral:
*Instead of open, seamless world, you gt a table top overworld aesthetic.  To me it's no  problem, but could be a turn off for some.
*Just as fun as any crpgs in terms of combat.

Im not gonna review this base on story as I am more heavily leaning towards the core gameplay.  Honestly I dont bother reading reviews on story as its pretty much based on their own experiences everywhere else too coz if you've seen alot of stories, the later ones will eventually become less interesting and could be influenced from that).

Obviously, still better than Starfield though.

Just a little FYI, the areas you can visit are ""exploreable"" but its not one seamless open world like BG3 or DOS1/2, its done with an overworld, table top aesthetic.  Personally, i dont mind these on certain games, so this is ideal for those that just wants to get into the ""action"" more quickly.  As your marker travels through the overworld, you will get random encounters (unless u turned if off) which is cool.  Its also cool the diffiuclty is highly customizable.

Overall I can recommend this to anyone that loves turn base games or those rpgs with RTS type controls because what's interesting about this game is you can switch between turn base ad realtime.  Though honestly, I recommend keeping turn based on until you get the grasp of the game and have a decent team, unless you are playing in an ""easy"" difficulty then it shouldnt matter, i just notice through my game play I have higher chance of winning if i stick to turn base.

In terms of characters, Ive seen  more interesting ones in other games, like Divinity Original SIn 1 + 2 and Blalduer's Gate 3, but definitely not any in Starfield.

I highly recommend it if you love tabletop rpgs, love team building, making random character builds, switchable turn base and RTS style combat controls and just doing the combat.",1708376530,1708376530,True,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Yep, 564 hours, and that was ONE (1) play-through, lol.  'Whew!'  You'll get your money's-worth out of this one.  Pathfinder, WOTR has a fantastic, rich story, amazing side and companion quests, diverse environments, and amazing sound quality and music.  The developers really took their time on this one.  You can tell there is love and care in this game.  This is a deep, mature game, and nothing is what it seems!  Beware, for enemies can be around any corner.  Maybe they turn into your ally; and maybe allies will turn into enemies...

There are options galore in this game, so no matter who you want to play as, how difficult or easy you want things to be, literally everything has been finely detailed down so that no matter your issue, there's probably an option for it.  If you're new to this game like I was, it will take you over an hour to even create your character; (no joke) that's how many options there are, and the different stats (basic, advanced, tertiary, etc.) you should brush up on will put even the most seasoned RPG fan to the test!  

There were only two things that were issues for me.  The first is there is A LOT of reading (kind of like my review, lol) with only some voice acting.  I would say on the ratio of 85:15 (reading vs. voice acting dialogue).  Of course, if it was fully voice acted, along with all the side quests, a single play-through would take over 1,000 hours, lol.  

The second issue is that it is a CRPG, (Classic), meaning the game is built around a turn-style combat interface and everything is designed around dice rolls.  Which is fine if you like that sort of thing, but it can slow things down.  For me, that is too slow of a game, but again, there is an option to change it to real-time, which was greatly appreciated.  You may have to lower the difficulty to make it more manageable, as you can only have 1 auto-cast per companion, but if you can handle some micro-management, you can do what I did and pause the game at any time to set up a strategy during the fight, seamlessly transitioning between turn-based and live-action, even in the middle of a battle.  

Overall, this was a fantastic game and with over 25 different classes, literally hundreds of sub-classes (yes, hundreds!), this game has a build for everyone!  You want to be good, go for it.  A neutral judge/jury/executioner, you're good to go.  Evil; no problem.  Chaos Evil?  Evil, yet Lawful?  What about a Necromancer Lich?  Or an all-consuming Swarm?  Will you choose to be a demi-god, or will you rise even above that to become a mortal Legend that even the Gods whisper about?  The choice is yours.  

But trust me, if you are new to this, try some youtube videos; they will definitely help!  Enjoy!  =D  ",1643920032,1708256324,True,0,0,0.475715845823287964,0,True,False,False

Gathers ALL information possible (including listening to you).

It's also coded in Unity. So it runs like constipation and looks like diarrhea.

If you understand the underlying system, they ignore CR, they add abilities that are way too strong.
Handing out inflict wounds without save in a ranged AOE doesn't make any sense. And they don't seem to adjust CR to account for it. That's just one example.

If you run it in windows, hit cancel when it asks to use the internet. This is a single player game. You should probably do that with any single player game.
To remove internet access if you've allowed it:
In windows, go to firewall settings, allow app or feature, find pathfinder, press remove.
When you launch, press cancel.
Next, go to advanced settings, outbound rules, new rule, and add a new rule for a program, browse to wrath.exe (you can look this up in steams local files), then next on all the remaining steps.
Or just don't play anymore. Because they have proven they aren't just going to take a little data, they are going to do everything including listening to what you say while you the game is running. They will do anything they can get away with.
And yes, they are based out of a country that is currently at war.

Doesn't solve the fact that this is coded in unity or that owlcat games is shit. But good luck friends.

Almost two years after the release they've updated their EULA and decided to add tracking (""for advertisement purposes"") without an in-game option to opt-out of it, and this is what their delusional out of touch developers had to say about it on the Steam forums:

   [i]""It's an industry standard for the games, all of the mobile games use it and a lot of PC and PS/XBOX too.""
   ""It is not big deal :)""[/i]

Regardless of whether they've removed it already or not after the initial backlash (though AFAIK it has more to do with it being basically illegal in EU rather than their customers' concerns), or what data they've been collecting, they've already shown their true colours and that they don't deserve your money.

As for the game itself, only get it on sale and only if you enjoy reading excel spreadsheets and pre-buffing before every filler fight. Same goes for the first game.

I will say Owlcat does a TERRIBLE job with character customization and reusing those already terrible options. They have used the same hairstyles/faces/bodytypes etc in Kingmaker, Wrath of the Righteous, and now even Warhammer Roguetrader which is by far the funniest part. You'd think they'd put more effort because it's a big license lmao. 

One part of the game that is kinda lame is that end-game builds on higher difficulties had to practically revolve around the same Attack of Opportunity cheese or else you can't really play them. It has a scuffed turn based system in this game tbh. But if you prefer RTwP or can get past the scuffed turn based system, it's very fun. 

The story grabbed me and kept me glued and the characters felt fun to get to know. I sincerely hope the next pathfinder game they come up with can be just as fun if they decide not to adopt some sort of ascension system like this one has. That felt like what made this game fun and unique for combat.

That being said, I can't say I can recommend this to everyone. As many other reviews have stated the buffing before every fight is absolutely terrible. I would highly recommend installing mods that will take care of the process for you. and the puzzles are just as bad. Both of those on top of the game being incredibly vague in a lot of areas. (companion story progression is a huge offender in this regard.) I have had to stop my game play on multiple occasions to look up walkthroughs because Pathfinder WotR has a major case of Wiki dependency. Also Crusade managment made me want to put a bullet through my skull due to the tedium and boredom it cause me, but you can skip it in the difficulty settings.

Character customization on the other hand  is top-notch if the initial overload of choices and reading doesnt put you off of it. Pushing through that first wall is well worth it if role-playing different character archetypes is something you really like to do. At the time of this review, I have just completed my first full playthrough at just shy of 100 hours and I cant help myself from starting up a new character to see what other choices I could make.

First credentials, I got to play CRPGs since Baldur’s Gate 1 when I thought it was a Diablo-like game from the screenshots, the year was 1999, and pretty much never stopped enjoying similar games ever since. Anything isometric with numbers, stats, inventories and groups tickles my childhood nostalgia, I also love the meta-game: give me an excel sheet with the numbers and a text for the story my enjoyment will not significantly reduced. 

So, I am admitting I am being subjective here, but still, this is a damn good game. The excel sheet part is pretty much is handled to perfection. Numbers, descriptions, items, skills etc. you may ‘play’ this part of the game and get some enjoyment without ever moving your character. May sound tedious, but optimizing my build(s) is pretty much what fuels the sense of progress. Pathfinder system is an improved version of arguably the best DnD system is ever created, and this game nails the transfer of this system to computer game format. Yes, buffing your party constantly can get tedious, yes on higher difficulties a bad dice roll means reloading a previous save, but I wouldn't have it any other way. 

The story, if you are like me who played almost all Black Isle/BioWare like games (multiple times) is not unique and frequently references to these games from the past in a very -- I would call -- tasteful fashion: it is never like Marvel-Disney memberberries, when I see a succubus ‘fell’ from demonhood I think of Fall-From-Grace, hence I instantly recognize the pattern and love every refined alteration made to the archetype. The writing is never ‘big-boy wanna-be writing’ as in Pillars of Eternity 2, but not concise as Planescape: Torment. The overall story is a conversion of a Pathfinder tabletop game module thus nothing to write home about, but smaller scale stories where the writers have agency are much fun to follow. Translating a kitchen sink setting like Pathfinder where dinosaurs, vampires, robots and elves exist into a computer game in a somewhat believable fashion is a tremendous task and the developers pulled it off with aplomb. 

Criticism! The game was released a in rough state, as a veteran of their previous game I unfortunately had the foresight to not to touch it until it received a year’s worth of update, but still there were/are still bugs out there, much less than Kingmaker but still. The Crusade management game is tedious and the developers know it, the entire system can be skipped or reduced to ‘story’ independent from the main game’s difficulty: hence my question, if it is a universally despised part of the game even the developers hated making why have it in the first place? Just allocate your resources to other parts of the game to get the polish you direly need.  

The bottom line! This is probably the best game out there for me, but get it with both eyes open, it is a commitment to enjoy it.

SAVE SCUM!

In a tabletop RPG, players cannot save and reload, but they can in a video game, and it seems as though Owlcat took this to mean that their game ought to revolve ENTIRELY around saving and reloading.

Consider the following: one of the very first encounters in the game is against a Monitor Lizard, whose melee attacks can inflict the poisoned status effect, which in turn results in ability score drain. Since your party will be at level 1 at this point, they have no ability to protect themselves from this effect, and unless the player character is an Angelkin Aasimar, they will have no ability to remedy the ability score drain aside from just waiting it out. So if one of your characters ends up getting poisoned, what is the player going to do? Just suck it up and deal with a stat drain they can't easily remedy, or simply reload and redo the encounter?

And that's just the beginning. Wrath of the Righteous has to hold the record for the RPG with the most amount of enemies that do either ability score drain or level drain. At least the Infinity Engine RPGs had the good sense to limit level-draining enemies to a few specific encounters.

Much of this game is little more than a linear series of ""Gotchas!"" Your party will walk through a door or enter a portal, only to immediately be thrust into battle against an enemy. Said enemy will usually win the initiative roll, allowing it to go first and use some obscenely powerful ability to cripple your party. So you reload your last save, cast the required buffing spells, and then redo the encounter, where you'll triumph handily.

An example: in the Lost Chapel, the player might stumble across a Gargoyle Chieftain, who will open combat by casting the spell ""Blasphemy,"" which will almost certainly paralyze most (if not all) of your party. It's not lurking in a cave, or located somewhere that might indicate a tough battle ahead. It's just sitting out there in the open, ready for some hapless adventurers to stumble upon it. So you reload, cast whatever protective buffs you need to avoid paralysis, and then redo the fight. And in the same area, you'll also find yourself wandering along when all of a sudden a Nabasu will drop in out of nowhere and hit your entire party with level drain. So you reload the game and better prepare yourself...

Does this sound like fun to you?

""Ah, but it is your fault that you got surprised!"" you might say. ""Why did you not scout out the area ahead of you using stealth?"" Setting aside the aforementioned encounters that are sprung on you after passing through a door or portal, most enemies' Perception skill is so high as it make stealth almost worthless. And that's not even mentioning the large number of scripted encounters where enemies are just spawned on top of you, at which point trying to sneak past them is simply impossible.

In another section, the player enters an area called Leper's Smile, and then they learn that it's filled with Vescavor swarms, who can inflict the ""Confused"" status effect. Once you enter this area you cannot leave (as it's an ambush), you cannot rest (because your troops will be slaughtered), so if you didn't prepare the spell that can suppress Confusion (Unbreakable Heart) then you're going to have a much rougher time of things.

Yet another example: in Chapter 3, the player is tasked with hunting down a dragon. Wandering in the area west of Drezen will result in you being pulled into a random encounter with the dragon, and if it gets to go first (which it likely will), then it will unleash its breath weapon, which can easily nuke most of your party depending on how the damage rolls go. So you reload and pray to the RNG that your party's spellcaster wins the initiative roll so they can cast ""Protection From Fire, Communal,"" which makes the encounter a breeze.

Someone at Owlcat actually looked at this encounter and said, ""Yep, this is good! Let's put it into the production pipeline!""

There are also a large number of dice roll skill checks in dialogue and while exploring your enviornment. This is a good thing...except passing these checks rewards XP, and while these XP rewards aren't often large, they do add up, and thus the game has linked your party's power progression to RNG. This in turn encourages player to save scum until they roll high enough to pass the check, and what's worse, getting around maps often requires a large number of Mobility or Athletics checks. Failing these will often result in time passing, which causes your buff spells to expire, which in turn requires resting to restore your spells. Better to avoid the hassle by simply reloading until you pass the check.

And so you reload...and reload...and reload...

Making matters worse is the rampant stat bloat of your adversaries. Comparing their stats to those of the tabletop game will reveal them to be FARCICALLY overpowered in terms of AC, attack bonus, and spell resistance, and quite often these foes will have random buffs applied that are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to dispell, and which never expire. Consider the following: near the end of Chapter 2, the player encounters Joran Vhane, the brother of the traitor Staunton. He was a blacksmith, but now he's suddenly become a cleric with a ludicrously high AC, and he'll start combat by casting buff spells that raise it even higher, and on top of that, he has a permanent ""Freedom of Movement"" spell applied to him FOR NO REASON (other than to prevent you from using something like the Grease spell to knock him prone, of course). 

Why? Why is this one dwarf suddenly tougher than the demons we've fought thus far? His brother proved to be a far easier fight, and he's the one who's been fighting in the Crusades for decades!

Now sure, having massively bloated stats might be acceptable for a boss fight, but it's EVERYWHERE. And the result is that much of the game's flexibility in character creation goes out the window. Enemies' saving throws are so good that many debuff spells become worthless, which greatly constrains your tactical options. Are you playing as a spellcaster? Well, of COURSE you'll have to take the Spell Penetration feats, given that enemies' spell resistance is so ludicrously high. Of COURSE you'll pick the ""Ascendant Element"" mythic perk, considering how many enemies have elemental resistance. Of COURSE you'll spec Ember into casting rays, since those target Touch AC, which is a lot lower than enemies' regular AC. And as I said, this isn't restricted to boss fights. In Chapter 4 you'll start running into this massive blocks of stats simply by walking around the map.

Owlcat based nearly every encounter around the idea that you'd have a full slate of buffs applied, and it's difficult to overstate how tedious it is applying the same buffs over and over before each fight (and there are a LOT of fights in this game). It's rather telling that one of the most popular mods is one that automates the entire buffing process, and on the whole, I'd say that 45% of this game is your character build, the other 45% is buffing, and the remaining 10% is actual tactics and strategy. But beyond that, the encounters in WOTR are simply dull by design. There's no use of terrain or elevation. No use of concealment or darkness or cover. Nothing except a constant barrage of enemies that hit hard, are hard to hit, and have a litany of immunities design to funnel you down to a few strategies. 

Pathfinder: Kingmaker was a flawed but enjoyable experience. Wrath of the Righteous simply doubles down on the all the worst elements of its predecessor, and having played Baldur's Gate 3 its deficiencies have only become more apparent.",1707715841,1707715841,False,16,3,0.649988949298858643,0,True,False,False

here are my gripes with this game: 

- THE WRITING: It is Neverwinter Nights bad, hell It's Shadowrun: Dragonfall bad. 
Kingmaker had much better writing. The NPC's are stereotypical and irritating to the point that I had to skip voiced dialogue. It's making Oblivion dialogues sound like Shakespeare. 

- You realize that TWO of the characters are going to betray you as soon as you take a close look at them (as soon as you meet them).  Its doesn't make you doubt their loyalty, build up their value as a team member or create rapport in any way. So you just might care when you get betrayed. NOPE!
 
""I betrayed you! IT WAS ME ALL ALONG!""
""K whatev!""

 In Kingmaker my jaw dropped when I was betrayed - in Baldur's Gate II I was literally raging when I got betrayed. 

- This whole shifting the camera is really not needed and just makes you reach for the keyboard. I know there is a mechanic later on that requires it - but it just seems like a pain. Pathfinder is an Isometric game... why even bother? Who asked for this?

- WHY PUT SUB-CLASSES IN THE GAME THAT WILL NEVER COME IN HANDY?! WHY?! To use them in the DLC?! 
I can understand the player creating a useless character as a goof. But to code in builds that will never come in handy or are just bad to play with is just padding out classes to make it seem like you have more.
Plus, what sense does it have to have a main class that does exactly what another main class does just better? 

I was so looking forward to this game after Kingmaker, but this isn't just a step backwards... this is the whole marching band going in reverse.... with pivoting cameras. 

I am probably going to play this, just to see how Testy and Pooch evolve - and probably recreate that in Kingmaker.

I do think since its a fantasy game, i would like to see much more gods and demons and between them mortals who suffers. I do think the psychology of the characters are very well represented you can understand their thinking patterns and where theyre coming from because i personally think evil characters are not typically evil that want to control the world and making them kneel type thats an another plus.

The game does not start out well; the least likeable and most retarded companions are the first handful you get. If you have patience, push through the slog of the first two awful chapters, and the game starts being on par with Kingmaker.

The writing is good, but the characters are awful and that's unfortunate.
The voice acting, for the most part, is equally bad - taking wheezing struggling breaths between every half sentence is obnoxious, and a lot of the voices are just fucking annoying. 

Performance starts out smooth, but much like Kingmaker as you progress in the game it becomes increasingly sluggish and unstable.

With the bile out of the way, play past the first two chapters, mute all dialogue and just skim companion dialogue (it's irrelevant mostly) and then you have an excellent game.",1703203581,1707517312,True,0,0,0.369057506322860718,0,True,False,False

But, despite all the ways the game seems to encourage choice and decision-making, there is 100000% definitively a ""correct"" way to play. The choices are an illusion.

If you play in turn-based mode, for example, don't even think about playing anything other than a tanky class because enemies seem to hyperfocus on whoever ""initiated"" combat. If combat was initiated via a dialogue encounter, that is your player. This means that enemies will run through a couple dozen enemies, taking an insane amount of damage through attack-of-opportunity, just to get a single hit in on your character. 

So, unless you want to cheese the game (or are okay with your ""great and valiant crusader"" hero being incapacitated during important fights), the game seems to very much reinforce the idea there was a ""correct"" class and build to choose at the start of the game. (Note that when you actually look at guides for this game people seem to raise their eyebrows if you want to play as a support in any capacity.)

The game gives you a wonderful pool of choices and options in character creation. A metric fuckton of races, feats, backgrounds, classes, subclasses, and heritages. But choices are hard! Thankfully, Owlcat is here to help you out by mechanically asserting a correct decision by shitty encounter design and shoehorning you into minmaxed builds at the expense of roleplay. 

It is worth pointing out, by the way, that turn-based combat was implemented in a patch for Owlcat's previous game. Of the two combat systems in the games, real-time with pause was the one given more thought. And the RTWP implementation in Owlcat games is absolutely unbearable for a completely different host of reasons.

There are a lot of problems in this game that can be excused and attributed to the many flaws of Pathfinder 1E, but the encounter design and the AI (in)competency can certainly not.

If you want fun turn-based combat with good encounter design, play Baldur's Gate 3 and the DOS games.

If you want the rtwp experience the Pathfinder games are trying to be the spiritual successor to, play Baldur's Gate 1 and 2.

EDIT: Nearly two entire real-life days worth of playing the game, beginning with some of the final moments of Act 2, a lot of the story elements and companion moments are actually starting to make up for the games innumerable flaws.

Most of the men in the game, are inept, emasculate, or are a complete joke. The main story revolves around the females. All leaders are females, all important gods are females. All item descriptions feature you as a female, refering to your char as She, and all skills as well. There isn't any strong male character, all strong/bulky fighters are females, there isn't even any portrait of male half-orc (maybe because it would be so toxic masculintiy) just portraits of female half-orcs.

The main villain is female, the main good character leader of paladins is female, their good god is female, the only romanceable masculine man is gay. The romanceable straight male character is a simp.

All woman are mary sue, the introduction companions feature only woman characters, there is a lesbian couple right in the beggining (woke toll no context).

Idk you take the first city as knight commander and then this quest becomes available to you). You go to backwater and it's the most unbalanced bullshit I've ever seen. Let me give you attribute scores of an enemy that you encounter many times (so far 8 of them, but I haven't finished the area yet.
Str - 34 / Dex 25 / Con 54 / Int 23 / Wis 25 / Cha 24 ......this dude is level 14 btw (10 outsider 4 rogue? I guess? On a fuckin Demon?????) Oh yeah, and they cast group haste that lasts idk how many rounds but essentially its permanent. Oh yeah, large creature also with AC 44.
That's not to mention the level 25 enemy they throw at you randomly in the same dungeon. This is the beginning of the game, what the fuck are these developers thinking? 

They also have random encounters, and decided that 6 ash giants was a balanced encounter.

I'm also playing on Normal. Yeah. Normal difficulty. With no changes to how many enemies are spawned. This is the normal amount of enemies these people PLANNED on you fighting. 

This game still suffers the same bullshit as the last game. Let me put this in perspective.

Imagine a friend wants to DM a game, and invites you over to test it. You agree, because this is your good friend and you love table tops. When you get there - to your surprise - no one else is there. He has in front of him almost a dozen character sheets.
""Pick one. Or make your own,"" he says.
""Sweet!"" you say. You look through and decide to make your own character, as none of the others really appealed to you.
You start, and you go through the game and it's alright. First session is establishing the setting and what's going on, classic you're found and wounded blah, blah blah. Now, introduce the characters and the party that will follow you! And they're all....
Terrible stereotypes.
The same GOOD PALADIN, and apathetic noble with a hidden past. Mongrel outcast with a close mind. Eccentric noble without a care in the world.  Ect. You get my point.
""Ok,"" you think. ""Nothing really special about them, but at least the queen is kinda cool."" Which she is.
Now we get to the gameplay.
Remember how I said no one else was there? Yeah. THIS gm expects you to play the whole party in combat. Meaning you have to micromanage your character, and the 5 others with their own spells and abilities. So now you gotta learn more than 8 characters, what they do, and how they do it. What spells and abilities they have and when best to use them. A chore to say the least, because the ""AI"" they have, all it does is determine whether they automatically participate in combat or not. That's it. Turn it off, they stand there when combat starts. Turn it on, they all attack the same person and go down a line. Never use spells or abilities, just basic attacks.
Great. 
Now comes the combat difficulty.
This Dm wanted you to take part in a seige, but instead of doing your own thing and rolling for the progress, you gotta fight everyone and everything. Giants, demons, cultists, everything. Oh, and these enemies are adjusted for difficulty or because you have to fight all of them. Each dude is your level with equal abilities and spells. All of em. Are you level 6? They are level 6 and there's 6 of them. Plus a few CR12 monsters that you have to fight at the same time. And you have to do this the entire seige. Every section of the wall, every room you enter. Enemies. A fuck ton of them. That's when you realize...
This asshole has no idea what balance is, and is just throwing shit at you because ""It should be challenging!""
It's a fucking slog every time. 
I had 1 enemy wipe my entire party of overleveled (because I cheated cause fuck this) and had an ac of 36. Fuckin what? Never missed an attack, had 6 attacks per round, and just minced through everyone.
So you ask, ""Hey, wtf is this about?""
""What?"" he puts his hands up defensively as if he isn't the SOLE reason for the encounter. ""It's a mini boss they're supposed to be hard.""
You sigh in frusteration and push forward cause you wanna get this fuckin over with.
Then the crusade mechanics. 
This dm put together a half baked, half falling apart system that he just expects you to know and the tutorials he gave you are fuckin garbage. The crusade system is just...meh at best, but somehow one of the better parts of the game so far.
All in all, this game is tedious, and not that great. Do not recommend.
Oh, also this Asshole DM dismounts you all the time, and some of the ""cutscenes"" are pointless and useless.
""You didn't SAY you were mounted when you approached them."" he says with a shrug. ""Now you have to spend your round action mounting. Your feats don't count either. Full round.""

The story is compelling too and gives detailed insight into how the Pathfinder lore uses specific deities. The campaign mode in this is significantly easier than the Kingdom mode in Kingmaker. In Kingmaker I always found myself behind the demand for specific kingdom level events and no matter what I did, I could never catch up. Two weeks to level anyone up and by the time they leveled up two crises using that stat had already failed. In Wrath of the Righteous, however I just kept recruiting soldiers and maxed out my Magic generals. The magic generals can render many problems inert, and make the game easier.

The crusade management is a big improvement over Kingmaker's kingdom management and it's insanely relieving that you are not bound to a timer for the main story in most cases like Kingmaker is. The Crusade battles themselves are a bit boring and feel like game off chess with some RNG.

1. You need mods.  Trust me on this; at the least, you'll want one of the multiple available auto-buff mods, the in-game save editor ""Toy Box"", and ideally one that auto-skips some of the puzzles.  Trying to play this game unmodified is a dreadful experience; by the time you're halfway through the game, you're going to be spending ten minutes every time you enter a new area or after every rest reapplying the same 50 or so buff spells over and over.  It's tedious and awful- and so are the puzzles, which were designed by an imbecile with a grudge against humanity.  The puzzles aren't mentally stimulating or even particularly challenging, they're just frustrating due to using a terrible interface, requiring trial-and-error, and/or giving little to no guidance as to what the objective even is.  

2. You'll probably want to use guides.  Interested experiencing a Baldur's Gate-style power fantasy where you go from a level 1 nobody to a literal God?  Better pull up a guide to the ""Secret Ending"", because you have no chance of meeting the roughly 30 requirements on your own.  Want to turn your evil companion good, or at least less awful?  It's possible for some of them, but good luck figuring out which of the sometimes counter-intuitive dialogue options you have to select.  Yeah, a guide will spoil parts of the game for you, but this one is more about appreciating the journey than any particular twists or turns along the way, so don't feel compelled to go in blind. 

3. Use turn-based mode, at least after Chapter 2.  Later fights are balanced around it, an the game becomes an unmanageable, almost unplayable nightmare using real-time-with-pause by Chapter 4.",1707198392,1707198392,True,32,0,0.738546907901763916,0,True,False,False

I tried to create a sorcerer character twice on the normal difficulty but found out that no matter what, I would miss about 2/3 of my spells. It was worse on my first character missing like 4/5 of my spells. I think this was because of my low dexterity stat on my first attempt at making a character (I wasn't aware that wizards were required to do so much cardio at the gym). Now missing most of my spells was disheartening, but the worst part was that I was limited to an ice cantrip and acid cantrip that did 1-3 damage each. for context I think the early game enemy's had like 10 -14ish hp. So to summarize I had to beat unlikely odds to land an attack, for the chance to do sub-par damage with my spells. And I had to sacrifice armor for that too.

Putting the gameplay aside, I do like most of what the game has to offer. The story is great and fulfills the player's power fantasy very well; I chose the Azata path which was very fun and I'm inclined to see what the Lich and Aeon paths are like, though I don't want to start another 90 hour playthrough.

The music is a particular highlight, Areelu's theme, a lot of the triumphant themes and the various mythic path themes are very strong.

There's a solid selection of companions too, though I found the neutral and evil characters tended to be much more interesting and fun to have around despite me playing a good character. The voice acting is also very solid, but there isn't very much of it. The game kinda pulls you in with the first hour being fully voice acted... and then it just stops, and only comes back during select story moments and the climaxes of the companions' quests.

The core of the game is great, you have great dungeon exploration, great fight mechanics. Tje lore, the gameworld and the story is also good. But there are quite a few very annyoing game mechanics which makes the gameplay toxic and waste the players time.
1. Travelling the world map -> It makes you waste your time big time. Anyone who thinks it was a good thing to implement in a computer game has no place in the gaming software industry. Period. This is the simple worst feature of the game, you will spoend like 1/4 to 1/3 of your total game time travelling on the worldmap which is ridiculous.
2. Instead of making clever encounters like what you see in eg. Baldurs's Gate 3, you will get encounters which are impossible to defeat if you don't know Pathfinder rules well. There is no way clever way around these encounters, you have to brute force everythig. If you don't know all the rules, spell, feats, etc by heart then good luck defeating enemies which 45 AC in the 3rd chapter of the game. Is it possible to defeat those enemies? Absolutely! Can you do that as a casuial Pathfinder player? Yes, but you need to do research to be able otherwise good luck! And the latter is the problem. You might spend  a lot of time to clear a dungeon to find out you cannot defeat the boss. Then you have to do your research, then you have to waste a lot of time to travel back to your base which is far to get necessary companion(s), spells, weapons 
then just to travel back and try it again. It is ok if the target audience are only Pathfinder players but then you have to state it on your game's steam page!

Well, I cannot say there are other big issues but these are so huge that these basically make the game unenjoyable and unfinishable to a player who doesn't want to learn Pathfinder well.

The game is just OK, will do, nothing exceptional compared to Baldur's Gate 3. So it doesn't deserve a negative review, but there are a lot of things which are mediocre. Sometimes the process of playing can become very tedious. Still can't make myself finish the story and be done with the game. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, on the whole, doesn't provide anything significant in contrast to the first installment, namely, Pathfinder: Kingmaker. 

Cons:
1) Sort of the same graphics with boring cut scenes, there a couple of exceptions, however, there is a small number of cinematic ones. 
2) Limited voice acting, tons of lines to read which is annoying. It's just irritating to the eyes. 
3) Over-complicated level progression system with questionable feats and skills. No way to stack the same characteristics related to damage, attributes or armour which is strange because it could've been balanced to avoid OP builds. 
4) ""Warrior-like"" and ""Ranger-like"" types of class are still the most useful and practical in any battle/encounter, right now I have 3 different melee characters and 1 cleric, and they can do 98% of the work. Edit: and one ranger class companion.
5) The idea of difficulty is that the higher it is the lesser the chance of hitting enemies makes the kind of approach ridiculous at least. 
6) Alushinyrra is unique and beautiful, but navigating it after a couple of hours by constantly rotating the camera is exasperating. 
7) DLCs, DLCs and again DLCs, two season passes, which are strange to see considering that at least 50-65% of the game is similar to Kingmaker except for the story, quests and a couple of new mechanics.",1706808994,1706911420,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

The grand war campaign against the demons was great, but it did get interrupted in the middle by a long, drawn out quest through some Abyss area for a third of the game, which undid all my prior campaign advances.  You then just have to start again.  A little annoying, but it was part of the story line.

Better then Kingmaker But still misses the mark of being a video game. 
This game is a great improvement from kingmaker. The characters are far more interesting and fun to be around. The setting and story are a lot more entertaining. I like the idea of regular fights against demons and hell. I really like all the voice acting performances and the environments are beautiful at times. But I cant get over how this game is just so clunky. 
Character creation feels like looking at a spread sheet. The UI is just awful, there has got to be a middle ground that keeps the spirit of the in person game and a video game. Combat it's self feels fine nothing spectacular, things like spells and passive ability's are just given to the player and never explained, which leads to frustration. spells failing for no reason is never explained, and that leads to frustration, and finally leveling up is such a daunting and stressful experience i dread that golden cross. Its wonderful for players to be given so many options for creating a character in a in person game but it feels unnecessary here and only leads people like me who have never played Pathfinder to third party sources begging for it to be explained. I spend equal parts of this game clicking out to different websites or videos trying to figure out what these classes are how they work, and five levels in find out i shouldn't be letting my companions auto level up because it makes them less helpful.
Lastly I know this has to be a dead horse by now but the armies mode is just simply awful. I didn't chose auto mode at the beginning thinking i would try it my self and see but I regret it. I see the idea but five seconds with this mode and even i feel like the game as a whole would be better without it. 
I like this developer they learn and improve with each game. So i hope if they make a third pathfinder game it could be better then this one by leaps and bounds.",1706068546,1706751384,True,0,0,0.482412070035934448,0,True,False,False

The game does a very poor job explaining what everything does, so be ready to check online for what skills and feats actually do and why sometimes it seems like they don´t work (The answer to many posts is ""It´s not properly explained, it´s actually ...."" and sadly quite a few ""it´s a known bug, it doesn´t work"") 

The combat is all over the place. Literally, there are A LOT of fights, but most are fodder than can be won in 20 seconds using real time (with pause) combat, which you should, as playing them Turn-Based takes a lot of time, and is no more rewarding. The few fights that actually require your input should (and pretty much have to) be played using Turn Based. The problem is that that makes it so that 90% of your fights are played on auto, with little to no input from you, while the big fights go to a completely different combat system that not only feels different, it plays completely differently too. Ends up feeling like 2 disjointed combat modes jammed together, with neither properly fitting the whole game (and that´s without even mentioning crusade mode, something like Heroes of Might & Magic but with none of the depth or charm). 

After 2 weeks trying to get into the game and running into small problem after annoying bug, glitch, useless feats that forces me to respec and boring fight that only lasts longer because so many things have Damage Reduction (they´re not hard, just annoying), I´ve decided to call it and just give up on the game, it´s just not fun having to constantly double-check online what was it that broke, or waste an hour on fodder having fights with the depth of random mobs on an aRPG game.

And like the previous title, youre a female, no matter what you do. All items, tooltips, and explanations. You are she/her, no matter what. Silly me, I thought there were 2 genders

Its ""Girl Power"", the game!

Any weapon thats not ""Cold Iron"" might as well not exist in this game

Theyve continued on the tradition of randomly throwing in a high AC enemy, in the middle of a lower level zone, just to ""challenge"" a new player.. If youre not reloading saves, or playing the game in hindsight, you are going to get repeatedly donkey-punched, just like Kingmaker. Lets drop a lvl 20 Stringy Demodand at a lvl 7 party in a main quest map.. Should be fun! I am sick of running into enemies more than double my level, in a game where you have a linear progression.. I also ran into a lvl 20 ghost, that spams mass paralysis, and negative levels, with 3 attacks per turn.. Im running into alot of 3 attack per turn enemies, and they all decimate everything!  Im only in Act 2!!  This is not fun! 

Beginning in Act 3, the game just becomes frustrating, with random encounters with multiple Gibrileth Contaminators and Abyssal hunters spawning on all sides, that decimate every single character. Even with FOUR animal companions (including Azata), I cannot overcome these random encounters!  I am playing on Normal difficulty, or lower! This is NOT FUN! at this point, Im just trying to finish the game for the story, but keep running into insanely stupid stuff like this. Even with Nenio specialized into illusion, and spell penetration, etc, the Phantasmal Killer still fails because of low rolls..Even hasted, the [party is either on their backs, or dead within 3-5 rounds.

One large issue is with the Journal, and how vague its written. If you dare to take a break from your game, you will likely feel too lost when you come back to it. Ive gotten to act 3, 4, and 5 several times, only to take a break and be completely lost upon return. Meaning I restart a new character.

Edit: Ive just tried Wintersun at lvl 11, and run into my first ""Ancient Blighted Treant"", and boy was that a game killer. Ive now had 3 characters make it to act 3, where I rather quickly gave up on my play through.

The options warn you that exclusive full screen is unstable, and its not kidding.. Ive never had a  game that I couldnt play in exclusive full screen, but this one froze when I tried to close the game.

Lawful, in Pathfinder, apparently means murder....

Expect to Roll 1 more than any other number, by a WIDE margin. the dice feel heavily loaded towards the low numbers.

Its also technically a mess. tooltip popups that happen within 0.2 seconds, and take up the entire screen, so you cannot use your inventory, without mousing off to the side. Which means you can scroll, and view. The UI is also terribly broken, comparing the wrong weapon, of the wrong person. Comparing to a weapon that youre looking at, to a weapon on another character, or the wrong weapon slot.

This game also runs so hot on your cpu, that you will need to adjust your hardware, and the setting, no matter how far above recommended specs. Playing in anything above 1080 is not recommended. They cannot even iplement exclusive fullscreen properly!

Make sure to build an alternative Trickery character. Just before Drezen, you will be left without anyone able to handle the MANY traps, and locks, otherwise. Great game design, Owlcat......

The crusade system is WAY worse than Kingdom Management ever was, and thats saying something! Enemy casters than can 1 shot entire armies, with over 900d10. Yes, you read that correctly. nine hundred, 10 sided dice worth of damage

Update:
In Act 3, I was yanked from my sleep, while I was in the middle of a campaign mission, which teleported me somewhere I wont spoil, then back to Drezen. I now have to make my way BACK to where I was... This is as annoying as Far Cry 5 magic bullets

Update 2024:
Yet another new character, Im in Act 4 in Nexus, with no way to advance.. An NPC (Suture) is supposed to appear, who wont. I need 2 key pieces (which I have) to use the Nexus Portal, but it doesnt activate.. The Angel wont open a portal either.. Ive been at this for 3 hours now, running back and forth, and it is bugged, halting all my progress.

With all that said, you simply cannot deny that the 2 Pathfinder titles are the greatest modern crpg games.. They have the most depth, build diversity, replayability, etc.. And for all the issues I do have with it, that completely destroy my enjoyment, I keep coming back to them.. Particularly because no one else makes RTwP combat anymore, andI believe its the superior way to play.

Here, it's just an awkward primitive minigame that even if I kill it in game options, it still took dev resources better spent elsewhere.  Edit: ugh.  It gets worse.  Awful, awful.  Auto mode?  Yay?  No, lose out on goodies and side-quests.  It's actually worse than the Kingdom Management in the previous game.

* Clammy, tight maps.  'World' map even worse than Kingmaker....

* Janky AI.  Half the party engaged and super tanky companions/pets just sit there unless manually directed.

* Plot that bogs down into tedium.  Started well, now a chore....

Pathfinder has been called Mathfinder for a reason. This can be quite intimidating. The game thankfully offers you default levels and presets which make sense. You can play it like a normal game and put your 80 hours in and play the pectacular standard campaign. 

There is something seriously wrong with your character. That ""wrongness"" is the focal point of the story. On the one hand you play the ""stranger with memory loss"" trope. On the other hand this allows for you transcending. You can become a Lich. Devils, angels, aeons, tricksters and other wild transcending paths are available to you. The max level is 20 and once you have reached it, you can punch gods.

If you don't leave any stone unturned the main campaign will occupy you for 200 hours. It has the strategic sub-system which is purely optional. Set it to story mode and do the occasional HoMM3-lite battle. I liked it. You can also turn it completely off. I liked the casual illusion of actually leading armies against demons  and it does not get in the way of spelunking.

There are people who no-life this game and I can see why. The different mythic paths complete with alignments lead to very different games. And there is a lot of DLC for it.

If you are coming from BG3, this game is quite comparable with a couple of key differences. Nothing has the VA of BG3. This game included. Compared to that the characters will feel lifeless. Interesting, but lifeless. The other thing is that this is Pathfinder. There is a lot to chose on every level-up and a couple of feats will not be as valuable as others. Thankfully there is an entire eco-system of guides and builds you can follow.

There also are a lot of mods for it. Only thing you may want are additional character portraits. Stay away from the cheats in your first outing.

There also are highly detailed difficulty settings. My advice: set to normal and be off to the adventure.

There is the elephant in the room and that is stability of the game. As of now I have not noticed any bugs. It wasn't so from the start but it is now very playable. 

I spent half my time with it on Steamdeck. Just use the trackpads and bind a couple of common keys and it is perfect.

This game is not for you if the idea of a 200hr campaign scares you. I can imagine you can complete it in 60hrs. If you skip the side-quests and directly move towards punching gods. You can plan to do so but I guarantee you will get distracted.

Last Sarkosian and Midnight Isles are DLC which plugs directly into the main campaign. I liked both. But if I had to choose I would go for Last Sarkosian. 

The other DLC are stand-alone campaigns. Which I have not yet finished. One happenes right before the final fight in some sort of time-pocket. The other happens in parallel to the main campaign from the POV of survivors of the devastation of the city you start in on.

If any of this appeals to you I would suggest to get the whole thing as a bundle when it goes on sale. But IMHO it is worth the full asking price.",1705922051,1705922051,True,1,0,0.519751310348510742,0,True,False,False

Multiple Mythic paths give good replay-ability, not necessarily due to entirely unique game play choices, but how your build interacts with the system. Each Mythic Path is broken in its own fun way, with many satisfying results along the way.

The companions are great, with enough varied personalities to make things a bit complicated, but each of them forgiving enough that save for picking an alignment diametrically opposed to them, they will stick around.

The combat somehow makes ttrpg combat feel even more like you are just rolling dice then ACTUALLY JUST ROLLING DICE! The gamepad I use is unable to end turns so every round of combat consists of Miss or Hit, numbers on screen, followed by several minutes of pressing every button on the controller three or four times before giving up and turning the combat off of turnbased and then toggling it back on quickly after getting an attack or two from the enemy. 

The acting is inferior to high school musical theater and the writing is so on the nose it's painful. It sounds like people are making fun of people who play fantasy. It sounds like the same actor is doing every voice, from the demon lord to the male and female children to the townsfolk of every race,

It is a hot mess that should have been scrapped in pre-alpha. At least in the first 40 hours of the game, that was the biggest problem that made me drop the game and then pick it after a long cooldown period.

As for the actual gameplay, it's more of Pathfinder Kingmaker, but with updated class abilities and some very good quality of life changes (like streamlined class selection, streamlined UI, etc).

As for story and characters. I really don't like a lot of the characters at the moment. Maybe I will cozy up to them as time goes by, but at the moment I feel that Kingmaker did a whole lot better job at it. Story is lit, though. Like it, love it, with good mix of funny and 'WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW!? WHAT IS RIGHT?! NOOOO' .

Overall, it's a mix bag. I hope I will have the time to finish it, but I might drop it for some Solasta or Baldur's Gate. They have their jank, but at least you don't have to put up with the Crusader system.

Update after 172 more hours and close to the end:

Story is still interesting and makes you feel powerful. Characters, even after completing their story arc seems a bit like.. ""okay, let's just get this over with"". Except for Ember. I would burn down the world for Ember.
The biggest gripe I had was with the Crusader system and luckily you don't have to interact with that as much at higher levels. Which also means that the pacing is very weird.

Paid software should not, under any circumstances, be bundled with spyware that records such a comprehensive set of information about the user's device and activities. This level of data collection goes beyond what is necessary for troubleshooting or software improvement and raises serious legal and ethical concerns.

The EULA's authorization for Owlcat Games to upload program files to the user's device for the purpose of recording detailed technical and statistical information is a blatant violation of user rights. Users should be able to trust that the software they purchase is free from intrusive spyware that compromises their privacy and security.

The provision allowing Owlcat Games to transfer user data to subcontractors and vendors without specifying their identities or the exact purposes for which the data will be used is unacceptable. This lack of transparency undermines trust and exposes users to potential misuse of their data by unknown third parties.

In conclusion, I strongly assert that the inclusion of such spyware in paid software is not only objectionable but also likely illegal.

It's a good game. Owlcat is definitely slowly developing their own approach at the the squad-based fantasy tactics gameplay. The lore and story is pretty decent. Nothing groundbreaking. It's your typical DnD-based story.

If you liked Kingmaker, WotR is a direct upgrade to that with new mechanics and easier controls.

RIght now, I just have 2 major complaints:
1. The ""Paths"" aren't equal in scale. Some are definitely more fleshed out than others. I would have much rather they focused on 3/4 main paths than having so many but half of them are incomplete by comparison.

Basically, while Angels get to be the Avengers, why can't I as Azata be more of a Suicide Squad? The Azata path and many like it just don't seem like they're fully fleshed out.

2. Companions. They're decent characters but compared to the companions in the other games, these guys are rather bland. I particularly got kinda bored with Seelah, Camellia and Woljif. They're good as units, but the dialogue and companion quests are just not that interesting.

Angel path is of course my favourite; I believe it has the most content of the paths? I also really loved the Aeon.

Of course it isn't flawless, and for some puzzles I have to look up the solutions (Not exclusive to WOTR, in general I'm just not very good at puzzles. I still somehow really enjoy them though.)

You create a character from a huge arsenal of possibilities and are thrown into the world. The story takes its course and you soon find yourself on a crusade against a powerful demon. However, it takes a good 150 hours to face this demon, during which you solve an incredible number of side quests and character quests in addition to the main quest and (optionally) organise the crusade itself.

The game tells the story in pen & paper style, which means a lot of text & a few passages read out very well by voice actors. This means that this is exactly what you should appreciate in a role-playing game: very well written stories with a lot of text that you really have to read to understand the story, as it is quite complex.

The game also brings complexity in a second area: in the group's battles against their enemies. These are either turn-based or in real time, but can then be paused. For me, the battles are where WotR is incredibly strong, as the player can reduce the difficulty level (among other things) of the battles to a tolerable level - at any time. This is where the game stands out the most from other games, as it really does cater for the whole range of buyers. You can take the time to delve deep into the skills of the characters and optimise them to perfection so that you can survive fights against the strongest opponents, even on the higher difficulty levels. Or you can play the battles at a level at which they can be won by anyone without in-depth knowledge.

The graphics, the music (and where available, the voice actors) are of high quality. You can hear people murmuring in the background in the towns and a harmonious atmosphere is created everywhere.

I picked it up after finishing Baldur's Gate 3, in need of another turn-based fantasy RPG to fill the void (not to mention that my D&D group is going to be playing Pathfinder soon), and I'm obsessed. I bought it exactly two weeks ago to the day, and in those two weeks I've racked up nearly 65 hours. And get this. I'm not even halfway done with the game!!!

P:WOTR is a sprawling party-based RPG based on the Pathfinder ttrpg ruleset. I've seen estimates that a completionist run can span over 200 hours, and I can fully believe that. The story is intriguing and well-written, the companions are interesting, and the combat is challenging but fun. In some ways, I would say that P:WOTR actually is *better* than BG3. 

Some of my favorite things about the game:
- The amount of content!! There's 6 acts or chapters, as opposed to three, and each one is long enough and interesting enough to sink a minimum of 10-20 hours into. The quests are different enough and interesting enough that I've never felt bored following a quest line, and they don't feel repetitive in the slightest.
- The number of build possibilities is nearly endless. There's over 25 classes, most of which also have subclasses within them. Combine that with 10+ races, and literally thousands of feats and spells, and there's essentially endless possibilities for builds. Plus add in the mythic paths and feats, and that adds yet another layer of unique build choices.
- The difficulty settings!! There's ~8 difficulty settings, each of which is 100% customizable. So if you want to play on easy combat, but enable permadeath, you can do that!! If you want to play on hard mode and disable permadeath, you can do that too! You can also change settings mid-game or even mid-combat. If you've tried one combat 4 times, and you're not having fun anymore, bump the difficulty down a notch, do the fight, and then bump it back up and keep moving. Or, if you start on Normal difficulty and find it too easy, bump it up a notch or two and see if that captures your interest!!
- The companions! There's a large number of NPCs who can become your companions, about double of what BG3 offers. Plus, you can have 5 of them in your party, ***NOT*** including your main character. Most of them can be romanced. Each of the companions has their own interesting story to uncover, mysteries to solve, and unique dialogue to have. Plus the little camp dialogues between two companions each night are such a fun and interesting way to see their personalities. And you never get the same one twice!
- THE MYTHIC PATHS. Holy shit, I love the mythic paths. They are such a fascinating and unique aspect to add to the game. The mechanic is super well-done, and I honestly wish more games had something like it. It serves as both a story mechanic (showing up at important plot points, and slowly revealing parts of a story that you aren't even aware of at first), while also providing immense levels of gameplay utility. Each one unlocks unique quests, unique options that impact the results of main quests, as well as unique powers. Plus the mythic feats and abilities that are available to you and your companions are SO USEFUL! They really are gamechangers, especially when it comes to combat utilities. (The boundless healing one that allows your healers to used touch-based healing spells from a distance has saved MANY of my characters from death or unconsciousness...) I'm currently playing the Angel mythic path, but I can't wait to play again and try out literally any of the other ones!! They all sound fascinating. 
- As a bonus (though this is simply a feature of the Pathfinder ruleset as opposed to D&D), you don't have to choose between feats and ability score increases. You alternate with each level-up. (And as a note, your ability scores can go well above 20. Nenio currently has a 30 INT score in my game, and multiple other characters have stats in the upper 20s.) Plus, the feats are MUCH more meaningful and useful compared to D&D. They make a much bigger difference in terms of functionality.

Alright, this review is getting long enough, so I'll leave it here. But hopefully this has convinced at least one person to buy this amazing game!!!

But the gameplay feels like you are playing with a dungeon master whose only goal is to show how good and clever they are and not to let you actually enjoy the process. The general strategy boils down to ""be always buffed"", because the monsters with incredible AC can just jump on you any minute, and there is nothing you can do in-fight, if you haven't gulped every potion available and casted every scroll you have in advance. So, it gets really boring. Also there is pseudo-HOMM in-game mechanism which is mostly a time-killer.
Storywise it also becomes weird, as the need to accomodate the idea of playing HOMM within an RPG leads to questionable storylines, like ""let's send our top military officer, who is currently in charge of a biggest military campaign in decades, on a spy-mission. Obviously, there is nobody else in the whole kingdom."" The writing and the dialogues also became worse comparing to the first game.

Their quests were interesting and story arcs mesmerising. In the second instalment they look like a dumbed down caricatures, who can exist only in a black-and-white world. I didn't really care for any of them. 
In the end I didn't finish the game, as at some point during the last act because of the glitch I lost all of my saves. I thought it was a sign to stop torturing myself and stop playing.

It is also very far removed from any Tabletop pathfinder experience I have, and I have been running Pathfinder games as a GM for years.

I hate minmaxing, I hate sacrificing my own roleplaying experience for stupid numerical  stats. And even after optimizing for high attack roles and spell penetration, more often than not, your ""Heroes"" are just failing to hit the totally unimportant NPC featuring an AC of 43 and/or a magic resistance of 25. This lack of felt agency is just ruining the game experience. RPGs first and foremost are about storytelling. Overcoming opposition by forethought and tactics has a place, but this game has lost focus. 

Overpowering Boss like NPCs without context, background and story simply should not exist in Pathfinder games. Its bad GM-ing and encounter design.

Want to go the greatest iteration of the Abyss in D&D history, go ahead. Want to explore a multi layered moving city, go ahead. Want to command armies in a Heroes and Might and Magic format? go ahead!! want to play the game in turn based or Real time with pause almost seamlessly?  GO AHEAD!!!!

Every one sings of Divinity series as the today's gold standard for CRPGS. Ive played them all, and I will die on the hill that argues the Pathfinder series is the greatest crpg since the Wizards Coast first two BG. (Yes i'm aware of the BG3 but it hasnt hit me as hard as WOTR, yet...). Let me tell you why.
1) The audacity of the scope - Whether its Kingmaker or WOTR, OwlCat has clearly love crafted this worlds in realisation of everyone's D&D fantasy. Whether it is the first world or the Abyss. The world are beautifully crafted and wonderfully realised,
2) Dynamic Game play loop - WOTR is not afraid to shake things up and throw you curve balls when you truly believe you have everything figured out, and the choices you made before hand will affect the results. It is so refreshing when your game play loops get broken up, especially when you are not expecting it to keep the environment fresh and exciting. Many situations test you mental resilience.
3) The amount of choice branches - This in particular is bonkers. The amount of choice difference and storey changes you find on your other play through just seems to be infinite, making the replay factor of this game amazing.
4) Deep and well developed characters. Like in every good CRPG from BG2 onward your team have personality and triggers. Placing an extra layer on your decision making.They truly add perspective to certain important decisions.
5) Build craft gone mythic!!! If just the standard levelling of like 50 different character archetypes is not enough, make it mythic!. An extra layer of min max character development that adds layers to what you are capable of. And if you play CORE or harder (like you should), you will need to perfect your build or you'll find your late game builds snowballing back up the hill!

WOTR - Storyline wise is not as good as KingMaker, Which in my opinion is the gold standard of balls deep psychological D&D trauma, and I loved every single second of it
However, it is better in every other way including the scope of what it set out to achieve.

PROS:
The actual storytelling is interesting. I thought the premise was unique, and was hoping to really get into the game. 

CONS:
I'm unsure why people consider this to be better than the first game - and most people say overwhelmingly better. The gameplay is still wonky - it actually feels like they took a step backwards. 

For example, the pathing is inexcusably terrible. No game released post 2000 should be this awful at having your party follow you. They seem very oblivious as to your movement, sometimes running ahead of you, in the wrong direction. If you ever go up or down stairs, the party will often not follow, but end up staying on the wrong floor. 

The performance is hilariously poor. Optimization seems to not be in the language of the devs. BG3 performs better on my system than this game, and you can just compare the two and see why that's a problem. 

The interface and tutorials are a mess. 

Cherry on the sundae, apparently either the devs or publisher was caught trying to sneak spyware into a patch. So instead of working on optimization, they were working on stealing your data? Time not well spent.

Ha! Pathfinder is much like D&D, just much more unforgiving at times, at least Kingmaker & Wrath are at any rate, also the story is very well done, kudo's to the writers for this one. Watch the others, learn from their mistakes, before they learn from yours. Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is an Isometric, blend of traditional RPG, City Management, and heavy Strategy via the Crusade portion.

 Now the city management portion, if you played Kingmaker is not as stringent or complex as it was on Kingmaker, it merely serves as a function to level your kingdom stats and improve various things within the Crusade. One other key important thing to keep in mind, there is no time limit with Wrath of the Righteous, I repeat no time limit, unlike Kingmaker which punished you if you wasn't speeding along. Thanks Lann, your awesome Lann. 

However there is a secret ending that involves completing the game between the 16th and 21st of Gozran, the year is not a factor that I am aware of. I won't say anymore on that, its a bit of a spoiler, however there are sure to be guides most likely for it, also the secret ending does not apply for the Legend path. Pearls of Wisdom from brother Woljif: If you hug a Babau you may get burned.

Speaking of paths, this is a huge game, and one of the new elements in Wrath allows you to choose a Legendary Path (unlimited...powa!!!!) *maniacal laugh*.

If you still wish to go in blind I would still research on a second playthrough, especially since the secret ending of the game requires you hit a bunch of different hidden checks and can be made inaccessible in the first ten minutes of the game if you pick the wrong dialogue choice.

May I introduce you to Pathfinder, where getting an AC of 60 is both entirely possible and honestly not that hard if you try. Your enemies will truly enjoy your +65 to hit 7 attacks a turn with 70 average damage (not including criticals). 

A lot of people in other reviews have complained of the combat being too hard, and I get that. I don't want to call it a skill issue, but you can't just run up and swing. You have casters and they're not just there for casting fireball. If you want to win any of the end-game fights you have to spend two minutes of in-game time dumping buffs upon buffs on yourself. It's a bit tedious, but if you don't you're basically playing three characters down. However, still do make sure to save frequently. Lost two hours when half my party died at the end of a dungeon and the only one that could cast a resurrection spell was one of the corpses. 

If you come in with general tabletop knowledge, the character creation and level-up is honestly easier than pen-and-paper. If you come in without that, I hope you're prepared for a brick wall of a learning curve. You can go pre-generated, but half the fun is experimenting with random character builds. Experiment, see what works, and you can always retrain your character.

The story isn't anything revolutionary, but it's enjoyable nonetheless. All the companions are wack in their own way and have fun side-quests that you should definitely do. You can make your own companions, but they get fewer skill points and don't have any of the interactions, so I only had one and that was for party balance reasons. Replayablility is there but the storyline is quite linear so unless you go down a very different moral path one single run-through gets you the entire experience. The mythic paths do make it worth another run-through if that's what you're there for.

The performance is mostly good with some glaring problems. For most of the game, I had almost no issues. However, there are clearly particle effects that are very poorly optimised and it hurt the experience to a point that I just stopped using summoned elementals since they tanked the performance into the floor. Also, if you have a particularly long session, for some reason there are massive lag spikes, but all it took was a game restart and everything went away.

Trying to replicate the tabletop experience is never going to work in a single player videogame. Tabletop games are about the camaraderie of a group of actual people coming together to bring their own individual viewpoints and problem-solving abilities to a quest, guided by yet another person in the form of a dungeon master who works with the players to keep things relatively stable, interesting, and consistently challenging. It is also about human intuition--the play of acting out a role you, personally, have developed for a character.

In a videogame, none of this works. I'm not acting out anything: I'm merely selecting prefab dialogue options (and, most importantly, selecting them in a way like one checks off a grocery list).

I feel no sense of camaraderie with computer characters--the thing about playing with other people is seeing their personalities shine in myriad little ways when they act out their personally designed roles.

There is no guiding hand in the form of a dungeon master in a videogame. One might argue that changing the difficulty setting can mitigate this feeling, but that only speaks to the weakness of the medium for this: whereas a competent dungeon master can mitigate particularly bad dice rolls with subtle changes in how the group moves through the game, in a videogame there is no comparable option: [i] the game encourages you to quicksave-then-quickload[/i], which gradually gives the impression that permanence and adherence to the results of your choices is effectively worthless. One might argue that WotR's Ironman mode should mitigate this, but [i] not when the game decides to bug out on you[/i]. How exactly is that sh*t fair?

The other thing about the difference between the medium of tabletop and videogame is tedium. Whereas you're only expected to keep your own feats, abilities, spells, etc. in mind when you play with a group of people, in a videogame you're expected to keep this ever-growing amount of information at hand in order to properly synchronize your party and give them better chances of defeating challenging enemies. I don't know a single person who can be expected to keep the DC, name, results and so on of hundreds of abilities spread out over 10 or so characters. 

And there is [i] just so much goddamn tedium in this f*cking game [/i]. Don't forget to check out the crusade! Don't forget to rest! Don't forget to put new spells in your spellbook! Don't forget to copy recipes and scrolls! Don't forget to check decrees! Don't forget to upgrade your armies! Don't forget to buff and debuff before literally every f*cking battle!

This stuff is not fun. It's fun when you're with other people. You can get drunk and be stupid about it. The joy is in spending time with others. Here everything takes itself so goddamn seriously. There's a reason games like this, if Steam achievements are anything to go off of, have a playerbase where less than a quarter of people who buy the game actually finish it.

In terms of gameplay, I think I prefer this game to Baldur's Gate 3. Granted, I am a massive lover of ttrpgs and character building. I love testing out new builds and seeing their progression. I kept struggling with getting into this game because I am personally not a big fan of real time with pause. For any of y'all out there like me, this game has a really well designed turn based mode that makes it feel really good to play. Highly recommend also checking out the Midnight Isles dlc for those of y'all who just wanna muck about with different build and party combinations and do some good old fashioned dungeon crawling. 

In terms of story, I really love the scope of it all and the different characters and NPCs. Definitely requires a lot of reading, but if that's your jam (and it sure is mine) then this should be right up your alley. I'm still only just getting into the second act of the game with the main crusade so I'm excited to see where it goes from here! My major gripe so far is that I wish there were more romance options, especially queer ones. I love the early game lesbian representation between NPCs, but I wish that I could live out my lesbian warrior core dreams with Seelah. That is an area where BG3 shines, but I definitely think the writers over at Owlcat are more than capable of delivering something of equally high quality when it comes to romance and character writing.

I like scene about journey of adventure more than politics of managing kingdoms or leader of crusades.

What i expected to see was more emphasis of a journey, stories, banters, memorable characters, and their interaction.
The likes of characters such as Morrigan and Alistair of Dragon Age Origins, or Minsc, Aerie, or Viconia of Baldur's Gate

I expected a story of why my character had to do choices they made
Not because of wounded by strange wounds, out of nowhere, and became mythically strong, and had to be a part of crusade that i dont want to be a part with...  lol
Its just feels like so little backstory for my character.

In short,
Playing this game just doesnt feels like playing an RPG for me.
Its more like a strategy than an RPG
After Act 3,  I became more sleepy than actually enjoy to play the game.

I'm not a player of pathfinder tabletops, but i do agree with other reviewers that said the gameplay is overly bloated with complexities, which is NOT EVEN NECESSARY.
at the end of the day, i just use a human fighter, lol...

And gameplay wise, the difficulty raher unbalanced, the same problem with Pathfinder Kingmaker.

Sorry Owlcat, 
I truly appreciate and wish to support the ""not big name Game Developers""
but for me, i cant recommend this game.
Off course, this is only my opinion. Others might enjoyed this game.

The story is excellent. There's nothing especially unique about the premise, demons are invading, you're a chosen one, you lead a crusade against the demons, etc. But it's the writing that truly elevates this game. There are 12 companions to recruit, and nearly all of them are interesting and have cool sidequests. Regill the angry little gnome and Wenduag the spider-catgirl were particular standouts for me. Even seemingly insignificant bit characters end up contributing to the story, it's all masterfully done. There are also certain parts of the story that play out like a choose your own adventure storybook, where a narrator gives you a scenario and you have multiple ways to deal with the situation. Certain actions will be dictated by who's in your party. For instance, you may not be good at stealth, but if one of your companions is, you'll have a much higher chance at passing the skill check. 

The combat is really good...for the most part. There are quite a lot of classes to choose from, and because you're the special chosen one, you also get ""mythic paths"" to follow that give you extra abilities. Wanna be an angel? Okay, cool. Wanna be a lich? You can do that. One thing to be aware of is that Pathfinder is a fork of the D&D 3.5 ruleset, and it's VERY number/stat heavy. If you're not used to that sort of stuff (I certainly wasn't), you should probably play on Story or Casual mode. But if you're the type of person who likes min-maxing and researching the best builds, you'll love it. 

Combat encounters themselves can either be played in real time-with-pause or in full turn-based mode. I prefer turn-based, however it can become a slog when you've got 20+ entities on the field and you're sitting around waiting for everyone to take their turn. You can turn it back into real time at the press of a button, but your party members are likely to run off and do their own stupid thing instead of burst-firing that one tough enemy you wanted to focus down.

The one MAJOR negative to this game is the crusade management system. As the commander of the crusade, it's your job to bring in recruits, manage affairs, assault enemy fortresses that block your progress on the world map, etc. That all sounds well and good, except it's implemented in the stupidest way possible. It's essentially a terrible version of Fire Emblem tacked on as a mini-game that you have to micromanage. Now, you don't HAVE to engage with this system, the game allows you turn auto-crusade mode on and the game will just handle everything in the background. However... 

The game actively punishes you for choosing auto-mode. You won't be able to fast travel around the map, which is a HUGE problem because traveling on the world map for extended periods will saddle you with debuffs, and the map is gigantic and takes forever to get around. In the final act of the game you will be aimlessly wandering around the map or resting for days on end at your fortress to pass time, because you have to WAIT for the game to conquer fortresses for you. And these aren't small wait times, some of the fortresses require you to wait 75 days or more. It actively wastes your time. As if that weren't bad enough, you also miss out on chunks of the story and certain mythic paths. This is by far the most asinine thing I have ever seen in a game. It's like they KNEW the crusade mode sucked and provided a way to avoid it, but then they deliberately screw you over for not engaging with their godawful mechanic. 

My one other gripe is the puzzles. Oh my god they are OBNOXIOUS. One of your party member's sidequest involves doing a bunch of puzzle solving. I'm bad at puzzles so I just used guides, and most of them aren't that bad. Just match tiles until you solve the thing. But the final task to complete this companion's sidequest is a gigantic dungeon FULL of nonsensical puzzles. She was one of my favorite companions and I wanted to see how her personal story played out, but this game is already really long and I just couldn't be bothered to slog my way through all that garbage.

I haven't played any of the DLC so I can't comment on any of that, but overall, very solid game. It would be a 10/10 if it weren't for the stupid crusade management crap and the puzzles, but since it's there, that drops the game to an 8/10 for me.

You can skip to the end if you want a list of pros and cons.

If you're on the fence, here's my two cents on the game after 700+ hours:


[h2] Gameplay [/h2]


The game adapts the ruleset of the Pathfinder 1st edition Tabletop RPG which in itself is based off of DnD 3/3.5e ruleset, this inherently means that the game will depend largely on a roll of the dice and your ability to pre-buff your characters and optimize your character stats, the game puts this front and center and unless you play on anything less than normal difficulty you're going to have a bad time if you neglect these two concepts. This can get especially tedious since there's a plethora of spells that you can cast on yourself and you end up have to do this most of the time in the game.

The variety of the enemies in the game are mostly demon-types, so most enemies are going to be similar to each other but still different enough that you'll never feel the game is re-using enemies until the final stretch of the game.

The game provides you with no less than 20 classes in the base game and more than 150 subclasses, this allows you to have a [b] MASSIVE [/b] build variety between spellcasters, martial characters or a mix of both. You can multiclass at any time from any class or its archetype so you'll never really feel out of ideas.
You have about 12 races each with their own subtypes and fixed attribute-bonuses (unlike Baldur's Gate 3, where you can assign a +2 or +1 to whichever attribute you like regardless of race). This slightly conflicts with the roleplay aspect but not so much that it ruins the fantasy of my character.

The mythic path system supplements your character build greatly and is the main flavorant, combining between immersive storytelling and creative solutions for whatever the main classes lack, you can be anything from an angel, demon, lich or just a straight up dragon and each of them is completely unique.

Some classes are alignment locked (mythic paths included) so paladins can only be Lawful Good, Monks can only be Lawful any, druids can only be neutral, etc.

Unfortunately the game provides a poor tutorial to its mechanics and you'll be left wondering for the longest time what spell does what, or how come all your attacks are missing or why your damage is so low,

There's also a unique mechanic combining between simcity and Heroes of Might and Magic, where you can manage armies and attack other demonic armies. If you ever feel tired of it or if it detracts from your experience you can toggle it off from the settings, I've always enjoyed it personally, though!

Finally, the game difficulty. Frankly the game is really ******* hard if you play on anything above normal (there's literally a difficulty level called ""unfair""), despite that you can [u] completely [/u] customize every aspect of the game's difficulty and tinker it to your liking or just straight up play on ""story mode"" if you don't care about the gameplay and are only here for the story, but there are around 7 or so preset difficulties and some game achievements will require you to play on them if that matters to you. The game also has an iron man mode called Last Azlanti where you're restricted to a single save file and if your main character or your entire party gets killed, the save file is deleted and it's game over, but again it's optional.

[i] Overall the game has a steep learning curve with a poor in-game tutorial explaining its many, many mechanics. Most of the time you'll end up looking information on guides or simple mechanics but the game has a helpful community that covers most of those topics. Learning the game can be frustrating at first but mastering it and learning how the mechanics work and seeing your build come together makes it well worth it. [/i]


[h2] Story and Storytelling [/h2]


Lemme preface this by saying the game has the best story out of any CRPG I've played. It plays off the chosen hero stereotype but it executes it so flawlessly you'll never feel put off by it.
The story basically starts in a country that's been at war with demons for 100 years, they've been on the losing end until the player character comes in, finally achieves victory and ends the war, or not. This is probably one of very few RPGs that allow you to be an actual villain instead of a hero and not hate you for it, in fact the game supplements evil-based characters with the mythic path system and other (well written) evil companions.

Character writing in the game is pretty good (not Bioware level, mind you), each character is leagues' worth of difference from one another but they all have their own reason to be part of this war, the game explores the motivations behind each companion with their own mini questline that progresses along the main story. Romances are well written with just the right amount of cheesy, wholesome or straight up sadistic. But they are entirely text based (no kinky cutscenes!).

Game is segmented into 6 acts (or 5 if you don't count the 6th act since it's practically 1 hour long), extending well over 100 hours of gameplay, so you'll have plenty of game to sink your teeth into.

There's technically a game installment (Kingmaker) released before Wrath but they're completely separate from each other 
with the exception of one or two callbacks, so you miss nothing by not playing Kingmaker first.

[i] Overall the game is a power-fantasy done right, there's always a large ""wow!"" moment in every act and the story is probably the game's strongest point, you can play the game just for the story alone in my opinion. [/i]


[h2] Community and Studio [/h2]


The Pathfinder community is probably one of the most helpful one I've seen, you can ask them any question at all (and you'll probably ask many) and they'll always help, since everyone has been a noob at some point.

The studio doesn't slack on bugfixes and patches either, most of the bugs that get reported are quickly fixed in the next patch unless it's not very impactful. Mind you the game [i] still [/i] has bugs that have been there since early access and it's not 100% bug free, but it's well-polished and I haven't ran into any bug or glitch that impacted my gameplay in any meaningful manner, the game's come a long way since its release and most of the bugs have been patched since then.

The modding community is active and constantly updating and releasing, though it's not as moddable as - say - Skyrim or such, it provides useful tools and fixes that which the studio does not, there are also portrait packs that allow you to add your own images as character portraits in the game.


[h2] Miscellaneous [/h2]


The game OST is [i] phenomenal [/i], it genuinely makes you feel the moment and it never misses a beat.

Unfortunately the game is very text-heavy, there are very few voice acted lines throughout the game and if reading long textwalls REALLY isn't your thing (btw if you made it this far, well done!), you'll get slightly bored sitting there spacebar-ing around 7 blocks of text just to progress the story or quest.

Artstyle and graphics are well done, the game is built on Unity and even though the camera is top down, it still manages to paint beautiful and ambient environments, there's a photo-mode for whenever you want to take a particular screenshot.

DLC is nothing to really write home about, they're supplementary and it doesn't add any extra story, they're just kinda [i] there [/i]


[h2] Conclusion [/h2]


Pros:
[list]
    [*] Well thought out and well written story and characters.
    [*] Elaborate gameplay and diverse character creation.
    [*] Banger OST.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
    [*] No good tutorial to explain said elaborate gameplay.
    [*] Really, REALLY long.
    [*] The game falls off around Act 5 and feels rushed at the end.

What I liked about this game is a story itself and quests of your companions.  Also, the soundtrack was pretty epic.
The list of items I disliked, however, is much longer
- As I have already mentioned - poor balance. It just ruins everything - you can not play this game on 'normal' mode at some point of the game because devs placed there  opponnents which you are not able to kill (they are 5+ levels higher than any of your party members and just one-shot your tanks) so you have to savescum  dozen of times and expect that at some point random will play for you and you will just be able to overсome this encounter. Or just set lower difficulty. The same thing happened to me in the first Pathfinder game as well. Seems like Owlcats are just adding hundreds and hundreds  of spells and mechanics to their games for the number but not for the quality. Sad
- Bugs. There are still plenty of those in the game. And I noticed that a variety of spells/abilities are NOT working as is described in the tooltips. At some point of 'Sarkorians' questline I literally had to delete one of my saves because the script was broken and I couldn't just do a thing. Also I had a bug in the 'Anscension' questline and for some reason the items from the demon lords just didn't fall (instead a shadow copies of the bosses appeared WTF). I read a ton of topics on this issue and it seems the only solution for now is installing a mode for toolbox which I am fully against of. 
- Puzzles. they s*ck hard.  Most part of those are illogical and could be solved only  checking all the options. And they are the reason why I will probably never re-play this game. Even if I am interested in the story i do not want to face those puzzles anymore in my entire life. 
- Billion of load screens.
- The crusade mechanics. They are just boring and seems like the core purpose of those is to make your walkthrough 40 hours longer than it actually is. The  Heroes - like battles lack both difficulty and depth of the original . And also the 'power' of the armies on the map in many cases is calculated based on some random functions and does not correspond the real value. Like, I struggled from some enemies that were marked 2 levels lower than  mine  and easily killed other enemies that were marked 2-3 levels higher than mine.  From what I saw - just get the firebolt and healing abilities for your general and faceroll the crusade fights. Or just ignore this part of the game, it's a waste of time

Owlcat, please, stop adding gameplay mechanics just for the number and finally do something with their quality",1703951601,1703952003,False,2,0,0.490911126136779785,0,True,False,False

Having played Kingmaker, I felt it was a well made game. I had beat Kingmaker on Unfair all the way through, and despite having some trouble, there was always a way to target your opponent's weak spot and go for the win.

I started playing WOTR on Unfair, having researched NPC's that join your team, planning out each level build and all that min-max stuff.

Now even though I find this game interesting and challenging in many ways. At the same time, I feel that some enemy encounters are simply not well thought through and over scaled (which several other player's complain about).

One such encounter I would reference is the gargoyle cave, during one of the NPC quests. The sheer amount of enemies that spawn and the armor class of the toughest one in the group leaves you no other option than to make the mobility check to move to the other section of the map, which is unreachable for the enemy group and simply cheese this fight. That's not really my idea of having fun and planning out an optimal strategy to win the fight. Sure, the game gives you the option to cheese many fights if you use the terrain correctly, but that's not really my idea of playing to challenge myself.

To give more constructive criticism, I believe the enemies in the early game scale too quickly in terms of AC for the most part. Some enemies can only be beat by a rinse-and-repeat method of casting true strike, hitting the enemy from reach distance and withdrawing. Again, this is not my idea of having fun and a challenge",1703940868,1703940868,False,0,0,0.476381123065948486,0,True,False,False

Don't.

Great characters, challenging combat, not a fan of the fact that you have no banking system (shared stash doesn't count in my mind) but that's just because I like to hoard unique items that no one will ever use rather than sell them.",1703052902,1703924061,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With no prior knowledge of Pathfinder, I had some friends map out a character leveling guide. Boy am I glad they did because god damn this game is massive. There's about 8 million different options and perks and whatnot, which is both good and bad. I don't think I've played a game with more choices and varieties in character building, but the downside is there are a lot of trap perks which can lead to being screwed down the line in leveling. This is where my friends came in handy because they helped steer me in the right direction. 
 
Story and Dialogue-wise, this was one of my favorites of the year. Every dialogue had a plethora of different options based on your background, race, class, perks, faction, ect. It was absolutely awesome seeing the game take so much into account and giving the player so many options in conversations. The storyline of you becoming this leader of an army and leading them against the forces of evil was super cool and provided a ton of high pressure and impactful moments. You constantly have to make tough decisions and then as you move forward in the game you get to see the consequences and rewards of those choices. Having a party of 6 at a time allows for a large amount of variety in party composition as well as having them contribute to conversations. While I didn't find myself as attached to them as other games, they were all well written and I was constantly swapping them out in order to see what new things I could find. The plethora of options for character building also applied to companions, so the combinations and possible team combinations were truly endless. I can definitely see it being a game some people dump 100's of hours into just to see all the different team combinations they can make. 
 
Despite my overall love for most of what the game had to offer, the gameplay of Wrath of the Righteous is another story. If I had to describe that aspect of it, I would describe it as ""busy and grindy"". While having a great option to switch between real time with pause and turn based which I really loved, the sheer amount of pointless trash mobs the game throws at you was a little much. Some of the dungeons felt like they took forever just because you just go from fight to fight vs like 3 or 4 low level enemies entirely placed there to drain your spells and resources. One of the big set-piece battles of the first Act ended up taking me like 2 hours due to the sheer number of enemies on the screen and even turning it back to real time with pause didn't help much. Sometimes even the trash mobs would body you if you weren't adequately buffed up in your party so what seemed like an easy encounter could turn bad if you weren't careful in every single battle. The real main issue I had with the games grinding was the Army crusade mode. While it was pretty cool to control and build up an army to fight the demons, locking progress of the game behind it was a terrible decision in my opinion. It really ruined a lot of my enjoyment of the game when I was having a blast with the story, but I couldn't get to any more of it until I won a tough crusade battle that kept kicking my butt. Eventually I just gave up and turned on Auto-Crusade mode to get past it. I didn't even care that it locked me out of certain items and content in the game, I just wanted to get back to the parts of the game that I was enjoying. The later Acts of the game really soured my enjoyment of the game with how long they dragged on and towards the end I just wanted to be finished. 
 
While I didn't enjoy it as much as the Pillars of Eternity games, I would still say it was very good and would absolutely recommend it for people looking for good CRPGs to play. Owlcat Games continues to release strong games full of content and I am sure Rogue Trader will be more of the same with all of the companies strengths put into it.",1703907005,1703907005,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Good:
1. Storyline, as above.
2. Great music score. I literally haven't heard a music score this memorable outside of Final Fantasy and Warcraft.
3. The scope and breadth of this game is just about unbelievable. The number of options to customize your character are ridiculous and would be extremely daunting to a person unfamiliar with RPGs, but for a seasoned player, the options are endless.
4. It's obvious from 1 play through there are numerous paths to take, you could easily play this game 6-10 times, one for each Mythic path.

Dissapointments:
1. Lots of bugs. Skills just disappear for no apparent reason, ie kineticist basic blasts just disappeared one day so if I remove them from my quickbar I've got no way to use them. That would make this class unplayable if I accidentally remove them, or remove them on a respec. Also, characters don't always move when casting healing spells, despite having a move action available, wasting the spell, unless you happen to have a rod to turn it into a quicken spell AFTER ALREADY CASTING (thankfully doesn't use up another spell slot).
2. When you design a puzzle to only have 1 solution, make sure it actually only has 1 solution, or if it doesn't at least make both solutions allow progression. Failure to do this is in complete opposition to the spirit of this kind of game, where players should be encouraged to seek out alternate solutions to problems. You can tell they tried to develop the puzzle so there was only one solution, but failed (location: Forgotten Secrets).
3. They ""simplified"" the rules, ie for favored enemy. Yes, you know you'll be fighting a lot of demons, which are chaotic evil outsiders. So picking favored enemy of Evil Outsiders might make a character overpowered... but isn't that literally the point of playing a ranger or other class with this feature? And if I want to be an ooze hunting ranger who came to be a crusader, that's my right. Don't change the rules. They are already written down for you. Keep the game's rules as true to the tabletop as possible.

Weird:
1. Significant memory leak, or something. Runs smoothly when I restart the game, but after a while of playing, the more characters that come across the screen (?), the slower it gets, to the point that even scrolling through my companions with all their pets causes significant lag. As does opening inventory, killing a target, and all loading screens.
2. This issue is more with the pathfinder system itself. While the customizability options are endless, the system forces you to take certain feats, or the build will not be viable, ie ranged is going to require a minimum of point blank shot and precise shot or you're going to miss 20% more on top of your current miss %.
3. They chose alignments for their characters not based on who the character was, but rather what they wanted them to be. For example, Seelah is a LG paladin, so she can level up as a paladin, but based on how she acts, she is either NG or CG. It's an argument in favor of 5e, where classes are no longer alignment restricted. I just wish the option was available to players as well as NPCs to act outside of your alignment restrictions and still be able to level.
4. Kind of wish they left the Mythic paths until after you hit lvl 20, seems strange to get your first rank at like lvl 3, but it fits with the narrative, and if you wait until lvl 20, some of these classes already get unbelievable abilities. But it gives me ideas for my own home campaign.",1703432895,1703894011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Some of the most frustrating things are when you pass an athletics check when climbing or jumping over a chasm then turn around and fail the return check.

For those of you who aren’t familiar, be warned that Pathfinder is an infamously complicated and bloated system. Committing to playing this game means committing not only to hundreds of hours of gameplay, but also to a ton of time researching the system and testing builds. It’s not built for the idly curious or for those new to the genre.

To match this frustrating system, Owlcat produced a frustrating piece of software. WOTR is replete with bugs and poor at presenting information. Grappling with inventory management or buffing takes forever, and quality of life considerations are conspicuously absent. Worse, it has the same memory leak Kingmaker had, which slowly degrades performance over time.

Whilst the lore of the setting is deep and fascinating, dialogue is overly flowery and utterly endless. Every character in the game is a professional orator just waiting to give the most long-winded speech of their life at your simple inquiry. It all feels very contrived and eventually your eyes will start to glaze over at the sheer waffle.

Of course, for some, the above won’t be enough to dissuade you. You’ve read the words ‘100+ hour cRPG campaign’ and you’re salivating. It certainly wasn’t enough to dissuade me from taking on the challenge that this game represents. I wish it had been. What I wish I’d understood going in is that Owlcat is an exceptionally mean-spirited DM. 

Encounters are designed in an almost malicious way - putting spell resistance and true seeing on literally everything and peppering maps with unexpectedly overpowered enemies that only have one real counter. Didn't build a team with that counter? Guess you die.

You could say that this design is a consequence of turning a tabletop adventure path into a computer game, and that some awkwardness is going to come with the territory of accurate translation. But that excuse doesn’t cut it when Owlcat piles on the AC and saves for enemies beyond what was written in the content they’re adapting, and drastically increases the amount of encounters between rests.

Beyond feeling cheap and arbitrary, this ridiculous enemy stacking reduces the vaunted depth of the Pathfinder system to a puddle. Sure, you have a million options for customizing your character and party, but only incredibly focused builds have a chance at succeeding. A million options are meaningless if the game is designed in such a way that only a handful are viable.

I regret investing as much time as I did in WOTR. I feel that I should have learned my lesson from Kingmaker. Heck, [i]Owlcat[/i] should have learned their lesson from Kingmaker, but they just doubled down on the same bad choices. They can paint an amazing isometric map, but they can’t pace or balance a cRPG campaign to save their lives. It all falls apart in the execution.

Reviews of Rogue Trader raise the same issues. At this point, I'm going to learn my lesson, and  accept that this is how Owlcat make their games. They’re an exceptionally niche product with a lot of design choices that I find extremely aggravating, and as a result I can’t recommend them, even as a huge fan of isometric games.",1703847636,1703847636,False,6,0,0.571716248989105225,0,True,False,False

Firing into melee -4 to hit but its an huge minotaur fighting my pixie and I'm directly behind it, no matter -4 till you get this or that ability. No same buff stacking, why not?, again not particularly logical. Then 6 party members (I dont want 6! why cant i have 2 that would be tedious enough) plus a animal companion, mine was a somehow highly trained attack horse that behaves exactly as a party member in combat, nah tosh and nonsense.

I have been playing cRPGs since mid 90s with PS:T and BG series among my all time favourites and when I saw the high review scores for this game I was delighted. I waited to play this game for about a year and a half as I wanted to have a relatively bug free and balanced experience and I managed to get this game on half price a few weeks ago.

Now after having sunk 150 hrs in this game, I am 60% through but whatever I have accomplished so far could have easily been achieved within less than 15 hours.  Everything in this game takes too long, map activities are uninteresting and boring, not to mention that map conquest mechanics is a massive time-waster. There is also too much irrelevant, uninteresting and not so well written dialogue. This game takes two paragraphs to explain something that could have been conveyed in two lines. Another thing that bothers me massively is that your party members' dice roll results in '1' far too often than any other number. In my play through 39% of all my dice rolls resulted in a '1' and almost 85% of my dice rolls resulted in a single digit. I have never seen such loaded dice in any DnD game, there is definitely something going on with dice rolls, its not random or  fair by any stretch. 

All in all I am regretting buying (even at half  price) and playing (and sticking with) this game so far, I am no longer enjoying it. Where BG games are a 10 for me, this game is no more than a 6. This is a massive disappointment and giant time sucking black hole. I am 80% convinced of abandoning my campaign and moving on to another game. 

I cannot recommend this game to anyone as there are several other great games,  tv shows and movies out there, don't waste your time on this.

I have realised that this game drops off much of its flare past act 1 because following acts don't really bring anything new.

You will lose turns due to movement bugs, lose spell casts due to action bugs, have characters die because the move + action calculations don't work, have characters path off some weird way instead of just attacking. Spell targeting predictions are flat out broken - AoE spells that display only enemies being hit still manage to friendly fire your group despite them being outside of the circle, best part is when enemies who were predicted to be hit aren't.

Game's an overbloated mess but also there is nothing else like it.

Bugs: Buggy (2023 Enchanced Edition) Depends on everyone's individual bug tolerances. At times gets bad enough to where you need to restart the entire game.

Difficulty: Vast customization options to tailor your experience, however on every setting there are insane and completely random difficulty spikes (this was even worse in Kingmaker). You'll be relaxing killing demi-gods, then a tiger solo wipes your entire group.

Pen and paper RPG: 10/10 the best there is hands down, no competition - the build possibilities lie in the hundreds, if not thousands, enhanced by mythic paths.

Videogame RPG: Like Kingmaker, pathetic - there is barely any visual customization, you will be saving the world dressed in brown rags. They added a transmogrifying NPC after the complaints with Kingmaker, but there is barely anything to transmog.. Mythic paths offer nice additional visual details on your character.

Story: Ranges from laughably bad at lowest parts to incredible at it's best ones. Ending was bizarre - it just ends after the final boss, no celebrations, shoves 10 pages of circumstantial text in your face, back to main menu. Compared to the incredible ending Kingmaker had, which was truly spectacular, this is a wild letdown. Not worth the 100 hours it takes to get through this game.

Storytelling: Seperate from story, because the moment-to-moment story beats are, most of the time, infuriating, using some of the cheapest and worst writing tropes possible (enemies escape in the middle of fights, at worst just running away, at least 10 times, making the story feel incredibly contrived)

Companions: Completely one-dimensional stereotypes, no clue why people are saying the stories get interesting - none of them had any plot twists or actual development, what you see at hour one is what you get by hour hundred. Massive step down from Kingmaker, which focused on what makes magical DnD adventures so special - lovable gang of adventurers getting in trouble. The Sarkorian DLC companion for 14€ is good.

Graphics: Don't even try to play it with anything under RTX2000 series hardware, the game is a trainwreck due to the developers not having enough experience with Unity. I could finally play it after upgrading from GTX1080 to RTX3080ti, was otherwise unplayable even on medium. The graphics themselves range from modern effects to PS3 era textures. It can look truly awful at times, the world visuals are very lackluster. Indoors environments generally look very good.

Mythic paths: Very cool concept, done quite well, obviously didn't experience them all myself but looked up a lot of the others on Youtube.

The world: Mostly f*cking miserable, especially compared to the comfy Kingmaker. The external world is 90% miserable, poorly textured gray sand and rocks. Drezen (your fortress) is straight up depressing as f*ck, what a sh*thole, and everything there is spaced so far apart that you'll spend many hours of your playthrough just running between companions that you need to talk to.

World map: Absolutely miserable once again, the corruption mechanic, which was made to combat rest-spamming, is inane, forcing you to go back to Drezen across the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map after every single quest, I don't want to know how much time I wasted dragging my team back and forth, what a joke. Didn't mind how Kingmaker did it.

Crusade mechanics: Disable them, no debate, they are truly horrendous - after Kingmaker, it's incomprehensible why they doubled down on this disaster, instead of using those dev resources on making the actual game worth playing. If you want the extra gear and mini story without the hassle, use mods to auto-resolve the battles. Ironically enough, they didn't take parts people liked from the Kingmaker's system, and built upon management with new and worse features in WotR. Fever dream sh*t... If you turn it off, you will miss out some things, however looking at the completion rate of this game sitting at 11% of players, the alternative most likely means you'll quit anyways, so take the net positive.

Other general notes:
The quest journal/log is an absolute travesty, what reviews have said - it feels like a poorly written and organized travel blog, half the time leaving you to google what you need to do next, at worst hardlocking you out of quests.
The puzzles are horrendous, 100% google material, otherwise they can end up taking anywhere from 2 to 10 hours each. If puzzles are meant to be a supplemental aspect of games, not an overly convoluted trap that kills pacing, then this is the worst offender in gaming quite possibly.
The dialogue writing can, at times, be absolutely painful, as ACG said in his review, basically 21st century slang ""yo-and-behold!"".
Audio and OST are great, a few mixing issues here and there but generally enjoyable.

I don't like having to read a ton of dialogue to develop to story myself, game should be 100% narrated. The game is also complex to start as there are too many choices at the character creation screen, and if you build your character wrong you probably will have a bad time in the game. On top of that, picking the wrong feats will further hurt your character and build so new players will probably need a guide for their entire first play. Difficulty levels being super easy isn't a real solution to how obtuse the game is. Graphically it's not appealing at all, these graphics are from early 2000s.

No matter how you want to role-play and write your own story, this game can meet the needs of the numerous professions in Pathfinder.

Disadvantages: There are still many bugs in the game update, and some skills do not match the description, which cannot be implemented. Some scenes have serious monster accumulation, which seriously slows down the game process. The resources available in the early stage of the game are too limited, and later overflow. Optimizing in scenes with many elements is worrying, and it can develop into a female teammate in a romantic relationship. The identity background and actions are too abstract, which is despicable.

Nothing game-breaking (yet), just really annoying things like when you select info on an enemy unit and it gives you info on some other unit instead. Basic stuff like that.
  
If you have a problem with billionaire Larry Fink's statement that, ""You have to force behaviours"", then you might have a problem with this game.

The voice acting... is kinda meh.  Maybe it gets better, but so far it's immersion breaking.  I mean like, two characters are talking - one sounds like they're in an open field, the other in a tin can.  Basic stuff like that.  On the plus side, the game has the option to turn it off, which I likely will end up doing.

The game's still being updated regularly (every couple of weeks or so), and that's a good thing, but the update download sizes (at least for me on Steam) have been MASSIVE 7.5 GB packages.  All to supposedly fix a handful of minor bugs each time.  That may or not be important to you.

What kind of game is it?  As others have said, BG3 is more like DoS2.  This game is more like BG2, except... more.

But after playing for over 200 hours, I do feel obliged to actually review it. This game is completely incredible, but to start with the negatives, you absolutely don't want to play this if you haven't played Pathfinder before. The primary flaw is how difficult it is. I generally play one difficulty level above Normal, and it is absolutely unreal at times (enemies with thousands of HP and 70 AC). There's a challenge, and then there's unfairness and it strays into being unfair very often. It also outright cheats a lot, with enemies casting more spells than they should be able to in single turns, or casting spells they shouldn't have access to yet, and it feels pretty bad to get hit for 130 damage when the toughest member of your party has 70 health.

If you can push through that, the game is an absolute blast. It's unique and immersive. Exploring the main story and companion stories was riveting and rewarding at nearly every moment.

It looks and sounds beautiful; the story is a wonderfully written power-fantasy on the lines of Throne of Bhaal; it's immense in scope; the characters are interesting and well written and the romances are engaging; there's dozens of character builds, varying pathways through the game with a host of endings and content. I've played 140 hours and have barely scratched the surface.

There's a few small negatives, for sure. It was buggy as all hell on release, which is standard for an Owlcat game. Most of these have long been patched, but some remain and new ones have been created with the newly released DLC content. There's some questionable design decisions, such as the backer-created content that at times is jarring in it's lack of quality compared to the bulk of the game. Some quests are timed but don't tell you, others aren't timed but pretend that they are. There's so much loot you can get lost in it - I've regularly found an entire two hour play session being dedicated to rummaging through the loot I've acquired over a handful of quests and re-equipping the party, and you end up with so much gold it's worthless, as there's nothing much to do with it.

You start off by making a character and the profile pictures are all... terrible. I had no idea you could screw up profile pictures this badly but they made them extremely racially and class specific so if you make a fighter you'll have 3 choices that might not look like anything you wanted to look like, the wrong race, gender, look whatever. They then give you 8 or so voices for your character and they all suck or are VERY specific. Aggressive is amusing but you'll sound like an orc or a barbarian. Wise is the only one that's actually well rounded and decent but he goes on and on about 'learning and knowledge' so he's really only appropriate for a caster and a sagely one at that.

In short, I can't make my character look or sound like I wanted, great... how are the companions and their voice acting?

Holy hell, the companions voices are even worse. They are all voiced by Californian interns. They don't even try to sound classy, Shakespearn, or even accent neutral Broadway accent which isn't hard to do by the way, they just talk like a bunch of contemporary table top nerds. The dialogue matches the terrible voice acting and I had to stop and question if I want to keep playing listening to them.

How about the story? It's awful so far. First 3 hours they don't explain the setting, they drop you in it and before you have time to learn ANYTHING about it they blow it up around you. This happens in 1 minute of playing by the way. I have no idea what I'm supposed to feel. I guess shocked but the cartoon characters that are my companions deflate any tension destroying the setting right away does.

I assume the complexity is the point, but to be honest, even as someone who is willing to spend hours researching builds before playing a game, it's still too much to really engage with.

Perhaps if you have already played alot of pathfinder it makes more sense.

The combat itself has thus far been a slog. Spells don't recharge among other ""fun"" tabletop DnD mechanics, so you burn through them quickly or never use them. As far as I can tell there aren't consistent cantrips that do more than normal attacks. So despite having a warlock, a monk, a warrior, a rogue, a cleric in my party, everyone just auto attacks over and over, missing most times until the enemy is dead. It's just not engaging

Again, the story has been fine, I kinda like it. But to be honest, the whole ""you can become an angel or other semi-deity!"" thing is a little lost on me. I prefer more grounded stuff with clearer stakes.",1703303088,1703303088,False,2,0,0.429299384355545044,0,True,False,False

I was hesitant to purchase this game because I wasn't sure if my ThinkPad E480 would be able to handle it. So I gladly took advantage of a free trial offered by Owlcat this past weekend. Running this game through Steam compatibility on Ubuntu 22.04 with integrated graphics (playing on 720p, shadows disabled), I can report no crashes and no persistent performance issues. I am using RTwP mode, as that is my preference, so I cannot speak to performance in TB mode. 
Content: 
So far, I'm having a lot of fun with this game. There is something unexpectedly refreshing about it. Exploration and  situations/encounters are aspects I highly value in games, and I am very satisfied with WotR on that level. I genuinely appreciate the sparse cinematics and sometimes campy dialogue. It's really just a game. I know I will never be the master of the Pathfinder ruleset, so I'm using builds posted by my favorite streamer, generally playing on hard and lowering the difficulty if needed. But generally, there is some buff out there that will drastically alter the course of battle in your favor.
Biggest negative: 
The crusade army aspect is breaking my momentum <- being polite.

The level of customisation you have for your character is unparalleled, but may also be daunting for new players at the character creation screen. Do not worry though, as you will be able to respec your character later in the game.

Its combat mechanics are very similar to Baldur's Gate 1&2, which helped me get used to it much more quickly than the average player. Unless you are role-playing or have played similar games before, I suggest looking up a guide for your first playthrough for viable builds to ensure you don't ruin your experience since the difficulty ramps up quite quickly if you don't know what you are doing.Still, it is a lot less complicated than its predecessor Kingmaker.

Therefore, I recommend players interested in the Pathfinder series to start with this game as the tutorials are a bit more streamlined than Kingmaker. Once you feel comfortable with the Pathfinder combat mechanics, you can then proceed to get Kingmaker as well for a separate Pathfinder campaign to satiate your desire for more Pathfinder.

It does everything you'd want an isometric CRPG to do: it has very solid writing, well-drawn characters, a good main story, interesting subplots, smooth game-play, infinite character customisation, slick presentation and a real heart. In terms of the basic elements, it's all there - and doing all the basics well is NOT easy. So I take my hat off to Owlcat. I hope they're proud of what they've done here, because they should be.

It's not perfect, though, there are some problems. First up is the fussiness of the combat. It's easily the worst aspect of the game. Challenging combat is fine, it's the *amount* of it, with the constant pre-buffing and micromanaging, that gets tiring, even for someone who, like me, enjoys tactical combat. There's really far too much combat in the game. Half of it could easily be cut. In addition, the game's final area is tough in a really irritating, spammy way; the ending feels sudden and rather weak - scant reward for the obstacles I'd overcome; and the puzzles are dreadful. The funny thing is, these problems - these exact problems - were also present in Kingmaker. But Owlcat haven't learned much from that, apparently. If anything, they've doubled down. 

Speaking of Kingmaker, that game revived a genre many people (myself included) thought was dead. An impressive trick - so how to build on it and prevent it from going stale? The 'mythic path' mechanic is a new idea - and a good one. 'Crusade mode' (a resource management / board-game battler ""game within a game"") is a more divisive innovation. I liked it; if you don't, it can be switched off. But the question is: are these additions enough to keep the formula fresh and the player base hungry for more? 

On balance, I'd say yes. If you haven't played Kingmaker, I'd recommend this with enthusiasm - just know that your patience will be tested along the way. If you have played Kingmaker, it's basically more of the same but bigger and better.

Damage resistances to weapons can be overcome the following ways (DR Magic/+1 weapon or above) (DR Cold Iron/+2 weapon or above) (DR Adamantine/+3 Magic weapon or above) (DR Alignment/+5 weapon or above) (DR -/Cannot be ignored generally).  You get more attacks as you attack bonus increases.  Basically once you get to +6 you get an additional attack that gets only a +1 (So -5) to hit, and this happens again every time it goes up by +5 again. Your Defenses against attacks are based on several sources, some of which can stack and some of which can't.  These Include Sacred, Deflection, Armor, Natural Armor and more.   Spells use a different defense than weapons called touch defense when attacking but generally also have lower bonuses.  If you move farther than 1/3ish your movement you can only make one attack so using a mount is advised for Melee.   If you use ranged attacks you have to boost both your Strength and Dexterity.  Composite bows allow you to add your strength to damage (You generally do not add strength otherwise).  You must take specific feats to use dexterity on melee weapon attacks.   Certain enemies can drain your abilities (Make you weaker, less Dexterity etc). These can be restored by resting or spells (Some can only be solved by spells). Certain NPC clerics can do this for you.  Level drain gives you -1 to everything equal to the amount of level drain.  Lots of conditions have lesser conditions like Staggered instead of paralyzed.  Over over things (Enemy portraits in combat).  Right click to see all.   Watch for immunities to conditions.   Very complicated game but fun once you start to understand things.

If you surprise enemies your team get one action each, so use it to cast combat buffs if they don't have good attacks or try to finish one enemy.

The game is not utterly bad, but not engaging enough for me to spend more hours on it. Generally they improved on Kingmaker when it comes to gameplay, but writing and plot has gone downhill. And since the game is heavy on text, I want that text to have some decent quality.

The good: 
Combat - The game is filled with spells and potions and overwhelming number of possible approaches to combat. It also usually punishes you for overusing resting, so you do need to think strategically and not abuse the mechanic (I played on ""Daring"", just below the ""Core"" difficulty). The clunky UI doesn't make tactics easy on you, but still I had most fun when clearing dungeons and leveling up.
Duck - You can have a duck familiar. That has to count for something.

The meh:
Music - Makes Jeremy Soul's stuff memorable
Graphics - It's not bad, but also not impressive. Plus some things that look like they just upscaled the old Infinity Engine (A powerful gnome leader looks like a starved child, ""rotund halfling"" is as skinny as all other halflings etc.)
Mechanics - I understand it's an uncreative copy of a ruleset, but critically failing dice rolls on things like ""Knowledge (Religion)"" seem quite asinine
Crusade - In chapter 2 it was quite limited, but felt alright (like a dumbed down version of HoM&M). As soon as I saw Chapter 3 I got PTSD from Kingmaker and it made me not bother with it. But it can be turned off somewhere in settings.

The ugly:
Horse - Uhm who the hell saw this and said ""Yeah, great idea! Let's implement it!""? Basically you & companions can ride horses. Everywhere. You enter a strawhut and you can ride around the two square meters on a horse. Applies to any dungeon, too. Apparently your horse even sleeps in your bedroom if it's your character's. It got so ridiculous I used a cheat to respec Selaah to get rid of it.

Plot - It's so grotesquely epic I almost miss the stupid Feys from Kingmaker. It feels like Fantaghiro on steroids, you get angels, demons, devils from the get go. Overwhelmingly fairy taley. ""Plot twists"" are completely generic and basically barely even twists.

Companions & Writing- They seem like designed and written by the same (untalented) person. Everyone talks a lot without saying anything. They range from dull to stupid and usually are just archetypes. I only liked Regill, mostly because he talked the least. The rest sounded like a cringy nerd (Lann, Nennio) or an outright moron (Seelah, Sosiel, Ember). Sense of humour is completely gone, replaced by stating the obvious in sarcastic voice. Probably the first casualty of Worldwound.
The same applies to most NPCs you meet: they just keep droning about uninteresting things. Dialogues are often non-sensical because they try to categorize everything into ""Chaos/Law and Evil/Good"" and it all ends up being very childish.

Controls - Another brainfart by devs. I am sure lot of people hated ""left mouse button for everything"" in Kingmaker, as it often meant you accidentally cancelled your spells or broke your characters off melee... just because you misclicked (easy to do with swarms where the correct pixels are anyone's guess). So in WOTR they added RMB support - which mirrors functionality of the LMB, so basically doesn't solve the original problem.

Never got bored or frustrated with it even when some bugs occurred, but wanted to take a break and wait for them to patch things up and replay it in half a year. Heard good things about Wrath of the Righteous from MandaloreGaming and MortismalGaming and got interested.
After a 110 hours of playtime I am sick of it. Playing it on Normal difficulty, because I was told that is good for beginners. The only thing that got me going this far was the story, but I am at the end of Chapter 4 and I don't think I care any more.
Coming from BG3:
- The combat is slooooooww and extremely over-complicated, there are a ton of modifiers, multiple types of defenses, multiple types of buffs in multiple categories, and you have to pay attention which stacks which doesn't
- The frickin buffs have time limits, so you are reapplying them all the time, especially after rests.
- There are just too many cannon fodder enemies and useless combat scenarios. While in BG3 each combat encounter had some reason behind it, here a lot of them are just a waste of time. Like travelling on the world map and ups comes a random encounter.
- The Abyss is atrocious hard to navigate hellhole. Sure I understand it is a madness realm, but come on this is a game. It isn't fun to rotate the camera like a lunatic, when I know exactly where I want to go. Also no quest markers, nothing, you can just find the places where you need to be. Have fun.
- The crusade mechanic is garbage. It does nothing just waste a ton of time to move your stupid units around the map and fight annoying, badly implemented Heroes fights. Horrible. If it was cut, nobody would have noticed.
- Everything is over-complicated. Why do we need so many classes and sub-classes? Why so many spells and effects, counter-spells etc? When I have 30+ different spells, each for a specific purpose, then I realize, well it doesn't matter, because if you haven't focused in certain aspects for your character the spells won't go through spell resistance, then they don't hit through ability checks etc... So much nonsense. It really isn't fun to read the logs and figure out why what I did has failed. 

Even the story which could be the saving grace is rather lackluster compared to BG3. None of the characters have comparable depth to any in BG3. The backstories aren't interesting. The quest rewards are boring. The big plot is kinda interesting and I would like to see the end, but it is so stretched out and dropped fed to me so slowly that I feel like my life is slipping away.

Stat inflation is not how you design a game.
Letting every enemy start with free permanent buffs that they don't have to cast is not how you design a game.
I shouldn't have to roll 20s to hit every enemy on the grossly mislabeled ""Core"" difficulty.
The enemies shouldn't have to roll 1s to miss my high AC fighters. 
Enemies shouldn't have 20+ saves and 30+ SR at the same time.
This game was balanced around Story difficulty, clearly, otherwise the game journalists wouldn't have been able to get far enough to review it. 
This is why gatekeeping is important to the gaming community.
It's a shame, too. Despite the glaringly woke characters, I don't mind the story too much. But between how unplayably buggy my favorite class was at the start. and how many glaringly obvious day 1 bugs have never been fixed, I still somewhat enjoy it.

First, ""campaign mode"" is ridiculously difficult and unsatisfying. Winning every battle made no difference, and in both parts of the game morale would begin to plummet for no obvious reason, and by the end it would be critically low. If you've seen the guides to campaign mode, you've seen that they are extremely long and complicated. I don't want to play games where a huge part is akin to AP calculus. 

Second, the romance element is great up until you consummate the relationship, but after that there is no...relationship. Your lover isn't by your side all the time. There's no conversation. IIRC, there isn't even a follow up ""and they lived happily ever after"" sort of thing in the epilog. To be honest, it felt very much like a dude's perspective, in that the whole goal seems to be bedding someone, and once you've bedded them they no longer matter. Since you have to rest periodically anyway, it would have been awesome if instead of listening to random companions repeat conversations you've already heard a dozen times, you could have cuddle mode/chat time with your partner, and you could make it as long or as short as you like. There are so many missed opportunities here. (Have the authors ever actually been in a good relationship? Or even a bad one?)

And then there's the fact that the whole premise and plot of the game makes no sense. She opened the world wound because...what? Demons invade our plane for what reason exactly? What's up with the halfling scholar again? And, at least in Azata mode, the Commander's Court storylines and characters are annoying as hell. I wish you could put a muzzle on Aivu. Aivu is the Jar-Jar Binks of Pathfinder.

Also, all the different classes and skills feel like overkill. But if you're into TTRPGs, maybe you love having all those choices.

There were some things I did like, such as the quality of life features in terms of looting and inventory management and that you can freely switch between turn based and real time with pause combat. However the game just has a dull presentation for me. The prologue section makes you think there will be a lot of voice acting but there really isn't unless its main missions or you meeting your companions for the first time. Most of the time you have to read a lot of text which I don't mind in games, but a lot of the writing can feel very long winded and dull to read imo. The combat also is very party based where you have to buff your party before going into battle but most of your spells have a limited use per day, which I know is part of the tabletop version, but its just not fun for me in a video game setting.

BG3 is more a bit less complicated in terms of customization due to having more classes and sub-classes. There are still the main three specializations of caster, melee, and ranged builds but there's, I believe, 26 classes compared to BG3's 12. Each class in Pathfinder has like 5-6 subclasses (or archtypes as the game calls them). It seems that most classes have some kind of choice at most levels, whether it's a general feat selection every 2 levels or a specialized archtype/class choice in-between. Levels go until 20 by default, I believe, so again there's a bit more depth to customization. There's also builds that aren't present in BG3 like mounted combat, which was cool. There was also an option for real time combat (with pause) or turn based combat, which I really liked. I am 50/50 on whether I liked the fact that you used your parties skills for checks, rather than only the selected character. It's a quality of life feature, but when combined with the 6 character party+animal companions (which have their own feats, skills, and customization!) it leads to one-dimensional gameplay where you just build your party to cover ALL the bases. I like that, but I guess it's much less interesting than BG3 where you can't build a super team that can handle everything at the right time, at least not as easily. I think a good compromise would be allow you to switch to another character in dialogue in BG3, so it's not as important who you started the conversation with. 

The story, companions, graphics don't compare favorably to BG3, but aren't bad. I feel like you really get a different, but similar, vibe playing this game. I think that's due to Wrath of the Righteous trying to faithfully replicate tabletop game play. YMMV, but if you want another game to scratch that classic RPG itch then this and/or Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire are both great games that didn't generate the same broad level of hype.

Looking back through the logs to see what stats I can improve after hours of gameplay only to realize the average ""dice roll"" on a d20 is 6. Not much I can buff when scum saving against a DC 15 with a +12 only to get two 2s and a 1. I was trying not to, but after realizing the terrible skew that higher difficulty just changes the dice rolls, I stopped caring.

Otherwise game is extremely .. average. Story is interesting, and it scratches the table top game itch that I do not get to scratch as much as I would like. I get to be the paladin charging into demons of ye old fantasy. Unless I haven't taken my arbitrary nap for the day.
Learning curve can be steep, as the game does not explain an abundance of aspects. But you can pseudo course correct during gameplay.  
I only give the game a thumbs up for current sale. Do not buy full price. If you have to choose a new isometric RPG to play and you're thinking this of the newest loot grinding game (the demon game that does nothing for the feel of the story) then choose this.

The more I play the game .. the more I am considering the thumbs down. There is A LOT that simply does not work or is extremely janky. Down to flat out stupid.


Never mind. I had recommended the game at first, but there is just WAY too much wrong. Rolling 5d6 for damage, no damage reduction with a failed save by target, deals 3 damage. I kept the screenshot for it cause the games inner calculator is just abysmal. Consistently does not account for total caster levels when rolling damage, and ignores supposed minimums.
Caster level 12, level 4 spell deals 1d6  per caster level, damage roll of 2d6 for a total of 4 damage. Where are the other d6s at?? 
The Crusade mode is just really bad. I mean, if you have ever played a total war game, it tries to be that on the grand map, but it just ends up functionally terrible. Story quickly fell off in Act 3 and stopped flowing forward. If I can deal with the terrible mechanics I want to at least finish the game, but I am already just skipping mass dialogue cause it became so meandering and boring.


I have not even bothered to get back to the game. I YouTubed a couple endings based off my choices. Realized I was hours beyond a point of no return to miss the ending I was going for.

I enjoy this game sometimes and I want to get through it. It has similar problems to their first game.
Great setup, and I actually like the management aspect. The problem is the encounters.  They are dull.  You get thrown in immediately to demons and fight throngs continually, all with slightly different names (but essentially the same creature).

The stat bloat is incredible and it detracts from the actual gameplay.  You will go round a corner and suddently there is an enemy that takes out the party with a poison etc (so you need to have a poison protection spell continually cast on your party).

Owlcat cant design encounters.  And I have bought 3 of the games.  Perhaps this is a review of me as a consumer",1701800244,1701800244,False,52,13,0.727849960327148438,0,True,False,False

You can create a ton of really interesting and viable builds and the mythic paths allow for a lot of variety, both mechanically and regarding their impact on the story. My biggest complaint would be that there's a segment of the game where you move troops around to unlock locations, and it gets a little tedious at times. I believe there is an option to mostly disregard that part of the game, but I think that in doing so you do end up with less access to items and resources. Luckily you really only have to deal with that for one act of the game! Besides that I really only have great things to say about it.

from 8 differnt mythic paths with 1-3 differnt ways to play though that all effect the ending this game is HUGE its been deemed as the spirual successor to Baldurs Gate 1-2,  and by many is considerd to be the TRUE Baldurs Gate 3
Hey Look in these days most game critics journalist and reviewers tend to jump from one extreme to another and make huge exaderations with little everdence and if ppl point out flaws if the normal responce is GIT GUD or such its a childish community
its clear that Larian Studios / WotC and many game critics journalist lied about that game and many of there fans did awhile ago attack this game attempting to derail and taunt and harass fans of this game for one reason or another
BG3 released unfinished which hurt the story and gameplay, with cut content to its story to dumb choices to soft locks hard locks very little customization in that game among alot of other things, They Censorship and attempt troll,  where is the 17k endings Larian promised? Oh right that was a lie, BG3 Faithful to BG1-2? No

WotR IS The True Spirtual Sucessor to Baldurs Gate 1-2
you start off as someone in over your head much like in Baldurs Gate 1
you end up being this powerful deity of your choice much like in BG2
over 300 class choices all of which work and while unfair diff may be hard due to how large and massive this game is, people are still figuring stuff out and builds on this game to this day, whats that think Tower Shield Spec is weak? think again can legit 1-20 it on unfair diff without needing to super min max via Aoen mythic path

but yes this is a grown up game your required to read and make mature choices not eveything is going to go your way or be to your liking, the companions and romances are deep and REAL Character traits, not like in some other CRPGS out there or like BG3

again the biggest flaw of this game is also its biggest strength, its a truely massive large RPG
its huge its large and in charge to the point people feel over whelmed when they get into it

Try something basic if your feeling super over-whelmed or try something you may enjoy and try custom differculty to something like normal diff or lower if this is your first time on a large CRPG

the other flaw 2 flaws with this game i see is as follows
1) the crusade management system is kinda dull if you ask me,  I Get why its there it dos add to the story among other things but its kinda basic, but then again we shouldnt have a RTS Complex nature to this game or some such or even a Turn Base Strat game, i dont think the RTS Genras are doing well coz i dont think ppl understand how true RTS Work and what knock, but thats besides the point,  This is kinda dull becouse i get it, they didnt want to over whelm you / make it to complex it is vastly differnt from the normal game play, good story elements and such to it but still
2) Unfair diff, look I dont mind playing some games on the hardest diff, i have beaten this on unfair via console and such however I Dispise it,  Its not fun in my option and the biggest reason is the amount of pre-buffing and such you have to do b4 combat,

Luckly there are ways above the 2,  via Mods or just having it on super easy diff or something like that for point 1,  But I like to base things on say no mods allowed and then let you figure out how mods work,  unless the game itself is meant to be modded or have tons of custom content, example Solasta Crown of the Magister has a custom campaign manager that i can understand being modded and complex and such to enjoy,  By the Way I Do think outside of graphics and voice acting even Solasta Crown of the magiser is better then Baldurs Gate 3,  if you want a simple none complex game that is better writen and better gameplay mechs then BG3 go play Solasta,  WotR is a complex game and its massive

Look I Get it, people love to bandwagon and just jump on one big point going IT JUST WORKS ITS JUST FUN! If a game truely is awesome you shouldnt be having problems naming good specifics points that are true, none of these Lies and misinfomation BG3 Fans / Critics / Larian Studios / Wizards of the Coast / Influencers out there have been cought saying and claiming.

I Was a big fan of the original Baldurs Gate games,  Yes even Baldurs Gate EE had controversy from removing FMV to other gameplay mechs and yes I am sour at Baldurs Gate 3, and its fan base, which has proven itself to be toxic  giving out death threats and harassment to anyone who points out any of the bugs problems or issues that game clearly has, and when they attack this game about a month ago it was just nonesence

the latest update made even more content to this already massively large huge game
again the biggest flaw i have is just how massive it is
these days when your 30+ years old with 40 not far away you dont have alot of time to be able to just sit there and play the game all the time, luckly or unlucky for me, I dont have much of a love life no wife or kids so i do have more time then normal

Still
This game is truely an Epic Adventure
Prepare yourself and I Do highly recommend you become a more Vet player of CRPGS / RPGS in generol b4 taking on this truely masterclass Epic RPG

This belongs to be with the Classics and masterpieaces the TRUE Classics and masterpieaces like Planescape Torment and others,  Not Baldurs Gate 3 and the farse that fan base has shown itself to be, not this lets jump from one band wagon to another and give out death threats to peeps who point out how BG3 released unfinished how alot of its story content is cut and how t he story that is in that game is not so good, or its gameplay features how the camera gets stuck in that game or the unit pathing that is terrible

if your a true vet of RPGS you prob know wtf im talking about
This game? Is Massive expect to spend about 300 hours or more on your first playthough on norm differculty
if you know what class you wanna be and all that jazz turn it down on a easyer diff tune down crusader mode or such you can get it down to 150 hours
for me it took almost 350 hours on my first playthough
granted other playthoughs come by quicker
and admitly i am enjoying the PC version mroe mostly coz of my illness and such  easyer to control things and what knock

This Game is a Blessing
Pillers of Eternity
Disco Elysium and other CRPGS from TRUE Indie companys are pumping out the true Masterpieaces out there
yes Larian isnt a indie company they have multible places to visit them spent over 150+ Million dollars on there game aparently wasnt enough to add in basic features like a day night cycle or dramatic weather effects or such
while solasta / Wotr which spent between 1-5 million dollars give or take at launch was a ble to have all thouse features and much more
granted I wouldnt put Solasta in the masterclass CRPG but i do think its a fun CRPG none the less

WotR? Masterclass,  But for the true Vets of CRPGERS not thouse game critics influencers who only wanna jump from one bangwagon ask for your likes subs hit that bell coz all they care about is popularity and jumping from one bangwagon kiddie case to another
I remeber Elden Ring getting 11 out of 10 oh yeah save file curroption screen tearing which was confirmed by a mature fromsoft prevent it from being that high but the fans refused to admit thouse issues

Major Name Studios / Games out there like WotC / Larian / EA and many others realy cant be trusted for one reason or another

This? is Top Quality content and shoulda been given the 150 + Million dollars to make there next game

yes I get i vented @ BG3 a bit and such but its important for you to understand my history and what i mean

Pathfinding:  0/10.  Godawful.  The original baldurs gate is a thousand years advanced from what this game does.  Your characters will take the dumbest and nonsensical route in 100% of situations.  For the love of god never let your characters move on their own by clicking on an enemy because they will zigzag in order to provoke the maximum number of attacks of opportunity possible.  I have never played a game with worse pathfinding/movement.

Difficulty: 3/10.  I am rating this low because I think the game is obnoxiously ""difficult"" and by ""difficult"" I mean tedious.  Opponents are absurd in number and have monstrous stats compared to you at the level you encounter them.  Levelling in this game is a torturous process because this game is extremely stingy with xp despite the fact that most fights that give even  a tiny amount of xp are so balanced against you are going to spend 90% of your time prebuffing.

It would be already worth it for a single run, but the game offers so many choices that you will inevitably find yourself replaying it to try other paths of the story, builds, companions and chance at finding secrets. There is a lot to be missed.

The only conns in my book are the complexity of the system, it can be a little overwhelming to inexperienced player, although easier difficulties remove a lot of those concerns. And the little interaction players can have with the environment in battles, if you are comming from BG3 you might miss that experience.

I really enjoyed this game for the first 80 hours (after spending 5 hours watching guides).  The next 80 were a bit of a slog. Towards the end, playing felt like a job. That's when I stopped. 160 hours in and I was only about 60% done with the game. I was doing all the side quests to be fair.

I played on medium difficulty and it was just the right amount of challenging. Since most of your play time will be spent reading (this game is verbose even for a CRPG), setting difficulty lower would not significantly reduce play time.

You can significantly speed up play time by skipping side quests, but you can't skip them all as you will be underleveled for the main quests and you will not have money to fund your army.

Crusade mode is a refined version of army management from Kingmaker, but I found it to be so frustrating that I quit the game. It is almost nothing like the first act of the game as a top down crpg and is more like grid-based battles a la Heroes of Might and Magic. I hated it so so very much. It wasn't fun for me, and I want to warn folks that this is a significant portion of the game. 

Yes, you can turn on the setting to auto-complete battles. Yes, you can find mods to make the difficulty trivial. This is what fans of the game will tell you if you complain. But make no mistake, crusade mode is a huge part of the game and slogging through it, whether ""easy"" or not, is unavoidable. Even if you try the strategies above, you WILL miss content that is only available during the full crusade mode.

It was a very unnecessary blunder, but probably not the ppls fault who built this amazing game, which has since then only impressed me. So i changed it back to positve.

Some of that ""old friends getting together for a session"" vibe is kind of present with this one, more so than the atrocious Kingmaker. However, the writers do not respect your intelligence, time, or choices. 

There are countless times where pushing along the story is far more important than your choices, freedom, or intelligence. Railroading is to be expected in an CRPG, but there are far better ways of doing things than blatant cheating, theft of agency, and making the character deliberately stupid/ignorant/unobservant at key moments. Avoiding spoliers, all I will say is:

1. If I encounter something major in one area, I should be able to make preparations or contingencies against it. Especially when I am ""in charge"".
2. If you aren't supposed to defeat the entry-level BBEG, don't make me fight them and then blatantly cheat to ensure a loss. Demonstrate their power on an NPC (perhaps in a cutscene) and give the PC something achievable. No one likes to be slapped in the face with the DM's d*ck.
3. The same above except with escaping NPCs. Do this sort of thing without blatant cheating or not having a player directly face them. For both 2+3 - if you are so hung up on the story, write a book or a screenplay.
4. Optimize the dang game. Don't make updates for purchasable extra content and DLCs mandatory unless you actually buy it.
5. Fix the bugs. In a vanilla game, I still have instances where characters cease all movement. Never again to do so unless they receive a freedom of movement spell or item. I had to download a mod to ""cheat"" to give myself items and/or the spell to allow me to use certain characters that I wanted.

Be prepared to read A LOT of text.  This game is basically a novel.  Very little voice acting.  Which is fine in most cases, I've played tons of games in the past without voice acting, but the writing isn't engaging in the least.  I found myself skipping and skimming through, just so I could get to the point of whatever was important to the quest.  
Also, why are the class descriptions referred to as ""She""?  Majority of gamers are male, and I'd be very surprised if this games player base, was overwhelmingly female.

The story is rather enjoyable also, of course. I would wager you wouldn't struggle to find a favourite companion to help influence their story on your adventures in this game or the previous, Kingmaker. Come join the war of Golarion to hold back the demonic hordes once more. Perhaps even achieve greater than each crusade before.

On top of that it seems to me like they learned a lot from Kingmaker, making most of the needlessly frustrating encounters/areas optional while maintaining a very configurable difficulty management meta-wise. 

Story-wise I think it's pretty much as good it's just a different subject matter so it might seem a tad more black and white for some I guess. Overall if you like Kingmaker or Pathfinder this should be a nobrainer. If you like CRPGs there's a good chance you'll like this one as well.

Pros:
- A lot of mechanical options for building your character
- A lot of choices that needs to be made (influences the plot at least a little bit)
- Very pretty for an isometric CRPG imo

Cons:
- Anything above normal difficulty is for min-max masochists
- Some quests seems to be very stretched out to make the game feel longer without significant payout.

I love Mortismal Gaming on youtube and he knows a lot about CRPGs and recommended this. I picked it up was overwhelmed by the character creation screen. I definitely spent over an hour in there just trying to figure things out. I ended up just dropping the game completely in favor of other game releases. However, I really wanted to hop into a CRPG again and decided to give it another try and I am glad I stuck with it. I ended up using a build found online made for beginners and would recommend that if you are feeling the same way I did. As of writing this I am 24 hours in and although there are a lot of QOL things that BG3 does better, I would say that this game is able to compete by having deeper systems, mythic quests that allow you to take your character from being a nobody to being a powerful divine entity of good or evil or somewhere in between, great music, great story and an interesting universe to learn about. As I mentioned, I have put some time into this and I do not see the end of Act 1 in sight yet. I think there are 6 total not including the DLC which appears to have 1 or 2 more (I could be wrong about this). Anyhow, my point is there is a lot of content here. You can see from the other reviewers that they spend hundreds of hours with it. 

I highly recommend especially if you feel a little empty after going through BG3 and want something new to sink your teeth into.

Big mistake because WotR is a huge improvement and one of the best CRPGs I've ever played, comparable to other legendary games like BG2/BG3 or Neverwinter Nights.

The premise is simple. You are the chosen one and have to lead a crusade against a demon horde in a corrupted land. Despite the simple premise of the story, the characters, dialogue, companions and narrative are all fantastic. The story also has 10 different routes you can take through it, giving this game very high replayability. One playthrough you can be a righteous crusader on a quest to stop all evil, on another you can become a lich and lead your army of skeletons to conquer the demons land. The routes not only change the story, but they also give you access to crazy new skills and spells, making the gameplay different between each route as well. There is also a large amount of alignment and route based dialogue. The gameplay systems are also fantastic. There are around 25 classes with 161 subclasses, giving this some of the best character building systems to ever exist in a CRPG.

The kingdom management is back, but it's executed well unlike in Kingmaker. There's also a strategic element where you need to form armies and defeat enemy armies on your map. It plays a lot like HoMM3 which is a good thing, but it can be difficult to manage early on. You can disable it if you don't want to deal with it.

The only big issue I have with the game is the the balance. WotR is one of the most poorly balanced video games I've ever played. From the end of Act 2 onwards all enemies will have insanely high AC and they will attack twice as much as any party member. The only way to survive is to either cheese the encounters, load up on as many buffs as possible or metagame to the extreme. It reeks of artificial difficulty and it's the most common negative complaint people tend to have about WotR. There are also some oddly placed quests. For example, one of the first sidequests you get in act 3 is a quest to kill an ancient red dragon...at level 10.

Thankfully there are a large amount of difficulty options. Unless you enjoy suffering, metagaming and reloading quicksaves I'd recommend playing default settings with enemies set to ""moderately weaker"". Keeps the game challenging but fair.

Overall, Wrath of the Righteous is an amazing game. It's one of the most well made and replayable CRPGs of all time, despite it's serious balance issues, and is worth the money.

6-17-2023 Okay, at this point almost all the bugs are squashed. Having gone back and read the original adventure path, Owlcat did a brilliant job of adapting it to a CPRG. NPCs are detailed and fleshed out, there are dozens of stories and side missions added, the main antagonist's motives actually *make sense*, and this is a game with an incredible amount of replayability. In addition, the expansions to the base Pathfinder ruleset that Owlcat did are very well done, and it would be nice if Paizo had gone back and added Owlcat's changes to the TTRPG. Particularly when it comes to Mythic paths and abilities. The latest DLC is integrated fairly well into the base game; not quite seamless, though, likely due to lack of availability of some of the original voice actors.
Still a recommend, still good. And there's another expansion in the works.

Nov. 27, 2023: Owlcat continues to support this game and keeps adding bug-fixes.

2. if you play on core or more you just need to buff for 4-5 minute every rest you gonna make (generally 20 minute) .

While Baldur's Gate 3 is the elephant in the room, it follows a very different design philosophy- namely being a robust CRPG with TTRPG drapes over the windows. On the other hand, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a much more faithful adaptation of the source material, placing it in the same category as Solasta or Baldur's Gate 1/2. In a way, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a spiritual successor to the earlier Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights games while Baldur's Gate 3 is more of a spiritual successor to Divinity: Original Sin, which means that there are some categorical differences, and I think it's fair if you want to pursue a more faithful TTRPG experience to look in the direction of Solasta or Owlcat's Pathfinder games as a separate category.

That aside, why do I think P:WotR works so well? It's a combination of excellent writing, beautiful worldbuilding, and strong characters layered with incredible amounts of player choice- and I don't just mean at the (admittedly daunting) character creation screen. Decisions matter, but Owlcat strikes a good balance around allowing players to adjust their trajectory during a very long campaign and stay the course and build deep in a particular storyline and option. The amount of alternate routes, character interactions, and so on are just overwhelming, and while I could nitpick having to run through the first two chapters over and over again (it's probably worth making a save at the end of the first act and making sure you turn on the retraining option if you plan to see different routes or try different builds, as the first route is pretty on rails and gets monotonous if you want to try a different playthrough).

Mythic paths manage to make characters feel powerful and unique in a way most CRPGs are afraid to allow access to until the final chapter, and have significant impacts on the way the game plays out, with dialogue branches for classes, mythic paths, character races, and even having access to certain features that allow for different characters to interact differently with the world on subsequent playthroughs. 

Alignment is leveraged heavily, and if you're familiar with the TTRPG space you're probably aware of why this can be controversial. Alignment is becoming increasingly disliked because of a variety of reasons I'm not going to get into here, but Owlcat inadvertently demonstrates this because many of the options, particularly for the chaotic/lawful axis, can be pretty jarring and for players deeply dedicated to roleplay may end up feeling like certain alignment driven options are particularly stupid or jarring. Fortunately there are usually reasonable options, including many that don't shift alignment, but the alignment system can make things punitive if you need a particular alignment for your deity, class, or mythic path, and I'd recommend using a mod to set alignment since an unwanted alignment shift could make things difficult for some builds. 

However, though you could probably find gripes, P:WotR does an excellent job of exploring a massive world with deep lore, without overwhelming players or becoming inconsistent with itself or other material. The characters are lovable (or hateable depending on who we're talking about) and even the relatively lightweight strategic layer (which can be more or less disabled in difficulty settings) feels like it's serving a narrative purpose. The consistent polish, patches, and DLC (which is often integrated throughout the game in dialogue choices, new class features, and even, for The Last Sarkorians, a new companion that joins in the first act and has dialogue throughout the main story. Other DLC adds a roguelike dungeon crawl mode good for testing builds without having to level your way through the story, a truly excellent ""play the average guy"" campaign where gear is scarce and the narrative and resource management is more tense. 

P:WotR is not a perfect game, but it has some incredibly powerful narrative moments, a deep and complex story, robust gameplay, and scratches a TTRPG itch perhaps better than any other modern CRPG, including the excellent BG3. That makes this an easy recommendation, and I would also recommend grabbing the season passes if you have the chance.",1701024396,1701024396,True,1,1,0.535519123077392578,0,True,False,False

It has more endings than I personally know what to do with, more opportunities for you to quite literally do whatever the hell you want, and there is an INVENTORY SEARCH BAR so you don't have to scroll past the 500 weapons and armor sets you're hoarding for the shop to find what you need!! 

AND THE MYTHIC PATHS. I don't think I have it in me to full send it down a cackling evil character on their villain arc but the fact that I could if I wanted to is VERY cool.

BUGS???[/spoiler] So far I've done an Azata, Aeon, and Trickster run, and all three mythic paths quite literally change the game both in terms of RP (the unique mythic questlines) and gameplay (combat mechanics!). Truly the world is your oyster.

I will say the one downside this game has is Act 4. The camera spinning mechanic is, frankly, a little annoying. BUT that's my one (1) complaint alongside an unending list of accolades. And once that part of the Act is over it's over and you never have to do it again, so. :)

All said, this is an EASY recommendation from me. Owlcat Games simply doesn't miss when it comes to the CRPG genre and I'm very excited for Rogue Trader in a few weeks. \( ^w^ )/",1701015481,1701015481,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is a good game.  However there is a downside of this game.  The normal combat mode is good but the part where you control armies kind of suck.  Luckily it isn't attached to your difficulty level so you can make the crusade mechanics weaker.  It doesn't help all that much though.  I almost lost the game because of the crusade system.  Even though I dominated the battles for the regular combat.  The crusade system kind of sucks.  Chapter 4 kind of sucks.  However the rest of this game is good and I'm going back to replay it.

The writing is usually good but there are some bad parts.  Still it is a recommend.

EDIT:  It is much more of a recommend because you can switch it to auto and it really does work.  You ignore that part of the game completely.  If you don't like the minigame you are completely able to opt out.  You can't opt back in when you opt out though.  I guess because they wanted a hard to get achievement.

EDIT again on 7/24/2023:  The devs added tracking software on the game.

EDIT Again:  Apparently appsflyer is used by everyone already.  I guess people are coming to grips with the fact that everyone is spying on you.  They said they won't use it so there is that.  Took back using the tracking software.

EDIT:  This is old but they said that they took it off completely.  So no problem with spyware or whatever.  This depends on how much you believe it.

Also this game has two aspects: Role playing side & strategic side. 
For roleplaying side, you are using your character & companions in the game world & following your destiny. 
Strategic side ise another aspect of the game. As the game progresses, you are using your armies & making a great crusade against demons. 
This strategic aspect of the game uses mass-combat rules published in Pathfinder Ultimate Campaign book. Some say that the strategic aspect is not enough but, mass-combat for a table top FRP game is not a war game, so rules for mass-combat do not need complicated rules for the strategic aspect.

Для такого события в игровой индустрии, к этой игре привлечено слишком мало внимания, так что хоть я и не люблю писать отзывы, ибо не умею, в этот раз сделаю исключение, дабы повлиять на ситуацию как могу.

[i]---Общее мнение---[/i]

10/10
Одна из лучших партийных RPG за долгое время, где можно ПОЧУВСТВОВАТЬ влияние своего персонажа на мир и, что более важно, влияние мира на персонажа. Решительно не понятно, почему так мало внимания приковано к ней. Если кто-то ждет исправления багов, как было с первой частью, то спешу заверить, что уже сейчас можно начинать играть и не откладывать в долгий ящик - да, баги есть, но они не критичны. Я прошел почти без патчей и столкнулся с очень небольшим их количеством, учитывая масштаб проекта. Для более детального разбора - добро пожаловать под кат.

[i]---Геймплей---[/i]

В этом смысле игру можно поделить на две, совсем не равные, части: стратегическая и классическая партийная RPG. 

[u]Стратегическая:[/u] В кругу своих знакомых часто слышал мнение, что первая часть не нужна и лишь затягивает время. Подобное же мнение встречал на просторах сети. Однако на мой взгляд эта система очень даже уместна и, более того, она необходима. Мне это напоминает обсуждение вида от первого лица в киберпанке - тогда тоже встретил новость о невозможности смены перспективы в штыки, но на деле, это оказалось действительно более чем уместно и очень способствовало погружению в мир. Так и тут - если убрать этот элемент, ты, как игрок, теряешь(быть может частично, но все же) ощущение важности фигуры своего персонажа и масштабности событий. Лично мне, как любителю градостроительных симуляторов, было немного печально, что этот элемент деградировал, по сравнению с первой частью, но это было ожидаемо в связи со сменой центральной идеи произведения. Но разработчик, предвидя такое мнение, предлагает опцию отключающую эту часть игры. Элегантное решение угождающее и нашим и вашим.

[u]Партийная RPG:[/u] 
 - Создание персонажа. Можно создать и отыгрывать ЛЮБОГО персонажа какой вам может прийти в голову(ну, почти любого в рамках вселенной, разумеется). Я нигде не видел подобных возможностей и, что самое главное, от вашего выбора меняется не просто скин и набор скилов, ваши решения не просто создают иллюзию воздействия на развитие персонажа, они действительно влияют на мир и на протагониста(который может, того гляди, и антагонистом стать). Любите классику где добрый творит добро или злодей - зло? Вперед, это атрибут по умолчанию(хотя не так много игр, где можно отыграть действительно зло - где можно быть повелителем мертвых, предавшим все ради могущества?), но между этими двумя путями тут действительно серьезный простор и ваш выбор весьма влияет на результат.
- Механика.  Блестяще перенесенная, классическая система Pathfinder не дает сбоев как и в предыдущей части. Более того, разработчики ее улучшили, добавив целое множество интересных фич и классов - начиная с возможности вертеть камерой(в одной части с помощью этой возможности будет обыгрываться достаточно спорная механика) и заканчивая мелочами вроде улучшенной системы взлома замков. Для новичков в настольных играх вроде DnD полагаю, что может быть сложно, но игра честно старается сделать все возможное, чтобы снизить порог входа - очень гибкая система настройки сложности, повсеместные подсказки и проч. проч. Это также очень хороший старт, если есть желание познакомиться с настольной системой. Единственное, лично мне ближе меньшее число сопартийцев - 4 персонажа в группе было бы идеально. 

[i]---Нарратив---[/i]

[u]Сюжет:[/u] Хорошая крепкая история про очередного избранного. Отличает ее от прочих большое разветвление путей и, ожидаемо, концовок. Вместе с историей развивается и ваш персонаж и это очень сильно ощущается. С каждым решением вы открываете одни двери и закрываете другие, но вес чувствуется всегда. Может быть придется пожертвовать чем-то, что является самым ценным для вашего персонажа для достижения цели или испытываешь злорадство при поражении союзника лицемерно поставившего героя в безвыходное положение ранее. Все это чувствуется очень и очень хорошо.
[u]Сопартицы:[/u] Изначально мне показалось, что персонажи из первой части удались лучше(хотя не всем они понравились), но тут у многих есть ""второе дно""(пусть порой и очевидное). Это играет на руку и делает коллег по несчастью более интересными и глубокими. Если бы у меня не было эталона - полагаю я бы даже и придраться не нашел бы к чему, но... к сожалению, все еще не дотягивает до DA:O. Ничто в этом вопросе не дотягивает до DA:O. Увы.

[i]---Визуал и звук---[/i]

[u]Графика:[/u] Отличная графика в ""мультяшном"" стиле. Я такое люблю. Может не всем прийтись по вкусу - мой хороший друг не воспринимает подобное, но это уже вкусовщина. Видно, что проделана большая работа по сравнению с первой частью, но именно в плане работы с камерой. Не уверен, что так можно сказать применительно к играм, но в первой части и не пахло такой режиссерской работой как в некоторых сценах здесь.
[u]Музыка:[/u] [strike]Без откровений. Ничего не могу сказать плохого о саундтреке - он хорошо подходит под приключение, но не нашел чего-то выдающегося.[/strike]

You can customize the game to make it as hard or easy as you want but it feels like your copping out if you need to turn things down to avoid micromanaging spells and buffs. None of the cast of characters had stories that were particularly interesting to me and the way some their stories are abruptly segmented between chapters makes you wonder sometimes if they even have any more content what so ever. There are some points where you might get 10% of a companion characters side story content which you then need to do another another 30-40+ hours of main story content before they have anything else to do or say.  The Story itself is very ""Wordy"" without ever actually doing or saying anything smart or interesting.  The game is fairly faithful to it's tabletop counterpart so much so that unless your a fan I feel it's a massive detriment and some systems from tabletop just don't belong in computer role playing games. Some of these mechanics are in other game as well like AC which just pointlessly turns every heavy armor tank into a dodge tank and you become only as tanky as your dice rolls allow you to be while always having the penalty for wearing your armor.  Every other rpg that's not a direct derivative of DnD solved this years ago like Wasteland and Fallout. 

All in all it's not an awful game and I wish I could rate it with a ""Mixed"" because it can be fun and it has lots of classes and variety's of spells and exploration and also features it's own version of heroes of might and magic esque battles to take keeps which is fun but exhausting to manage when you just want to get to the next story arc. If I could recommend something else I would say get Wasteland 3 or Expeditions:Rome which was more the thing I was looking for when I bought this game and would of bought those instead.

I've seen some reviews complain about the voice-acting, and this was really my biggest hesitation to buying, as I really did not like the voice acting in the first Baldur's Gate years ago, and I expected the same sort of thing.  But so far I've been pleasantly surprised.  The voice acting is not irritating, not yet at least.  Some of the characters I enjoy, and others are okay.  This is very much personal taste though.

The game almost plays identically to D20 DnD games, and Pathfinder was an alternative rule-set derived from DnD, so hence the similarity.

What I like most is that the text between characters is mostly voice acted, and I found it engaging enough that I didn't just skip over everything when there were a few pages of story-line to read without voice acting.  I can't tell you how big of a deal that is for me, because I decided long ago that ""fiction is just arbitrary"" and at that point I stopped really caring about story-lines, especially in video-games.  So to find myself enjoying the plot says something.  Hopefully you'll enjoy it as much as I do.",1700889394,1700889519,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With so many different classes and archetypes as well as ten different mythic paths the game has a ton of replay value seeing how the story ends if you go down one path instead of another. Overall, it's a fun game but not one without its flaws.


So, basic gameplay starts really good, but Owlcat hasn't quite learned their lesson from Kingmaker and sometimes forgets that even though this is a video game the player character is playing a table top character. Adding twenty enemies to a fight in a video game where you can just mow things down endlessly means nothing, in a table top game it completely wrecks your action economy and burns all your spell slots. Some of the enemies are meant to be optional challenges but they are to be frank... A tad ridiculous and assume that you built a heavy damage dealing character. If you made your main character support enjoy not being able to deal with the 72 AC enemies and nigh invulnerable spell resistance. If you just want to play through the game on normal you'll have to know what you're doing and put together a competent build. Pathfinder experts might enjoy the challenge but more casual players are going to struggle, and well... The premade builds are not up to the task of taking down a lot of the tougher challenges. Another thing is simply that not all mythic paths are created equal and different paths have better synergy with different classes. Without knowing the path abilities in advance you could set yourself up in a situation where your abilities don't really work well together. Example, a Trickster in any class with only two skill points. Overall I think the good outweighs the bad, just be ready to put a lot of thought into building up your party. The game suggests you use debuffs to beat high enemy AC, and with over 602 hours into the game I have not both overcome an enemy's spell resistance and have the enemy fail the save. I could just be unlucky. I mean I have Spell Penetration, Greater Penetration, Mythic Penetration, and the spell focus ones as well, and even persistent spell. I have had a lot of luck with save or suck it spells... Which with the low chance of a debuff spell working might as well just go for an end the fight spell since they have roughly equal chances of working and you can probably target their lowest saving row better. In general finding ways to find stacking buffs on party is going to go further to your melee people hitting than hitting the enemy with a debuff. 

Crusader Mode is a huge letdown. If you turn auto-crusade on prepare to be skipping a ton of days waiting for the auto-crusade to defeat armies and open them up. Doing it yourself is slow and tedious and pretty much any non-magic general isn't worth hiring. High quality ranged units and generals who can instantly end fights with spells are the way to go. Once you have Twincast and at least two different elements on a general you pretty much instantly win. Still, Crusader mode is less a challenge and more a test of patience. It's honestly better to just set crusader mode to story mode so you can get triple income and not sit around for three weeks saving up the money to build up an army before you can advance five feet down the road. Many of the events and choices you can make in crusade mode are fun, but the actual fights and army management is very repetitive and tedious.

The game's biggest issue is the same as Kingmaker. It was released completely broken. I made a Bashing Finished based build on my Trickster combined with Trick Fate and well the game couldn't handle it and crashed. Which, I admit getting infinite free attacks until the enemy is dead is game breaking I didn't expect it to literally break the game. There's all kinds of other bugs and annoyances. Owlcat has been releasing patches to fix things, and the game plays much better than it did at launch but still has a ways to go. Much like Kingmaker it's going to take them a bit to get the game into proper working shape. Which is a shame, I had really hoped after Kingmaker they would have the experience to fix a lot of these problems before release. But, well, here we are.

Anyway, if the difficulty curb being all over the place and the occasional glitch don't deter you, the game really is a fun experience. Like Kingmaker they've made quite a few changes to the plot and characters. Unlike Kingmaker, I think their version of one of the main villains, their motivations and plan are much more interesting than in the original path. For spoiler sake will avoid saying which villain though it should become fairly obvious which by the end of chapter 2. 

With one exception (Camille) the NPC party members are far more fun and interesting than they were in Kingmaker. Ember is such a good pure child that even on my chaotic evil demon run I can't bring myself to do anything to bring her harm. She's also, just... So freaking good. Nenio is another fun one who has the most annoying companion quest in the game and yet is still my favorite companion despite what I got dragged through because she is a constant source of entertainment. I also grew quite fond of Daeran, which I didn't expect and he by far has the best romance arc in the game should you choose to pursue it.

I also find it interesting that mythic paths aren't tied to alignment which can be fun. I decided to to a demon paladin run, and I was able to complete it without falling. Though could only reach mythic tier 9 as being lawful good did lock me out of the storyline that lead to the final mythic quest. Still, it was cool. It is fun to have Iomodea come down and yell at me for how evil I am now that I'm a demon but then still provide me with paladin powers because I haven't broken my code. I guess motives don't count for paladins and only actions so as long as it's technically within the paladin code you can do whatever you want and your deity just has to sit there and keep giving you new spells and abilities every day.


But anyway, I've had a ton of fun. I have suggested this game to many friends as well as gifted it because it is ultimately a good game. It may have a few problems but in the end I think the good greatly outweighs the bad.

The DLCs vary a bit in quality. Inevitable Expanse, Through the Ashes and The Lord of Nothing though at least made the season passes worth it for me. Plus season 2 pass the new character for the party and quest involved are pretty legitimately fun.",1640495211,1700875021,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I got my ass handed to me plenty of times when I first started playing the previous game Owlcat made, Pathfinder: Kingmaker. Had to reduce difficulty, when I usually raise difficulty with any games. Took a few runs before I could run core rules without crying.

The game itself has a vast world, which you explore in chunks based on story progression. There's tons of equipment find and deciding what to use is part of the fun / frustration. Character builds can be pre-planned, since you can see the abilities, feats and bonuses gained at each level. It's a very very handy tool to have when you're choosing your class. It makes for fun and clearer multi-classing. No opening websites to see what abilities you will get at which level, just check the progression chart at level up and spend 30 minutes changing your mind all the time before going with your original class anyway haha.

400 hours in and I'm starting a new run again since there's a huge new update. This game never gets old for me.

The game is great and the developers seem to have taken the community response seriously.
The game is worth the money and so is the DLC. 

Update as of 25/07/2023:
Owlcat games has added a program called Appsflyer into the latest update 2.15.M. This software tracks user actions on their computer outside of the confines of the game, tracking advertisement interaction along with other user actions. The app claims to be GDPR complaint. Previously users had the option to opt in or out of data sharing however, the EULA was update to force users to accept the installation and operation of Appsflyer on their computer or not play the game we've payed for. 

Owlcat claims they will be reverting this change but, how can we trust them?. They've lost my trust and I have uninstalled WOTR for now. I have also taken rogue trader of my wishlist.

I have never changed my review on a game before but, I had to do this. This behaviour is unacceptable.

Better than Kingmaker by far. Still has a tonne of bugs, I was really loving playing a Cavalier however, the movement on horseback was incredibly buggy for me especially when paired with a  reach weapon. I had to respec my PC because that play style became untenable with all of the bugs. Wrath of The Righteous also has many of the same flaws as kingmaker just not to the same degree (to my knowledge, only up to chapter three).

The mythic paths are an excellent addition and having seen some the outcomes for these paths makes me truly excited to replay the game to experience them all.

The story is fantastic and has a lot of moments that really feel rewarding. I'm already planning out my second and third character to take advantage of what really feels an extremely replayable story. With that said, there are a lot of issues with the gameplay.

So many fights feel like you need to go in prebuffed, but they have long winded dialog that ensure everything falls off before the battle begins. Then, there are other fights that come out of no where and throw you into the middle of it, and it often feels like the enemies themselves are coming in fully buffed, while you're having to take precious turns to get your characters fighting fit.

Bosses with the same AC as you hitting on all their attacks while you miss between all your characters. Spells missing, touch attacks resulting in instant death from attacks of opportunity, 

Beginning in Act 4 I found myself having to reduce the difficulty just to get through some boss encounters and that didn't feel satisfying at all. I'm not a newcomer to the Pathfinder world, nor am I an expert on it, but I feel like 'Normal' difficulty shouldn't mean despite sitting at AC42 my character is a punching bag to everything including regular old trash enemies, but I can't land a single hit despite sitting at a +29 chance to hit. That's not satisfying at all. 

I've tried turn based mode, but honestly, instead of losing in the 15 seconds it takes for a more powerful enemy to proceed to target down and kill each of my characters with their 5 attacks that never miss, I'm spending a good 10 minutes just to have the same result. 


I'd still recommend playing this game. I just wouldn't shy away from reducing the difficulty when you find yourself facing enemies that are taking hours to beat.",1631881683,1700764712,True,2,0,0.525691688060760498,0,True,False,False

I'd say a standard playthrough would be ~100 hours or so. I played on Normal difficulty without any DLCs. Here's my verdict.

Highlights:
- Mythic paths feature unique spells, abilities, and dialogue options.
- Overwhelming amount of character classes and builds.
- Secret optional bosses can be encountered throughout the whole game.

Neutral:
- Dozens of companions. A few can be missed. Some bothered me.
- Hundreds of spells for sorcerers. But prepare to read paragraphs of text to understand them.
- Good luck figuring out Pathfinder mechanics. Random pop-ups were not enough for me.

Disappointments:
- Tutorial features voice acting... and then characters are silent for almost the whole game.
- No guidance for Crusade Mode which begins in Act ll. Almost made me uninstall.
- Enemies have +40 armor class in Act IV and beyond. You spend 10 rounds missing all attacks.

Mythic Path Review (No Spoilers):
I chose the path of the Lich. You can resurrect important characters and travel with them, which is great. Be a spellcaster, like a sorcerer, to gain access to powerful undead magic (melee characters are neglected). Some mythic quests make you wait 30 days for something to be built, which sucks. That happens twice! Otherwise, I enjoyed being a lawful evil character.

After completing the game, the only big downside it's isn't as strong in the narrative department as other classics in the genre (still a very big improvement over Kingmaker), but it makes up for it in spades with how much the game and it's story changes with the mythic paths the game offers. Many games, RPGs in particular, promise that your choices matter, but I've never seen it done so elegantly as it was here, even if it's not very drastic and the basic structure of the campaign remains the same. Campaign mode is an improvement over Kingmaker, too, but it still feels somewhat incomplete. 

On the technical side, after a load of patches the game has a surprisingly low amount of bugs (for a game of this scale and scope, that is) and the only thing that really sours the experience are the recurring freezes in turn-based mode, that become more noticeable and annoying in the late game.

As someone who only recently got introduced to the DnD in BG3, I found the Pathfinder system to be more complex and challenging - 25 different starting classes, 161 subclasses, and even more feats, and A LOT of math behind combat. Luckily, the game has many difficulty levels and an excellent in-game guide. A switch between turn-based or RTwP-style combat also adds to the flexibility. Still, it's not a game for complete beginners in cRPGs.

The plot is nothing groundbreaking, imo, yet it is far from boring and has amazing, memorable moments, especially for the companion's quests. For a game that requires A LOT of reading, the dialogue is written well. 
The game is HUGE and very easy to sink many hours into. That's one of the game's strengths but also a weakness since sometimes it felt like a slog and overwhelming. The replayability value, though, is very high.

The graphics are decent, the music is excellent, some annoying bugs here and there, but nothing game-breakable (for me).

That means it is an isometric, tactical RPG, with a very deep and complex rule set, a focus on character builds and commanding a team of 6 highly customizable characters. As a note for Kingmaker players, this game is very, very similar but also MUCH improved. This game can be played both as Real Time with Pause or Turn Based.

First, it must be said, this game has a HELL OF A LEARNING CURVE. Pathfinder is a tabletop RPG based on 3.5 D&D, which is very rules heavy. This game layers a few system on top of that, such as the Mythic Paths and Crusade system, to make it even more complicated. If you are familiar with Pathfinder or the previous title Kingmaker, there is still a lot to learn, but if you know neither be prepared to take the 5 week correspondence course and read a textbook worth of guides. There are lower difficulties where you do not need to understand the systems to play the game, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from engaging with the mechanics so you'll probably feel like you are missing out.

Second, the game is very long (a first time playthrough taking well over 100 hours and possibly taking over 200) and despite this, it is clearly meant to be played through multiple times. There are many mutually exclusive options in the game (like the mythic paths) as well as a ton of hidden content. It is literally impossible to experience it all in one go through. And on top of that, many side quests and the secret ending are so obtuse and difficult to get, you will never naturally find them and will end up using a guide.

Last caveat, the story and world building can include some heavy subjects. Your main antagonists are demons, so be prepared to go through some torture chambers that include some messed up magical stuff (note though there is NO sexual violence or anything like that, or at least not that I encountered). I find the isometric viewpoint you experience the game through to make it almost impossible to be truly grossed out by anything, you are simply too distant and things don't have enough detail, but do be warned of gore and some disturbing visuals.

So if reading all that doesn't dissuade you, and in fact all that sounds kind of good, then this is the game for you. Like all those caveats are the actual selling point of the game, and this game has a ton of content to play around with. You can make tons of builds for your main character and can builds tons of interesting parties. The game can be brutally challenging at times and really test your systems knowledge. You can play, and replay, and replay this game with new things to find every play through. The depravity of the demons can make you feel like a righteous warrior of heaven taking them down, or you get the option to be deliciously evil yourself.

And while the systems complexity is, to me at least, the main draw, everything else is also quite good. There is a lot of decent voice acting, the story, writing and world building are all interesting and at least passable at worst, the game looks pretty good (for an isometric CRPG), and even the sound and music can be quite good at times. 

One big complaint though is that despite having fixed a lot of issues and bugs with them game since launch (nevermind the fact that Owlcat released this game super buggy) there are still annoying bugs and things wrong that may impact your experience at the time of writing this review. In my first playthrough I encountered only a few but in my second playthrough, where I did a lot of mounted combat, I encountered many. So your mileage may vary.

Bottomline. If you like complex systems, tons of content, replaying a game with different builds and roleplaying in a disturbing, demon filed world, then this is the best game of its kind.",1679361091,1700362459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Alright. If you install a couple mods. Namely Toybox, CombatRelief and BUBBLE Buff, this becomes a very good game. AI Cheats. Cheat back. For Crusades, get a Mage hero and then give them tons of Archers.


Original Review:
Game was great til the Crusade Mechanics, now its just mind numbingly boring and uninteresting and they tied all story progression to this crap. Spend 90 minutes Pressing Skip Day over and over to recruit a couple troops per week. Each Army can have 3 total troops, and also anything that isnt ranged is absolutely garbage. Like 0-1 Damage per turn vs 16-39 per turn garbage.  Send Troops into 1 battle. Win but take losses. Spend 90 Minutes building back Army of archers. Send into Fort. Flip Coin. If Heads, repeat previous steps; If Tails spend 20 minutes playing Pathfinder again before going right back into Crusade Grind. You can set this insufferable garbage to auto resolve but the AI is dysfunctional and just gets your guys killed. You can turn the mode off entirely but then you lose about 2/3s of the Quest Content. Third Option is to use cheat mods to autowin every single crusade fight. Its also great that they dont introduce this garbage til 15 hours in and you can't refund it anymore.

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Greetings from HowlStrom, where the ice howls and the snowflakes dance! I, Kiba Snowpaw, have journeyed through digital realms far and wide, but none have captivated my furry heart quite like ""Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition."" This is not just a game; it's an odyssey of mythical proportions, blending epic battles with moral conundrums.

[h2]A Tale of Demons and Destiny[/h2]
As I embarked on this journey to the Worldwound, it was like tracking through the treacherous blizzards of HowlStrom. Facing demons and choosing paths of virtue or vice, I felt like a true mythical hero - part wolf, part legend.

[h2]Gameplay - A Wolf's Challenge[/h2]
Navigating this RPG as a character of my own creation was like hunting in the great wilds of HowlStrom. With a plethora of classes, races, spells, and abilities, I tailored my hero to be as unique as the snowflakes in my homeland. And the consequences of every choice? As impactful as an avalanche!

[h2]Combat and Strategy[/h2]
Battling through hordes of demonic foes in real-time or turn-based combat was a thrill akin to a midnight hunt under a full moon. Utilizing advanced combat maneuvers, I felt like the alpha of the pack, leading my furry companions to glorious victory.

[h2]Companions and Crusade[/h2]
My party, a band of more than 10 unique companions, became my pack. Together, we faced trials and tribulations, each decision shaping our bond - for better or for worse. And leading the crusade? It was like rallying the wolves of HowlStrom against an unseen threat, a test of both strategy and strength.

[h2]Choosing Your Mythic Path[/h2]
Exploring the nine Mythic Paths was like discovering the ancient secrets hidden beneath the HowlStrom ice. From celestial Angel to raging Demon, each path offered extraordinary abilities that shaped not just my character, but the very world around us.

[h2]Mature Content - A Wolf's Warning[/h2]
Beware, fellow adventurers! The game’s mature content is as stark and raw as the winds of HowlStrom. Yet, it adds depth and realism to this epic tale, making it a journey for the brave and the bold.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
[i]Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition[/i] is a masterpiece of storytelling, gameplay, and immersive fantasy. As Kiba Snowpaw, I give this epic saga a howl of approval. It’s a must-play for those who yearn for adventure, challenge, and a journey of mythical magnitude.

[b][u]Rating: 5/5 - A Legendary Adventure in a Land Beyond Imagination![/u][/b]
For those who seek a journey filled with danger, glory, and mythical choices, this game is a portal to a world where legends are forged and destinies are fulfilled.

Pretty intense and fun game so far

Edit Nov 12 '23

Finished my 1st run 2 weeks ago. I began planning my sequential runs leading up to the final missions. Not only has this game encouraged me to try more dnd rpg games, but it has opened me up to be committed to table top pen and paper sessions. Looking forward to play rogue trader after I finish up the current run I'm on

Keep in mind, you don't have to play a certain way just cause that way has a meta. Wotr being an RPG comes 1st. Make sure you play a way that you enjoy

The characterization of all the key cast members  carries a weight I haven't been privy to since ulysees from new vegas and Kriea from Kotor 2. I suppose Chris Avollone's work shines through. Not going to go in depth further than that. Seeing how the characters are like for yourself  has more precedent than me wanting to gush over them. Mandalore gaming has a good review even though I disagree with a point or two of his if you want one that goes in depth. 

You want to succeed at the over arching point of the game? Make sure you pay attention to exposition dumps and dialogue. Your character's perception isn't the only one being tested.",1684250237,1699847605,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

A történet nagyon szerteágazó, a játék legelejétől fogva van súlya a döntéseknek, amik kihatnak a játék végére. Leszögezem, hogy nagyon jó játék, de:
1. Aki nem szakértője a szabályrendszernek, annak guide-ra van szüksége, hogy eligazodjon a rengeteg class és subclass között és életképes csapatot állítson össze (multiclassokról nem is beszélve).
2. Rengeteg buff van, és a nehézség úgy van belőve, hogy ezeket egytől egyig használni is kell (ha az egész csapatot buffoljuk, akkor hamar eljutunk oda, hogy 80-100 varázslat minden egyes helyszínen a csaták előtt, és a rövid buffokat ebbe bele sem számoltam). Ez dögunalom. Ezt automatozálni kell, de az alapjáték ezt nem támogatja, addont kell letölteni hozzá. Buffoló addon nélkül a játék elejét leszámítva (akkor még nincs sok varázslatunk) gyakorlatilag játszhatatlan!
3. Nem triviális átlátni, hogy milyen buffok működnek együtt egymással, különösen a transmutation buffokat illetően. Még ha guide-ot is követ az ember és van egy Brown fur transmuter a csapatban, nem világos, hogy ennek mi a haszna. Rengeteg utánaolvasás vagy kísérletezés, amíg rájön az ember, hogy bizonyos buffok stackelődnek egészen elképesztő eredménnyel (pl. 80-as erejű kutya 15 körönkénti támadással)",1699706685,1699706685,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Annoying Spells, missing enemy diversity for the first hours of the game, classes that are not usefull at all and a story that failed to catch me. But at the end I decided to give a thumb up. The reason is the good implementation of the Pathfinder rule system. It's good and even if the story is a little dry and the character mediocre, the character advancement and the options are worth a thumb up.

So at the end: Great game for roleplay lovers, not that great as game at all. Sad that ther is no meh button only up and down.",1687104484,1699625690,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You really do need to understand Pathfinder if you want to have a good time here, because the game doesn't do much to help you learn. There is an encyclopedia but I don't think it's crazy to say I don't want to read hundreds of pages of rules when I am trying to enjoy a video game. This is Pathfinder 1E, so the system is still very, very dense.

It's especially a problem here because this game is really hard. It's not insurmountable on normal difficulties, but you really need to have a good understanding of Pathfinder and optimized builds to get a grip on this. If you don't already know Pathfinder well you are going to have a bad time.

I also really didn't like the Crusade elements, they got tedious fast. You can shut them off, but unfortunately the entire game is paced around them and it locks you out of some of the best story elements. If you're going to make content optional (which, clearly, is something they did because a significant portion of their players disliked it!) don't punish me for not opting in. The weird pacing with crusades off means that sometimes you have to just rest for a week to make something happen, and watching my character sleep is never a fun experience.

If you like Pathfinder, though, and you like really difficult high level content, this game is pretty good. The engine is still clunky as hell and a lot of things are broken (Cavalier, sadly, is both one of the most fun and one of the most unplayably broken classes) but nothing else really does what this does.

I will start saying that if you like to play this game on a lower difficulty, only for the story, then probably you can ignore most of the Pathfinder's rules shortcoming.

To be clear I'm no lover of Pathfinder 1e rules (I do like 2e), I know that it can be a personal preference, but is a fact that everything spawned from D&D 3e is broken, so if you wanna a fine tuned and balanced gameplay, avoid it. Most of the flaws of the game stem from the tabletop rules, but in this instance is ever more pronounced since it uses the mythic rules which are even more broken: the incredible power spike that those skills give to the player means that the enemies cannot be competitive unless they have very bloated stats, which are in this game. Still, bloated enemies bring even more problems, especially on harder difficulties: crits can one shot everything from both sides, most feats and builds become useless (because you won't hit and won't pierce resistance, saving throws and immunities), and you'll find yourself to take the same feats over and over on every char if you even wanna hit something. 

Combat is often resolved before is even started, it mostly depends on the buffs you have, if you have the right spells available and if you win the initiative, especially at high levels. There's no place for tactic in combat, since the first who hit will usually one shot the opposition. Buffs are so prominent that if you manage to dispel enemy buffs you've already won, bosses become instantly pushovers, but good luck with that if you don't have the right build/ mythic path since the caster levels are so bloated (unless you play with tabletop tweaks mod, then you can use Mage's Disjunction and dispel everything automatically with no roll, as per tabletop's rules).
The tedium of buffing and tracking the ones have also add to the general negative experience.

Unless you play on an easy difficulty you'll be forced to specialize and pigeonhole every character into one specific role, more often than not that character will do only one thing and every attempt to do something else will result in failure. For example If you specialize in enchantment spells your other spells will often become useless (buffs are an exceptions, those are basically required and never useless). 
The enchantment spell school is especially representative of the problem (Save or suck) because using it will result in only 2 possible outcomes:
1) you will disable every enemy on turn 1 and walk over them
OR
2) enemies will be totally immune and your enchanter become instantly useless (a lot enemies are immune to ming-affecting later on)

Elemental damage is heavy hampered cause all enemies resist everything (elemental weapons are especially useless unless they do sonic damage). If you get Ascended Element you can bypass resistance and immunities, and this mean that is basically required if you wanna do elemental damage. 
This is reflected in many aspects of the game, furthering a downward spiral where enemies are ""immune"" then you use
a ""ignore immunities"" ability, and then enemies will be ""even more immune so that your ignore immunities won't work"" and so you'll have to use the ""ignore immunities +infinity"" and so on and on. Frankly this is bad design plain and simple.

BUGS BUGS BUGS and Poor User Interface
But let's leave the pathfinder rules behind, since those are not Owlcat's fault, and let's talk about the playability of the game, or more precisely, few of the more egregious shortcomings:
- The game is bugged as hell (see below)
- There's only one way to know what status conditions do, getting hit by one and read the tooltip on your char. The result is that you will read spell's descriptions without having any clue what actually do ""blindness"",""staggered"", ""dazed"" and so on beforehand (good luck in choosing the spells and feats you want). The only alternative it to know Pathfinder, luckily for you the rules are available for free on the net.
- Some mythic powers that add new features to your char (like second bloodline for bloodrager) won't show on character sheet, and you'll have no idea what you'll get when you level up, better save beforehand.
- Wording on skills is subpar, and often you'll pick feats only to discover later that don't do what is wrote in their description. Often you'll have no idea what the description even means unless you are well versed with Pathfinder's rules.
- Crusade mode is just bad, tacked on as an afterthought, is light Heroes of Might and Magic but without the tactics and the strategy. Is not hard, but is a chore and it slow down the gameplay.
- Due to the above mentioned reasons (and many more), the game is almost unplayable without mods (Toybox, full respec, Tabletop-tweaks, are just the bare minimum)


Few of the most egregious bugs:
- in turn mode using range touch spells will not work and make your char stuck and waste your turn. This happen when the character should move and then use a touch action, in these cases you should always move before casting, but the again, if you cast once you're close to an enemy you will likely get and attack of opportunity...

- The move options in turn mode are extremely finicky, very often you'll lose a turn just by clicking, sometimes even when you don't do anything at all.

- Some skills are so bugged that will actively make you character worse, one of such example is ""Focused element"" which can reduce around -25% of your mage total damage because of how badly is implemented: it will apply two times your damage as two halves, but on the second half won't put any of your actual bonuses so you will lose half of them (you can use toybox to remove that feature and to salvage your char, but you'll have to remove it every time you level up).

- Sometimes debuffs will become permanent on you and no spell or other cure will remove them, can happen with many sort of debuffs like confusion. In these cases the only way out available is to enable the option that removes debuffs when you rest from the difficulty menu. Same for buffs, it can happen that you mantain some powers even after you respec, this is beneficial to you, but still a bug.

- Quests and NPCs will get stuck, save often in different slots.

- and many, many more

There also some beneficial bugs, for example You can use metamagic on spells that you gain when you wear rings (like ring of the salamander) and this will make those spells stick in your spellbook even after you remove the ring. Or the fact that using shield Bash with large shields won't give you any penalty, and many more.


STORY
I don't have any more drive to write about the story, let's just say I didn't like it. Is taken from the Pathfinder adventure path of the eponymous name, which have the same level of writing as the campaigns that I wrote as a GM years ago, as to say very low, cliché and predictable.

CONCLUSION
If you can stand all the bugs and use mods, this is still a serviceable game, but personally I would suggest to try something else, like Pillars of Eternity: Deadfire or Divinity Original Sin 2 (I have yet to play Baldur's Gate 3 so I can't say anything about it).",1699571402,1699571402,False,4,0,0.496592044830322266,0,True,False,False

Everything felt improved from Kingmaker and, in particular, the pacing of fights and the difficulty curve were much better. I played through the game on normal, without excessive buffing before each fight, much more enjoyable than in the first one. The only thing I kind of did not like was the hyper detailed character classes and the tons of specialized loot that comes with that. So many things you find are not usable and while this increases replayability, it's kind of frustrating to have so much cool stuff that's basically useless.

But I still very much enjoyed my 130hr playthrough - much of which was done on a Macbook Air M1 while traveling. Performance was generally good, but there were some scenes where the framerate dropped to around 15fps, but in a game like this, that's not that big of a problem and I thought that the graphics looked really nice. Unfortunately, there is no framerate limiter in the game, the ability to lock to 30 would have improved things quite a bit, for sure.

Most of them are in regards to world-map traveling and crusade fights; in particular, morale.  You can go around and curb stomp every demon army available, and then, your units will mostly skip their actions in battle because their afraid to fight....  ""We just destroyed all these demons threatening our very souls!  But what am I living for!?""  *insert autistic screaming and running*  Who comes up with this?

If you were dumb enough to take non-mages as your generals (like I was), you will never win another battle because all of your soldiers cower in fear after destroying hordes of demons.  This is easily the dumbest element of the game and in the top five of worst implemented game mechanics of all time.  Once your morale becomes broken, making progress in the crusading aspect becomes extremely slow and costly of your personal shekel account.  Granted, most purchasable items in this game, just like in almost everyone of these types of games, is useless.  Which means you're walking around with a lot of shekels and nothing to spend them on but resources for your army, and naturally, the conversion rate is pretty bad.

Another problem is with armor class.  Its very difficult, if not impossible, to make it through the game on the default setting without AC buffing.  Enemies have no problems with regularly hitting my front-line cleric, who has an AC of 31 unbuffed, why and how are what I ask when I see her hp go from green to red in less than 3 rounds.  Of course, this doesn't work the other way around, but when it does, your fighting nobodies, and your wizard still dies in 3 shots or less.  It sucks having to buffing people constantly in order to make it through a battle with enemies that are roughly your level.  This makes the concept of feats, armor, and shields seem useless because they are without magical aid.  This limits your ability to play the game with a party of fighters, rogues, or whatevers.

Wizards, are almost completely useless.  Outside of greater magical weapon and haste, wizards can't reliably contribute much to a fight.  Firstly, they are targeted heavily, which is fine, but it gets annoying quick when they get smoked within a few attacks or are paralyzed to do anything because they regularly fail concentrate checks.  Secondly, even when you become a specialist wizard, choose all feats that improve your spells with that school, boost them with metamagic, pass a concentration check, finishing it all off with a prayer to Odin, your spells regularly fail to deal significant damage if they even hit at all.  I had to use 3 fingers of death on an enemy that was lower level then I was, and just as I was about to use a 4, my melee chumps came over and killed him....   Lastly, ingredient requirements for spells is cool, somewhere over the rainbow, but not in Kansas.  We don't do that in Kansas Toto.

I understand Pathfinder went through great lengths to not be sued by wizards of the coast, but damn, they need to simplify their descriptions of feats and other such things.  What their trying to convey is hidden behind a wall of gobble D gool and I'm not Italian, so I don't appreciate that.  They need to hire someone capable of simple direct communication.  No one comes here expecting to read a book (the description) about how ""improved dumbassery"" works, but sometimes that's what happens.

The corruption that builds when your sleeping is a good idea but, when implemented, it forces you to teleport BACK to the kitchen to make yourself another corruption free sammich.  Then, you're privileged to slowly march where you were before to resume your journey.  Until you fail a perception check, and you will fail a perception check, then you get to enjoy being surprised and surrounded by the enemies.  And guess who's gonna have an enemy targeting them?  That's right, your wizard!

The last thing I'm gonna cry about is the overall speed of the game.  This game feels painfully slow when doing anything.  Casting spells, walking, everything feels like it takes forever because it does.  I don't know if there's a way to speed up the game or not, but man there should be.

Overall, this is a very good flawed game that has a lot of DLC that no one should ever buy.  I shant, nor will I encourage others to buy the current DLC for this game.",1699415146,1699415146,True,1,0,0.469798654317855835,0,True,False,False

The game being expansive isn't the problem; in fact, I view that as a good thing. However, there are not enough surprises or other incentives to keep you playing. For lack of a better term, mediocrity ensues as the game overstays its welcome in a particular state.

If you like CRPGs or strategy games, then by all means, give it a try. I can't say I was disappointed. It was reminiscent of DOS2 and BG3. But there are some things I must address:

Surprise attacks while adventuring should be unwarranted in space you occupy with troops. They were so tedious, that every time they occurred, I lowered the difficulty settings just to be done with them. Of course, this resulted in me accidentally fighting some relevant mobs on easy, which detracted from the gameplay.

I chose to play as a lich, to become the best tank. I had chosen this based on the recommendation of a youtube video. What I did not consider, however, was what a negative outcome this had on the story for me. First of all, and spoiler alert, the game forces a scene in which your troops attack innocent civilians and convert them to the undead. Your own civilians, no less. This really doesn't make sense, firstly because although it would make sense that a lich would be evil, from a roleplaying perspective it hard locks you out of being an antihero, and second sacrificing the intelligence of civilians for the brainless undead isn't a logical maneuver. Finally, you must give up love, which, honestly I don't understand. Where is it ruled that evil people, or undead for that matter, cannot love? The mind is in tact.

I also got hard locked out of the secret ending, as I was no longer able to interact with the book. Meaning I would pretty much have to go down the lich path for completion for even some modicum of logical sense. Emotionally at this point, I the player became disconnected from the story.

The looting mechanics in this game are fantastic, and the demonic woman is actually attractive. So the romance is nice. The game was otherwise fun up until the gameplay itself became too tedious to continue. This combined with my own detachment led to me quitting.

I enjoyed the attempt at options in the game, even though I ultimately wasn't satisfied with them. There were a lot of puzzles I didn't feel like were worth my time. And I wasn't a fan of the exhaustion mechanic, with my team almost always becoming exhausted resulting in frequent trips to the castle because you can't sleep in the wilderness without gaining horrible penalties from the corruption meter.

I want a sequel to be released. I really did feel like there was a lot going on here, a lot of very good things.",1699369712,1699369712,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

It is horribly unbalanced. Some classes are just plain useless. And it's very easy to brick a build. You will need to bring in your accountant to review your character sheet.

This is countered by incredibly interesting companions. Who had their build bricked by the devs at level 3 and you cannot respec it because reasons. Example I'm talking about is ember with blackened and point blank shot as a CASTER. 
She is still fairly good, don't get me wrong, but here's the issue: You gave me a huge amount of classes to experiment with and a bunch of companions you cannot fully respec and you brick their build. Why? Why would you do this? 

I went with mercs except for sassy oracle guy for important reasons. So I can actually experiment with builds, but I lose out on some party chat and just general flavor.

This brings up the difficulty is frustrating in a lot of ways. Like getting gibbed. A lot.
I just disabled deaths door stuff and remove bad effects on rest to save me the headache. They pass out ability score damage a lot (The infamous shadow makes an appearance fairly early on)

Since some classes are useless this doubles up on the frustrating difficulty and the terrible builds.

Casters are good, but they feel weak. Archers feel weak too. 

Melee and pet classes are overpowered. Mounts are really great. Melee classes with pets are stupid good.

You will still want a healer and a caster (maybe two casters) for magic damage and CC. Some enemies are weak to magic damage, you will need to get your accountant to go through the enemies stat pages to find out which.

Overall it is very difficult to come up with a viable build and the game, even on normal difficult, will absolutely destroy you if you screw it up.

That being said figure out what you are doing and it's an interesting game, fun mechanics, fun story. Just frustrating difficulty/balance/design decisions.",1699338787,1699338787,True,1,1,0.518518567085266113,3,True,False,False

It's too big for a steam review so I'll just past the TLDR from it. TLDR: If you're looking to buy this game, I would go with a resounding…*MAYBE*. I really enjoyed my single playthrough of this game for the most part, but I see a ton of flaws in this game. I may come back to one of my other characters at some point but I don’t see that happening any time soon. I have read reviews for the DLC and I have to say, I’m disappointed with what I’ve read and can confidently say I will not be picking up any DLC. That's a shame, because I really would have liked them to fix some of the flaws and expand on some of the good things they did in this game. If you’re a fan of CRPGS, and you don’t mind a game with some major flaws, and you’re looking for a game with an overall good story and decent roleplaying, then I say give this game a shot. If you’re looking for a fun challenge with polished mechanics, while also being entertained by a good story, then I would say *Maybe.* If you’re set on looking for a CRPG that is going to be a good challenge and don’t really care about a story, then I’d probably turn you away from this game. My biggest wish and the main thing that stops me from playing this game is the ending. Anyways, thanks for reading the review, hope it helps! I will find somewhere to post my full review, or I will make a video essay about it on youtube one day.

It managed to captivate me for more than a hundred hours and this is why I’m giving it a positive review, but unless you’re really into “old-school” CRPG genre – you should avoid this one. Also, if you decide to play -  I recommend to start the first run on Core difficulty. 

[h3]Pros:[/h3]
Main Story;
Exploration;
Good variability in Main quest;
Companions*;
Flexible difficulty settings;
Enormous number of classes, spells and loot.
[h3]Cons:[/h3]
AI**
Bad UI;
Lack of variability in side quests;
Companions’ personality and prehistory*;
Lack of balance on fixed difficulties;
Multiple OP spells, classes/subclasses, items, which make other obsolete;
Crusade Mode***;
Slow start(first four levels in TTRPG-based games are always lacking in terms what your character can do; in WoTR leveling-up to 6th level took around twenty hours for me );
Combat System****;
Minor bugs like passable doors or healing/harming spell disappears due to lack of movement.

[h3]Overall:[/h3]
This game is one of the purest TTRPG’s experiences in computer games, which is the root cause of the most problems WoTR has. Probably, my opinion on this matter is subjective, but I don’t understand why do we need dice rolls for ability checks, while failure leads only to “unavailability” of additional content for the player, because your wizard suddenly forgot how to read. Also, this game highlights that first editions of DND and first edition of Pathfinder are rather poor foundation for computer games due to non-existent combat balance: all encounters are either to easy or require you to cast a dozen buffs on your party before the combat, or even to use “unbeatable” strategy of conjuring a horde of meatshields, who hold the line, while your caster destroys everything.

[h3]Footnotes:[/h3]
* - [spoiler]Companions have decent quests and distinguishable personalities. However, their back-story is superficial (with exception of Daeran, Arueshalae and Camelia). It feels like their existence began at the moment they’ve met your main character (MC). Furthermore, I find most of them either annoying, gross or not fitting their class. I think the only characters I come close to liking are Regil and Arueshalae, but first should have been dwarf and second should’ve been evil from the start.[/spoiler]
** - AI is bad. It constantly leads its minions into area of effect spells and try to attack your party with the spells you have immunity to.
*** - I don’t know why it was added. The only thing it does is prolonging already huge game. 
**** - Combat system in WoTR is bad. Furthermore, it has designed to throw enemies at you each 5 meters or so. In more details: It seems to me that developers tried to run after two hares and caught neither. Game offers you two types of combat: turn-based and real time with pause (RTWP). However, both types are bad. RTWP suffers from “foundation” issues and from dumb AI, which doesn’t allow you to delegate controls to it even during slightly challenging battles. Turn-based mode looks like it wasn’t planned from the beginning and as a result was rushed. Game doesn’t provide any tactical depth to engage player into combat. There aren't shield or flanking mechanics like in Expeditions:Rome (here both flanking and sneaking are mostly perk-based, while in Rome they are based on positioning); you can't interact with different surfaces on a level of Divinity OS series; you don't have ""bonus actions"" like in Baldur's Gate 3, where you can Shove opponent or throw something into him, etc. Overall, turn-based mode in this game fills boring and has rather inconvenient UI (I often lose my action due to going too far). Furthermore, you can’t control your summons or your extra attacks after your first foe died.
Another issue with combat is the enormous number of immunities, resistances and overinflated armour class, which either turns battles into a slugfest or forces you to play certain builds. I'm not going even to mention the Swarms.
The worst combat issue is the encounter design, As I said earlier WoTR lacks tactical depth and sadly encounter design killed positioning as well. Enemies constantly spawn around you, you are being ambushed in scripted events, etc.  I think battle on the bridge in the Ivory Sanctum is one of the worst examples of encounter design in gaming.

After all this negative you can wonder why I’m playing this game? Answer is simple: approx. 10% of the encounters are great and they made me go forward looking for more. Additionally, there aren’t many big CRPG games nowadays and this is a good one even with all its flaws.

I feel like every system in this game is designed with the sole purpose to repeatedly fuck you in the ass. This game shits on your time and proceeds to set it on fire. 

 I reached my breaking point when attempting to ""save"" the courtesans in Daeran's house. 100% pure RNG, absolutely no action you can take to preemptively increase your chances of keeping them all alive. ""Why care"" you might ask? Because they knowingly designed an achievement for it. Otherwise I would just think it's pretty much scripted for everyone in that room to die. These unarmed and essentially naked dumbfucks actually RUSH demons. ""What's the big deal? Just reload until you get it."" Well to add shit icing to the shit cake that is this game, you have to watch an unskippable cutscene each and every time and it's genuinely rage inducing. Why Owlcat? Who the fuck ok'd this? 

Even before that, I was just not having fun. Enemy mobs with insanely high AC, spending 10 minutes buffing just to overcome it, only to have an enemy roll 3 20's in a row and destroy my party. 

Also, ""Last Azlanti"" mode doesn't even tell you it's permadeath and will delete your save if your party all dies. Why the actual fuck would you not tell players that? Thank god I only got shafted in the prologue. I can only imagine if I had spent 40 hours just to get screwed over and all my time flushed down the drain solely because the developers didn't think it prudent to add a detailed description of a fucking mode.

WOTR has a ton going for it, the narrative, world building and details put into everything is incredible. However that comes with tons of bugs, a wall of min maxing and spell spamming gameplay, and some really eyebrow raising choices with various mechanics.

Companions: 5/10. Most start off bland or cringey, but they all start to grow on you, some later than others unfortunately. Some require rather esoteric means of recruiting. Some feel like self insert characters that don't belong in the universe.
Mechanics: 4/10. It feels less like DnD and more like a typical MMO, spamming buffs, healing, and just having a massive list of spells where some are good and the rest get unused or are just plain useless. Crusades are a lousy M&M clone.
Difficulty: 3/10. A common complaint, this game stat bloats enemies like crazy and difficulty is a rollercoaster.
Narrative: 9/10. The sheer scope and scale of things are impressive to say the least. I never felt like I knew what was coming and choices felt meaningful.
Graphics: 9/10. Beautiful and fitting, there's so much detail put into the environments and combat animations.
Map Design: 6/10. Most are too big, lots of backtracking in some parts, and the reality defying abyss gets old quick.
Puzzles: 2/10. Utter garbage most of them are esoteric time wasters that don't even have consistent rules.

Essentially there's a lot of good buried under a lot of bad. Like a cruel DM holding a really good story hostage. Yeah balance is hard, but maybe that's where more testing and focus should have gone instead of whacky mechanics most people don't like. If the flaws weren't so bad I'd rate it up there with Baldur's Gate because of the universe and story. It reminds me a lot of Cyberpunk 2077, there's a core there that's strong and could have been a timeless work, but instead all the busy work and awful implementation drives most away. Most are using cheats with Toybox which is just proof the game is pretty much unplayable on its own.

The Good:
+ You can beat this game if you love enjoy your story without worry about combat in-game if you bad at RPG gameplay which is good
+ You can try get trauma if you love challenge yourself or want to claim all Achievements if you are veteran RPG player which is good
+ The game name Pathfinder and you truly chose your path. Don't try to check guild or help online to find out what is the best option to chose. Just take a sip of water/soda/tea/coffee/hot chocolate and think about what will you do, what do you want when you are that main character?
+ There are no right option, there are no right route for you when that time come. Be a good guy, be bad guy or simply want to see the world burn for nothing is fine as long as you play as your will
+ Great story write, good game when you want try something else before/after playing Baldur gate game
+ Romance option is kinda good. Great develop character story specially my little spidey....(I am sorry for left you but i am feel more pain when she left her world...)
+ Base game is already good. Never try DLC but might try when have a chance

The Bad:
+ Bug... not ruin your gameplay like some dialog loss sound, crash when loading save sometime, delete useless items function don't work well,...ect but the game is good, don't worry much about those bug... Or that damm bug with scythe...
+ Need more NPC portrait

- You good/suck at RPG game
- You want to romance somebody in not normal way (or simp someone)
- You want to see how bad your personal are
- You want t see how good your personal are
- You want to see your blade and arrow miss a lot of time even though you put all your point on DEX (hurt my eyes when try Turn-base battle)

The game starts in the most generic way possible, every major event is scripted to the letter, and it’s difficult to care about anything that happens, especially with characters eager to provide you with lore dump at every opportunity, while having no real personality of their own.
Sure, lore dump can be enjoyable, but only if the world is intriguing on its own, which this one definitely isn’t.

In other words, if you enjoed Pillars Of Eternity, NWN or came from a tabletop background, Wrath Of The Righteous would feel great.

You think that if the character is in your party during the party management screen, an x usually means move them out of the party. I actually deleted a character by accident and did not realise hours later. Have a unique build with lots of interesting abilities and spells? Nice, they are nested in buttons. These are basic UI design 101... come on.

On top of that there are some really annoying QoL issues like your mouse click doesn't register once in a while, and you have to double click.

I tried so many times to enjoy this game, and the core combat and RPG elements are fun, but boy do they like to make it hard for you to enjoy it with a combo of annoying gameplay, UI and QoL issues.",1630848916,1698558436,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This is one of the longest rpgs that I have ever played story wise.  As someone new to pathfinder, I think WOTR is amazing in almost every aspect, and exceeded my expectations in most areas. Main story is incredible and deep.  Story companions are well developed and interesting.  Combat is well designed and enjoyable in both real time and turn based modes - try both. Boss fights are generally smoother in turn based, but it's also more satisfying to roll over a mega boss in real time.  Character customization is the biggest pro of this game.  Build options are incredible and very complex.  You don't really have to worry about min/maxing outside of higher difficulties.  I do recommend playing on Core+ or custom just to be able to build your companions to your liking.  Not all auto leveled builds are terrible, but you can certainly build better allies with personal customization. 

I have to say that I don't get all the hate against crusade mode that I've read in reviews.  It's a fun game within the game, and it's not overly complex and most importantly provides alot of great weapons, armor, and accessories that can be obtained at the start of chapter 3.  I enjoy crusade mode and find it's a good change of pace from party combat. 

There remain a few balance issues with this game combat wise but a well built party can overcome almost anything.  There are some fights on Unfair that feel very unfair.  All the puzzles are bad. Not good at all unfortunately.  Puzzle mini-games are not intuitive at all and provide almost no direction within the game as to the logic of solving them.  There is, technically, a logic to them; however, it is so cryptic that you will probably solve the puzzle with trial and error (not easily) far before you are able to deduce the logic behind the puzzle itself.  Save yourself hours of headache and just search the results for these puzzles.  As someone who loves puzzles, this was the most disappointing part of WOTR to me.

In my opinion, the best way to play this game is to try it with companion auto-builds once on a lower difficulty and then on subsequent playthroughs try a different class/build and crank the difficulty down on the early game so you can remove a lot of the beginning repetition but crank up the difficulty until you hit a sweet spot where you can still have fun and feel the power of your build choices.

I even dig the alignment system--those who complain about it think that being evil means selecting every single dialog or choice marked ""evil"". Not so! Some of these options represent a completely depraved evil, others are more nuanced. Want to be a lawful evil bureaucrat? You can! Choose your dialog options based on what fits your character, which will end up equating to some lawful and some evil but not all of either. It's a great system and it works, you can be whatever kind of character you want to be.

I have played through this game once and started a new play-trough but out of the 120hrs I have in this game I would say about 30hrs were good, fun content. 
There are some good elements that are fine by themselves, but as the game progresses you start to notice how far down you really are and how much this fun core was transformed after your first few lvl. 10+ encounters.

THE GAMEPLAY- Late stage combat is easily the most annoying in any game I have played thus far. I will gloss over how unbalanced certain classes are in relation to each-other due to the sheer number of available classes, but the massive chasm between them still cant be ignored. It is a cycle of needing to stack buffs before every single encounter (dont forget to save beforehand), entering combat, dispelling all of the buffs the enemies get for free, and after all of their buffs are whittled down as far as they can you still have to fight with obnoxiously high armour class of the enemies and blatantly unfun enemies that just have immunities/resistances to half of the things you can throw at them. Then you either succeed or reload a save to do it again. I wont spoil anything but the final boss felt genuinely insulting to fight against. 

It is a different type of combat, but it would be dishonest not to mention the absolute atrocity that is the ""strategy game"" part on the campaign map, where you play the most low quality turn based board game that isnt even fun the first time around. 
Well, you can disable this strategy game part! Except you will be missing out on a lot of rewards that you wont be granted in any other way.
The world map itself has no redeeming qualities, it is too large so you just end up resting all the time, which the game actively punishes making you take detours to your city to rest up properly, making the journey EVEN LONGER. The random encounters on the road also do not make the experience any more pleasing.

THE SETTING - Very cool. The worldwound and demonic invasion concept are still very fun to make your characters around, to see how you can integrate them into the setting and see your ambition come to fruition. Also custom portraits make character creation very fun. 

THE STORY - Very little of it is interesting and it is surprisingly linear, very negative because one would expect mythic paths to largely expand role-playing potential, but no. If you choose a lich mythic path you will be an evil sorcerer, if you choose the demon mythic path you are a power-obsessed animal an so on. Your story is very much based around what mythic path you choose, not the choices you make throughout lets say, interactions you have with other important characters in the story. Without spoiling too much I choose the demon mythic path on my first play-through and tried to redeem my character through a scripted event that is sure to happen when you select demon. You get to roll a skill check to switch your mythic path to a Legend. The problem? I failed the check and remained a demon. This doesnt bother me by itself, and if anything it could have added a lot of depth to my character, but what followed most certainly did. The very important character that gives you the opportunity to do this check acts like you straight up denied their request for redemption and basically say ""well fuck you"" and then are never seen again. The only options I was left after this encounter, that were related to the mythic path, was just boring, scary villain stuff, like I made no attempt to better myself. In the ending slides the narrator was like ""he died and noone liked him because he was a demon"" which made no sense as said character was actually good aligned by the end and made an effort to do good in the second half of the game.

Companion quests? Well... The companions themselves are ok, but if you deny their one request that they have for one specific companion quest, you will just remain strangers throughout the whole game. If you put a quest off there will be nothing to remind you of it and no in-game repercussions if you dont pursue them until the end credits. And therein lies my biggest problem with this game. 

When you miss out on a story element, it is just gone. It offers you no alternative to this questline that ""you didnt do properly"" or even worse because you failed a skill check, which is basically asking the player to save-scum. The quest line is just over and there is nothing you can do about it. You get the feeling you always did a wrong thing when a quest ends early for whatever reason, which is horrible for an RPG. It needs some other bone to throw you, another way you can complete said quest or some sort of long felt consequences for acting a certain way, but this game just shuts the door in front of your face instead. ""You dont do THIS with your character? Shame, try doing it with your next character that would do something like that. THEN you will have access to this content! After a mind-numbing 100 extra hours on your next playthrough!""

Pricing- the game itself is a good price on a discount but the DLC pricing is absolutely atrocious, because you are paying almost half of the games price for a new companion and a new class.

But I suppose if I need to add more then Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is a wonderful game with an excellent story. The characters are well written, and the story consistently had me wanting more and trying to piece plot lines together before they happened through hints that the game sprinkles in. The system is very crunchy with a lot of options for success. You have so many classes to choose from and even the classes have *archetypes* which can change how they play entirely. There's so much content to this game even without the roguelike DLC that they added. This game feels like an instant classic to me.

The only things I have to dissuade anyone from buying this is the amount of RNG that takes place throughout the game. Even if you think you're guaranteed to succeed a roll you're wrong, the game WILL find a way to give you a seat in the failure corner. Also the combat in this game requires a lot of patience due to the Pathfinder TTRPG system this game is based on.

So far I'm having a great time- the game comes with a mixture of classic RPG elements, lots of different class options and quite a few paths for the player to take. It already has the turnbased option implemented (so big fights can be more manageable and less hectic) and I was surprised to see a type of battle that is  pretty much ripped straight out of Heroes of Might and Magics - both in terms of feel and looks. 

Generally speaking, though: If you are a fan of the original Baldur's Gate games (and therefore don't mind the game being hard and at times unforgiving), then this title is for you. Lots of fun creative writing choices and more engaging companions in comparison to Kingmaker. 

[b] I do think there is still some stuff to be improved upon: [/b]

- For example the Heroes Rip-off battles could greatly benefit from an automatic fighting option. Otherwise it gets really tedious, when you do miniscule damage to a unit, but that unit also can't kill you...

- This game's fatal flaw honestly is that Woljif is not among the romanceable characters - considering that he's one the most charming, fun and engaging party members and has been used to advertise this game,  I was saddened to find that this tiefling is not kissable thus far.
Huge oversight tbh.

In terms of overall writing I cannot say much yet, as I have only played 30 hours and expect my first playthrough to take about 60 more. I have noticed that Owlcat has a trend of making good aligned characters a little...bland.

just to be clear there were things i enjoyed about this mission, that with some tweaks couldve been a much better overall experience, for example, a little more npc participation, appropriate xp and the ability to actually loot everything you killed, and maybe another level to pad your spell slots a little better. i'll admit i was just a bit grumpy after that slog of a mission and my review reflected that. i still don't recommend this game to anyone until something is done about that mission, but i'm wiling to change my recommendation as soon as that happens.
*end edit*

Dear Owlcat games. i just played the tavern defense mission. WHAT IN THE EVERLOVING FUCK MADE YOU THINK THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE ENCOUNTER FOR LEVEL 3 CHARACTERS. I SURELY KILLED LIKE 60 BADGUYS AND THAT BULLSHIT CR8 FIENDISH MINOTAUR  WITH TWO LEVELS OF SLAYER. AND WHY THE FUCK DID THE NPC GUARDS NOT EVEN PARTICIPATE UNTIL THE MONSTERS WERE LITERALLY BURNING DOWN THE TAVERN, AND EVEN THEN THEY ONLY FOUGHT THE MELEE BADGUYS THAT GOT IN IMMEDIATE RANGE. On top of that why did you think only 690xp was appropriate when i fought enough badguys to cover at least 3 levels if this were the tabletop game. why did you not let me collect all the loot afterwards and instead you only gave me like 1500 gold and like 4 trash weapons.

seriously owlcat games. what the fuck? you owe me and everyone else a fucking apology for subjecting us to that.

i will NOT be reccomending this game to anybody until you patch this game and have the npc's participate in that combat and you give full fucking loot and xp for the fucking bullshit you subjected us to in that fight.

unfuck yourselves owlcat games.

I would say that this game is still the best CRPG ever for me.


One of the new CRPG player friendly by far.

I have been trying to get into CRPG for story and choice matter games. While I enjoy to watch the steamer play this type of game or watch the summary scope, it is really hard for me to play them by myself. Because of the terrible UIs of this kind of game and lack of good tutorial in the past, I couldn't finished games like POE1,2 , Original sin 1 and 2. I can make far progresses in a few game like Icewind Dale and Dragon age: Origin. However, this game and Wasteland 3 are the game changer for me.  Wasteland 3 made a huge improve in term of UIs for the genre. Meanwhile, Wrath of the Righteous (maybe also Kingmaker) has a good tutorial and very appeal art for western high fantasy for someone who love JRPG arts. 

There are 2 important cons of this game for me.

1. The time limit system of the main quests, the game does not  exactly tell you which quest you should finish first. This makes players to save a lot to avoid their mistakes.

2. The alignment and choices of this game is boring. Unlike the game like Wasteland 3 or Witcher 3 that are really hard to decide what choice players should make.

This game is easy for me to recommend for any D & D turn based strategy fan. I spend hours creating and leveling up characters. Download the custom portraits from nexus mods and get ready for some tough decisions.

The world is expansive and richly detailed, the characters are unique and interesting, the story is intricate but not overwhelming, and the design can be quite lovely.

So then why don't I recommend it?

The primary reason is because the highlights are overshadowed by some disappointing low points.

The world is beautiful but you'll be whipping the camera around half the time to just be able to see what's happening which gets wildly disorienting after not too long. The compass helps but it's definitely annoying to have to constantly re-orient the screen to get an idea of what I'm looking at. The individual area maps feel cramped and very vertical because you're always trying to turn it to get a wall out of the way or see around a bush.

The maps are interesting but the game has a fun habit of hiding exits and critical points from you at which point you get to scramble to every point on the map to try and find the special exit. I got stuck on a number of maps just clicking around trying to find where I was supposed to go which is the opposite of fun.

While the world itself is detailed, the stuff in it is not. Loot becomes repetitive very quickly and you see the same parade of items come up again and and again only to be dumped off with a merchant which leaves you with mountains of gold and nothing to spend it on.

You'll end up with piles of scrolls and potions that have to be sorted and handed out to your companions (put a pin in that) to a degree that you almost don't need a spellcaster at all with the number of scrolls you end up having. Maybe that's just a function of the difficulty I was playing on (Normal) but I spent a lot of time selling off scrolls and potions.

The miscellaneous treasure is a nice touch but it becomes visual noise pretty quickly. Why pick up a handful of gems that is, somehow, worth only a few gold when I'm already sitting on a ton of gold? Most of the ""treasure"" doesn't sell for enough to make the time needed to sort it worth spending.

The ""loot"" part of the game dies quickly because you just don't want to spend the effort to sort things that are only marginally different from the last fifty things you've found.

Combat is in an awkward place. It's not bad but it's also not great. Your companions can't/won't use items (like potions or scrolls) unless you select them and tell them to use the item which means you get to micromanage your team to get them to use everything. You can highlight a single ability or spell that they'll hammer incessantly but that's of highly limited utility. Combat necessitates a large degree of micromanagement to a degree that gets exhausting and you just kinda give up and zone out after a while.

Real-time combat can be an absolute blurry mess and turn-based makes every fight ten times longer than it needs to be.

Overall it just makes me want to avoid combat simply because I don't want to bother with it.

The Crusade portion of the game feels...extraneous. You can turn it off but it just kinda begs the question of why have a whole huge part of a game in it if you can just....turn it off? The map system in general is a further annoyance. You have to rest constantly and it slows everything down to an extensive degree and doesn't really add anything to the game so it feels like just a way to slow things down.

You can make potions and scrolls but...who cares? You're drowning in those already, why would you need or want more of them? You can cook things but the buff is ""meh"" and you have to lug around a bunch of special ingredients to make them work so, again, why bother?

This is a lot of small gripes but they pile up to a game I can't really recommend. I think people interested in the dungeon crawl aspect are going to get bored pretty quickly and while the story is rich, the gameplay kinda gets in the way to a degree that's off-putting in a hurry.

With a re-work and some streamlining, I'd be genuinely excited about this game but I can't recommend it at this point.",1697673143,1697673143,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

And the choices actually make sense for various types of characters, characterization and personality-wise.

The gameplay is quite a let down though, it’s very much a spreadsheet game where Min-Maxing is essentially a must, while there’s little to no environmental interaction and tactical thinking to it. A very build base game, some encounters require a myriad stacks of buffs which can take a few minutes to completely set up to have a reasonable chance to win but it also more or less means the combat is very simple, just build your PC and NPCs up properly after that you can let it go, you can turn on AI and win without thinking much during the fight itself, something I frankly hate. Especially when various feats and builds aren’t viable and you tend to be railroaded into choosing a very optimized and specialized build since it’s quite noticeable on how superior it performs.

For all that BSs, you can just scale the difficulty down and play it normally, min maxing be damned.

My favorite ruleset implementation for character building was DnD 3.5 in NWN2.  The execution of the ruleset in party based combat stunk.  It lacked challenge, and many of the statuses, area affects, etc. didn't work properly.  The build options in WotR are as good or better, and the implementation is a true challenge.  Some complain of the wild swings in game difficulty between settings.  The challenge has been a breath of fresh air.  Party composition, skills, rare abilities, traits, etc..all add up to an incredibly fun and challenging experience.

The rest mechanics, corruption, overland map, etc. all play well together for a complete and integrated experience.  When I think of PoE's adventure map on the high seas, it was a bit comical and didn't flow well with the campaign and various encounters.  I never feel like the campaign and army mechanics are disjointed or play independently in WotR.

The writing is generally fine to good.  WotR is a bit campy, but I can't tell if it is intentional or not. It likely has some translation issues, but overall I've enjoyed the companion and quest dialogue.  You can't have high fantasy without a few cringe-worthy moments.

Owlcat had a winner here then shot themselves in the foot. Still, with some mods and a lot of perseverance, it's salvageable. There's a rough diamond buried somewhere in there.

The good stuff first. It's got great world building, a decent plot, a huge variety of options for character generation, memorable companions to adventure with and some good dungeons to take your party through. Great itemization too. The story sucked me in, I happily spent hours tinkering with my characters, and I liked almost all the companions. A couple are a little stolid but the rest - very well done. Even when they were a pint sized darth vader. The world's most sarcastic assimar. Or a raving psychopath.

The ok: The combat's.... not bad. It sells itself on being either turn based or rtwp. Tbh, neither is that great. Turn based is pretty dumbed down compared to say, DOS2, while RTWP was desperately crying out for the variable speeds that POE2 gave us. It turns into a Benny Hill sketch most of the time. Luckily, there is a third option - tactical timeflow - which I found an okish compromise. The game's basically paused and you hold down a button when you want to advance ut at 50% speed. It's a bit frenetic and not as good as POE2, but it's doable for the most part. 

The bad... The dev's decided to try their damnest to stop you enjoying all of that goodness. 
- The ruleset's unnecessarily overcomplicated, poorly explained in game and they hired *fextralife* of all sites to do the wiki. Yeah. You'll google alot.
- They decided to force you to spend half your time playing an incredibly clunky, dumbed down strategy game (crusade management). It's awful.
- When you get to the crpg part, the map's enormous, you can't go two steps without a random encounter or having to rest, and half the stuff on it's pointless
- It really doesn't respect your time. It makes you backtrack far too much, forces you into long dialogue sequences, and often prevents you from saving. I dread returning to the keep.
- It's still pretty rough around the edges. The pathfinding is *awful,* there are a lot of minor glitches eg pets disappearing, characters not rendering, abilities not working... and some more serious ones though. 

In short, it feels like they bunged absolutely everything they could think of into the game with zero filtering; sure some of it's darn good, but some of it's just padding, and some of it's pretty awful. 

You've basically got two choices. You can switch crusade management to auto, put levelling on auto, turn the difficulty down to story mode and just  sort of cruise through it for the story. Or you're going *need* mods - toybox, bubble's autobuff, the crusade auto win mod, the bug fix ones... - have a lot patience and be willing to do a lot of googling to figure stuff out. 

Doing that stuff it was worth it for me but I'm not sure I'd recomend this to someone who's only got a casual interest in crpgs, say just coming from BG3. You need to have a lot of time, an awful lot of patience and be wiling to push through a lot of makework to get to the fun stuff. When you do, it's great.

Amazing game, with plenty of issues. Very easy to mess up your builds without proper knowledge of game mechanics. But once you get it down the gameplay loop is very fun. Companions and npcs are diverse and intriguing with plenty of variations to their stories and endings. Main story is engaging and exciting, side quests are much less consistent in quality. Crusade mechanics suck. Forced waiting for crusade content as well as the transition to Act 4 and the secret ending are super annoying. Maybe 15% of dialogue is voice acted. 

Get some QoL mods, adjust difficulty settings throughout the game or follow a strict build if you dont mind not going in completely blind. Highly recommend Demon mythic for first playthrough, or Angel if being evil is that much of a problem. If you dont care at all about story and just want to kill things in satisfying ways play Trickster.

One piece of advice I have for you is this:
If you are comfortable with RTS style of combat and pathfinder system, as well as min-maxing of characters go ahead and play on normal and higher difficulties. However if you find this tedious or boring, for the love of god please drop to the lowest difficulty and experience the story and the world of Pathfinder.

Despite being based on Pathfinder, a system that is probably among the most complicated RPG rulesets to ever <bless | curse> this world, it's eminently [i]playable[/i] in a way that a lot of its older Infinity Engine inspirations, like Baldur's Gate and Planescape Torment, never were. This time, you do not have to suffer through a barely-playable game just to get to the good writing!

And good the writing is. D&D has a reputation for being a ""generic"" fantasy setting, but that's only if you ignore all the interesting parts of it -- and Pathfinder: WOTR is [i]all about[/i] those interesting parts, especially the cosmology, kind of in the vein of Planescape Torment.

The ""Mythic Path"" system is an incredible addition, particularly in how it ties together gameplay and narrative. Effectively, it lets you take on the archetype of something beyond the mortal pale (an angel, aeon, loki-esque trickster, etc), and use those powers to ""break the game"" and even ""break the story"" -- but it's far more interesting than a simple power fantasy because [i]your ability to ""break the rules"" is bound by the archetype you choose[/i].

The Crusade system, with its clone-of-Heroes-Of-Might-And-Magic combat and basic nation management, adds a nice bit of spice to it all and serves as a welcome break from dungeon crawling, but without being so in-depth that it steals the show entirely.

The game its rough parts; some of the puzzle dungeons are rather long and sometimes unintuitive (but at least they tried -- more than I can say for most CRPGs these days), and balance is sometimes a little rough, with the early game being well on the difficult side but the late game descending into nukefests as your quadratic wizards two-shot bosses. And sometimes you will probably find yourself needing to consult a guide. But none of its flaws feels fatal to the overall game experience, at least to me.

My primary warning is that the game is [i]really big[/i] and some parts of it have quite a lot of combat, though it depends on where you are in the story. This is easily a 200 hour game, especially if you play in turn-based mode; don't go into it expecting anything less. Don't try to marathon your way through the game as fast as possible as you might for a 20-30 hour RPG or you will probably burn yourself out.

There are so many decisions that for the life of me I cannot understand, in addition to Owlcat seemingly being unable to design normal encounters.

Like I first mentioned, the rail roading. This is one of my greatest pet-peeves, since the scenes where this happens look good on paper, but are horrible in practice. In the first dungeon you have that four-armed demon thingy that you walk right in front despite having an elevated tactically superior position. Then there's an encounter with a necromancer, and your party cleric decides to charge ahead on his own. In theory this makes for dramatic set pieces, in actuality it's just incredibly clumsy and hamfisted.

Another big problem: the encounters specifically customized to fuck you in the ass. Like the succubus in the lesbian couple's house, that has permanent mage armor + shield (iirc AC 28), can also cast invsibility to guarantee flat-footed condition, and level drains with a +9 touch attack (completely ignoring the usual grapple requirement for a succubus's energy drain ability). Owlcat... are you alright? Do you think stuff like this is okay? It's the bandit archers from Kingsmaker all over again. m(

The biggest disappointment so far was the encounter with the eyeless demoness once you make it back to the city. It's pretty obvious that the game tries to recreate and -capture the first encounter with Irenicus at Waukeen's Promenade in BG2, but if just falls flat on its face for several reasons:

* In BG2 it's Irenicus that decides to let you go in order to deal with the Cowled Wizards. In WotR a low-level NPC ""drags you away"" from the 28 HD epic level demon with AC 35 or whatever.
* In BG2 Irenicus actually doesn't want to kill you, because he wants to continue experimenting on you. In WotR you're nothing but an inconvenience to the epic level demon, and in the battle she drops the (relatively speaking) equivalent of tactical nukes on your party without batting an eye.
* In BG2 Irenicus is already in battle with another, similarly strong, force. In WotR the 28 HD epic level demon can focus her undivided attention on your level 3 or so party.

I used to play Baldurs Gate 1 and 2, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity...
Let's say I'm used to CRPGs. The character creation is intimidating even when you're used to that kind of stuff, but by keeping it simple, it's fine, there's just a lot of information to digest.

I've had a great time playing the first chapter (or first act don't know how to call it). It's immersive, interesting, the city is fun to explore, combats are well balanced, I was very excited in anticipation for the rest of the game!

And then the second chapter, well... I gave up on the game after 20-ish hours.
The whole crusade gameplay is just a pain in the ass in my opinion. It just slows the pace of the game for uninteresting management and even less interesting combat with your army and commanders. I almost gave up on the game at that point then realized you can turn the whole crusade thing off in the options. Thank god!

Story wise I think it got stale, and the combats felt unbalanced.
For example, apart from my main character I also have a full CON fighter specialized in shields and defense, a real tank in theory. How frustrating is it to spend the whole fight chugging potions and spamming healing spells on my fighter just so he can barely make it? A lot. That on normal difficulty. It feels like once a character is targeted by an enemy, they might as well be dead.
Also, a lot of defense and utility spells at first but magic doesnt seem that great for damage compared to sneak attacks and archers.

So after 24 hours of gameplay, I give up on the game because 
1) I'm not enjoying the combats, I tried lowering the difficulty but then I one shot pretty much anything so that's not much more entertaining.
2) The story grows very unoriginal, while having good writing and interesting characters and side stories, the more hours I spent in this game the less I cared about anything happening.


I'm sure a lot of people would enjoy the game though, it's just not my cup of tea.

Sure there are lot of classes but a lot of the choices don't really seem to matter.

I think I've played every RPG game to the end but had no desire to finish ""Chapter 4 - Abyss"" and uninstalled. One of the, if not the, most annoying and frustrating level designs imaginable.
The pathways are narrow, parts of the terrain shift when you rotate your camera and there a lot of pointless puzzles too.

Now I have to compare this to BG3 which I couldn't stop once I started.
If I'd put a finger which makes this one suck in comparison, other than the terrible Abyss level, it's another quantity over quality thing that ales a lot of other CRPGs.
Have to credit though that BG3 had a budget around $100 million while Pathfinder had only a fraction of that at around 2 million AFAIK.

Can't please everyone sure, but listen to your play tester's feedback, I'm sure I'm not the only one who hated this entire Abyss level. And for the next one, put quality over quantity.",1696744449,1696745037,False,5,0,0.528795838356018066,0,True,False,False

[tr][td][h3]Conclusion[/h3][/td][td]
Overall, this game caters towards a main demographic of tabletop players for pathfinder. This is no easy game to wrap your head around if you're coming from Baldur's Gate 3, it will be feel more akin to neverwinter nights 2, as well as the infinity engine games. However, if you're willing to put time into the game, the story is very consistent, more times than not reintroducing characters you met prior and your choices have consequences. There are bugs present in the game since it switched over to a newer release of Unity, however they are non game breaking, some events for quests however could feel apparent and break the immersion for you. I can only think of 2 instances, but they are very small side quests for companions.

And for OwlCat, DLC 6 better include a [b]nenio romance[/b] or we will riot.

The game in general does a good job of customization options all around, including with difficulty and play styles. 

Overall, I enjoyed that aspect of it and arguably prefer this game over Baldur's Gate 3 because I prefer Pathfinder's complex character options to 5th edition DnD's simplicity. That said, the complexity of Pathfinder, especially as adapted to a video game, doesn't perfectly pan out easily and it becomes difficult to avoid things becoming broken or otherwise requires meticulous build plotting that can get overwhelming and convoluted. And this is something of a munchkiny action RPG in practise. I don't mind that to an extent.    

But the main problem with this game is that it makes the same mistake as Kingmaker by spitting the game into both a core RPG and a strategy game at once that blocks one from proceeding with exploration and quests, but it is a bit less egregious about it than Kingmaker. Because of this I never quite finished Kingmaker despite putting lots of hours and numerous playthroughs into it, because the strategy game part ruined my immersion and blocked the exploration and RPG game play. It got frustrating that way.  

I would prefer a pure Pathfinder RPG experience without the strategy game aspects forced onto the player. Even in this game I had a lot of playthroughs but never went beyond the 2nd chapter or never made it to Drezen precisely because the strategy game system seemed to block my progress with super difficult battles. It's a bad design choice trying to do too much at once. Unlike Gwent in the The Witcher 3, which is an optional mini game that's fun, the strategy game part of the Pathfinder video games is a requirement and a tedious chore.   

That said, overall I'd rate this game a 4/5 and consider it a step up from Kingmaker. The core RPG is pretty good and the game serves its function as a video game  adaptation of Pathfinder. It mostly suffers from the splitting into a strategy game and a bit of jankyness at times.",1696733894,1696734906,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

By the end of the game, I had gotten tired of the gameplay and just wanted to finish the story, turning the game on story mode, so I could breeze through the combat. Here are my main complaints about the game:

1. Stories told through exposition dumps: It's not a good idea in books, and it's not too much better in games. This game is very story heavy. Normally, I love that, but at several times, I just got bored with having to read paragraph upon paragraph of exposition, especially when a lot of the side characters that have a lot of text to read have no personality. You need something else besides just dialogue to keep the reader engaged. I'll be honest, I skipped 90% of Storyteller's dialogue because of this.

2. Imbalanced Combat: I'm looking at you, Blackwater! Okay, so this one gets REALLY bad in some parts, especially in Act 3. I was playing the majority of the game on Normal with most of the battles in Turn-based mode. Most of the battles were pretty well-balanced where large groups of enemies and bosses were still difficult and required strategy. However, you reach some places where they just throw these massive beasts with 40+ AC and a quite sizable healthbar at you that none of my characters could hit unless it was a crit. These battles are only possible by realizing you messed up by entering the combat, dying, reloading and then dumping every buff known to man onto your party before starting the combat again, and even then, it takes forever to finish the encounter in real time mode. This was quite common and was one of the other reasons why I lowered the difficulty down to baby mode to finish the game.

3. Resistance to fire / electricity. There are so many awesome spells that you almost never get to use because practically every single enemy in the game is resistant (or immune) to fire and electricity. Nenio just became my buff mage because all her offensive spells either did very little damage due to resistances, or failed due to incredibly high saving through modifiers in the enemies after Act 3.

4. Voice Acting: It's not very good. Certainly not the worst, but almost all the voices sound so out of place in the context of the world of pathfinder.

5. Writing: It's okay. There are some times where the dialogue is great, other times where it's so bad, I wonder how it made it through the editing process.

6. Party Customization: When you first start the game, you create your character and are overwhelmed with the huge amount of classes and subclasses available to you. However, your character is the only one who you can freely customize. Every other character has a set class (and they are pretty standard) and if you don't like it, you have to multiclass, which, since their stats are preset, limits your options. Also, you'll never see their class reach level 20 if you do that. If you retrain the story characters, their level resets only to what they were when they joined your party. I know that if I want to experience the other classes the game has to offer, I can just restart and customize my character with a different class, but the game took me around 180 hours to complete. I don't have the time to do that again.


Conclusion: The game has some really major flaws, which may not have seemed so major had I not just finished Baldur's Gate 3, but I did, so I can't help but compare. The writing I can get over. Writing is difficult, especially when you are writing this much. Seriously, the amount of text in this game can probably fill a whole book. But the gameplay problems could have easily been fixed and tweaked to make it more fun.

I had a good time for the majority of the game, despite these flaws (thus the recommendation), but you either need a lot of patience or to skip a lot of content to make it through the game without becoming burnt out. By the end, I was more glad that the game was finally over rather than satisfied at the conclusion of a story well told.",1696510003,1696510720,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

****EDIT****
Looks like the bugs have been ironed out, can't be sure about all of them, but the ones that were inhibiting my enjoyment are gone. Definitely worth it for fans of these kinds of RPG's or DnD. Tons of replayability.

***Original reveiew***

I really want to love this game. I enjoy it immensely, when it is working.

An update today apparently ruined my capacity to recruit mercenary characters, which was working fine yesterday. Now I go through the process of creating the new character, then the final button doesn't work on the first click. Then on the second click, the interface closes as if it made the character, yet no character is to be found. Instead it just takes my gold. Reloading and restarting have done nothing.

This is game-breaking for me as one of the best features of this game(and the first one) was making at least a couple of custom characters and maxing them out to fit specific roles.

Of course I've encountered the rare random crash, but this is not nearly as troublesome as the new mercenary bug. To reiterate, I was playing yesterday and had no problems recruiting. If updates are going to wreck the game, it would be better to wait until they get the kinks ironed out.

UPDATE 1:

This particular bug appears to only affect that game, new games are fine in this regard, although now the interface keeps disappearing on me after I level custom side characters until I use the hotkey for my inventory, then it shows my party as only being my main character until I close the inventory and everything goes back to normal. 

I also keep running into other bugs, the most annoying is one where a mounted character won't pick up an item or investigate a point. They just stand there and if the whole group is selected, they won't move until I select them alone and then move them somewhere else. This only happens with mounted characters but makes going through some areas take twice as long if not longer.

There are also a surprising number of skills/effects that the description reads as ""null"" making some choices a shot in the dark such as this choice gives all units the ""Swords of Gorum"" effect. Hover over it to see what that might be and I get nothing. Some units in the crusade mode have the same issue, which considering how vital that mode is, is disappointing. The update to fix starting stats for some generals apparently didn't affect both of mine in a game already at that point, meaning one has less attack for all his units and the other has less defense. Updates seem to be coming, but who knows when these things will get fixed.

Update 2:

Encountered the same bug in another game. It appears to happen if during character creation(for custom party members) you pick a feat that would give you a default weapon that isn't in the game as a default weapon. For example, it you give a dwarf fighter the feat for specializing in a spiked shield. It won't give you a spiked shield but since it tries, it fails and you just lose the gold. 

Another annoying thing is that despite turning off all the tutorials in the opening options when creating a new game, the tutorials appear nearly constantly in the early game. Yes, I know how attacking works. Oh, you want to tell me about formations after I've been using them in this very game already for more than an hour? Tell me more! There isn't much point in giving people the option to turn off tutorials if you then still force them to see all the tutorials. Unless the objective is to annoy people, in which case it's Christmas.

Update 3:

Been a while and a bunch of updates, of considerable size. Started a new game to try out and see if the same bugs persist, particularly the Cavalier one where they don't pick up items if mounted. Didn't get that far. After creating a new character, the game began without sound. Then the sound of a video I was watching on my other screen cut out. Alt+tabbing to check on the video resulted in the game switching screens. This was fixable with alt+enter and moving it back. Checking on the video playing didn't fix the sound issue. Closing the player and the game didn't fix it either. Only a complete restart of my system restored sound. This is an issue I haven't encountered with any other game and I feel no desire to try to work through it. Probably going to wait a year or two to check on this game again, if I ever feel like reinstalling.",1630982701,1696468354,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It starts great, gets better, but by the final hours it overstayed it's welcome.

1. The crusades were tedious, If I wanted to play Heroes of Might and Magic I would have played Heroes of Might and Magic

[spoiler] 2. The fact that your armies get wiped out after act 4 does nothing more but add tedious padding. [/spoiler]

3. The game is filled to the brim with boring tedious filler combat.

4. Enemy stats are insanse, I played on normal for the first 3 acts, but by act 4 enemy AC was getting trough the roof, and by the end-game, after you defeat [spoiler] deskari (which by the way happens sooner that it should ) [/spoiler] you encounter random demon mooks with ACs in the 50s even on ""weaker enemies"" settings.

5. The quest log was just terrible, especially if you take longer breaks from the game, its impossible to piece together what you were supposed to do or where on some of the quests.

6. In act 5 one of the NPCs required for a companion quest was just missing. Googling for it convinced me that she probably died and the game somehow did not acknowledge that. However in the final battle, she was alive and well, so no clue where that NPC vanished.

7. The final act feels very rushed and phoned it. Tedious battle after tedious battle, with cinematic camera movements before each fight that put you in a bad position, but no dialogue, no interaction, nothing, the game takes control away from you for no reason.

I've played a lot of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, a bit of Neverwinter Nights and Icewind Dale, and most recently an insane amount of Baldur's Gate 3, so it's safe to say I like CRPGs, even old and obtuse ones with stupid mechanics like THAC0. That said, I've never played Pathfinder before, either tabletop or games like Kingmaker, so this ruleset and a lot of the terminology in it is largely new to me, and it's with the ruleset that I have MOST of my complaints. If you already know the rules for Pathfinder, this game seems to me to be a perfectly fine and fun video game implementation of them, but if you don't know Pathfinder already then I warn you to steer clear of it.

I think the 5 foot step rule is awful, I regularly move my character in the 5 foot step mode, swear, change to ranged weapon with move action then shoot with standard action, then next turn I have to 5 foot step again because I have to forfeit my move action to switch back to melee again. 2 turns not spent smashing because of one missclick when really the game should just let you take the rest of your movement at the cost of your move action if you accidentally moved 5 feet without it.

Casters feel completely impotent. Seelah crits for 30+ damage per turn, Lann can shoot 2 or 3 times per turn (with Ki) often for 12 damage a shot, and my 3 casters deal 1d3 damage with a cantrip that misses or is saved half the time because they are incapable of ""aiming into a fight"". When I choose to cast one of my EXTREMELY few spells (both in number of prepared spells and number of spell slots), the overwhelming majority of the time the enemy succeeds their saving throw and my turn is effectively wasted, and even on the occasions where the spell succeeds, we're looking at 1d6 damage and a status effect that lasts for 1 round, which is awful when compared to Seelah and Lann's turn. If Seelah is crit and downed it's basically over.

Terms like ""fortitude"" and ""reflex"" and ""will"" are barely explained -- I genuinely have no idea whether fortitude is dictated by STR or CON or something else, reflex is probably DEX, no idea what will would be from.

There's green ""v"" icons on certain things and I don't think I ever saw an explanation for what this indicates -- I gather that when adding points to abilities like perception and the like that having at least 1 point in the vegan abilities also adds a nice bonus which I assume is like the D&D 5e proficiency bonus, but don't think I ever saw this explained anywhere.

Some spells like ""Create Pit"" have such a long description that you have to expand them just to see how much damage they do or what you can expect from them, and when you've read the whole thing somehow you need to remember that it's initially a reflex save then it's mobility and athletics saves and that you deal a certain number of d6 of damage which depends on who is casting it... right. Now remember all that, and the 500 other spells you'll be offered when levelling up, and maybe you won't have to spend 5 minutes every turn reading descriptions.

A measure of user friendliness such as a % chance to hit when aiming a spell or an attack would be great -- show me the chances before I make the move to save me from spending 30 seconds a round checking for resistances and AC stats just so I know which shitty 1d3 cantrip to use. Show me the % chance for a creature to save on an effect from my spells, or to tell me if the creature is immune to the effect. It's not like I don't have access to this information in the inspect option, and I can see my own character sheet, so why do I have to do so much fucking maths just to make good use of my actions every turn? What do you take me for, a fucking calculator?

Most of the enemies in the first part of the game are completely immune to effects like sleep or mind altering spells, which makes half of the spell lists of Ember and Camellia pointless, reducing them to 1d3 cantrip machines. Camellia has high DEX but few finesse weapon proficiencies, so she's a shitty caster AND a shitty melee unit.

My custom character is a wizard because I like a high save difficulty class control build, but I can only cast like 4 first level spells per day at level 4 even though I have 20 INT? And I have to pick the spells I want to use for the next day BEFORE I rest because I have no opportunity to change them during the rest sequence if I forget, or during an excursion if I want to change my prepared spells before an encounter? This is NEEDLESSLY obtuse, and fuck any sweaty neckbeard who says otherwise.

Certain mini-boss type enemies are resistant to pretty much everything except ""cold or good aligned weapons"" or other such combinations, which means not only do I need to worry about enhancement levels and masterworks but I also need to bear in mind whether my magic weapons are ""good"" or ""cold""... Ridiculously convoluted system.

I've been playing on Normal difficulty and I can see insane training wheels in the combat log, +5 to attack or damage rolls most of the time, that's crazy, and it doesn't feel right. If an early-game party is so inept that we need godlike intervention just to play the game on Normal difficulty then that indicates to me that there's a balance problem. I think a better way of handling this was demonstrated in Baldur's Gate 3, where you can reach level 3 before you even reach the first big fight, after which progression slows back down to a more usual rate.

A bug I regularly have is when I ask a caster to cast a healing spell on someone and they start the animation then abruptly stop: it says in the combat log that they cast the spell, but not that they cast it on the target I requested, nor that the target was healed. Their action is consumed and says ""minor cure wounds"" or whatever, and they lose the spell slot, but nobody is healed.

Another similar bug I have encountered twice with mini-bosses is that I will cast a spell on them and see in the combat log that I penetrated their spell resistance, but then it doesn't state whether the enemy succeeded a saving throw, it just doesn't have an effect on them... what? Where's my fucking spell?

Why are there different types of AC, like touch AC and regular AC? Why do enemies sometimes have both spell resistance AND the ability to save throws like god himself? Why does my caster need to improve their spell penetration AND their casting difficulty class?

Why can Lann at level 3 shoot twice for a full round action, but Seelah only attack once at level 4? When I got Lann he had that already but I can't see anything that explains WHY he has that capability on his character sheet.

A truly mindnumbing experience I had early on in the shield maze was with a champion enemy who clapped my fighter and paladin, then Camillia and my wizard spent literally 5 minutes in combat with him. He would miss 90% of his attacks, I would miss 90% of mine. Occasionally I would have to drink a potion. There was no counterplay at all. I simply had to click the same buttons every turn until I had whittled him to death with 1d3 rays of frost. In BG3 I might have shoved him off something high, or thrown a grease bottle to knock him prone, or kited him with ray of frost to reduce his movement speed significantly every turn, but in this game it was unfortunately just an incredibly uninteractive encounter.

I feel like, at 12 hours, I've given this game a fair shot, and I honestly like the classic CRPG stuff it has going on in it. Unfortunately because of the install size of the game, I need to uninstall it to get some space back for other stuff. Given that BG3 exists with a simpler and more accessible ruleset, and a similar price point (excluding sale prices of course), I just can't recommend this game to anyone looking to try a CRPG for the first time.

A well-designed game based on an existing ruleset would allow you to both enjoy the story while playing according to the standard rules, giving the option to play on harder modes if desired (which you also can here - I can only imagine the ridiculous character optimization needed to do that).

The result is a game almost impossible to enjoy casually unless you effectively break the rules. It's not fun knowing that you're not playing by the rules. Just as it's not fun to know that the game is wildly unbalanced. It's not hard to balance an RPG. Games like Pillars of Eternity do it effortlessly. For some reason these developers just thought the definition of fun was making you plan out almost every single encounter and map out all 20 levels of character development from initial character creation. Maybe that's fun for the obsessive, but it's not fun for people who want to roleplay and enjoy the story. You shouldn't have to choose.    Therefore, this is a bad game, which is a shame, because the content behind it is so good.",1696196101,1696196101,False,98,14,0.642131805419921875,13,True,False,False

This statement is not even related to the game's length, which is quite impressive by itself. It's about how this game does a poor job of helping you play the game itself.

The game plunges you into a tutorial that does help you with the absolute basics in the first part of the game. This is all well and good, but the game completely abandons the idea of providing any helpful information on later chapters. You'll often find yourself trying to understand game mechanics through the in-game encyclopedia, only to realize how nearly useless it is. You may run into descriptions like ""This spell has the effects of spell X..."" without describing or linking to spell ""X"" in question. Or you may find one of your characters with an affliction with no description on how to remove it (is it with rest? Restoration? Remove curse? Dispel? Who knows). You'll be discarding the encyclopedia and ending up relying on external sources.

And the game lies to you. ""There are no wrong choices"", except there are. You can try to lean in to the role-playing aspect and create a character based on that, only to find that it will not be viable on later chapters (the game does allow you to re-spec in certain difficulties). The game will also recommend auto-leveling for your companions. Your auto-leveled companions will be nearly useless in later chapters. You will, once again, have to rely on external sources to be able to build your party and start enjoying the game.

Which brings my next point. The game is very combat-oriented. Almost every situation is only or best resolved by combat. The game will even add random enemies just to pad the game with ""content"". The absence of alternative content types will leave you exhausted by the repetitive combat loop. The few puzzles the game has are ruined by the use of an awful interface. These two criticisms are exemplified by one of the companion quests dungeons, where you will spend hours juggling between endless enemies and horrible UI for puzzles.

Even if you know what you're doing and do things right, you'll end up wasting your time with constant save scumming. Oh yes, the game kind of expects you to save scum, as it is very common to even fail ""easy"" dice rolls constantly.

On another note, a game that relies on the boring, continuous ritual of pre-buffing just to level the playing field is not being clever. Raising numbers with 6 different buffs just to be able to hit an enemy is a mindless chore, not strategy.

The game offers a lot of replayability through the different mythic paths and their respective content, but with a lack of new game plus options (carry over money and items at least), I wouldn’t be incentivized to play over a hundred hours of this game again.

Many people may add that mods and other resources can vastly improve this game's experience. But in my opinion, any game that relies on external resources like this already failed to do what should have been the main goal of being a fun, accessible and fully encompassing experience.

Finally, the very last ending scene sort of implies you screwed up you 100+ hour playthrough because you didn't follow the very-specific steps for the secret ending. A final slap in the face for the whole experience really.

I would only recommend this game to people who are already Pathfinder fans, DnD enthusiasts, or masochists. Or you could just breeze through the game on the easiest difficulty and enjoy the amazing characters and story. An ""Enhanced - Enhanced Edition"" for this one may be a stretch but hopefully future games in the series are better.

Extra criticisms: no minimap, no option to place map markers, quest journals don't update properly. The annoying bug where enemies run out of bounds and you have to reload entire fights because you can't kill the enemy that yeeted itself into the void (even in boss fights).",1696009205,1696009205,False,9,0,0.521182596683502197,0,True,False,False

But everytime I try, I keep getting stuck on the character creation.

I've prayed for so long that the pathfinder games, pillars of eternity, etc. would eventually bring a simplified description to their abilities, perks, race descriptions etc.

I can understand the need for 1000 lines of flavor text for a spell when it's tabletop because that's how you bring the fantasy to life.
But for a computer game, all that flavor text can be visualized with your animations.

All I ever need to know when I hover over a spell or a perk is:

Range:
Damage Range / effect:
Resource cost:
Attack Modifier / Save check: 

RPGs are already extremely deep in both lore and time investment, alienating potential lovers of this genre because you failed to make the basic game mechanics approachable is such a waste of the developers time and a huge disappointment as a player.

This has to be one of the most frustrating game I've ever played.  Clearly it was good enough to keep me engaged, but I'll be honest a huge amount of my game time is me just hate genuinely getting sucked into a loop of hate playing.  It stopped being fun, and just became about not losing to the terrible scenarios and decisions the designers made.  It just feels like I'm playing a really well-written, but very linear dnd campaign dictated by an unreasonable if not downright cruel GM who actively misunderstands how the tools of the system are meant to be employed.  

Every GM knows that you want less higher-level enemies with interesting abilities in fights, not huge swarms of frustrating low level enemies because it becomes a slog bug god damn the slogs are everywhere.  Every gm knows that allowing people to rest too much, or giving them too many consumables just allows them to go supernova on every boss, but here I am just reverting my save, stacking buffs, and dunking anything that was too challenging to defeat with tactics.  I've never met a GM so terrible at employing skill checks.  In this game, they are are boring and frustrating because they either barely have a consequence for failure, or you just downright never get to try the thing again.  

Past emulating a ttrpg, even just as a video game in general it is frustrating.  You will find yourself stuck for long periods of time because you accidentally missed that one piece of loot from that one dude's body.  If you are the type who feels guilty save scumming, be ready to get riddled with guilt because often times you simply don't get the information you need to face a situation until you've run into it and found out you just don't have the right pc with you, or didn't happen to have the one spell you need.  Losing hours of progress because you missed one thing is just common place.  Learn to enjoy it i guess.  Information is often presented in confusing ways that then comes with permanent consequences.  Basically the game is riddled with f**k you moments from the devs, so if you're like me and you can get frustrated with video games, or particularly if you play them to get a sense of control in an otherwise out-of-control life, this ain't it. 

And the puzzles, my god the puzzles.  They all tend to be like a lock, with a conceptual key that opens it, but the key is so difficult to catch onto that they had to make the puzzles themselves incredibly easy to solve.  This is compounded by them being incredibly boring.  For me it creates this loop where I run into a puzzle, I get bored of trying to solve it so I look up the trick and it turns out to be some silly little thing that I personally would never have had the patience to catch onto as part of a game i'm trying to enjoy so I look up just like the most basic hint and it blows the walls off the puzzle and now there is no more joy to be extracted.  No joy in the process of finding the key, and no joy in unlocking the door.  Just bad puzzles that feel shoehorned in.  

To conclude, this game feels like I'm playing with an inexperienced gm.  They only were able to employ the system towards combat while dropping the robust holistic nature of 1e, and then the combat itself is a bunch of repetitive slogs with poor enemy diversity.  I find it to be more frustrating than anything else, and after over a year of trying to enjoy it, I give up.  

I will say the redeeming factor to the game is that it has a really good story with very interesting characters and a good diversity of paths to take for replay value.  I can see why it is positively reviewed for that reason alone, but I just found myself mentally checking out at a certain point based on gameplay frustrations.",1695501513,1695501513,False,21,1,0.592870771884918213,0,True,False,False

I am actually changing this to recommended because once you get past some of the game's flaws, it is actually incredibly deep - perhaps just as much as BG3, albeit in different ways.  Some of those are subtle, but others are extreme.

This mostly has to do with the Mythic paths and how they evolve, and while some of them are barely reflected in the world, others massively alter playthroughs (Demon, Aeon, Swarm, and Lich being the obvious ones, but the most interesting is Legend).

Just like the rest of the original review says (and I intend to leave it as-is), the game is ironically more loyal to the Baldur's Gate CRPG formula than BG3 is.  BG3 is still an amazing game, but I think once you are able to get past or through WotR's flaws, there is an incredible amount of writing there - especially if you can get into the Pathfinder lore.

It's not flashy, but I think this harkens back closer to a time where big effects and fully rendered 3d just simply didn't exist.  It requires you to read and imagine - but if you can get there, it actually goes far harder narratively than BG3 does, which is saying something.

I feel somewhat bad that I know for a fact many won't be able to get through or over most of this game's flaws (and those of Kingmaker), but ironically this makes me want to go back and try Kingmaker again.  I know there were tons of fbugs on release - some I imagine are still around.  But still, I don't think it should outright discount or kill everything else good in the game.

---

Updated Edit:  I put another 20+ hours into it in an effort to try and find something else redeemable and honestly it just made me want to play Pillars of Eternity 2 again to play a cRPG with less tedium.  The constant out of combat buffing, crusade campaign, overland travel requiring constant interruptions via resting - the whole thing is begging for mods to remove these ""mechanics"" or at least make them less anti-fun.

Seriously if you found yourself looking back at cRPGs again after a good experience with BG3, just play Pillars.  Even Pillars 1 had more going for it than a game like this with 200 subclasses - only about 20 of which are really enjoyable or useful in this context.  Make no mistake that loads of those subclasses are fun, thematic, or useful in tabletop where they can shine - but this aint tabletop.

---

If you picked this up out of curiosity after playing BG3 like me and felt that that the D&D 5e ruleset of that game was only really backstopped by all the little trinkets and 1d4 doodads they throw at you, then oh boy you're going to love Pathfinder, as it's roughly (without exaggeration) about three to four times as complex as 5e rules.

Ironically this game is more like Baldur's Gate (the originals) than BG3, and BG3 is way closer to Divinity 3, just with a D&D skin.  Doesn't make it bad - but it does make this game closer to the original formula.

However while there's some good parts to that formula, there are some awful ones as well.  Some areas of the original BG were pure crawl.  Furthermore you essentially came to rely on a few key and universally useful buffs like haste or otherwise to make it through once you could pick them up.  BG3 has haste, but it's far toned down and comes with its own risks.

Pathfinder however and especially this game does not deal in an ability range even remotely as mundane as BG3 and the typical tabletop campaign.  This is extremely epic scale to the point you're battling arch-demons and essentially gods while effectively becoming one or attaining godlike power.  What it means is that your modifiers begin to get utterly obscene.  AC 25 in D&D might be considered high.  AC 25 in Pathfinder might as well be a sitting duck.

I've played a lot of the original BG, and more recently all through BG3, and more importantly a game far closer to this (and BG) which is Pillars of Eternity.  Pillars has its own formula though and what Pillars gets right is having a lot of short-duration, in-combat status effects (both buffs and debuffs) and very little if any hard CC.  This game all but forces you to go through the motions of applying quite literally a dozen or more pre-buffs before wading into combat and praying the dice don't go against you.  To reach that magical AC 30, 40, etc...it's all done is increments of 1, 2, and 3 mostly.  Same with attack, saves, etc.  It's all just a litany of baby steps.

That's probably the most insufferable part aside from the omegabloat of the classes and feats thrown at you.  It's definitely Pathfinder alright.  It's got all the hallmarks of why people who don't like Pathfinder as a system don't like it, ie: the extreme granular complexity of everything.

Parts of the game are good.  The soundtrack is good until it gets old (they all do, so not a slight, but it's lacking a little variety).  Some of the graphics are ok, but it's lacking detail in some of the models for sure.  But more than anything else, the system just sticks out like a sore thumb.  More than the grand story, the epic power scale, the characters, range of both evil and good choices - the system will have you pulling your hair out or slamming the difficulty slider down when a PC with a dozen buffs gets instantly dirtnapped by something that has 6 attacks a round and lands a few crits.

I mean it's definitely better than Kingmaker.  But lmao that's not saying much honestly...

After the ""desaster"" that was Baldurs Gate 3 for me, I decided to give this game another try. 

First, it killed my graphic card, there is nothing special about the graphics here. I can run very hardware hungry games at max and the card only runs about 60°C. But this game... the second I start it, the card went up to 90°C and kept going at that temperature for no reason. After a few days it vaporized the thermal paste and overburdened the fan units, so I had to replace it but it was already too late. I had to order a new graphic card: very good job on this one OwlCat by not using Unity properly.

Ok on the game. The only QoL improved from Kingmaker is, that you can now rotate the map, and that helps a lot. Storywise it is... ""challenging""... it starts realy good, but than starts to drag a lot and before long you have a ton of text to read, most stuff is not voiced. At some point, still during Act 1, I was very lost what to do and what this is all about. When you can ""dig"" yourself through this, you will be fine. When you do read through everything, even though way too much of it is unnecessary fluff, you manage to be fine and can progress. Most of the companions are somewhat boring and stupidly written, I do not like them at all, but they are all that we got. Fortunately it gets better later on.

The story itself is also quite good, it is what is to be expected. People say BG3 have a ton of content, tons of decisions, tons of consequences... obviously they have no idea what Pathfinder is, because there is much much much more. A lot of stuff is not obvious that it will have some impact, and some is straight away... like you can decide to go south and get caught in the stuff there, but actualy you are needed north and the people there die and are no longer available for you. 

The campaign mode is a bit better than Kingmaker, but not much. At least it does not bother you with stupid stuff like a revolt even though your loyality bar is at max. The armee battles are a homage to Heroes of Might and Magic, but not as thoroughly thought out.

Where the game realy falls short is its balance... because there is none. Up until the end of Act 2 everything is actualy pretty fine, some mobs are lower than your level, some equal, leaders, miniboses and boses a bit higher, there are also optional encounters that are pretty tough too. But it is all doable, the ""trashmobs"" are only there to deplete your resources so you will have a hard end-boss battle in the dungeon or even the Act. But that falls completely apart when Act 3 starts. Usualy you will be around level 8, but trashmobs are lvl 16-20, miniboses 25, boses 30... and their starts show. You have to run certain builds and buffs to have at least some fighting chance. Best part is, when you enter the first ""story relevant"" location, the mobs get down again and you fight lvl 8... now you are 12, having few hours fighting 24 and are now bored. But do not be afraid, when you leave and are on your way back to the captial to resupply, the random encounters (trashmobs) are back at 20 again. And it gets worse with each Act/Chapter of the game. Usualy trashmobs are 1.5 or 2.0 your level, bosses etc 3x. Very often you are in some sort of autopilot mode to kill stuff and than bam, out of nowhere you are killed instantly and you wonder why... you check the log, reasses the situation, reload and prepare (pure metagaming there). You will also laugh, when various trashmobs are much harder to kill than the endbosses... like some Demon Lords themselves... and when you reach endgame, everything is lvl 40 and have 50AC even on ""story"" difficulty (the lowest possible) and have 400HP.

Theoreticaly the game offers a lot of replayability... there are just too many choices and consequences and should try differently, but with the advent of Act 3 the game is just pure frustration.

The game offers a massive amount of customization over its character builds that by starting out without prior experience to the tabletop, will leave you daunted and overwhelmed. The combat is alright with the option to play in Turn-based or in ""Real time with pause"" with the former offering you time to think and strategize for efficiency and with the latter clearing out trash fights.

For the Story, the game offers a good variety of choices throughout its quest-lines with respect to character alignment and your chosen mythic path, which offers replay value in experiencing the other routes of the quest-lines. The choices you make in the earlier acts can have a wide impact on the general story and at times some choices you do in the earlier acts will come back at the later parts. The Main Story isn't a masterpiece but its decent enough to motivate you to reach its end and your play through may differ if you choose different paths offering a good amount of flavor to your run, as I have played on a Demon Mythic and in the later stages redeemed myself to become a Mortal through the Legend path.

The game offers a wide variety of companions which have their own quirks and personalities that can make your play through entertaining with some companions bantering during camp rests and at times interjecting on dialogue. Each companion has its own quest-line and the quests on my experience are good except for a certain companion that lets you solve puzzles which is tedious.

However the game isn't without its faults especially if you have no prior experience in the tabletop or in Pathfinder as the game does not introduce newcomers to its systems very well. Enemy Stats get bloated in the later acts giving you a hard time if your build isnt well thought of or optimized often causing misses on attacks and spells not penetrating resistances. Puzzles which is varying in difficulty at times easy to do but most of the puzzles I had to open up guides just to complete it especially on one particular dungeon where its all just puzzles breaking the pace of the game and at times leave you stuck from progressing.

On the Performance side, Act 4 and some parts of Act 5 I have experienced some performance issues like a drop in frame rate when fighting multiple enemies and even when just venturing out the area. There are times when I experienced quests bugging out caused by NPC's becoming uninteractable and areas not showing up on the world map and I had to use some mods to complete the quest. 

To wrap up my ramblings. I highly recommend the game if you are looking for an RPG with a wide variety of choice and depth of customization which makes every play through a unique experience with its different endings that makes you wanna come back for more.",1695116421,1695116421,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) familiar with d&d/pathfinder-style games and systems, 
2) are looking for an immersive world with abundant lore and 
3) are willing to commit A LOT of time to this game. 

Since those are the players that are most likely to find this game, I decided to rate this game positively. If you enjoyed Kingmaker, you are the perfect candidate to enjoy this game also.

If you are a player looking for an RPG with a great story, companions and easy to understand mechanics with the playtime of about 30-50 hours [i](think Dragon Age Origins, as I was)[/i], then I BEG YOU look elsewhere. I will try to explain why.

In short, I would describe this game with these words: verbose, exhausting and micromanagement. 

The game has a steam completion rate [i](based on the ending achievement)[/i] of 11.6% [i](at the time of me writing this review)[/i]. That is an incredibly low rate for a game that has been out for almost 2 years now. I suspect the reason for this to be the sheer amount of content in this game, most of which will involve travelling, combat, or listening to the life story of literally every character that speaks to you. I am not surprised that the way the game handled those elements would turn exhausting to most players.  

To satisfyingly complete this game, you will have to put in about 70-90 hours [i](non-turn based combat, story difficulty)[/i] // 150-200 hours [i](turn based combat, medium difficulty and above)[/i]. There are SO many encounters in this game [i](and some of them quite challenging, but not mechanics-wise but luck-wise, which is as bad of a decision by the devs as it was in Kingmaker)[/i], you WILL spend half of your playthrough in combat. And even if you play on story difficulty, the travelling time and crusade management pads out the time way too much. This is a game that should have been 40-60 hours long but ended up padded out to the extreme. 

It proved way too exhausting for me altogether - I resorted to skipping through most of the dialogue that didn't pertain to the companions and the main story - but I am certain that a player who is ready for a big world to dive into could find this a great, possibly the best RPG they'll ever play.

[h2]The infuriating:[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Endless, pointlessly time consuming, and sometimes needlessly overpowered enemy encounters
    [*]The size of the map forces you to spend a long time travelling it, which then forces you to rest every 10 seconds. This issue is partially remedied by conditional teleportation, which is not available until about halfway through the game and must be deliberately set up by the player
    [*]Overbearingly verbose conversations. One review I read described this thus: ""The telling of the story feels like it is orchestrated by a DM that loves listening to their own voice."" I often felt that the dialogue writers failed to make a point without creating an unnecessary wall of text
    [*]Quite a few bugs are still present in the game, which prevented some quests from being finished, some forced me to restart my PC, some disabled keyboard input [i](only in Chapter 4 weirdly)[/i], some shut the game down directly 
    [*]The whole EULA debacle with Owlcat still deserves to be mentioned, even if it's not a problem with the game itself
[/list]

[h2]The strange:[/h2]
[list]
    [*]The addition of the crusade system - not exactly sure why this game needed a Might and Magic minigame
    [*]The camera mechanic in Chapter 4 [i](personally I also don't understand why that chapter had to be so long, but oh well)[/i]
    [*]Tutorials did not feel very helpful at all. If you have no experience with these types of games, you may have a hard time getting into it
    [*]You can, within one conversation, expect some lines to be voiced and some randomly not. I first thought that it was a bug, but no, most text in the game is actually not voiced
    [*]After you bring up your map, if you try to zoom in on the map, it will not zoom in on the map, but rather adjust the size of the indicator which shows what part of the map is visible to you. An incredibly unintuitive decision
    [*]The camera is more of an enemy than a friend
[/list]

[h2]The complex:[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Everything involving combat/classes [i](unless you're playing on a lower difficulty, which will disable some achievements, so beware)[/i]
[/list]

[h2]The great:[/h2]
[list]
    [*]Companions - their backstories, VAs, witty dialogue and personal quests
    [*]The RP options are supremely well designed
    [*]An enjoyable and interesting main story with many turns and moments that genuinely surprised me and left me agape for quite a while
    [*]Allows you to realise your power fantasy in a full spectacle, be it as a force of good, evil, or anything inbetween

Having bought the game at a discount for $18 I have gotten far more than my money's worth and have only a few minor gripes so I give it a hearty thumbs up.

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a standalone Pathfinder party RPG using D&D 3.5e rules, which aren't your grandpa's D&D rules and since I'm as old as your grandpa that means to me they are over-complicated with regards to the multitudes of classes, sub-classes, feats, non-stacking bonuses, and rules for what weapons and abilities can hit enemies.  You can play entirely in turn based combat mode which is what I'm doing.  I did the introductory part of the game 4 times, initially with the default Tower Shield specialized Fighter, and also with custom Rogue, Cleric, and Fighter characters.  The Tower Shield specialist was sort of a joke because I played for quite a while and never found a tower shield.  Eventually I went with a custom no subclass fighter, which so far feels like it was a good move because it lets my main character take point and be the focus of most battles while being fairly unkillable and doing decent damage.  Also if you look at the following you'll see that you won't get another strong melee character for a while after the first character who joins you.  Characters' classes who will join your party in order of appearance (as best as I recall and playing as a Lawful Good sort): Paladin (LG), Shaman (hidden alignment), Zen Archer (LN), Scoundrel (CN), Witch (NG), Oracle (NE), Wizard (N), Cleric (NG), Hellknight (LE).  I eventually got rid of the Oracle and the Scoundrel, neither of whom I would have used much in my party in any case, although there might have been other benefits if I'd kept them, for example the Hellknight character brings the ability to recruit Hellknight mercenaries for the crusade army which is the main reason I kept him although I have yet to bring him on any party adventures.  

The game is really 2 games in one, the party role playing game and the Fifth Crusade which is played out mostly separately on the world map although the two games intersect a lot, like your army camp could be attacked requiring your characters to defend it, or your party may not be able to get to certain quest areas until your crusader army clears enemy forts out of the way.  In general I don't care for this trend of having non-dungeon delving aspects to character RPG games (think Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pillars of Eternity I) but since managing the Fifth Crusade hasn't been difficult up to this point I'm not too unhappy about it.  There is an option to let that run itself if you don't want to do it.

I have run into a few fairly minor bugs and annoyances.  I'm going to call having a Tower Shield specialist as an available default selection in a game where tower shields don't drop a bug.  Often when casting healing spells the caster moves toward the target and loses the spell but the heal doesn't go off -- it's best to move into range manually before casting.  When changing melee weapons while in combat, the character who changed weapons gets an attack of opportunity which I believe is the opposite of what should happen - enemies in melee range should probably get an opportunity attack on the character who switched weapons.  As I mentioned before I think the combat rules are vastly over-complicated; I grew up with original D&D and AD&D first edition and to me that's about as complicated as it needed to be.  I much prefer the D&D 5th edition combat system in Solasta, for example.  It's also seriously annoying to me that my spell casters are mainly only useful for buffing the party since practically everything you run into will have high magic resistance and multiple immunities.  Thank the gods for Haste; my wizard memorizes it 5 times and works on a scroll every time we camp, otherwise I'd probably not continue playing.  Although the witch's hexes are sometimes effective and she is a great healer I eventually swapped her out in favor of the second cleric who can buff the entire party with Bless and Prayer and can cast heal spells by sacrificing memorized spells.  I have the shaman in my party too because she's the best lock picker but except for Bless and Protection spells she doesn't have great party buffs either so I mostly have her memorize healing spells.  But overall, at least so far, the good outweighs the bad by a large margin.  Another thing I like is that the moral dimension of decisions you make is pretty straightforward, not the muddled ""there is no Good option"" quandaries in many games of this sort.",1694806844,1694806844,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As an Owlcat production, it keeps that hybrid innovative way of setting a role playng game. The game itself divides on a role mechanic and a tactical mechanic. 
The role phase is like most games: create a character, set off to adventures building up a party to fight against the problems of the land. 
The tactical phase is set on some chapters of the game. It allows to you recruit units, build,  and guide an army, setting you on a conquerors path around the Worldwound lands against daemons that pour from the Abyss. This phase is set on a map board, while the battles are set on a grid map (compared by many with those battle maps and mechanics from the New World Computing´s Heroes of Might and Magic franchise (more work on this part could probably help, though it is a fine add for my opinion)).

The game itself is quite long and shows much love from the developers team.
It brings 25 classes, 167 sub classes, and 13 prestige classes; bringing so many choices to the player to customize their dreamt hero. Adding to this, they set one of the most extensive list of playable races of all RPG... 12 races (even half vampires) and 21 bloodlines/backgrounds (adding abilities from such races, and even the chance to shapeshift in  such forms) that range from celestials to serpentines along with undead, elementals, fey, dragons and others. Including the DLC Last Sarkorian (already included above in the count), the developers  give special love to those that like shapeshifting; giving the chance to the player to shapeshift between many forms like: elementals, sabertooth tigers, manticores, hydras, dragons, ankous, wyverns and others. 

A second grand boost is given to the customization of the party as the game have a second profession tree labeled as Mythic path. Such path brings to the player the chance to play as a major beign in the game, giving the chance to play as 10 mythical creatures  or a legendary hero. Such creatures bring a new perspective to the game story, each adding their own abilities, visual city customization, companions, special army units and abilities; some also bring special locations (able only to them), and special interactions with  characters along the story...
Did you feel out of context some situations in role games, for example when you played as a necromancer and those lesser undead still fight you?...no more as a lich you may controll them while other professions need to fight them...
what about playing as some nature lover, but been unable to restore some death/corrupted lands, say no more as an azata you have such power (not in many places, but still worth it)...
a killer frenzy was no possible in other games?, become the swarm that walk and feed on everyone; such innovative ways to interact in the game were only possible on board and paper, well this game brings some of those into the game and allow you to feel more connected with your choices, you character and the way you want to role-play...oh and check on those finishing moves, severing the body of your enemies, looks great adds a lot.
Around 10 mythical paths to choose, angel, devil, daemon, lich, gold dragon, and others; each with their own abilities and summons. 

Many levels to customizr your own character: 20 levels of professions, single or multiclassed, 10 levels of mythical creature, 40 levels as a legendary hero. 

About gameplay:
The game itself require a lot of reading, need to prepare before ""venturing forth"", as the game itself could prove difficult if one mess with the build of the character. Luckily, you may check one the class progression to see what abilities come with each level, so you may pre-plan how you are gonna spend your levels.
The game allow you to have pregenerated characters to join your party (need to recruit them as mercenaries) or pregenerated ones, each with their own story. Regretably, while i find the story amazing and quite enjoyable, the companions are a drawback. They are average, only their conversation their chapter quest have some meaning; their conversation (via resting) is superficial at most, having no further consequences even if they fought about something. Eventhough, some of your decisions may end up in ending your relation with you companions.
Some optional choices that are linked to the alignament are not approved by all the players, i myself found some of the alignament situation failing at showing  how such an aligned character should approach the situation.
Some builds may need knowledge of the items that are in the game, as some items are to be make by players choices, as you craft some items from previous ones, but you do not know the attributes of such item until its final creation stage. On the bright side, there is a chance to rebuild you character in-game, just be sure that the initial difficulty settings allow it.
Plenty of items to choose from, plenty on interactions,  plenty of customization for your run, but you may find the game hard, at least until one understands the mechanics (and even there there are some hard encounters).

Final words...
The community is quite helpful, and the developers roam through the forum from time to time.
While the game is excelent, my thought, there are still some minor bugs.
Every time the developers release a patch, they fix some things, and break a bunch of others (EVERYTIME, no misses).
The product is among the very best of the genre, an AAA game; many options, high replayability, you may create the very character you want ()plenty of customization options, and plenty of paths). Several difficulty settings to choose from, and several youtube streamers with hints that may help you out. 
The price is adequate, and you may find it on sales with very good offers; the DLC are no needed, still perhpas i would recommend Last Sarkorian to add some options for the character creation and a new partner to join your adventurers.
Regretably, this awesome masterpiece is linked to spme very negative situations: first and foremost developers try to change the licence agreement after many copies were sold, with no option (at that moment, before they reverse their doings) but to accept; a move that made my trust in the developers and my ability to keep what i bought, dangling on a rope. In the same movement, they tried to bring a program along with a patch, that takes information from your system for marketing purposes; at that moment, the user´s opinion about  a non game resources force into their PC were not required by the developers...the situation backlashed and they had to restore the previous settings, yet the move brings up some distrust about how they behave with their community. Nontheless, this was their only ""bad"" move, as they always have a good communication with the community. 

If you like role playing games go for this game, yet, first check on the tactical mechanic as it is no evreyone cup of tea. 

Hope this help
Have fun

It's a very large and deep game and you need to be willing to sort of take that leap and let it absorb you entirely to fully enjoy it. That can seem daunting initially perhaps, but it quickly becomes very worth it.

This was my first time playing a pathfinder game and I started on Core difficulty. For me that was the right choice because I like to deep dive into systems, but for 99.5% of the players I'd strongly suggest not doing that, and instead starting off with Daring difficulty or below so you can focus more on the story and doing what feels fun or right rather than on min-maxing.

The art of this game is great, and the music is second to none. I listen to it frequently even months after my last play-through. The gameplay is mostly very fun and engaging, though there are some areas/aspects of the game that I feel should've been cut down a bit in size.

Using the word 'epic' to describe the scale and story isn't hyperbole. The mythic path idea is great and helps personalize both your narrative and mechanics.

My last playthrough was as a Trickster. They get an ability where they can Intimidate for free at the start of a combat. Later, it upgrades to any enemy that gets Intimidated has to save again or attempt a coup de grace on themselves.

As I was attempting the 'secret' ending, I had to fight the demon lord Baphomet. He spawned, rolled initiative, looked at me, and then killed himself.

Get trolled nerd.

It also helps that you can have a chaste succubus gf. Seelah isn't lawful stupid (10/10 would save a beer cart with), Regill is an absolute (evil) bro, Ember is too pure for this world, and Camilla is. Well. Camilla.

This game feels unfair at first. As a tabletop veteran, I was shocked at what encounters were being thrown at me. I was fairly frustrated going through the first few acts, surprised at what the game was throwing at me. But that difficulty is uncommon in most games these days, and what that difficulty does is force you to adapt and learn the game's systems, or continue to fail. Once I realized this, I stopped having such a bad time. I used my buffs properly. I used CC spells when they were needed, and gave my characters more options for ways to deal with problems that weren't just auto-attacking. 

This game is extremely unforgiving for newcomers. Even hardened RPG veterans are going to find the Normal difficulty of this game to be a challenge. To any new players, I recommend you use the 3rd-level spells Heroism and Haste constantly with anyone who can cast them; these will carry you long enough to figure out builds. More than that, however, you should take your time. Spend an hour or two when leveling your characters, or more if you're just starting out. Really sink your teeth into this system, because the game expects you to do that on all but the lowest difficulties. 

This is a very, very long RPG if played on turn-based instead of RtwP. However, that length allows for meaningful decisions that last hours and hours into the experience. I found the companions surprisingly enjoyable, and while not as good as Bioware's classics or New Vegas, there were a lot of very pleasant surprises in the writing. Moreover, it felt like the writing had a lot of heart, which is not something you see much anymore. 

The Heroes of Might & Magic mode I think gets unfairly criticized by a lot of players, or by players who don't understand how Heroes of Might & Magic actually worked. It's not difficult, and it's not complicated, but what's fun about it is that your choice of Mythic Path actually affects which units you get, which is a really nice touch and makes me wonder what a strategy game with narrative choices affecting unit type would actually look like, and in that regard I think it's a great success even if the mode itself does get tedious by the end. 

Due to the length, and the payoffs of several plot threads over the course of the game, Wrath of the Righteous has been one of the most satisfying RPGs I've ever played. If you enjoy overcoming challenge with a deep system, and enjoy taking your time with games, this game will likely sit as highly in your list of favorites as it now does for me. So for anyone like me who enjoys deep systems and learning them with a game that rewards understanding those systems, I have not in over 18 years of gaming seen a better RPG and I could not recommend this game more for doing so much with so little resources to work with. 

As for the BG3 comparison, well, that's a game that has a completely different design philosophy and caters to a different, less serious audience. But for me personally, I can't help but wish that games like WotR were the ones winning awards and selling in the millions instead, but I'm happy this game exists at all to cater for hardcore RPG fans who enjoy a game that pushes the player to the limit and then some while still having a great story and memorable characters.",1694413408,1694413408,True,1,0,0.516245484352111816,0,True,False,False

It has a complex, challenging ruleset, deep worldbuilding, a fantastic storyline, excellent companions, and an obscene amount of mechanical character customization. All in all, it's overwhelming - which, I think, is what CRPG fans are looking for. The voice-acting and sound design in general is incredibly good.

Unfortunately, it's also a bug-ridden mess, and the problems become worse and worse as the game progresses. Charging characters stall, UI elements stick themselves to the screen, the camera jumps up and down in combat, and for many players, significant percentages of the game are outright unplayable.

The Crusade system is horrific. If you work out how to optimize it right at the beginning, it's boring. If you don't, it'll make it impossible to progress. That's because the only viable tactic is to snowball an overwhelming force right from the start; any loss you experience will itself snowball into a brick wall. While there is an option to turn the whole system off, doing so locks you out of significant content, including one of the options in the game's flagship special system.

I do still intend to finish the game and I would still recommend it to anyone thirsty enough for CRPG content that they can overlook the glaring issues mentioned.

I say this due to clear improvement I can see that has occurred between Kingmaker and Wraith of the Righteous (WoTR).  The story still has a time pressure and stakes but has lost those hard lose situations that where evident in Kingmaker as well as having a massively improved and interesting cast of characters.
The game has a vast amount of player choice. While any options are “limited” to the classic alignment grid and so many people playing of one set alignment are simply going to pick whatever coincides with theirs, if one is truly trying to role-play a complex character it can result in some very interesting situations.
The characters that one meets within WoTR are also very interesting.  There are duds who fall flat, but for the most part even the characters whose personalities went against mine in most playthroughs still had enough motivation to keep me invested in their character and aware of their views.
The game, while deep, does run into the problem of front ended complexity very quickly.  Path of Exile comes to mind with its labyrinthine skill trees and while skill-wise WoTR is simpler it is even more front ended with its character creation.  “What race?”, “What class?”, “Should I pick a subclass or not?”, “Does my deity matter?” and more which can lead to many players dropping the game before even getting involved.  Even after character creation when levelling or equipment selection this problem continues to show itself.  I was in many ways lucky that I stuck it out, but many would not be wrong for simply leaving after that feeling of being overwhelmed took them over.  To the games credit it does try and solve this problem by allowing for auto-levelling and pre-generated characters, but I cannot help but feel this does not help explain to the potential players how to actually work with the system, instead hoping through practical usage that the player will learn how to play.
An interesting addition to the game is its downloadable content (DLC) which, while it does add more content, does not really added to the overall game as a whole.  In some ways one could consider this a good thing, “Just buy the base game and you’re set!”, but then my question would be why did they bother to release the DLC in the first place?  I think the problem with a lot of the DLC is it mainly distracts from the overarching story and so unless you really like learning more about the lore, I cannot really recommend whaling on this one.
With the paragraph lengths above as a guide it may appear that I am down on the game, and while it does have its floors, the fact that I could play the game for as long as I did and still come out feeling largely positive about the world, mechanics and characters indicates to me that the game itself does indeed deserve the attention of those that liked the TTRPG version or even TTRPGs in general seeing as it does play very much like one except in when you hit on party member in the game there is less likelihood of you being booted from the table.
Pros:
•	Characters and deep and likeable.
•	The story is interesting and diverse.
•	The mechanics can allow for a lot of skill testing and satisfaction.
Cons:
•	The DLC is rather redundant.
•	The game struggles to explain itself properly.

What I mean is they are polarizing for the right reasons. With both games, they had an idea and ambition, and set out to achieve it. They went all in on realizing their vision without compromise. The result is a game that's not for everyone. A game where the criticism of it is very frequently justified and on target. Yes, not all paths are treated equal. Yes, the combat can be brutally difficult and unfun. Yes, the abyss is agonizing to navigate through. Yes, the final act is something of a let down. Yes, the puzzles are about as enjoyable as watching paint dry. 

The difference is all of these flaws are the result of passion and talent being directed at other aspects of the game, instead of executive meddling or a lack of funding or anything like that. The peaks and the valleys are intertwined, the result of the fledgling studio (are they still fledgling?) biting off more than they can chew at times. And the result is both a game with parts that are some of the most miserable slogs I've ever waded through, and a game with parts that I will remember fondly and vividly for the rest of my life. Put simply, they have soul.

I'll preface by saying I really enjoy this game.

BUT

It stresses me out a lot. Most of the mythic paths feel like a job rather than a goal or a fun bit of flavor. Additionally, the abundance of mythic paths kind of give you a inaccurate impression of how much roleplay freedom you have, which is to say you often have the choices of good, bad, I don't care, and ""I'm bored. I'm gonna kill you!"" (this one and bad often end up being combined). Additionally, for an RPG, it sure does lock you out of almost literally everything unless you follow a guide. I know its folly to try to look up guides without being spoiled on countless things you didn't even know about, but there was no other way to play the game in any fulfilling way, and every single guide in existence talking about the ""!!SECRET ENDING!!"" gets pretty old, not gonna lie, especially with the fact that so many, let's be honest, stupidly pointless and meaningless decisions are vital to reaching it.

And good luck trying to do anything at all on purpose. I've played three different playthroughs now attempting to romance one character and have failed all times because of such random things such as: a secret statue you have to jerk off to, a song you have to sing at a very specific point in time (the option to do so requiring several previous actions to have been done as well), letting someone out of jail instead of letting them out of jail and also calling them hot, and who knows what else, since not only is the secret ending that everyone advertises on every given piece of material they have ever written about the game such a driving point, but apparently you have to follow a guide down to the letter to be able to fuck who you want to fuck. I seriously have to rest in specific places that have no logical reason for resting in in order to progress romances with people? What even is this? Frankly I'm getting tired of restarting in order to directly and purposefully complete any of the goals I set. Everything I accomplish is purely by accident. I could play this game ten times all the way through and still fumble my way through it blindly. While that might sound nice since you discover new things every playthrough, it's very much offset by the fact that you [i]can't do anything you want to do[/i] without reading multi-page instruction manual. I'm honestly concerned about what bull the game is going to throw at me later that makes all my choices either meaningless or makes meaningless choices decide the fate of the whole world or something.

Frankly, I'm going to have to take a break from this game for a little while. I'm tired of playing through three acts before realizing I've locked myself out of something eight hours ago by waving at someone instead of fist bumping them or having mac & cheese instead of spaghetti.

Unforunately, the game can be all over the place with its balance and features, e.g. the crusade management feature provides nice flavour: you can get demon units, angel units, etc. It is however basically useless since the best option is to create a ball of death and roll with it.

Baldur's Gate 3 is coming out next month. It's already playable in part for those of us who pre-purchased it and it's gorgeous. Why is that relevant? Well, after the disappointing ""Pathfinder: Kingmaker,"" I was LOVING ""Wrath of the Righteous"", even recommending it to my wife. Figured I'd wait till I'd clocked it before I recommended it here. Then I woke up this morning to discover that Owlcat had implemented a non-optional 26 GB ""update"" to add 3rd-party data-tracking software & change the EULA -- and when people were livid, Owlcat sniffed ""Well, it's standard practice for MOBILE games!"" Screw that. This isn't a mobile game. If you want to change your product THAT drastically after people had already purchased it, you should probably just refund us the money and start from scratch with your new ""mobile game"" audience. Supposedly they'll add another update tomorrow to remove the spyware, but only because A) their customers revolted (hard to sell seasonal passes & DLCs and upcoming games to people who think you're scum) and B) it turns out their spyware would have been illegal under EU law. They as much as admit in their statement on the matter that they'd add the spyware back in as soon as possible. Good to know so I don't waste my time or money on their upcoming ""Rogue Trader"" game, i suppose... If you already own WOTR, don't let it update! I'm determined to get my money's worth since they won't refund the purchase, but I refuse to become their product.

UPDATE: That roll-back update? The one they promised would remove the data-tracking & return the original EULA? Because they were SO sad they'd upset their customers? So far, neither hide nor hair of it -- and other players are reporting a similar absence. Meanwhile Owlcat posted claiming it was out on the 25th. Just a further indication of the kind of company Owlcat has chosen to become!

UPDATE 2: Having played through further without updating, looks like Owlcat also just kind of gave up on the game after Act 4. Starting Act 5 means suddenly seeing a lot of the ""choices"" in the game not matter or be glitched to irrelevancy. E.G.: When I began Act 4 I had placed several characters in jail for their crimes -- it was full. But when I began Act 5, almost none of them were in jail anymore -- i assumed that they had escaped, but nope. I ran into them in their usual haunts and they (and their character descriptions) spoke to me as if they'd never been arrested or imprisoned. It really feels like Owlcat just gave up after a point and trusted that people would have invested too much time to care.",1690228355,1693859750,False,11,0,0.525910079479217529,1,True,False,False

Pros:
- Variety. There are 25 base classes, and if you count the archetypes and prestige classes too, this number goes over 200, and when you add mythic paths into equation... Replayability of this game is staggering.
- A compelling story with some choices, mostly dependent on your mythic path.
- A crusade mechanic for fans of HoMM series, fun and rewarding, although simplistic in nature (just outnumber everything and hit first)
- Flexible difficulty levels that can fit players of any experience.
- QoL features (I'm looking at you, Baldur's Gate 3), skill trees, shared backpacks, all that stuff

Cons:
- Very beginner unfriendly due to complexity of the system and it starts at the character creation, it's daunting at first and you can spend an hour or two just creating your first character.
- Very demon-centric adventure: 85% of your enemies are chaotic evil, and 85% of those are demons, so it heavily favors some classes (like paladins and ranger demonslayers) while making others completely useless (like assassins), same for spells

Overall, a great game, a must-play for fans of the genre, 8.5/10

P.S. I find it funny, when people write a negative review saying ""Oh, I tried this game on unfair difficulty and it is unfair, 0/10"", like, duh, who do you think easy difficulty is for?",1693735176,1693735176,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I open up with that because I quit the game in Act 3, three separate times. And if I left it there I would've missed out on an incredible story with pretty much unrivalled freedom to shape it with your choices. So if you're here for that, for the characters and story, it's there and you'll be hard pressed to find better, so if some mechanic is preventing you from enjoying that just get rid of it.

Now, don't get me wrong. The combat in this game is good, but it demands a lot from you. That you prepare for each encounter, that you have a good understanding of what each of the stats mean, that you keep applying buffs and using items. And that would be fine, if it weren't so common. The game seems to be designed with realtime with pause in mind, not turn based. If you play the latter you will spend dozens of hours more on the same encounters and some places may begin to feel like WoW dungeons, with hordes of trash mobs you can't avoid or talk your way out of. That said, if you enjoy realtime combat, you may have a completely different experience.

On the crusade management side things can get pretty interesting with the council decisions you make, your companions acting as advisors. The army battles and construction... I kind of wish they weren't there. Most of the aforementioned council decisions relate to those systems (ie. you get new units, they get buffs, you get access to buildings etc.). Which is impressive to see but I'd much rather have story implications for say, recruiting outlaws and deranged people than actually seeing a unit called ""outlaws"" on a HOMM-like battle.

All criticisms aside, I can't recommend this game enough. If you have any interest in RPGs you will find something worthwhile here.",1693721462,1693721462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You simply can’t get a better bang for your buck. I’m on Act 3 and I’m loving it. 

—Your choices actually MATTER and your companions WILL have things to say about the things you’ve done (or didn’t do). You can be their best friend (and in some cases more), or you can be their commander, and yes, there IS a difference between the two options. Or you could just be an absolute, unabashed, flagrant asshole to everyone; that’s an option. Not a very *good* or *fun* option, but it *is* an option. But why would you do that? 

—Thanks to the maddening, archaic, mysterious, near-obtuse nature of the 1st edition Pathfinder RPG system (seriously, you need to sacrifice an entire orphan in order even understand the combat system when playing on the tabletop), you can customize your character builds and are actually encouraged to experiment without remorse nor serious impediment throughout the game (unlike in games in the Soulsbourne genre where choice is an illusion, experimentation with your build is actively punished, and fun is not allowed…which, come to think of it, is every game in the Soulsbourne genre). And not just your main character, either; you can experiment with tweaking your companions’ builds, too! It’s like they took all the criticisms they got from Kingmaker and actually listened! Finally, I can unlock even more synergistic aspects of my party, allowing me to bust out truly cracked and twisted combinations (like say, having one companion create a giant pit underneath a group enemies and then get another to chuck the Mother of All Fireballs at said pit, or have one character paralyze a boss monster *with the power of comedy* while another is busy getting group heals off)! 

—There are puzzles you actually have to look up guides for! Combat encounters that require extensive planning but can also be improvised! Gear that isn’t as integral to making good builds but pulls its weight! Various NPCs to sell things to and buy things from! Turn-based army vs army battles that harken back to the Heroes of Might and Magic series! *A LONELY OLD ELF MAN WHO IS IN NEED OF RANDOM THINGS SO HE CAN LOREDUMP ON YOU (and is possibly also in dire need of hugs, a blanket, and a nap)!* Dear GOD, I haven’t even scratched the surface of this game! The mad folks of Owlcat have struck PAYDIRT with this! It’s certainly got me excited for their Rogue Trader project! 

—And the soundtrack SLAPS. Give whoever made the soundtrack a HUGE raise, please! I love it! 

If you’re stuck between having to choose between buying BG3 and buying this game? Make it this game, especially if it’s on sale (I got my copy at around a 60 - 70% discount, plus the DLC and the deluxe edition at around that same discount). Hell, splurge for that deluxe upgrade and the season passes; it’s very much worth and only ~$30 USD more (unless you’re getting all that at a discount, which means you’re getting a better deal)! 

If, when I finally do get to buy it (hopefully on a deep sale; gimme that 80-90% discount!), BG3 can match THIS? I’ll be impressed. Until then, Golarion, the Crusade, and the Worldwound await! DEUS LO VULT BABY! CUE THE LAST STAND BY SABATON!",1693663208,1693663208,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Things about Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous better than BG3:
	- I like the banter between the characters in camp in PF:WotR a bit better than in BG3.
	- The role playing and customization is better in PF2. 
	- You can speed-up combat by pressing space.
	- If an enemy is just outside of your movement range, you can still move towards enemies by clicking on them, instead of clicking on a space in front of them like in BG3.
	- The feats are mostly all good and meaningful, unlike BG3 which has a lot of junk feats.
	- You can actually PAUSE THE GAME! WOW!
	- You can have more than 4 people in your group.
	- Difficulty settings are much more in-depth in PF:WotR than in BG3.

Things that BG3 has that are better than PF:WotR
	- BG3 has better graphics; particularly character graphics. PF:WotR characters look like plastic figurines. This is a minor complaint that may in fact come down to personal preference.

It's mostly people who played D&D 3.5 of 5e and are screaming that something has some actual rulesets instead of loosely tied together concepts of how rules should be constructed so that they actually make sense.

The game is incredibly deep in lore, personalities of the characters are distinct and change as you make decisions with and for them. Owlcat does a pretty good job of making reactions realistic, from the low born paladin trying to do what she sees is right and standing by you even through some of the most heinous stuff because it is for the greater good (or leaves, which is its own fun little drama), to the ultra pragmatic Hellknight who will stop at nothing in order to ensure this problem is solved, to the guys who are just getting sucked up into it and trying to make the best of it all.

It's incredible that people actively scream at AAA companies for having flat, uni-dimensional characters with no progress, growth or change, with uninteresting and predictable stories. When OC gives them a game that has good things, the opposite of what they are complaining about, they scream about how much it isn't ""true to source"" and ""math doesn't work"". Despite having a combat log that will literally break down every feat and aspect that influences the math to see that no, it is all correct.

Listen to the people who actually talk about the game, the characters, the development, the story and the play. The idiots who are screaming about inherently optimized characters don't seem to understand the concept that flaws exist, not everybody is min-maxed in real life or in fantasy to do what they want with perfect precision, and it is the flaws, the weaknesses and strengths that help MAKE this game so good.

Edit @400 hrs on first character playthrough: Got dan that was a fantastic f*cking game. I personally didn't mind that the end of it was somewhat 'abrupt', for me it was a trope that was actually done unusually well.

- Some areas of the game are locked behind companions. If you don't have them on your party, you can not access some places, making you miss out on content, experience and loot.
- Corruption mechanic (time waster).
- AC not stacking via items (purely arbitrary, as you can do it by multiclassing).
- Too many restrictions on items (you can use a rapier but not a estoc or a scimitar on the same character... sorcerers/wizards barely get any clothing, i've spent 3 acts of the game with the default garb).
- Annoying game mechanics (armor check penalty, max dexterity, arcane spell failure... all of this in a game with so much rng already).
- Encumbered nonsense and even worse, each character has a personal weight capacity on top of the party's one. That affects their ability scores negatively.
- Extraordinarily unbalanced and unpolished game, where any of your characters can get one shotted in the tutorial dungeon on normal difficulty, even the tank.
- Diseases that last indefinitely, which the only way to cure is to use an ability that requires a consumable item. And the character needs to have a high ""Lore Religion"" score, which can still fail of course, as everything in this game is ruled by asinine rng.
- Buffs that require consumable items... 
- So many god dam buffs, holy hell this is so daunting to keep track of (even with bubble buffs).
- The crusader mode (a mini game that you didn't want, shoehorned into the game you paid for).
- Putting the CM in ""automatic mode"" makes you miss out on content and good items.
- The game as whole isn't very visually appealing or impressive, i paid 60 bucks for this and it looks alright. The color pallet is really limited and the enviroments are quite boring and repetitive (act 4 is the exception but it has it's own issues).
- Poorly optimized considering how constrained the locations and regions are, saving the game makes it stutter,
- You need mods to increase your characters movements speed out of combat... it's not that hard POE 2 did it, just copy that for fuck sake.
- You can't bind going into stealth to any key, let me repeat that, you can not bind getting your characters into stealth to any key. It's simply not possible, as there is no option in the settings to do so... 60 bucks on sale, kill me.
- You can't toggle your cape visually off... seriously was this game even tested by anyone ?
- Casters having to waste 2 feats (when you only get them every two levels) to be able to land any ray spells is baffling stupid.

This game only becomes somewhat enjoyable after being highly modded. I don't recommend it unless you have money to burn, otherwise buy Pillars of Eternity 2 Deadfire instead. It's a vastly better experience and game overall.",1674605179,1693074007,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After many, many months of patches and improvements since launch Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous now stands tall as one of the best crpgs I have ever played. Owlcat's portrayal 
 of Mendev and the Worldwound makes for such a huge and content-dense setting that it's easy to lose yourself in it for dozens of hours at a time.

Story-wise the game is linear, but it is solidly written and with more significant role-playing choices than most other games in the genre. There were enough little details and nuances that I kept coming back, which is always nice.

The companions are overall fantastic. The character writing and VA are excellently done and the companion quests and camp interactions are wonderful. I would honestly say that these are the best and most interesting party members for any modern game I've played in this genre.

Character building is byzantine, but highly rewarding. Even dozens of hours in I could still find
all sorts of new tricks and optimizations to make my party even better at slaying demons than ever before.

Pathfinder: WotR is absolutely worth your time and I will absolutely sink dozens of additional hours into it after this.

Original (2021) Review:

The game is fun and well written, but it has a totally unacceptable number of bugs and SO MUCH unfinished content: blank tooltips, broken item descriptions, items missing proper icons, items having totally wrong icons, and the crusade mode being a total mess.

By no means do I have a complete bug list, but my god, just following the Azata mythic path runs you into something like half a dozen different unique opportunities to softlock yourself. Crusade has abilities that flat out fail to work and units with blank/placeholder stats that are useless in combat. The escape and space keys randomly stop working. Some areas that require certain companions to enter will still block you from entering even if you meet all the requirements.

Cherry on top? The best (arguably) ending requires you to follow an utterly ludicrous and arbitrary set of steps to even be available. Some important choices are signposted, MANY others are not. You can literally lock yourself out of the ending with a completely random choice in the prologue before you even know anything about the plot.

Needs serious work, will revisit my review in another 6 months if things improve.",1632072937,1692895889,True,0,0,0.50724637508392334,0,True,False,False

I love the story, character acting, and general game play (I like cRPGs). While everything starts out OK, by the time you reach Act 3 the bugs really start piling up. It's simply just not ready for release. There are loads of unfinished UI elements, pets randomly go away, quests can't be finished, etc. But the thing that finally made me quite is the crap crusade mode that they added this time around. It tries to be similar to Might and Magic, but it's buggy and completely unbalanced. 

It seems like they spent most of their time on the polish for Act 1 and 2, which play though very nicely. It takes a 180 degree turn after that.

My advice is to just way 6-12 months for them to figure it out. They are slow development team, but eventually they'll clean it up like they did with the first one.

EDIT: 12 months wasn't enough. I recently tried to complete the game with one of the DLCs.

Proof : 

- This game has real time gameplay that have to be paused in order to play it strategically (exactly like original BG and instead of turn based in BG3 that derives from divinity).
- Instanced Map like original BG (instead of a somewhat open world).
- Improved Formation groups that can be tottally customized... 
- And that are up to 6 companions (like in the original BG and instead of only 4 in BG3).
- Old alignment system!
- Camping on the field (instead of camping at a random camp outside the map for some lore exposition reasons which kinda still works too, anwyway, with PWotR).
- Still has acts (but BG3 too, to be fair)!

Yeah, it has a feeling of something inbetween Mordheim and Heroes of Might and Magic in certain aspects. But i really think it is the true heir of the original Baldur's Gate era!

This game has challenging gameplay like no other game. It is the darksouls under CRPGs. Expect glorious epic battles against hordes of demonic creatures. You have thinks of ways to defeat undefeatable monsters. The game has a good story and well thought companion storylines, a necessity for a CRPG.

The Bad

- Crusade: the game has a build-in Heroes of Might & Magic sidegame, but a very bad and annoying version.
- You can very easily miss out on important items, storylines, companions by seemingly very random choices or minor details. You will be punished for making bad choices, but you can only know way afterwards whether the choice was bad or not.
- Towards last 2-3 acts the story almost becomes non-existent. Instead the developers decided just to throw you the same battles and monsters over and over again. Less is more sometimes.
- Ending is a bit disappointing. Including the last few boss battles.
- Crusade again.

Art: very good character art, interesting scenery
Story:  very good, frequent updates, quest menu, maps
Voice Acting: plenty and good
Music: meh, mostly dour mood symphony but changes often (like DOS2)
Gameplay: adjustable between DOS and BG, but see below

Reaction:  First dungeon takes way too long to get out of but was Fun.  The paddle controls are at first complicated but ok after (mouse/key is faster)  Too many options (overwhelming but actually optional, good).  Get past that and it's every bit as good as BGII or DOS1.5 yet not exactly same as either.  Pathfinder has neither the great symphony of BGI nor improved 3D prowess of DOS2; it's not a perfect 10 but may be a Must Have, idk after only getting out of first dungeon.

I had fears (from bad reviews) early on they'd have messed up major elements like flow of battle or linearity.  I feel all the bad reviews are totally incorrect or even spam.  Game was not advertised as better than BG/DOS and it meets it's mark very well.

MY #1 TIP:  use lower screen resolution REALLY - the Unity game engine is slugging and this will add many wasted hours over time.  The game is allot more fun if the interface is highly responsive (even the item window is slow if the 3D action is slow).  Unlike BG, PF has allot of small (interface issues) multiplied by allot of options that waste time: you'll need the speed to make the game nice to play.

Let me compare to DOS.  Pathfinder's interface isn't as quick to use but similar.  (DOS1 had better gameplay, DOS2 better graphics).  The strategy of battle however is more like BG (and PF does it very well!)

Let me compare to Baldur's Gate.  BG has excellent Canadian real symphony (not computer midi generated junk).  BG had great color choices for mood and setting.  Together with storytelling: BG had excellent atmosphere.  BG ran ""very responsively and smoothly"".  BG was very non-linear - BUT BORING and frustrating at times it was not perfect.  FOR PF - the story is great/better, music less good ... but there's only one ""Town/City"" and it's all damaged not really a city.  No multiple towns to visit per say.  However!  While all of PF is mostly""broken damaged places"" they are not un-pretty - there is a flare in most areas that is eye catching - a flair that microsoft ""dark graphic"" rpg don't have - more like DOS1.5 i say.

I'm still on first chapter.  Very good game.  For anyone who loves Baldur's Gate or Divinity Original Sin I will say if you can get this game on discount it's a MUST HAVE.  (discount because it's unity engine and has small but many interface inconveniences that add gamplay time - but which you learn to lessen and get around by playing)

But it's hot garbage.

I'm a longstanding TTRPG player, and GM. I've run games, I've played in games. I'm *extremely* experienced in playing Pathfinder 1e, so I know know the system inside and out. I literally used to build Pathfinder 1e monsters from the ground up as a hobby, have built my own campaign setting from the ground up *twice*, and have put together the equivalent of perhaps 3 full adventure paths worth of raw game material in my career as a GM. 

From that point of view: some of the boneheaded decisions made by Owlcat in this game hurt my soul.

The pathfinding is terrible (unless you pause the game and super carefully micromanage what the character does, move by move, they will ALWAYS pathfind into the trap, for example, even after it's revealed. This is something the original Neverwinter Nights, over a decade ago, had solved), the method of controlling your characters is unintuitive as all hell (I cannot tell you how many times I've tried to use a consumable but ended up using it incorrectly, wasting it), and the dungeon design in the beginning is literally some of the worst examples of what *NOT* to do if you want to be a successful GM - both in terms of challenge, and of making the encounters interesting.

This is like playing an extremely boring version of Neverwinter Nights that's trying to be Xcom, and was programmed by a bunch of amateurs, and released in beta as a full game. I've made it as far as the scene where the dwarf and the faceless demon lady were bantering back and forth, and that was when I decided to plow through with a build specifically designed to just burst down everything I came across (for those who don't know - burst damage builds in low level Pathfinder 1e are unfair in terms of how good they are, and will typically chew through any encounter that doesn't involve your GM throwing non-standard tactics at you), and just decided that the story was flat out boring and quit.

Like, I'm familiar with the actual AP Wrath of the Righteous to an extent - mostly the Iomedae controversy later on in the AP - and it's not one I would normally run or want to participate in because it's kind of lame, so this doesn't really surprise me, but I am disappointed.

If Owlcat make another one of these, they should do Carrion Crown, Iron Gods, or Tyrant's Grasp. It would be *much* better. Wrath was just a bad choice overall.",1692529514,1692529514,False,6,0,0.428850412368774414,0,True,False,False

Died against some ""Damage Reduction"" monsters in the newb tutorial dungeon, because all you ever do apparently in this game is miss everything you try to do, unless you spent several hours planning out specific builds to be able to spend 30 minutes buffing yourself before the fight.

This was on ""Normal"" difficulty. There are 4 other difficulties hard than this one.

I built a sorcerer and I ran out of spells before I ever landed a single one of them.

So then I was left with Cantrips, which miss 9/10 times and if they land and do a critical hit, you're looking at a whopping 2 damage.

Meanwhile newb npc's are shooting you, twice in one single turn, for 9+ damage each shot.

You gotta attend the ""College of Pathfinder"" to build ""the"" specific build with only skills that is required to play this game, because everything is proprietary for this game as well. Otherwise you have no clue what is actually useful in this game or not. Half the stuff is just an empty box that you wasted by picking. 

If you don't attend the college and study to know what is useful, or just randomly pick things over and over starting new games and going through the tutorial over and over and over and over again and keeping a spreadsheet of all the things that work and don't work, you will just lose. Quickly.

As others have pointed out, retracting this simply means they realised that their decision would cost them more than their spyware would bring in in marketing revenue. Unfortunate to see such a promising developer lose their way so fast. Thankfully Larian looks poised to fill the gap in quality, player first CRPGs.

The only gripe I have it is that the some skills dont feel impactful. In fact, most of them are. It's a small thing but can ruin the immersion sometimes when you have dos2 which had a very satisfying animations.

--------
I forced myself to complete the game despite what was said before. So I have a lot more to add to my review:
Before the final strike, you will get the task level up all stats of the crusade (leadership, logistics, diplomacy, military). Even if you have all the buildings, your level of logistics does not upgrade anymore. All other stats you can upgrade (even on maximum level), but not logistics. Can you finish the quest? No. Brilliant. 
Also, you can have a quest (find Captain Sielkind) without a location to finish it. Why do you have it? Who knows.
Quest with Nenio inside ""The Enigma"" - 1.5 hours of doing what the dude from the video guide on youtube says. Joy. Pure joy.
If you want to change your ability scores, skills, or build in general, you can retrain your character. At least, thank you for that. I tried to retrain my character, so I had to choose all options again (all million of them) as you do for the new character! Even the name field is blank (the game says that your character means nothing). XD
At the end of the game, I had the last dialogue with a failed skill check. My wizard didn't have the required skill (specific one skill for ALL FOUR options! from that dialogue). I laughed and applauded. Fail. It was the perfect ironic ending for all of this.
""Pathfinder"" - is a result of hard work, but choosing options in dialogues that say nothing about consequences, doing quests you cannot complete, and looking for spoilers on the internet is not fun.

Disgusting creatures, kanerah and sister would have been good too but i opted for nyrissa, but it didnt work out. I aint about that cuck trash

*SPOILER WARNING*

So in this game things are even worse. The romance options are awful man there isnt even a cool tree lady nope, this time only options are total capital S-luts. First you have succubus woman, she literally has sex with men till they die NO THANKS, i aint about that cuck life. Why anyone would pick her is beyond me. even the good ending ends up with her moving to the countryside. Why? Because shes shy. So instead of moving in with her ""beloved"" she moves into the woods to get gangbanged by a bunch of farmers lmao what kind of mental patient would romance that??? 100% gay

Next option is a spider cat creature. sheesh thats disgusting. And her voice is disgusting too (very talented tho). Lmao so she must have great personality then? NOPE. She is a traitor and is willing to betray you at a moments notice if it benefits her. Not to mention she opens her legs to literally anyone lmao (ofc nobody except for other disgusting people like Lann would be willing to tap that. Even in relationship with you she tries to cuck you hahaha. What a ho. Romance this creature no thanks. 

Lastly you have queen something who is cool lady. But shes not companion so you barely spend time with her. What a shame. Not to mention the only reason she is romancable is because everyone during the kickstarter said they wanted her to be romancable so if the devs had their way the romance options would be even more cucked

Other than the TRASH romance options the story is good again

The combat is also TRASH I just put it on story difficulty to get through it fast dont even care. 

So in closing, romance options are utter trash, combat is trash, AND it has bugs so sad that dragon age romance wont be ever matched, and bioware is dead so the entire romancing as a concept in rpgs is basically dead because the only devs that have romance in their rpg are the cuck fans. Yuck. 

What a shame

Ember should have been an option just saying...

But on a more serious note the game is an improvement on kingmaker in most ways. They made the campaign portion better, by removing the moronic stats and repeating events and replaced them with few events that actually do something(buffs, nerfs etc) Although this had the secondary effect of making your choices not based on your own morals or how the situation should actually be handled but based on the buffs you are getting because some options are objectively worse than others.

They removed the timer of bald hilltop attacks so you can spend as long as you want dicking around in the campaign map without worrying about how long you are taking (excluding a few quests yep check google for this info. Like if you are going to have a timed quest then have the decency of giving the time left at least sheesh)

They added a whole new autochess thing to the campaign management which is very clunky truth be told, but it makes the kingdom management a lot more interesting and fun to build these massive armies with stacks and stacks of troops)

The story itself is a lot more engaging, and the varying mythic paths make the game much more unique for every playthrough (even though some are clearly better than others, angel, demon, aeon the best everything else is sub tier). 

Ofc there are problems as well, some retained from kingmaker some being totally new. 

once again getting the secret ending is a pain in the ass and you have to follow a damn guide, which will require you picking up seemingly unimportant items that end up being the most important thing in the entire world, like what? What a pain in the ass. This time it isnt just dialogue they added totally new levels of annoying with the gems! Yeyyyyyy fun times, NOT
Got to love researching a god damn reddit thread as im playing through shame on the devs

one problem they retained from kingmaker too is the odd pacing. The games progression is tied to the progress you make in the campaign map but there are key locations you need to explore in order for the game to progress with a certain event popping off. But which location? Basically you are playing minesweeper and all the while you are trying to go through every location you DONT think will be a key event in the main story, because many quests are timed and if you go too far in the main story then those will insta fail. HOW FUN. Thankfully they atleast have fewer trash locations to explore in this one. In kingmaker i just straight up ignored most locations if they didnt have quest markers. That wasnt really a problem this time.

Go through locations too fast without hitting the key event well that means you have to sit around doing nothing for quite a while when you finally do find the location. Find the location too early? Well now you are in a hurry to get everything done before its too late. I dont get why you have timed events without saying how long there is or what its even tied to. You cant even tell which quest is the main questline lmao. Its a mess.

For example wenduag has a bunch of events in act 4 that get activated when you camp while in the wilderness. Not the campaign map but on location inside the tents. Now personally I pretty much never camped while on location so her act 4 questline didnt begin until I was already in the midnight fane which meant I couldnt complete her questline. Now this isnt said anywhere you have to figure it out on your own, and if you dont notice then tough luck you missed out on 3hrs of content because you didnt use a game mechanic that isnt necessary. Cool

Another great addition: The enigma. What kind of lobotomite enjoys doing puzzles in rpgs? Like seriously. When i think about rpgs I think turning tiles over until a cutscene plays. So fun. Screw story and dialogue bro no no i like clicking on tiles until they turn different color for hours in a row hahahaha so much fun.

And then you have the abyss. What a mess that place is. Walking around in a jumbled mess of loading screens using a map that looks like the map from minecraft. What a pain in the ass. Who thought this was a good idea? You learned nothing from the final mansion level in the last game? Like seriously?? Unbelievable. Well actually they must have learned something because this is around twice as bad or more. But atleast there are quests to do instead and no mirror dimensions thank Abadar


But if you can get over the shit romance options as per usual(you cant have sex with the fox I mean heyyyy I aint no furry but shes probably the only virgin in the entire game the options are slim wth devs why only the trash options every time its ridiculous first you ignore amiri now no ember or nenio curse you), the stressful pacing, the abyss section, and the secret ending being difficult to achieve even with a guide not because its ""hard"" but because there are so many stupid requirements it makes you brain bleed then yes its a good game. It has great writing too, I laughed out loud. Personal favorite would have to be experiment with nenio on friendship. The companion quests make up most of the best content the game has for offer to be honest so definitely do them. (Except camellia, shes a biatch => gut her in the basement no questions asked)

This game is full of bullshit moments where the dificulty spikes kill you dead. Or worse. 

This is a game designed by childish sadists who take joy from players being caught in their gotchya traps.

Mephestopheles in the commander's area is my final straw. Having finally (after many many many retries) gotten past the interminable and crazily bad Act 4 -- a visual nightmare (not because of gore but because none of it made sense) which was a poor man's attempt to replicate Planescape: Torment -- you are putting back together the pieces of the ruined crusade mode left by an incompetent 100+ year old Queen who is now missing and probably in need of rescue and BAM!! Your Azata friend was actually not a CG angelic being but Mephestopheles, lord of Hell.

In sum: After over 700 hours (some of which were fine, and some few were fun) I have come to the conclusion that OwlCat is comprised of frustrated vengeful Dungeon Masters who have been burned by bad past experiences with munchkin level power gamer players. Oh and some UI/UX neophytes (the actual proper use of this word btw, not 10th level clerics of Baphomet.) I mean there is absolutely no reason to reinvent how UI/UX works for games at this point. 

Some good points just for balance: The pf class system despite its complexity is built on decades of streamlining D&D rules and is pretty sensible when you dig into it (apart from the many and myriad bugs and missed oportunities). The Azata dragon is cool af. Crusade mode combat has good bones, just needs a lot better UI/UX and maybe some more tactical elements to flesh it out. And a good tutorial for those not well acquainted with chess or HoMM series combat. (Hint: Ranged weapons rule and healing stacks means you don't lose to attrition if you are careful.) The Treasures dlc is *not* a roguelike but it has some roguelike aspects and is a good example of a rogue adjacent D&D knock off.",1691864106,1691865494,False,2,2,0.484886646270751953,0,True,False,False

The Pathfinder rule system is very complex and can be daunting, especially when it comes to character builds, it is not just level up and pick the new skills that sound cool; there needs to be some planning there, which is likely not for everyone.
Story seems to be very well done; a bit strange that most of the characters seem to be women in this game, the dudes seem to mostly have remained at home, breaks the immersion a bit, but ok why not; and hey there is Lann.
A much improved game compared with Pathfinder: Kingmaker, especially the Crusade management that is now bearable.
There are a lot of ""Difficulty"" options, and in my view the developers have made things a bit confusing for ppl landing from Pen and Paper or other D&D-like games by labeling one of the options ""Core Rules"", which misleadingly does not only mean ""Use the Core Rules of the Pathfinder system"", but also ""add extra enemies and difficulty to the game"". In my view these could have been separate sliders; I definitely want the closest possible to the ruleset, but maybe a ""normal"" difficulty for the first run.

There has been clearly a huge effort put into this game, and the stories around the Mythic paths are great. However, the main story loses steam when reaching Alushinyrra, where mechanically things slow down to a crawl when trying to navigate the town of framerate disruption.

It's a good game overall but it sure has it's rough edges.
I spent some 600 odd hours at it, so you will get your moneys worth out of it, but know what you are getting yourself into.

Let me start though by saying the world map minigame is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be.
They added a lot of quality of life features that really help whit the tedium. You're still not going to miss it though, you simply won't want to gouge your eyes out. The people complaining about are mostly from earlier builds.

- It's long. most definitely 100+ hours for the first play through and very likely way more than that.

- Story is not it's strong point. It's serviceable for sure, but don't expect a master piece.
A lot of that comes from really flat characters, they are super shallow and cliché. Expect no subtlety here.
There is almost literally a line in the game were you say ""Weh! I will kill you now because I am a villain"". That's the kind of character depths you get. And the villain is especially guilty of that. 

- it's strong point on the other hand is combat and build variety. 
There are for sure a bunch of dead skills and even entire classes, but there are soooo many that it hardly matters.

- It's very unforgiving for new players, even if the game is actually really easy....if you know what to expect. BY the end of the game especially you become completely  OP almost regardless of your choices, but the beginning is really really rough.

- Even this late..it still has bugs..and some are quest breaking, if not game breaking. Apparently some have been in kingmaker already and have not been fixed...
It has a lot of them, but most are harmless...some aren't. The logs don't tell you everything either or show wrong information at times. It's not enough to give it a negative rating but it is still a problem.

- No nearly as much replay value as you would think from mythic paths. There can be some major changes, but they usually happen so late you no longer care. On the other hand it is balanced by the fact that is counts as more build variety.... But also a lot of the stuff here comes WWAAAYYYY too late. like 20 mintues away from beating the game kind of late.

Overall, it is in the upper echelons of CRPGS. The pacing is very good, I kept thinking..""just one more thing"".
It's fun, but get it for the combat, not the story. Even Kingmaker did that better and with less cringe.",1691706287,1691706287,True,1,1,0.479606896638870239,0,True,False,False

This game has amazing potential but the dialog, companions, and voice acting have all gone downhill.  The lack of quality is missed.  Too much attention on ""woke"" injection and not enough attention to the basic tenets of making a good game.

I waited to purchase until I thought most of the bugs were worked out so that has been helpful.

The game still manages to feel like it was made by true fans of the genre, even though it feels the talent pool has evaporated.  The effects of hiring ""equity"" maybe?

There is true greatness in this game, but the level of commitment and sometimes the strange choices for systems – makes much of the games best parts too far and few between.

The story is very cool and it can take many forms.
The companions are more complex than most other RPGs. They really feel like people with their own will and identities. They will, undoubtedly, surprise you. The companions are some of the best parts of the game, that and mainline quests.

The crusade management is fine, to a point, but the map and some of the systems and clutter makes the game a chore in many ways. Traveling the world map or issuing commands to your armies is a gigantic pain in the ass. It just takes too long and the UI is not optimal for this level of engagement. This is the biggest problem of the game because it makes it so hard to push through and not burn out. By the end of act four I was burned out. I spent the rest of the game speeding through the rest, it was the only way to finish the fight. Is still did 70 % of all quests if not more.

Combat is very complicated and sometime downright unfair, but that’s because it’s not your average RPG. It’s based on the Pathfinder tabletop? It makes no claim to be a simple game, and therefor is hard to fault for that.
If combat was closer to Pillars of Eternity I would like it more. As is, it becomes a bit too complicated and more or less a debuff gauntlet handling the massive amount of negative status effects the AI will pour over you.
However, the difficulty options are excellent and you have a very high degree of control over many aspects of the games difficulty. This mitigates a lot of the BS of the AI, still with a, to me, preferable system like Pillars of Eternity – this is not as necessary.

If you have the time, if you can commit – this is a gem of a CRPG, but make no mistake – much like the crusade itself this will be a huge commitment with hard choices.

That said it makes combat very satisfying once you get the grip on how the game works behind the scenes and in addition to that you can swap between RTwP and Turn-Based at your convenience. There are of course (very) few parts of the game that suffer from bad balancing but all in all it shouldn't deter you from enjoying the game since they can be overcome if you're creative. 

As far as the crusader (mode) management  goes, I've noticed that it receives much unnecessary hate and nonsensical criticism. It's basically a mini and slightly worse Heroes III game inside the game, it provokes you to think about your next moves and fights that you may want to take or avoid. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that you need to pick a mage General in order to have the best time. In anycase as you progress trough the game the crusader mode gradually becomes easier.

The last thing that should be addressed is all the negative reviews surrounding the so-called ""spyware"" controversy. All of these reviews should be dismissed as they were written by people that barely scratched the bottom of the barrel of the game itself in large majority of cases and they are just there with malicious intent in order to sway away players from enjoying the game. Developers do listen to the community and they immediately recalled their decision (which still did not make some people happy), therefore there shouldn't be any privacy concerns and listening to the community is deserving of at least, little bit of praise.

Over and over I tried and failed to get through the start of the game, Act 1-- getting a few hours in before ultimately restarting with a new character or losing interest completely. This time, I finally stuck with it, and boy am I glad.

Visually speaking, the game has some gorgeous visuals. The impressive and inspired locations definitely crop up more frequently as you get to the later acts, travelling to places which defy the natural laws of reality, pocket dimensions, things of that ilk... but even the normal areas associated with the earlier ""Acts"" of the game you explore can be gorgeous. The weather effects, particularly the more rare ones, are very nice to look at. The look of the gear you put on your characters can be very goofy, with jarring combinations of helmets, shields or even horrid looking eyeglasses, but the existence of a transmog system as well as a toggle to remove individual pieces of gear makes it a non-issue, or potentially even a boon if you like goofy things. 

Beyond that, I'd say the game does a very nice job of making melee combat feel -chunky-, with blows bisecting, beheading or sending enemies flying across the room as you get to the higher levels. Magic looks great when you cast it, too-- lightning arcing across the room, beams of holy light coming down from the heavens, though I rarely found it reflect on the bodies of my enemies like physical attacks did. Never did I see disintegrate actually, well, disintegrate someone.

Exploration is nice. There's a -lot- of places you can go, and barring a rare few portions of the game, you generally have as much time as you'd like to explore those places at your leisure, making the game a fairly relaxed, enjoyable experience compared to Kingmaker, where most quests had visible or not so visible timers. There's a fair few hidden areas and a couple of hidden quests and a frankly silly amount of hidden loot to reward exploration, and I always felt pleasantly surprised hearing the 'ping' notification of finding something hidden.

Pathfinding, ironically, is quite poor. Your AI companions will blunder into traps that they know are there, which can lead to frustration- but the game pauses every time you detect a trap or a new enemy, so the frustration can be alleviated somewhat. I thought the game was rather good about autosaving as well, generally giving you an autosave before or after entering a new location. I never lost significant progress.

The combat was rather enjoyable, despite my loathing for the Pathfinder 1e system. My frustrations with it, the abundance of math, the numerous stacking buffs interlocking and contradicting each other and the strange ways actions are divided was mostly settled by the medium, WotR's videogame nature speeding up the tedium significantly. I -love- that you can swap freely between turn based and real time with pause. The latter serves as an excellent way of churning through ""trash"" encounters, where you're fighting plenty of weak enemies that aren't much of a threat, while the former makes really tricky boss fights and the like much more manageable and fair. Being able to speed up the enemy's turn in turn based mode was also very welcome, and I came to miss it when playing other games.

The main thing which made me love WotR, however, was the writing. From the quests to my companions (one of the biggest highlights of the game imo), I never felt bored or like my choices weren't mattering. All the way into Act 5, choices I'd made long before then came back to influence my playthrough, and toward the end I felt as though I'd truly worked hard for the conclusion I got to the game. Voice acting wise, the game is mostly top notch. All of it has some pretty excellent delivery, and while a majority of the dialogue is silent, the main quest as well as important side quests remain voiced, and deliver some excellent performances in those moments.

Of all the thirteen companions in the game, there were only two I disliked-- and even then, I could see their merits. I find it tricky to write about what I liked without spoiling things by going into too much detail, but suffice to say, I felt like the crew you collect form a genuine bond through campfire dialogues between your companions, and that all of them have a lot of humanity to them, feeling very... earnest? For lack of a better word. A fair few of them are evil, or neutral, but despite that they all felt -useful- and like they had valid points and interesting philosophies or reasons for thinking the way they do. It felt like my actions were influencing them, for better or worse, that for all the good I did on their behalf, it would have been just as easy to corrupt them or exploit their problems for my own ends.

The main protagonist is mostly silent, though the 'voice packs' you can choose for your 'command quips' (just stuff you say when moving to a place, attacking something, sneaking, casting a spell and so on) all have a -ton- of character and personally made roleplaying a lot more fun. The portrait art you can choose for your characters is also quite lovely.

It can be difficult figuring out what character you want to play. The game doesn't hold your hand, and the abundance of classes, and the multiple subclasses associated with each, make choosing really hard. It doesn't help that many of the choices are bad ones that can cripple you in the long run. I'd personally recommend playing a Paladin, as it's a fairly simple but thoroughly effective class which remains useful the entire game long, with the Paladin being a natural counter to the demons which form the game's main enemies.

I probably missed some positives. UI and inventory management is very sleek and good. You can sort things and sell trash easily, and your inventory is categorized nicely. The game does have its faults, though.

To begin with, as you progress through the game 'buffing' by stacking beneficial spells on your party becomes more and more essential the higher a difficulty you're on. While not initially a problem, you will come to a point where you've got 100~ spells running at a time. That... really *sucks* when you're having to manually apply them all, one after the other. It caused me a great deal of frustration and ate up a lot of time before I installed a mod called 'Bubble Buff Bot', which introduced a 'one button buff' that I could very easily manage and adjust. Install that mod, at the very least, though be aware that it might disable achievements for you. (There's ways of working around that)

Other issues... well, I'd start by saying that the game has a really awful minigame where you manage armies, kinda like Heroes of Might and Magic? You create buildings in settlements, recruit armies, and send those armies to attack the enemy, whereupon you're taken to a grid-based, turn-based battlesystem very much like HoMaM. Unfortunately, unlike HoMaM, it sucks. Really bad. It was a genuine drain of my enjoyment of the game until I started cheating that aspect away, essentially removing it. It's not entirely without merit-- the armies you collect and the way your crusade progresses reflects your choices really well. A ""demonic"" commander could raise a demon army and do 'demonic' things while an angelic commander could do the opposite, inspiring their troops and seeking the most good and virtuous ways out of complex political dilemmas.

Progressing through the crusade mode, you're constantly faced with 'event cards' where you're given a block of text describing some dilemma you've been asked to weigh in on, and multiple choices with drawbacks and benefits, and that part is genuinely engaging and fun, making for good roleplay. Unfortunately the system it feeds into is the battle part of the Crusade minigame. 

Traveling through maps can be really tedious with the party's slow movespeed. Especially in Act 4. Still a good game. 9/10.",1691383223,1691383223,True,62,1,0.836777150630950928,0,True,False,False

I have decided to change my negative review to positive based on the changes Owlcat has made/reinstated. TBH, It wouldn't be fair if I didn't recognize the changes they have made. However, I will be wary of data harvesting in the future. 

This game is extremely enjoyable :-) and I am doing another campaign. Thanks for listening, Owlcat!

First off, even as a veteran of computer and tabletop RPGs, but not Pathfinder specifically, I found character creation to be incredibly opaque. You can absolutely ruin your build with decisions you make before you even start playing the game, and aside from already being a long-term Pathfinder munchkin, just building your character out of a guide, or figuring out what you did wrong partway through and restarting, there's not much way to figure out how to avoid this. It's a test you don't get to study for, and I've never much liked those.
The combat is a slog even on core (one of the harder difficulty settings, but not by any means the hardest, and the lowest you can get a lot of achievements on). Expect to save scum a lot on both combat and stat checks if you haven't gone in with a game-breaking build and hired a bunch of mercs to replace your party members (who have a lot more personality but are generally built to fail).
The writing's okay, though it's got that D&D-and-descendants thing of making everyone with an evil alignment basically a serial killer whose sole motivation is torturing kittens to death for the lulz.

1. It’s more fun building characters in Pathfinder. I’ve played a lot of 5E, and I like many things about it, but 5E is oversimplified. You don’t get many choices beyond race, class, and subclass. Pathfinder has more subclasses and feats, and you get many more feats to customize your character with. Add to this the mythic paths, and there are just a lot more options for creating interesting character builds. Some people might want it simple. But if you like strategically optimizing characters, there’s a lot more of that in Pathfinder.
2. There are better pets and actual mounts in Pathfinder: WotR. Your pets level up and get classes. You can ride your animal companions (and it is actually a huge advantage in combat to do so). Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t seem to have mounts.
3. There are a lot more spells in Pathfinder: WotR. WotR has a higher level cap (20 compared to Baldur’s Gate 3’s 12) so you can get to higher levels with more powerful spells.
4. Multiclassing is more interesting in Pathfinder. Now it is true that there are a lot of multiclassing options in Pathfinder that aren’t a good idea. But if you know what you are doing you can create some very effective and interesting builds by multiclassing. In 5E, it is generally not optimal to multiclass.
5. I only really played what was available in Baldur’s Gate 3’s early access so far, but from that experience, I feel like the story and characters are more engaging in Pathfinder WotR. Baldur’s Gate 3 writing does seem good though, and I like its tie-ins with tabletop adventures like Descent Into Avernus, but to me, it seemed like Pathfinder: WotR is more story driven.
6. I like that Pathfinder WotR has both turn-based and real-time combat. I like turn-based combat a lot… when it makes sense. When it’s just dungeon encounter #8 of 40, and the stakes aren’t very high, I don’t want to micromanage it. It’s nice to roll through lighter encounters in 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes.
7. I can read faster than voice actors can talk. Pathfinder WotR frequently gives you a lot of exposition in text blocks without fancy voice acting. And that’s fine with me. Most of the time, I was going to finish reading the text before the voice acting was done and cut it short anyway.
8. Pathfinder WotR is a very in-depth classical isometric crpg. It’s got what I like. A world map, where I can choose where to explore in what order, quests, dungeon crawling, character development, etc. 
9.  I like the strategy game features in WotR, I was a big fan of HOMM 3 and I like city management games. Pathfinder WotR feels very much like a continuation of the old-school crpg tradition with some nice strategy/management game features added.
10. Baldur’s Gate 3 is a crpg too, but it leans really heavily on interacting with the environment. That’s kind of its big appeal, doing creative, maybe absurd, things in the environment. You can throw a gnome at a goblin, knocking the goblin off a cliff or into a puddle of oil which you then set on fire. There’s certainly something to like about that kind of game play, but it wasn’t really present in any crpgs before BG 3’s predecessor, the Divinity games. Baldur’s Gate 3 also has great graphics. But despite these neat features, Pathfinder WotR is the deeper crpg in a lot of ways. I guess it depends on what you are in the mood for, old school crpg quests and dungeon crawling, detailed character building, and city and army management, or creative choices in a very interactive environment.
11. First-time players of Pathfinder WotR may find it surprisingly difficult. But its encounters, at least the serious ones, aren’t really calibrated for you to just trade blows with the demons. You are expected to use a lot of spells and items, especially to buff up before the fight, and sometimes to counter the particular dangers of a special foe. If you don’t want to buff up before fights or figure out what counters dangerous enemies, you can also just turn the difficulty down on the fly. Personally, I don’t go in unhasted.
12. A lot of the character customization in Baldur's Gate 3 is adjusting hairstyles and other aesthetics. And BG 3 does have very nice graphics and if you don't spend at least 30 hours playing with all of the hair color and makeup options, you haven't really gotten your money's worth. But I actually really like that you can import portraits in Pathfinder WotR. Midjourney can make really cool-looking fantasy portraits, so even with all the tools in BG 3, I still like the look of my Pathfinder WotR character better.

On a more game-centric note, I feel like the story fails to maintain it's stakes. It introduces early on that if the tutorial city falls, a crystal sets off a chain of explosions domino-ing into the death of billions and the fall of the nation, shortly followed by the end of the world after the main bastion holding back the demon scourge falls. After setting such absolute stakes, it goes on to gently push the player to kill the head inquisitor for hunting witches. If you don't (it is optional, of course) the dialogue from a rival cleric group's npc simply assumes you've killed him regardless, making it clear the devs and narrative expect you to so strongly that they take it for granted. Before this we were introduced to the outright inept city spymaster, who admitted to hearing rumors of a demon cult right below the city's main fort (which houses the earlier crystal) and simply never bothered to investigate. It's frustrating that the lazybones is presented as a buddy and an ally when there's some standing two feet away with the vigor and willingness to really get things done, who I'm expected to kill for it. He may be zealot, but in a war against literal demons I should hope he is.

Make sure you know what you are getting into and do some light googling into what Mythic Path is interesting to you. You might want to wait another year or so until they finish the game.
I cannot recommend something that people might spend even 2+ hours on only to realize they cannot do what they wanted to.

[i]Update: it must be mentioned that developers tried to include spyware in the installation but they reportedly removed it.[/i]
I'll start with
[h1]THE BAD:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] POOR OPTIMISATION. I had to:
[list]
[*]turn SSR and HBAO off (thanks internet)
[*]forcibly turn tessellation off in graphics drivers for good measure
[*]reduce GPU clock speed, power consumption and memory speed
[/list]
all to stop my graphincs card's fans from screaming in agony as the card heats up to its highest temperature ever witnessed by me. Some neglect was allowed during development on the technical part. GPU usage was close to 100% before and 40-50% after tweaks.
[*] COMBAT IS DIFFICULT. Having had taken a look at the combat system when I was starting the game, I decided to just play at lowest (story) difficulty, because I'd have to literally STUDY the combat system for several days. And I thought D:OS 2 was difficult.
[*] GAME IS LOOOOOOOONG. Not necessarily a downside, however, in the second half of my 120 hour playthrough I was getting increasingly tired of the game's slow pace. There's no teleport system ready to use, instead you need to build [spoiler]teleportation circles in outposts[/spoiler] and use them and even those are not available in Act 1. Most of the time you have to walk anywhere you need as far as I'm aware.
[*] RANDOM ENCOUNTERS. Oh how annoying they are. Any trip more than a day long will trigger a couple of them at least. THANKFULLY, I had a character with high stealth for most of the game that enabled me to skip them entirely.
[/olist]
[h1]THE UGLY:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] CRUSADE MODE. While I had fun beating demon armies up, it quickly wore off. Roughly every 5 days a demon army pops up, even in a dead end that is not connected to the source of the demon invasion. And then you need to get your army going wherever need be. Only in [spoiler]Act 5, when I sweeped the entire map and destroyed all demon armies could I place my strongest army in a bottleneck close to the demon invasion source and just[/spoiler] camp without having to run around the whole map to catch them. I'd write it as BAD but this mode can be made automatic so that it doesn't require player's input. However, many quests can be failed because of that.
[*] VOICE ACTING. Or rather lack thereof. It is very sneaky of developers to fully voice first 2 hours of the game and then voice only a fraction of dialogues. It seems only choke points of somewhat important quests are voiced (beginning, key points, ending). But the quality of voice acting is very good!
[*] DIALOGUES. Sometimes they are very long and it feels like reading an interactive book instead of playing a game. I kept finding myself skipping dialogues of characters or in quests I didn't care about.
[*] COMPLETIONISTS BEWARE. If you're one, you're gonna have a bad time. Achievements here are hard.
[*] SAVE BLOAT. The longer you play, the bigger your saves become. In late game one save file can reach 14 MB in size. This applies all saves, including quicksaves and autosaves. If you have 10 of each, it's 280 MB of saves, which slows down cloud sync.
[/olist]
[h1]THE GOOD:[/h1]
[olist]
[*] CHARACTER DIVERSITY. There are 10+ companions you can have, all of them have different personalities and traits. Everyone else is different too with their own goals, problems etc.
[*] MAIN QUEST. It was interesting enough. Not going to spoil.
[*] COMPANION QUESTS. They were interesting too. Not fetch quests, real adventures, sometimes with plot twists.
[*] INTERFACE. It's quite friendly and well made. There are even 3 colorblindness filters.
[*] FREEDOM OF ALIGNMENT. Player can be good, evil or neutral and this choice is not forced upon them [i]at first[/i] as far as I can tell. [spoiler]Until mythic path choice has to be made.[/spoiler] Then player should stick to it.
[*] SWITCH BETWEEN REAL TIME AND TURN BASED COMBAT. Self explanatory. Convenience feature.
[/olist]
[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
IMHO, the only way this game can be enjoyable and completed under 100 hours is on easy difficulty, with crusade mode on auto and skipping all quests except main and companion ones. Maybe even companion ones. That way you can get a simple ending and leave it at that.
If you have more time, there's a lot of content for you, good luck.
Some GPU tweaks may be required.
Good deal on sale with 50%+ off.

I, and many other players out there who just want some sweet sweet adventures, don't really care about those crusade nonsense. It breaks the entire role playing aspect in a RPG game.

No thanks and please leave me alone (They won't). I don't want to be a commander or what not, nor I care about this crusade BS, I just want to role play and back stab people alright? 
Also, this game is really text heavy. Sometimes I couldn't help asking myself: Am I playing a RPG game or a Text-Adventure game?  So many text. I would say about 50% of my game experience are reading those damn texts. And it would hurt if you skip them because otherwise you would miss out the lore or events and eventually you would get lost and get confused while doing the quest, like why am I entering this place? What should I do? Who is this guy? etc etc. Oh, and those Mandarin translations. I tried them, they are just so bad. 
And those confusing feats and skills and stuff. There are TONS OF THEM, and TONS OF TEXT trying to explain them. At first I thought: Well yeah, those developers did put some efforts to make their game feel grand and glorious. But after those skills getting more and more complicated, I am just lost.
Like every other DND+RPGs, this one has dragons, gods, devils, and you are the chosen one. To me, after getting exposed to way too many games within the genre with similar settings, I'm just tired of it. Dragons? Gods? Devils? The chosen one? I care none. I only want to start my own adventures and just be who I am. None of these ""the world is on fire, please save it"" BS should be my business.

I found this with Kingmaker, the developers don't seem to be particularly great at balancing particular fights and love sudden difficulty spikes for no apparent reason.  The protracted wave after wave of enemies just got really boring, it didn't feel tense or exciting, just a boring grind.  Also, cannot understand why the enemy AI has no regard for any opponents anywhere near it, just sends them straight past them all towards my PC main.  Just ridiculous game mechanics spoiling the game.  Also the way this game is balanced in terms of how the enemies are in combat just pushes this min/max play style which is just not what a lot of people want in an RPG.  I put a couple of hundred hours in Kingmaker, it just felt like a slog and this is unfortunately for me personally even more of a slog, which I do not find fun.  Taking out the Pathfinder v D&D nonsense people love to d*ck measure about, it just doesn't feel particularly tactical or varied, it's just a bit of a dull slog, requiring you to build some min/max builds and then pit them in some kind of attrition based grindfest.   BG3 has much more fun fights, still very much challenging, some very tough, but even when you fail and die you still feel like you had fun.   As soon as I hit this fight, I thought here we go again.  I cannot honestly explain why I spent a couple hundred hours in Kingmaker, I cannot say I immensely enjoyed it, story mode was a total waste of time as it was far too easy, normal difficulty in both games is a total grind that worsens as you progress.

The writing is pretty good the 'mythic path' elements particularly so. You get to do good or evil or even fun stuff and it's the strongest element of the game by far. Characters range from great to just OK, no-one got kicked out of my party because I didn't want to deal with them. The overall story is good enough however it struggles from the length of the game, you'll have figured out any intrigue long before the game finally gets there.
The gameplay is serviceable till it decides you need to be challenged at which point it devolves into tedium. The pathfinder rule set is, lets say not very friendly. The stat bloat is crazy so min maxing becomes more and more important. Prebuffing is the name of the game and its a long list of buffs. The balance can get wacky and auto level up is not up to the task of the harder fights. Your level up choices are more important than any strategy and its a lot of work.
There is also the crusade management aspect of the game, its mostly filler. You'll get checked pretty hard on occasion but that's just something to save scum and come back to with bigger numbers. It might be needed filler as it gives you a change from the stress of a weirdly balanced fight with some easier content.


In conclusion: If you love pathfinder rules, D&D 2.5e etc you could enjoy this. If you like RPGs for the story or class fantasy over the mechanics I'd recommend going elsewhere as this one is a struggle. A shame because the writing is pretty good, maybe slog through it on sale, its what I did. I wish I'd moved on like it seems many others did. Less than 50% of players made it to the halfway mark, and only half of them went on to the last act.",1691011112,1691011112,False,3,0,0.554054081439971924,0,True,False,False

WotR is definitely one of my favourite cRPGs I've played over the past 30 years. The central story and supporting NPC party cast are interesting and there's enough well-written lore spread throughout the game that no area felt stale. The mythic paths add some nice replayability to the game as they all play very differently and have direct changes to core storylines.

I strongly recommend new players start at lower difficulties, because the game is punishing even on Core if you're going in blind. Don't even attempt Unfair unless you have substantial knowledge of the game and mechanics, and are really good at building strong characters (the game warns you of this, and it doesn't lie). Beating Unfair was one of the high points of my gaming career!

There are a couple areas that I have some negative feelings about, though. The first is the amount of time it takes to cast party buffs. On higher difficulties (and mandatory on Unfair), you basically need every single buff available to you active, on just about every single fight, right from the start until the final fight. Much of my time on Unfair was spent casting buffs. There needs to be a way to make this process faster, like automatic casts upon finishing rest, or making all buffs instant-cast while out of combat or a specified time after finishing rest.

The other thing I dislike is how jarring some of the alignment dialogue options are. Good and evil are about what you'd expect, but the law-chaos axis often feels forced. Playing a paladin is especially strange because ""lawful"" basically means ""merciless"" in WotR, which doesn't fit the archetypal Lawful Good character. Many of the options feel like ""lawful evil"", not ""lawful."" Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a huge problem (always choose ""good""), but in this game, any alignment choice moves you towards your chosen alignment AND neutral. ""Good"" choice moves you to NG. ""Chaotic"" towards CN, etc. You must sometimes choose a Lawful action even if they are very out of character in order to remain a paladin. You *can fall* by being too good, which is utterly silly. It would be nice to have ""lawful good"" dialogue actions, where you're not sacrificing one or the other. 

Despite those problems, I still love the game. It is well worth picking the game up even for one playthrough. You'll get your money's worth as the game is long, challenging, and interesting. I expect I'll keep playing as new content is released.",1691008692,1691008692,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

First, the good, of which there is a great deal: it feels like there were lessons learned from Kingmaker, and nearly all of them helped make WotR a far better game. Improvements in AI, in the UI, small quality-of-life improvements, fixes to many of the bugs, and a major change to the management system all made for a far, far more appealing and fun game.

The Crusade management mode of the game is enormously better than Kingmaker's kingdom management. Gone are the ridiculous time constraints that made Kingmaker's management not-fun. No longer do I feel like I'm racing against the clock just to eke out successes through save-scumming. While the crusade management is simpler, it isn't to the detriment of the game. It works better in every aspect.

The quests in the game are more fun, too. It feels as if there were fewer than in Kingmaker, but that might be a result of me just enjoying them so much more. I was disappointed as I began to run out of quests at the end of each chapter. They're also written better, which leads me to the next point: the story.

The story is excellent. It's cohesive in a way I didn't expect. Themes are adhered to and elevated through related (and sometimes unrelated) questlines. You feel like you have real choices along the way, and I never felt shoehorned into a particular playstyle or alignment or storyline.

My only, very minor, gripe is that there are some bugs in the game that can leave you frustrated. Things like spellbooks not updating properly after a retrain, or abilities disappearing. Minor issues that don't make the game unplayable, but are still irritating when you discover them.

All in all, I highly recommend Wrath of the Righteous.",1690953446,1690953446,True,0,0,0.495867788791656494,0,True,False,False

On one hand, it is very ""woke"" for its time.
All women are powerful, strong, driven and amazing.
All men are soft, ""victims"", bloodthirsty, or stupidly incompetent.
All major NPC's are women, bar none. 
Also, after playing it thought a few times I feel the writing leans to playing more ""you can be anything you want"" chaotic.

On the other hand, 
The mechanics are fun, 
the settings are awesome, and 
the overall story is really cool.

For its faults, it is still one of the best CRPG's out there, imo.

Should you buy it?
Well, if you are a fan of heavy handed fem- supremism, overt and in-your-face homosexuality, and a generally very liberal game.. you should be good.
If you cant handle that.. its still a good game.. just use your imagination to get you through some points.

People should chill, this game is good and doesn't deserve such poor ratings because of one poor decision of the dev.

Compared to kingmaker, it's inferior despite being a sequel. Better rpg mechanics, worse story. 

Pros:

-More classes and archetypes
-Mythic paths
-More items and armors and weapons...you can now put armor on animal companion too which is very cool.
-More memorable companions, including the amazing, magnificent and brilliant Nenio.
-Upgraded graphics and better music.
-Worshiped deity choice isn't just flavor anymore, characters acknowledge mc's race and class occasionally.
-Scroll scribbling and potion making during rest.
-You can mount your animal companions.

Unfortunately, here the pros end. 

Cons:

-90% of what you fight are demons and cultists. There is no point in taking ranger favored enemy types like goblins, fey, plants....you literally won't meet these opponents ever in the game. In almost 200 hours I can recall 1 encounter with plants, zero with goblins or fey. Other types are similarly under represented, sometimes you find some undead and other than that....same few types of demons leveled up....over and over again.

-Most of the story is traveling from one huge dungeon hub to another, clearing it room by room from repetitive enemies, rinse and repeat. Minor locations don't matter.

-Puzzles, fucking puzzles, overly complex, unintuitive, omnipresent puzzles. Some are hidden and you won't even know about them until some other player tells you what you missed by accident, the solutions to them are equally esoteric. In enigma alone you have 11 puzzles to solve. Worthless, tedious time bloat.

-The writing is poor. Things happen to push story forward. Characters do stupid and ooc shit to push the plot forward. 

-Most mythic paths are morbid and take agency from player. You either do what your mythic path/patron tells you to or you are locked out of powers and mocked. Lich, Aeon, Demon and Swarm are especially guilty of that. None of that ends particularly well for the player either.

-The mythic paths represent extremes, and so do dialog options. In kingmaker we had a dialog line for every alignment, here it's only Lawful (Blind Justice), Chaotic (Clown), Good (Turn the other cheek), Evil (Murderhobo). I could literally tell which dialog option says what just by looking at its tag and without reading it, it's so straightforward and predictable. Like it's mass effect or dragon age or something.

-Any story that can be solved by characters just talking to each other in the beginning is a poor story. And whole story of WOTR literally wouldn't happen if certain someone just talked to the mc in the beginning. But her, knowledge earned is more valuable than knowledge given, eh? what bullshit.

-Choices don't matter. You find evil book that promises you power? You can take it or reject it? You reject it, huh? Too bad, your rejection of power is considered power so you get power. Because the plot needs it. And many other examples of that, but I don't wanna spoil whatever story is left there.

-Mythic paths are op and easily break normal pathfinder builds. Example: I made inquisitor. One of the main gimmicks of making inquistor is getting more judgement uses on level up. Then bam, first mythic level, you get unlimited judgements...made me think what's the point of leveling inquisitor further. Other classes are equally broken.

-Almost all enemies have spell resistance and elemental resistances which break elemental weapon enchantments and spells unless you take the mythic path that makes you totally ignore elemental resistance to given element...which is also broken.

-Crusade management is even more tedious then kingdom management in kingmaker, another timesink.

-No companion is a 2 handed weapon fighter by default, and no companion has animal companion by default. You need to multiclass them for it. But hey, you get 3 archers, the monk archer, the ranger archer, and the fighter archer. 

As for difficulty, it's similar to kingmaker. Playing on daring difficulty level, my experience was...first act was the hardest, then act 2 was easier, and then difficulty just disappeared and I'm steamrolling everything. Dunno if it's pro or con. 

And despite all that, it's a good crpg. But damn it's tedious to work through it, yes, work. Often it's just a grind. And since most people play crpgs for the story, not gameplay mechanics, I advice to just play kingmaker instead and only play wotr after getting bored of kingmaker. 

Oh, did I mention that a few days ago the game got another patch, almost two years after release, which fixed some bugs and introduced some new bugs?

The problem is the game is ridden with bugs and incorrectly and erroneously implemented mechanics. And now is, what, around 2 years since release? The game is not really getting better despite the updates it receives.

The cycle looks something like this: we get an absolutely bug-infested content release, like the initial release or a DLC, then come the patches which break as many things as they fix, then a new pack of buggy content. As a result, you can never really play the game, there's always some problem, some crash, some bug etc.

Now, let me note that I realize that the ending is (usually) techincally reachable, and even if something does not allow the player to progress, it is (often) techincally possible to fiddle with the game state through a mod and maybe fix your problem.

I write ""can never really play the game"" because it's a number-crunchy combat-heavy cRPG where the numbers that form the basis of combat do not ever completely make sense due to endless bugs and thoughtless implementations, and that leads to my enjoyment of combat being spoiled.

For me, the core gameplay of Pathfinder: WOTR is the combat. The rest, like the story or characters, is just backdrop for the core gameplay. And it's all devalued because the core is just bugs within bugs within bugs. So that's why the thumbs down.

I still have some hope in the developers. Perhaps, this review will show that some of their players are interested in them fixing the game before churning out additional content. Maybe they can even release their next RPG in a more techically sound state.

(The game's review, as if nothing happened this month, is below)

The negative is for forcing the Player to install a data collection tracker. Otherwise you were unable to play the game.

It's rolled back as of the current version of the game.

While ""iT iS a StAnDaRd In GaMe DeV"" so to speak, it is a shady and abhorrent practice to introduce such a tool long after the game's premiere and multiple DLCs being released. 

Also, EU citizens can legally opt-out due to GDPR laws introduced in countries that are part of the European Union; and the scope of data collection must be absolute minimum if necessary. 
Crash logs are fine, but IP adress, time stamp (at what time the app was launched), and other things the tracker collected cross the line. 

Failing to do so have legal consequences. 
This attack on privacy might fly in other places in the world, but in the EU not so much. 

I do acknowledge the apology from the devs. 
I do appreciate (proclaimed) deletion of the data that has been collected during the period.
I do see the changes are rolled back.

But this is the kind of trust that will not be regained easily.
God bless people who will forgive, but I - personally - will never forget this kind of move.

[b]Game's actual review:[/b]
The game is perfect for those who cannot find enough friends interested in Pathfinder, and also want to play their own adventure.
From little things like uploading portraits of your own characters, to enormous amount of buid possibilities - the game has it all.

Character creator is rather blunt with minimum amount of cusomization, but that's fine. You won't be seeing much of your character's model close up anyway + compared to other games (like Solasta) the characters are actually pretty.

I treat this game as a good introduction to the table top version of Pathfinder. Mechanics are mostly the same.

It is visually stunning...when it wants to be. There are certain spells and skills that have no special effect whatsoever, but that's a little thing bothering me.

Story wise - there is so much to do. There are so many possibilities to go through and finish the game. 
The Mythic system is one of my favourites, as it plays to the power fantasy, and really makes you feel special.

The characters are pretty well written. I focused on some, while I ignored the rest, yes, but that's my personal taste.

Soundtrack is fitting. I don't have any favourite tracks that I would listen to outside the game but that's fine.

Crusade mini-game is fun - for as long as you make it last. It's nice that you can opt out of it and set it to automatic.

Also, the gore is gorgeus and nasty. I love when the enemies just explode in blood and bits.",1690835464,1690838443,False,10,2,0.561568617820739746,0,True,False,False

Nevermind the recent data tracking implementation fiasco, which was more than a low blow towards a loyal playerbase, but a forced breach of privacy against people who had purchased the game. 

The game itself is being constantly tinkered by the developers, which more often than not breaks certain interactions and mechanics within the game, disrupting gameplay and sometimes impeding progress in certain areas. This was also the case for WotR predecessor.

While you get a template for an adventure with amazing potential, it is ultimately tarred by the incomplete and sometimes faulty updates that fail to deliver something that should have been available on day 1: a finished and polished game.

As it is I couldn't give it a thumbs up. I am already in the hole, and will probably finish my current playthrough at some point if the developers make good on their word to fix an issue that has already been recognized by them, which has brought others progress to a halt. But if you are still on the fence on whether to purchase this game or not, at least be warned. You may finish your adventure with no issue, or you may get done dirty halfway by a surprise ""update"" or even live in real time the implementation of some sketchy scheme.

However, I strongly suggest reading the rest of the review as this has done little to change the damage to trust their actions have caused, and I have concerns for the companies values going forward. I still feel any post-purchase required changes are theft of personal property, and despise that they seem to use mobile industry ""standards"" as their basis for how they act. I am still unsure if I will buy further products from Owlcat, but know if they try similar things in future games/updates I never will. 

Let me start off with the fact that I absolutely love this gave. It is likely my favorite CRPG, fighting with DOS2, which is saying something because I love CRPGs. But I need to give a recommendation to avoid this game due to the recent change to EULA requiring acceptance to install invasive tracking software on the system before you can play. Despite the decision to reverse this, I have lost a great deal of faith in the company due to this for the following reasons.

1. The software is invasive and shouldn't be in a video game like this in the first place. In the community posts, they defend their actions as ""it being industry standard, especially on mobile games"". This is very weak and shows a lack of understanding. Many horrendous behaviors are industry standard, but not justifiable. Real-money gambling is the industry standard right now in games. Battle passes are industry standard. Claiming smoking doesn't cause health effects used to be the industry standard. I expect better from companies than just industry standards, especially when they are comparing with the mobile game market. 
2. The EULA would be still unacceptable, but better if it was A) option or B) there from the beginning. But as it, it forces people who have owned the product for years to accept this change showing the devs don't believe anyone really owns the game. Essentially, they are stealing the product you bought and making you rebuy it with your data, and if you don't like it then you lose the product. 

Unfortunately, these are the kind of actions that require a lot of good faith actions and communication to repair the damage, and the community post does not own up to the severity of their actions as of now. I was eagerly waiting for Rogue Traders and pretty much a guaranteed launch buy (just waiting for reviews). Now I am not certain if I will be, and I certainly will not be if they put tracking software in the game which cannot be opted out from. 

Developers, from a loving fan of your game, please do better so I can enjoy (and buy!) them in the future. Own up to just how serious the forced changes were (theft essentially), that comparing with mobile game ""standard"" is not your team's standards, and continue making great games.",1690511031,1690744489,True,0,0,0.616053462028503418,0,True,False,False

The Enhanced Edition brings many improvements and bug fixes to make the game even more complete and enjoyable. The developers are constantly working to improve the player experience, and it shows clearly.
Colorful graphics and a great soundtrack perfectly convey the atmosphere of the game and add a special charm to it. Plunging into this world has become a real pleasure for my eyes and ears.
The development team deserves a special mention for their excellent work on this game. It is obvious that they are passionate about their work and are creative in every detail.
So, if you're a fan of RPGs where character building and decision making matter, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition is a great choice.

WoTR was an improvement on Kingmaker for me in almost all aspects. I'll give a generally run down of the main game before a few quick reviews of the DLCs on offer. I am writing this now because I appreciate the developers being open about a mistake made, although I must say most AAA developers are committing the same nonsense with little repercussions. 

WoTR Main Story: 9/10
I really enjoyed the story of WoTR, have attempted many Mythic Paths and restarted multiple characters, multiple times. Some of my general pet peeves with ""Evil"" game paths were addressed in parts by the Mythic Path system. The story itself follows the PnP campaign of the same name, one of the more enjoyable in my opinion. I won't spoil any more than that but a few acts were stand-outs for me, ACT IV being my personal highlight. 

Graphics: 8/10
On release was a serviceable Isometric RPG with some stuttering issues and bugs, which were solved from the many patches implemented since. Today, the game runs smoothly on my middling system and I haven't had any bugs pop up for quite some time. The world itself is probably the standout over character models. 

Gameplay: 10/10
I would say this game has an extreme learning curve if you haven't had experience with the PnP system. But stick at it, it gets easier and more enjoyable with time. Character development gets more and more enjoyable, the more you understand how feats work and interact with one another and across to the other systems that affect your character like BAB, AC and Mythic Path choices. The depth can be insane if you want it to be, which works well for higher difficulties. Easier modes let you explore the world but there is potential for an extremely tactical approach. I am not a huge fan of Real Time with Pause and prefer Turn Based, but be aware that playing TB mode makes the game a fair amount longer to get through as battles generally eat up more time. 

DLCs: 6/10
Bit of a mixed bag really, I enjoyed most for what they are, but I feel like the DLCs in Kingmaker were more enjoyable for me personally. As someone who likes to try builds and test out party composition, the dungeon DLC, The Treasure of the Midnight Isles has been my most liked. The Last Sarkorians is cool but I haven't been able to place the character really in my general lineups. Through the Ashes and Inevitable Excess I haven't really played, I end up just going for a new run instead which may be a ""me problem"" really.

As far as CRPG's go this is for sure one of the best I have played coming from an individual who does not enjoy the genre that much this one is an exception. As far as I have played ( start of act 2 ) the story has been fantastic especially in regards to the crusade, the fight against the demons, the mythic paths, characters both supporting an main there really is nothing I can criticise I have always been a sucker for stories involving a black and white good vs evil and while stories like that can be pretty cut and dry and perhaps a bit bland WOTR really does a great job of showing why the crusaders fight. This is shown arguably or at the very least for me the best in how the demons treat humans without spoiling too much there is a scene where a succubus has tricked some crusaders into believing that the succubus is the very incarnation of a goddess and has one crusader cut his own eyes out for having sinful thoughts about the goddess's body. It really encapsulates why these demons are by every meaning of the word a blight to be purged and sure that crusader was sinful but that doesn't mean he has to carve his own eyes out and by walking the path of righteousness the game really makes you feel like a holy crusader ( if you go down that path )  as opposed to say just being the good guy like in a game like Mass Effect. The game really is a step up from Kingmaker in the sense that not only is the story good but the city / crusade management is much easier and can even be switched off if you feel so inclined I did not feel the need to do so though and have been having a great time raising my armies and building up my cities to vanquish the demons. And now to address the elephant in the room...Yes the game's developers did try to implement spyware into the game a spyware that in a nutshell tracks what you are doing online and reports back so your data can be sold the highest bidder and yes that is among the highest sins a developer could do but I will argue the point that within the same day of the spyware patch being pumped out the developers walked back their decision and completely removed it from the game as well as deleting any and all data that was collected if you can believe them. In my eyes this is acceptable sure it does not change what they tried to do but the fact that it was removed so quickly after the player backlash makes things a little better. I'm not saying to give your trust to them again so soon but I don't think the game deserves to be review bombed after all there is a good game here and the decision was walked back.",1690705385,1690705471,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Pros:

- Awesome story.

- The choices really matter.

- Each mythical path significantly influences the story progression.

- A massive number of possible combinations: numerous skills, items, builds, and more, giving the impression that this game is endless.

- Well-developed character romances.

- The devs recycled assets from Kingmaker, which I find a great idea if it speeds up the game's development and allows them to focus more on the main content.

- Aivu is the best character in the game, by far, and her cuteness is irresistible.

Cons:

- Extremely grindy. If you play without mods, expect frequent annoyances like having to disable numerous traps one after the other, even in places where it makes no sense for them to be. The traps are just pointless and time-consuming. Who would install so many traps everywhere?

- Making a single wrong choice or not setting up camp at the exact moment can break your playthrough. For example, I was romancing Wenduag, and she suddenly attacked my party for no reason due to one of those missed steps. I couldn't romance Areshuale either for the same reasons. Why would the devs do this? It takes away the player's freedom to make choices and makes no sense in the story.

- A game that requires a walkthrough to be played has failed to become a fun game.

- Standalone stories, like Through the Ashes and Inevitable Excess are just a waste of development time that could be used improving the main game, creating a new mythical path, expanding Aivu's story and so on.

- A lot of complexities in the game could be simply facilitated, like a mechanism to auto buff the party for example.

- The devs used some sort of spyware to collect data from the players. Despite their repentance and canceling it, it still needs to be mentioned.

- While playing the game, I suddenly faced a 20+GB update that forced me to wait for the download. However, it didn't bring any new features, only bug fixes.

I love most of this game. 

I enjoy story rich rpg games (such as this), and most of the main story is good. There are lots of choices to make, skills and upgrades and side quests. It is a bit tricky if you play a more difficult way than easy/normal with combat and skills and setting up your companions and party for battle. Pause and plan. 

There are ofc not all good. There are bugs here and there, still. Save often. I don't enjoy the map overview fights with your armies much. Sometimes your choices seem very black or white and imo some choices are just dumb. But, that might be a personal preference. 

Over all, if you enjoy dnd baldur's gate style rpg games with story and campanions, go for it! I do enjoy this game more than the first Pathfinder.

I don't believe that this is a ""mistake"" or ""oversight"" as claimed by the publisher, probably it was assumed that people would not read the patch notes. Understand that you are being placed at a disadvantage when the EULA you sign when you purchased the game is unilaterally adjusted to now allow tracking on your systems.

The EULA stated that the tracking information could be made for sale to third parties. It is an ""industry standard"" SDK (read: data harvesting software not linked to this game), to track you and your system information. The information is supposedly ""anonymous"", but it should be understood that the fingerprint of ""GPU + CPU + RAM available + hard drives + IP address"" is a pretty unique fingerprint, even if your name is not attached to it.

Although the game is good, it means that you just can't trust the publisher not to try and change the deal you made with them later. 

To the publisher, I understand the need for technical telemetry. As far as it relates to the game that's an acceptable trade off v.s. privacy in my opinion. However, telemetry related to advertising and marketing, especially when you force an agreement of the sale to third parties is not. I hope to person or team that proposed and agreed this change is removed from a position where they can make such changes in the future.

Mid Campaign Update (1/27/2023): Difficult time getting through Act 1 with a save that I'm happy with. Currently finishing up A1 on Hard with a mostly merc group, and it's going ok. Not sure it stays fun after the complexity spike at the start of Act 2, will give it one more go with this current pure Spell Master (going Lich). I might actually table this effort (finish Act 1, then just save it before taking any Mythic levels - pretty solid jumping off point I could come back to), then run the non-mythic story. That might be cool, and probably avoids at least some complexity, which doesn't curve out very well in the main story (spam popups for basic crap I know, while treating character building decisions (which make or break a playthrough) as no big deal.

I have only completed the first act, several times. 
It's easy when the game decides to randomly remove your bases/items forcing a restart. 
The character creation is godlike and probably where I spent about 30% of my time. 
The problem is the sandbox outside of that creation that: 

Forces you to read gendered language for a minority of gamers.
Forces you to interact with characters who define themselves based on their sexuality. Mandatory. 
Forces you to reload when you enter any new location on anything but easy because the difficulty scaling is abominable. 
Forces you to remount your mounted characters during combat if there's a load screen, a new area, an inconvenient conversation, if the wind blows.

Some high level fallout 4 conversations where you're either overly forgiving, don't say anything, or kill the other person in literally every alignment choice. Not to mention it's written by what I can only assume is a group of high school students looking for extra credit.

I am a big fan of the RPG genre, and for a long time I do not remember such a pleasure from the game, probably since Dragon Age: Origins I believe. Very cool characters (especially I liked Daeran and Regill), deep role-playing system (mostly enjoyed magic classes), interesting story and, of course, cool mythic powers! But the most important thing that I loved in this game is the opportunity to become a real and powerful villain! Demon and Lich mythics are just top! However, I totally could not resist the charm of little baby dragon Aivu, so I played as Azata as well, with great pleasure I must say. Also, I laughed heartily on the Trickster path, some of the jokes are absolutely awesome! The game has amazing replay value, I'm already planning several playthroughs ahead, because I really want to play both the cosmic Aeon and the late mythics of the Golden Dragon, Devil and ultimate evil Swarm-That-Walks. No, I'm not tired yet, I find something new in every playthrough, because the game is just huge, no, it's better like this - HUGE!

What else is good, the game has a supercool sincere community, and the developers are in touch with the players, yes, there are still some bugs in the game, but the guys quickly respond to problems that arise, regularly patch the game even after so much time from the release. Thank you for that, Owlcats! Also, great thanks for guys who shoot walkthroughs and write guides, you are absolutely just as helpful as Camellia, that's for sure!

The first game had a few problems, but still ended up being a fun experience. Recommendable, even, if only barely.

On the other hand, I would absolutely not recommend this game. 

First off, the most glaring issue, one which was in the first game but is exacerbated in this game, is the unbalanced encounters. As an example, the very first mission you're given is to head on over to a market square and build a bridge. Neat, right? Well, you do that, go on your happy way, build the bridge. What do you do after that? There's a huge zone to explore, might as well get to exploring, right? Guess what bucko? On the other side, there's an encounter with monsters who do ability damage and cannot be damaged except by magical weapons. At this point in the game, you will probably have one, maybe two magic items between your whole party. Guess it just sucks to suck. In another place, in a house in that same zone, you have the misfortune of meeting a creature in the basement which can only be seen if you can somehow detect invisibility. Didn't make a wizard? Haven't met one yet? Well, sucks to be you, you just can't fight that unless you come back later. That's not the end of this issue, either. These encounters are just legitimately impossible whole-party killers if you're not prepared (at level 2 or 3). These are aggravating enough, but mercifully uncommon. What is not mercifully uncommon is the extreme prevalence of supremely poorly balanced encounters. I've been playing and dungeon mastering pathfinder for years at this point, so I understand that balancing encounters is difficult. The developers of this game took one look at that challenge, and said to themselves ""let's just not even try."" Every other encounter is VASTLY overbalanced for your characters and their level. For example, running across a medium water elemental in the tutorial which requires you to use every single consumable available to you to have a hope, or running across encounters with multiple demons that are credible encounters for your party singly. Or, when the inn you're using as a home base is attacked by a horde of cultists which never stop coming until you kill a specific set of units, something which is not told to you, or highlighted, except in one single piece of dialog. Then, at the end of the encounter, a boss mob spawns who is massively overmatched not only for your pathetic party, but also every single NPC in the zone that they give you to help you out. I looked up a guide for it, and they recommended a half dozen plus casts of a specific spell. At level 3. For those who don't know pathfinder, that is legitimately 100% of the casts available for a single caster or more at that level. Fortunately you can get past these issues if you have really good luck. Which brings us to the next issue.

THE DICE ROLLING IS RECTUM-SHATTERINGLY BROKEN

In the first game, this was noticeable. It wasn't terrible, but it was noticeable. You'd have pretty long runs of mildly bad luck here and there, but it wouldn't be too terrible. Usually you could figure your way through it. In this game, it's like you're using dice which are loaded against you. They figured out how to make dice rolling work back in 2002 with the release of Morrowind, so how the absolute piss have they somehow managed to screw it up THIS BADLY? You can go whole combats without rolling a single hit. If an enemy casts a spell on your party, it is GUARANTEED that you will fail your saves. Roll for damage? Prepare to roll low! The only good thing is that the enemies seem to suffer under a similar, albeit somewhat mitigated curse. How is it mitigated? Well, if I roll a 5, I miss. If an enemy which is vastly over-matched for my level rolls a 5, he hits!

Next, we get to map movement and random encounters. You will have random encounters. You will have LOTS of random encounters. You will use your resources on these random encounters, and you will need to sleep. If you sleep outside of safe places though, you start to get cancer. Sleep too many times, and the cancer becomes terminal, game over. You need to sleep to replenish your resources, and you will likely need all of your resources to deal with the aforementioned overtuned encounters. See how this is an issue? It's just terrible game design.

I personally didn't like any of the side characters in this game, but that's more of a personal thing. Maybe you'll like them, who knows. I didn't get very far in the game before I put it down in disgust, so maybe they get less annoying as time goes by. I doubt it.

What's good about this game? Well, the character creation is pretty faithful to pathfinder, with lots of options. It is a ton of fun to theorycraft your character. Unfortunately, if you don't build something relatively optimal, you'll just get absolutely destroyed on repeat. Isn't that fun? 

The game looks pretty good, though it is very resource intensive for what it is. Hope you've got good fans.

Alas, not only would I be lying, I would be doing the game a disservice.

Playing Wrath of The Righteous is a very jank, very inconsistent experience with certain areas and encounters that can range from annoying to straight up infuriating, bugs that can range from certain dialogue not triggering properly to entire quests breaking, and the entire crusade mode is just a waste of your time, although the actual core gameplay and combat loops, being based of it's namesakes TTRPG, are very satisfying and fun when they are working properly. Oh yea, it is also optimized like absolute trash.

So, why the positive review? Well, while the ""game"" aspect of this CRPG is nothing ground breaking, it is in the story and narrative that WOTR really shines, and specifically the characters. WOTR has some of the most well written characters of any RPG in recent memory, and the companions especially have fantastic writing, with all but one feeling unique and creative in their own way. [spoiler] Sorry Greybor, edgy ""I'm a conflicted assassin"" is not creative nor unique [/spoiler]

While some of the side quests can be a bit... meh, in terms of their narrative and it's impact on the larger world, (These are mainly the fault of backers. Certain backers got rewarded by being allowed to design quests/areas/characters, and they can feel out of place. One such example is Blackwater.) the main story and higher quality side quests are fantastic. You do not need to have played Kingmaker before, or even really dabbled in the Pathfinder universe to enjoy the story, as it does a fantastic job of framing itself and giving you a good footing in the universe.

You can tell this was a CRPG made with immense amount of love from Owlcat. They truly wanted it to be the absolute best it could be, and it shows in the final product. No, it is not polished, it is buggy, it runs like crap, but by god, the characters, the writing, the narrative; if you are looking for a AAA experience, with a large budget and team behind it, than you are going to be dissapointed. If you are looking for a CRPG that tells a good story, has good characters, and overall has high quality writing that allows you to make choices which actually impact the characters and world around you, than this game will make you very, very happy. It made me happy, after-all


Edit: As I am sure you have seen, recent reviews are complaining about a program called Appsflyer temporarily being added to the backend, claiming this is some form of spyware; this is unequivocally false. Yes, Appsflyer collects data on users, but so does your OS. So does Steam. So does nearly every website you visit. You know that little button that shows up when you visit a new website thats asks you to allow cookies? Well guess what, if you accept that, you just gave that website access to a huge amount of information about your web usage. Steam, when you take that hardware survey? Congrats, you just gave Valve a full hardware readout of your pc, going so far as it being able to tell how much free space you have in your hard drive. Use Steam at all? Congrats, you just let Valve know your purchasing habits, what games interest you, and what types of communities interest you. Use Windows at all? Congrats, Microsoft now has access to system wide analytics, including any and all tasks your PC is undertaking, system and software information, along with almost anything else that they could want to know about you. Have Win10 or Win11? Well guess what, Microsoft has access to a built in [b]keylogger[/b] on any machine running Windows 10 or 11. Oh, you carry a phone around you and have a social media? Well, do I even need to explain? Nothing that Appsflyer collects is data that you do not readily give up without even realizing it.  If you are worried about companies collecting data on you, you should not have anything connected to wifi, let alone a steam profile which you make purchases on.
 
All yall freaking out about ""spyware"" saw a buzzword and decided to freak out. Owlcat didn't try and sneak Appsflyer in, they didn't try to keep it in once they saw the community pushing back.

Interesting companions and good combat, even though you might get tired of fighting demons by the end.  I set the ""campaign management"" bit to autopilot, so I can't comment on that.  Difficulty is a little uneven, but I feel like that's almost par for the course with this type of game.

The only real negative is the ""Abyssal corruption"" mechanic that has you constantly travelling back to home base to clear it off, often resting a few times along the way.  The whole world map travel part of the game is a bit of a time sink, and the corruption mechanic makes it much worse.  Just give us a good reason to return to base rather than forcing us to.

I love the game so far played a lot, I'll do a more in-depth when I get done with it, spent a good 6 hours making something trying it then re starting...I have one big complaint...who ever made the Tavern Defense and actually let that go to print should never be allowed to make a choice again, as a core player it was just a slog, and not in a wow I'm so happy we made it (the last 2 arsonist who get 2 full rounds before you can even get to them and they focus fire the same place ruined my 12/12 building...but it was a slog like wow I instantly want to destroy the crusaders I wish I could have just helped the cult they seemed more competent, any person who thinks yea they should just stand around slowing turn base to a crawl...and gods forbid you start a rage earlier then turn 15...that said game is still amazing but yea next time I'll just tell them to fight without me and be happy they die...that is all

Oh added one more thing whoever put an unskippable cut scene with not save point before the fight you can go to the same place as the person who made the Tavern Defense...I feel like the people that made this have not actually played Pathfinder in all my years no GM (outside of someone looking to be a jerk) puts this much ""Sleep/ Paralyzation/ Stun effects...I still enjoy it but like a ton of really poor game choices, did you think core and up players would just 1 shot the boss so why not put a long cut scene...

Well it seems that Owlcat saw the negative feedback because of the non-optional tracking (effectively spyware in my opinion) and has promised to release a hotfix that removes the integration with AppFlyer and revert any changes in the data collection parts of the EULA that were implemented on the last patch.

Good for them, better for people who play games and don't want their data collected, collated, and sold.

I am changing my review to a recommend, but it with the *caveat* that you know going into this that the company has tried to pull a fast one once already. Enjoy the game but keep an eye open. If that sounds like too much for you, I understand.  
I enjoyed this game, and before today (7/24/23) I would have (and did) enthusiastically recommend it to my friends who also play CRPGs.
However with the patch that added (without any option for opt-in or even opt-out) a tracking element to this game with ""AppFlyer"" integration I am uninstalling this game and will not be recommending it to anyone going further.

I get it, you want to be able to understand how users are interfacing with your game, but this just isn't the way and only burned up goodwill.

If the tracking integration is removed, or changed into optional, I will update my review.

Also, I am not sure this sort of thing is GDPR compliant, but I am less sure of that than I am my own personal requirements on games.",1690217671,1690383774,True,1,0,0.503600001335144043,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the game is filled with awesome moments and fun gameplay, but is absolutely drowned out by the myriad of bugs that litter the game, even 8 months and 2 DLCS after release. 

Sure, the bugs might be circumvented by patience and quicksaving, a LOT, but add the second of the 3 flaws and you've got yourself a proper mess, that being the insane difficulty spikes of the game. You can breeze through a good chunk of the game without having to min-max the ever loving f--k of everything on normal difficulty, to then just be absolutely destroyed by a single random enemy which spams one-shots, AoE Crowd control, and permament debuffs every turn, with more HP than your entire party put together and an AC to match (AC: how difficulty it is to hit, and trust me, you'll be missing a LOT). It's jarring, and completely out of the blue most of the time.

It really feels like the game wasn't playtested at all, or if so was run with god-mode on. I think it stems from a near fanatic following of the rules of the pen-and-paper game, which is all good and dandy on paper, but it's missing a crucial part that makes that work, the DM, who can react and adjust the game on the fly to make sure it's a challenging, but ENJOYABLE experience, which this game is NOT, a good chunk of the time, but instead tedious and forces you to resort to save scumming tactics. That is, unless you spend a week researching all the hundreds of obscure mechanics in the game and craft a character that is so broken, even the hardest mode feels too easy. 

And then, the third and final major flaw of the game, the crusader army mode. It's barebones, it's unintuitive, it's extremely restrictive in how you can play it. Basically, you periodically receive resources, which you can spend to either train units, or purchase mercenaries, and as the game goes on you can unlock new units and upgrade existing ones in different ways, but after near 300 hours in the game and a fair bit of experimentation I can say that there's only 2 types of units you need, and those two units types are so insanely out of anything elses league, you're actively sabotaging yourself by spending your resources on anything else. Even so, the difficulty spike problem makes itself known here as well, though not nearly as often. Now about the actual combat in this mode, I almost forgot about it while writing this because it's so forgettable. You have your units on a grid map, you take turns moving your units and attacking, mixing in a few spells here and there. The game likes to remind you that you can position your units to block the path for enemy units, but again, in 300 hours, I've never done that. The battlefields almost never have anything but open flat ground, so there's no strategy involved in positioning your units, and even if you do try to set up some kind of strategic positioning, there's nothing stopping enemy units from just running around yours and start whacking at your more fragile backline.

Anyway, I could go on and on about how empty the mode feels, but luckily you can turn it off in the difficulty menu. Except by doing so you can't turn it back on. And it locks you out of content. For some reason.

But even so, after all this, the game is not all bad. The writing might be cheesy and predictable, but it's not bad. It does a good job setting up the world, the characters, the plot. The game makes you feel like an absolute badass, a hero or villain to save the world or let it burn. And when you get a respite from the janky and unexpected difficulty spikes, you find yourself with a frankly enormous array of options to build your character wether you want for RP or min-maxing purposes, and the game is honestly fun. The game has so much potential and there's a lot of really, REALLY good stuff in it, but unless you're prepared to either play on the baby difficulty, or min-max the hell out of it, you'll probably find the experience pretty sour as the game goes on, and it's a long, long game.

TLDR; It's buggy, it's INSANELY difficulty at the most random of times, and the crusade mode is awful, but it has a lot of really good stuff in it as well, just overshadowed by it's flaws.

Edit: After some time, most if not all major bugs are fixed and the game has been balanced out further. This, plus the whole rollback of the AppsFlyer after listening to their players and community is why I'm changing this from a negative review to a positive one. This type of behaviour from gamedevs is exceedingly rare these days and deserves to be rewarded and applauded, good job.",1652533565,1690362260,True,0,0,0.497942358255386353,0,True,False,False

This is the natural progression of gaming companies in these days and they proved they view WOTR as a liability that needs to be validated in the budget.

Budgets kill gaming because gaming is supposed to be art, not a work of a budget, and Owlcat proved which side of this they're on.

Any company that thinks sending spyware in an update on an auto-updating game clearly has management problems focused on profit more than how good their game is.

Unless you REALLY like pathfinder and want to mod the crap out of it, Solasta is based on 5e SRD and Baldur's Gate is made by Larian who made Divinity Original Sin 2 and is looking REALLY good.

This game doesn't offer much in the way of home-ruling anything so you're stuck with a few subclasses unless you add mods to make the game more like Tabletop (which is cool) but some of the functions never really seemed to carry over correctly in Vanilla.

Whole sub-classes are kinda useless. The character creation could stand to be updated to let you know that selecting the BASE class without a subclass is also an option, although there isn't much reason for that in any case that I can see.

Mods like toybox allow you to either cheat outright or add home-table rules, but it's sad to see yet another company lean on mods to add functionality that they could have added if they focused more on their art instead of MBA profiteering horseshit.


Maybe Owlcat will prove me wrong, maybe their chiefs actually know how to follow numbered lists and aren't the same as every other C-suite I've ever met while working IT.

Maybe they actually care about their game and not just the money they make, but I don't believe it right now.

...you got to have precognition anyway or ask the almighty oracle of google all 15 minutes. 

Example: hurry up, you got to save some extremist paladins - oooh, 30 hardcore damage and spell resistant gargoyles swoop in (where the game told you it wasn't possible) and attack with neg levels, stat damage (all on normal) and neg damage aoe bursts, while your buffs just affect your party and not the 12 people around that could help but are just flesh shields.
So try again with new buffs/spells, just to fail again - so other characters might help - back to the army camp.
(so immersion would call for immediate action, but i had to let it hanging for 2 days, and nevertheless save scumming as hell. only other alternative is playing some ridiculous OP character bullshit you looked up on the internet.)

Then there's the Swarms, (with the nice tutorial tip how to approach them that is just wrong.)
Since you'll meet those game-wrecking monstrosities long after you can refund the game i'll have to give a negative review, although i don't like to and i'm having fun playing.

24/07/2023 update added a tracking service that you can't opt out, hence the negative review.
... that has been removed in a couple of hours due to feedback, so balance has been restored.

So, I figured that I could write an actual review since I'm at it. At the moment I have eye issues, so I apologize from some spelling mistakes I could make.

-First thing first: it's 80-120h CRPG campaign per path. That's a lot of time, so you might not want this. I suggest using Toybox (a mod) to speed up movement, because that helps a lot.

-Plot wise the game is good, sometimes it gets worse, but overral I'd say they made a decent work with it.
At some point the story branches in several paths, some of them needs updating (and are planned, I think) because they need a rewriting, but most of them are done.

-Gameplay wise it's a turn based strategy game with the pathfinder system, so there are a lot of choices, min-maxing and whatever to be had, if you want to.
There is a real time combat mode too, but I never used it, so I cant say anything about that.
Difficulty can be adjusted with several presets plus a lot of customization. It's actually a good thing because Pathfinder is not the simplest system, so people that never played a campaign will get lost, a lot.
Another thing related to difficulty is that the campaign is a MYTHYC one, your average encounter will be demons, so they are strong, numerous and have a lot of resistances or immunities, high saving throws, ecc.., so difficulty gets worse and worse the higher you set it.

I think I'll update it in the future.",1690220608,1690269856,True,0,0,0.501442551612854004,0,True,False,False

Oh, look, an update...  25+ GB update that fixes...  the horribly abusive obviously unwarranted unwanted spyware they forced in the last patch...  Oh, and a couple of bugs that actually mattered to me.  So, with some of the fastest internet speeds in my country, I can play the game I decided to give another go before the ball and chain gets home in only...  20 minutes after she gets home.  A patch so large it dwarfs some AAA games, forced on me because they forced anti-consumer spyware on me (that's probably still on my computer without my consent, if so, Owlcat, you have some legal issues coming), and the only recourse I have now they've done this is to uninstall it.

Fun ride, but I humbly recommend any and every player demand a refund for this kind of garbage-tier behaviour.













The wonderful thing about Early Access is you get to help people iron out terrible bugs/bad ideas/broken content prior to launch.  The terrible thing about that is that sometimes one still buys a AAA game thinking that sort of thing has already happened.

When a game that spanks you this hard for making logical decisions while building characters that don't happen to work out (don't pick the wrong kind of caster with the intent of playing either an angel or lich, or you'll have earned yourself 30 hours of regret, for example, even if said class and subtype look like a perfect match for one of those, because it's probably not.), you have to hope that they don't put in place patches this late in the development cycle that, I dunno, strip walls from half their functions.  Still impermeable (unless you get stuck permanently halfway inside one), but every mob can see you through them and target you with ranged attacks and spells).

This would be fine if there wasn't so much game design that went into developing this concept known as (stop me if you've heard this one) ""ROOMS"".  The designers used this new notion to break fights into manageable pieces, by making each room a discreet sort of mini-map all of it's own, in which things like vision (with the exception of doorways, windows etc), arrows, horrific spells and suchlike are curtailed by ""WALLS"".

So, you spend a hundred and ninety hours in total learning how to ignore 2/3rds of the options you are ever presented with, because like all good 3.5 based content, knowing which options are terrible, poorly balanced or plain suicidal to even contemplate is 99/100ths of the game, and get your reasonably non-suicidal main up to the bit of the game with a huuuuuuge map and LOTS OF ROOMS, and what you're left with is being hardlocked into archery fights with people you shouldn't be capable of seeing, while being incapable of working doors until such fights have been resolved (if you're lucky enough that they don't include traps, enemies with stupid ranges, or your party relying on more than 2 characters to fight with melee weapons and thus no longer serve any function whatsoever).

It's a fine game when it's working, so long as you include never knowing if it's working and knowing what will never work and being okay with empty content that serves no legitimate purpose.  I would have liked to progress through the game today, but somehow, this long after release, all DLC's etc, one still can't expect the kind of quality assurance one expects from  non-quantum physics.  This is Schrodinger's Game, it's both a means of obtaining enjoyment and a way to make your soul cry tears of blood *at the same time*, and only opening it and loading a save will tell you which it is.",1669022127,1690267895,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

You don't get credit for backing down, I see that spiked bat and I know where you were trying to stick it so I don't forgive you for saying you'll surgically extract it tomorrow. I've bought all their games and DLC up to this point despite the problems, but Owlcat is dead to me now.

If you're very familiar with Pathfinder and how it works, you probably already own this by now, and you'll probably enjoy it (overall) much as I did. I don't think it's very helpful to give a review for people who already own the game though, so I'm going to consider this from the imagined perspective of someone who isn't very familiar with Pathfinder.

This is not a good game to learn on. The complexity of character creation would seem like the main stumbling block but isn't really a problem, you can probably come out of it with an ok character and  the premade party members that join you would probably make sure your party is decent enough to get through the prologue,.

It's around the end of the 1st chapter, or anywhere at random in the 2nd chapter, where you're going to start encountering enemies that you can only hit on a natural 20, who will resist most spells and effects, and hit hard enough to wipe your party repeatedly. As a new player you'll probably think you just don't understand the system well enough and blame yourself, think maybe you didn't grind enough, didn't optimize enough, but I'm here to tell you, it's actually Owlcat's fault. There's actually nothing you can do to make certain encounters fair because they aren't designed to be fair.

They have seeded the game with quite a few random 'skill test' (or brick wall) encounters that ignore all rules about how to build an encounter, all rules about how to build a monster, to create absolute unstoppable freakshows that your party at the level you could possibly have during that chapter should not be encountering under any circumstance. These encounters will be tied to quests, sometimes main quests, sometimes unavoidable 'random' encounters that you can't just steer away from. The only way through is to design your party from the very start to handle these cheaty enemies, but a player new to this game is going to have a hard time doing that, a player new to this system is really going to have a bad time.

It's really just quite strange. You could probably just lower the difficulty far below normal -- and you should do this for the Crusade mode, which is too simplistic to provide an interesting challenge but is happy to stall out your entire campaign just because your armies aren't strong enough -- but since the difficulty changes stats rather than reworks encounters you  won't learn much about how the game works this way, and it will probably only delay the point at which you will run into encounters that are impossible. By time you reach the midpoint of the 'Blackwater' dungeon you will know the pain of a player with a DM that just ignores the rules and wants you to suffer.

On top of that I'd say this game is a good representation of too long, too broad, which dilutes the quality of the content. This is unfortunate since there is a lot of quality content in the game, but with each chapter taking multiple days worth of hours to complete you're going to spend a lot of time on the not so quality content. It really feels like a timesink, so you have to go into it wanting a timesink, or being very enthusiastic about Pathfinder.",1661934634,1690234936,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game is saved by the ""evil"" characters which are well written and actually use their brain. You are not safe however from the sassy, wise black-woman with american accent stereotype, or the lesbian transgender couple shoved down your throat as the good guys (same as Valerie the mid being fawned over as beautiful in the previous game). 
Overall story is okay and offer a lot of possible overall slightly actually different outcomes branching that could be considered ""best"" depending on how you roleplay it.

Game mechanics : 
Absolutely garbage, and that's a consequence of using a D20+Rest system and everything being about either :
>Meta-gaming the ""test"" that you will be required to take to stack modifiers, making it gamey and tedious
>Reliant on luck, encouraging save scumming
>Either you put the difficulty to trivial or you are punished for not save-scumming metagaming.
>Witholding a lot of information about the consequence of choices, resulting in punishing players for not metagaming
>Class system is tedious, offer a lot of options but most of those are ""wrong"" choices. You'll end up theorycrafting your build in advance instead of making spot choices with the information available to you
>What works mechanically doesn't thematically, and vice versa. 
>Overall wide disconnect between game mechanics and story.


Recommendation however is to install mods such as bags of tricks/isekai class to take the piss about the world and having say, your OP character and his harem rather than playing it seriously.

Overall the game is wide but shallow, most of the play time will come from reloading/turn based ""gameplay"" (erk) if you play on higher difficulty and you are actively punished for not-metagaming. Very different from actual tactical RPG, such as the original dragon age for example. This one is closer to a very long checklist that was made for you and that you have to clickously check dialogue by dialogue, skill check save scummed by skill check save scummed, grease exploit ecounter by grease exploit ecounter.

As many other reviewers here today have mentioned, they have added no opt out 3rd party nonsense, AppsFlyer. This is as of today's update (7/24/2023 EST). Not sure but I hear a lot of noise about how it violates EU laws. May or may not be a future lawsuit, no idea, I don't live in the EU. 

If you are fine with the tracking, by all means play the game in the future. Otherwise... we might actually get refunds (however extremely unlikely) if we mass request for them!

I for one will ask for a refund. 

Not sure how this will affect the new game (Rogue Trader) or their old game (Kingmaker), but I have a feeling I will revisit Kingmaker in the near future.


------



First off, this game is proof of why Steam needs a more in depth recommendation system. My recommendation is truly ""This game will be great, eventually! But right now the bugs are very very annoying."" This game doesn't quite deserve ""Very Positive"" RIGHT NOW. In the future, once most of the major and some minor but persistent bugs are gone, then it will deserve ""Very Positive"". Also, for those who do have the game but don't know ALT + B is how you bug report in the game!!!

I am currently running a mounted combat, Cavalier Human build. I play in turn based mode almost all the time, so most of my experience, and some bug reporting and thus this review, will be from that angle.

When this game works properly, it is extremely fun. It really does feel like Pathfinder as a video game. I also own Kingmaker, it was fun.....after they smoothed out most of its problems (I STILL get the bug of not encountering Jubliost, and this was 3 months ago). But ya, this game right now is riddled and teeming with bugs. Both minor and game breaking. I know people are mad about the game being released in this sorry state, and I am a bit mad about it myself. Honestly though, this game was a kickstarter child, and I suspect (this is pure speculation) that they simply ran out of money and needed to get more to properly smooth out the bugs post release. Crappy and not the best practice, but ultimately money runs things. The other side of that coin is that this is pissing off some people who were expecting a more polished release. It makes it look like Owlcat didn't learn much from Kingmaker release, true or not.

Turn based combat, and mounted party stuff in general is a mess. Missed turns (ie the character won't/can't act), charges not working/cancelling out your turn, mounts (i play with two horses in my party) not attacking in combat while mounted in melee, suddenly not being able to loot items or use doors while some party members are mounted (have to manually select somebody on foot at these points)...the list goes on.

I have also had two game crashes with a unity engine message popping up during loading screens. Both at areas that affect others as well. 

Crusade mode, I have had two bugs. One unit just vanished, poof. Gone (dwarven shield bearers). The other was weird, after enemy units would act, sometimes the battle would just suddenly go to a loading screen, with previous casualties but not damage (as this is figured per member of a unit) being counted for the next go round. In fact I had to go with the next go round, as I couldn't even move away. Trying to move AWAY from the enemy army would just continue combat. Had to not use general special abilities to finally finish the combat.

DISCLAIMER: Now, the rest of the bugs I am going to mention I have not encountered myself but I have heard about from tons of people on the official game discord. Some I have seen picture or video of to prove them. Also, not everybody has constant bugs, but they are common enough. These include (and might contain some small ***spoilers*** for some of you)

Drezen siege area as a whole. One of my crashes was trying to start this. People are constantly filling the bug help area of the Discord server with complaints about the Drezen siege not loading, preventing progress, etc etc in a slew of ways.

Items lost, character's armor not working....lots of inventory character stuff missing, not working, etc.

Crusade mode, particularly post Drezen siege, seems to be all kinds of messed up. Armies ignoring other armies on the map is one example. Managing the crusade from Drezen seems to have lots of bugs, such as events piling up and not working, with different examples existing (one of note is the game event showing up 20 times and preventing anything from being done).

Many quest completions are apparently buggy. This seems to be more mid and late game, but I have heard a few in early game.

Mythic Paths (once u get to select one) just doesn't seem to be working properly in a lot of areas, in crusade mode or normal. I have heard Angel and Lich, in particular, are just not working in a lot of ways. 

Other various and asundry bugs, mostly game crashes and not being able to play the game for all intents and purposes, often related to some of the above issues.


EDIT: also the vanilla retraining system is garbage for voiced companions. it takes you back to the level u got them at, not level one. so you want to change that 3 level selection and not use mods and still get achievements? no dice.

[b] that's the mark of great game [/b]

if you like crpgs, even if you didn't like the other pathfinder games, you owe it to yourself to play this game. seriously. i consider this game tied with divinity original sin 2 for my favorite rpg of all time. though those two games are nothing alike.

again the characters are good. voice acting is great. the story is really engaging and the writing is stellar. not only that but the game is legitimately funny. i dunno how they manage to nail comedic timing through text boxes like that but they do. 
as far as RPGs go i could not ask for more. there are so many interactions everywhere. so much you can miss. and the sheer volume of classes, subclasses, specializations within them [b] IS INSANE [/b] not to mention the possibilities of multiclassing.

oh yeah and the OST is consistently good, with a couple of tracks that are absolutely MAGICAL. i have legit needed to stop playing more than once just to sit and appreciate the music and the moment. with more insanely good tracks i'm sure to have missed because they're path exlcusive.

speaking of paths, this game seems extremely replayable by the way but i have almost 200 hours and i haven't finished my first playthrough yet. which is crazy. even without replaying, the amount of choice and roleplaying each path provides is crazy. i know that the build that i have is ONLY possible because of the choices i made. it's also surprisingly relevant to story, companions, events etc.

mild content warning: this game contains [b] A LOT [/b] of graphic descriptions of torture. as is fitting for the setting. if you like me had no idea what this game was about before starting it, the game is about waging a holy crusade against demons. so there's a lot of dark themes. that being said it's just text boxes and the game keeps a comedic tone with it (albeit a dark one).",1679030157,1690219137,True,1,0,0.444444417953491211,1,True,False,False

-The crusade management system (for the most part) is much better than the Kingmaker equivalent.
-The mythic paths provide replayability and an enhanced sense of progression.
-You can play as a lich
-HOMM is fun.  Wasn't expecting to see it here, but fun is fun.
I disliked:
-Many of the mythic paths feel like they are incomplete, especially the secret, incredibly buggy one.  Some of the choices you can make in that path don't seem to do anything, and the power you gain is not nearly enough to compensate for losing all companions.  
-Crusade stats could use a tooltip.  I have no idea what I'm doing to raise my leadership stat, but apparently I'm not doing enough of it.
-Mariliths and Gallus could use a nerf.  In real-time mode they're not as awful, but in turn-based mode they have an unfortunate habit of taking down max-level characters in one turn, specifically the ones in Iz
-Some of the classes are straight-up useless.  You will not fare well if you choose the class that specifically kills fae and nothing else, because there is literally one fae in the entire game, and a speech check can make them harmless.
-Finally, those puzzles are just awful. Sure they're optional, but that just made it worse when I found out that the only reward I got for figuring them out was a useless item that harmed me more than it helped. (a lot like the secret mythic path, come to think of it).

Overall, this game feels unfinished.  It's fun, sure, but don't expect everything it tells you it can do to have been done well.  My advice for how to best play this game? Activate the setting that lets your companions just get up after falling in battle, pick a class that you like the sound of, and just play the game once.  It falls apart under scrutiny, but if you just go through it once, you should be able to miss most of the jank and annoying features.  Without those, it's a solid CRPG and should be a fun few dozen hours.",1690215818,1690215818,True,1,0,0.499769449234008789,0,True,False,False

The text taken verbatim from the patch notes is below for those that want to read it.

It seems Owlcat has a short memory of negative publicity earned by the RedShell spyware installed in Civilization, Vermintide and others before they were rolled back due to customer complaints. The only difference is that Redshell was silently installed but herein it is a mandatory install under a patch. If I had to guess why the patch is so large I suspect it is virtually all related to appsFlyer. Clearly Owlcat does not respect my privacy and have broken faith with me as a customer.

I am uninstalling Pathfinder until the 3rd party appsFlyer application is withdrawn. Nor will I purchase any Owlcat or META Publishing products products while they utilize this product or anything similar. I recommend others to do so as well and post their thoughts on this practice.

Verbatim (from patch notes):
We have implemented a 3rd party service named Appsflyer — an industry standard tracking solution for user acquisition for computer and mobile games. This solution allows developers and publishers to understand which part of players have purchased the game due to the impact of their advertising campaigns. It will help us to define the key metrics of the campaigns and significantly improve our marketing efforts. Though Appsflyer is fully compliant with GDPR and other data processing regulations, we needed to reflect its implementation in the game's EULA, which resulted in improvements of the paragraph 3.1 of the respective EULA.

Character building aspects are amazing. Story is not too bad, a lot of potential in companions (haven't seen it play out yet, but all in time). And absolute freedom in difficulty customization.

However, that difficulty is exactly the problem that I want to raise here. The game really forces you to min/max everything. You wanted a fun build? Haha, noob, don't you have the fifty necessary stacking buffs on your party? (and it's not quite straightforward to stack buffs, by the way, you need to know which sources add up and which don't, and then plan which source to get from what, without knowing which spells and items you will get in the future) Then you won't be able to hit these enemies with absurd armor classes that we'll just throw at you. Haha, noob, you didn't stack all of the resistance penetration? Well, then also your magic is useless against those enemies. You thought yourself clever and packed some touch attacks? Nah, this enemy has touch AC above 30, in addition to all of the above. Just git gud. And while you are not, proceed watching how your whole team needs to roll nat 20s to hit, while your frontline is literally dying one character per round to the absurd amount of attacks from the enemy that is not even a boss.

So if you come to the game without familiarity with Pathfinder, and try to build your characters on the fly (which is exactly what I liked about the game), at some point at the end of Act 2 you find out that you better go to difficulty level below Normal for these encounters. So I'm really glad that Owlcat games put those difficulty options. They still could've made a more balanced encounter design, though. Because to play on any higher difficulty, you probably should forget about the amazing character customization part of the game, and just google those min-maxed builds and run with them.",1690047877,1690047877,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It's not my favorite game of all time, but it's the game I have the most hours in outside of an MMORPG, but unfortunately it's not for everyone. It's not even for all cRPG fans.

Pros:
1) There are a staggering number of classes and sub-classes. Multi-classing is available and encouraged. Whatever you can dream can be built.
2) Massive campaign with a dizzying number of personal choices that significantly alter the way the story unfolds.
3) Supports both turn-based and non-turn based combat.
4) Excellent story with rich lore and deep, complex characters.

Cons:
1) Too much reliance on levels, especially for spellcasters. Spellcasters don't just get additional spell slots per level up, the duration of their spells is also tied to their caster level. In the early game, essential buffs like Shield of Faith and Bless only last for a couple of minutes which leads to either chain resting or slogging through combat unbuffed. By the later levels, caster levels make these spells effectively permanent.

2) Far, far too much reliance on buffs. By the end of the game, your spellcasters aren't bringing impressive nukes or crippling control spells (although they can). They're bringing primarily party buffs. The ""essential"" buff list is absurd. By level 7, you'll be casting upwards of 20+ permanent/semi-permanent buff spells and another 10+ temporary buffs in combat.

3) Noob traps are absolutely everywhere. You get a lot more out of this game by following a guide. Describing how and why there are a lot of noob traps would be a book on its own, but I'll be as brief as possible. Most sub-classes are redundant to other class/sub-class combos that do line-for-line the same thing, but significantly better. Spontaneous casters get access to magical items that teach whole spell lists to them, negating their primary disadvantage to prepared casters. Non-stacking buff categories plague the game everywhere, and some of them have similar names, but do stack like Natural Armor bonus and Natural Armor enhancement bonus. Noob traps also flood the combat system which I'll talk about in the next point.

4) Entire playstyles are presented as possible, but don't work in game. For example, starting as a lightning caster you aren't told that all demons are immune to lightning. 90% of the game is immune to poison, but poison spells, abilities, and sub-class archetypes are included. Nearly all enemies have ridiculous and impossible levels of spell resistance and saving throws, especially bosses, giving all difficult enemies two separate and independent areas with which is fully and completely ignore the abilities of your spellcasters (another reason you should use your spellcasters for the significantly stronger and more effective buff spells). There are ways around these limitations, such as Mythic Talents, but it turns the super neat Mythic Path system into a game of ""how can I get enemies to stop fully negating my build?"", rather than cool enhancements. Oh and did you know Armor is useless? Not only are the total armor class maximums significantly lower than unarmored, ""pajama"" tank counterparts, armor comes with insane movement and skill penalties that most of the classes designed to work with armor have no real method of overcoming and have the inherent weakness that actual armor doesn't add to your ""touch"" AC, meaning even when trying to use armor despite how bad it is, several enemy types ignore your armor AC anyway.

5) Mythic paths really take the role-play out of your characters. In this regard, the narrative structure of Owlcat's predecessor, Kingmaker, really stands out. Mythic paths not only determine how your campaign plays out, they have alignment restrictions which decide what kind of person your character is. What's worse, is there are insane gaps in the power scaling between Mythic paths. For example, Angel and Lich get access to unresistable nukes that are AoE, have unresistable damage types, and embed unresistable control spells. These are not just the best spellcaster Mythic paths, the Mythic spells provided are so good they make the spell lists provided from your character classes inferior in every way, aside from the essential party buff spells.

6) Difficulty scaling is absolutely broken. The base difficulty is, fortunately, easy enough that a blind run can be muddled through with some save scumming, unless the player makes some truly unfortunate build decisions. However, the game, including combat encounter structure, doesn't really come alive until you're playing on Core difficulty. Once you start optimizing, the game becomes utterly trivial after leaving Kenabres. The gap between optimal party set ups and sub-optimal ones is the gap between gods and insects. For context, it's the difference between a 30% hit rate and 95% hit rate. It's the difference between tanks with a 30% chance of being hit and a 1 in 400 chance of being hit. It's save-scumming 7 turn combat to make it through, and one-turn killing all enemies on screen. ""Unfair"" difficulty doesn't help, as all it does it make it so you need an even larger reliance on buffs to overcome the obscene armor classes of enemies and if any party member is directly hit by an enemy, they are likely downed in one hit. Any party member that doesn't have munchkin levels of armor class might as well go naked. 

Overall, WotR is an excellent, but very flawed cRPG. It has an incredible number of complex, overlapping systems that players require deep knowledge of to tackle the higher difficulties. But with that complexity comes replay-value as you master the layers and learn the system. But, just like Dwarf Fortress, it's not for everyone.",1690041585,1690041585,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Difficulty spikes ridiculously at random battles.

Enemies have ridiculously high AC and Spell Resistance, making chances to hit incredibly rare.

The Mythic paths add an interesting layer that really pushes for replays to see what is different between different playthroughs. However, it is stretched thin, with huge gulfs in-between meaningful progression.

Played a good Character so my view is from that side, You can play Evil / Neutral character but i am saving that for future play through.

Story is Phenomenal, No spoilers but a lot of oh shit moments and hard choices.

Combat is mostly what you want it to be, played on Core myself and level 1 - 14 was a awesome and well balanced when you figure everything out, at around level 15 combat becomes pretty easy and I stopped playing in turn based for the most part and could just real time everything without taking any damage, exception being bosses. 
A lot of class and build options, sadly your ""story"" companions are kinda forced into a class so it limits there customization, You can hire mercenaries that you can do whatever you want with, but I prefer having story characters in my party.
The ""crusade army"" combat was kinda fun if you like heroes of might and magic style game play, its very simplistic but if you dont like it you can disable it and have it auto complete.

There is alot of options for multiple playthroughs, there are 10 ""paths"" you can take i am not sure how much the story changes between them, but should get at least 2 playthroughs for good and evil where the differences is noticeable.

I'm going to start by saying i wish we could just have an adventure game. Just as in king maker all the extra stuff is not that fun. This is like a 12 year olds power fantasy game.  I also feel like it become bloated with excess crap. 

To get into some details of what i like and hate.  You have what is it 199 class/subclass and thats not counting super awesome magic mythic magics!!! on one hand i like options, on the other you can cut half of them and not know it. So many are just slight tweeks that make something suck a little more that hardly effects game play. 

King maker was iffy on the RNG/prebuff/meta BS but this game leans into it so much more. If had fights in the early game go as this. I stomp them or there is one guy in the group that can solo my whole party. The amount of times you run into things 2/3x your lv in the early game is a bit much. And thats even on lower difficulty. It very much feels like this game expects you to cheese spam every fight. 

This games balance is god awful, like omg.. WTF. slightly strong enemies give such a massive boost to AC. They need to give you a better difficulty adjuster rather then the large stat jumps we see and the bad guys one shot you and you cant hit them.  This is one of the most unbalanced games ive ever seen in the early game. 

Be more respectful of my time! From king maker to this i can tell you expect us to prebuff with alot and save scum in this game. Dont make things expecting me to reload a fight when it goes tits up, and it will. At first I like that the baddies did more then just spam simple sword atk, but you still set so many numbers too high.LV10 guy on my lv4 party.... it's very clear you're expecting us to ""cheese it "" and ""save scumb""

One thing that gets me about this game is the ""help"" people offer , its often  them gloating when this games less skill more RNG just saying.. or people pushing tactics that are very cheese/rng. It's like in another game i played and enjoyed a bit, people would just say, ""use the death fog barres and teleport insta kill/win"" is that..fun? its not to me. Or just keep reloading a fight untill you make the thing laugh on the ground for so long and burst it to death before he swings at you as.. every time he hits you , someone dies.  

And thats another point, if they hit you, you die. Dont make a tank no no, make a clothy dodge person, the trick is not to get hit. buff to all hell so they cant hit you. armor is for noobs! Im sick of the same people who talk about how you just need to learn the game then suggest a few mobs that fix's the game. 

Im told this game is not like pathfinder at all. IDK about that ive been wanting to play pathfinder i have the book but after this, im just gonna keep with 5e. I hated the king maker part of kingmaker but i loved the game play. This one, so far, its just poorly made/ balanced and kinda bad combat. This is not a game of skill, its a game of cheese/ abusing the system and taking advantage of cheep crap. I know that last comment is going to upset a lot of diehards out there but, oh well.

PNP mechanics can't exist in tandem with linear video games. they strive for two fundamentally different things.

XCOM has this problem too, it always ejects me out of doing another run. 

a failure in a PNP setting, table or virtual, is never actually a failure - they are opportunities for creating a narrative.

a failure in a linear video game setting is a punishment for incorrect preparation or execution - it demands instead that you do better in order to pass the trial

you can't fundamentally move on from a loss in this game, a death in the party is out 6,000 gold and two lost levels of advancement. you literally cannot tolerate that, it's a slippery slope that you ultimately can't escape from, you can only absorb so much bad luck despite it all. what do you do? well, what do you do when an alien gets a crit on your sniper?

reloading isn't fun, it breaks pacing and engagement collapses. it's the time when the podcasts turn on as you do whatever rote process got you to the spot you were at. dying in PNP creates engagement for the group as it's possible to move on. it's the time when characters shine, to seize the moment under pressure, regardless of the outcome, and come out the other end satisfied, TPK or not.

i kept playing this game for it's system agnostic qualities. i was quite enraptured by the mythic questline and roleplay aspect. the characters never grabbed me. i hear from people that being played earnestly saves them from stereotypes, i suppose i just don't operate that way. or maybe i do, that's exactly how the music worked, and the good tracks hit me like a freight train. or maybe i don't, the plot is nearly interminably generic.

Game play is very involved. it has a complex system. You need to think about things to get through it. Pathfinder is D&D on the juice. 

Story is sort of whatever. Voice acting in this is sort of bad. at the same time i wish they added 100% voice dialog because the reading is sort of heavy. I get tired of reading after a few hours. in this day in age most these games are getting a full voice over. but whatever. the game play is why this game is good. 

Music is pretty whatever. not bad not great. 

you can spend hours looking at skills and trying to make up your mind as to what to play due to the size of the options. don't think any game has this one beat in that department. the game at core difficulty is challenging but not too much. That's been the way to go for me. I want the experience to be closer to the challenge of a tabletop game. This game does a good job of that if that's what you want.

The summon was not caused by a spell but by the effect of an item and cannot be dispelled, had to sit there for a full minute until the summon disappeared.
Update 7: For a game literally called ""Pathfinder"" the pathfinding is abysmal. You click on a position and if there is a wall nearby half of your party will go around the wall, literally to other rooms. Ranged attackers halt in place once they spot a target, preventing other characters from moving past them into rooms. I have watched a character move in a half circle for 5 minutes trying to move across the screen, just to see if it would eventually change it's path. It did not.
Update 6: Why can't I target things that are climbing? Why do I have to wait for the spider enemies to get to the ground to hurt them? Why are there almost no clues given for most of the puzzles in this game?
Update 5: I'm unsure of the cause, be it translation or writing or what, but the game uses feminine-gendered pronouns for Azata regardless of the gender of your character? Kind of annoying for my cis male Azata to be referred to as she by all of his class abilities.
Update 4: At one point I'm forced into a turnbased only fight where you are supposed to have someone go click on 3 statues while infinite unlootable, non-xp giving demons are summoned. Your only clue to the ""solution"" is that you see a demon kill itself and make a statue shadowy. Literally just a crumb of an explanation is needed but none is given. 
Update 3: The AI for summoned monsters will have them ignoring threatened zones and terrain effects, running away from the enemy you summoned them next to into pits of acid quite often. Summons are so bad in this game but you are forced to use them just to have more meat shields, it's insane.
Update 2: Fear effects and spells ignore immunity because the devs did not tag various spells and abilities with the ""fear"" tag. This has been identified and reported for years and still has not been fixed.
Update: In Real-Time Mode enemies can get line of sight through walls, and shoot you, through said walls.
Going to have to give this game a negative review simply because the designers feel like doing really strange things like temporally locking out the ability to access an illusionary wall to a single mission in the game, even though you can return to the location later and see that the wall has a staircase behind it. This is not good game design. I have to add that this is the method of unlocking the Lich mythic path, a path that people learned about long before the game came out. We were told it would be ""hidden"" but this is absolutely insane, and if it were to happen in a real D&D game the players would chew the DM out. ""So I can't tell that this wall is an illusion now, with no save, but if I had checked previously I could have, again with no save."" They have tried too hard to increase replayability by simply obfuscating everything to a railroady degree. You must do everything exactly this specific way or you're going to have to slog through 500 low xp encounters with demons resistant to everything under the sun again with a new character to not miss the trigger.
I have to add to this review a little bit. The game is focused around fighting the most unfairly powerful enemies possible. Most enemies will have resistance/ immunity to most or all elements, Spell Resistance, etc. The combat is by it's very nature utterly unfair. Now, this can get frustrating at times but in a vacuum it is mostly a good thing. However there are just too many times where you get railroaded into a fight being unfair. Your characters will stand still while being surrounded by enemies during ""cut scenes."" I'm currently trying to complete a sidequest where I am unable to do anything while spamming through a dialogue tree for 10 minutes broken up by 2 fights. There are NO CHANCES TO SAVE during this. At the very end they change the order of the dialogue responses. The ""good"" option for almost all of the previous dialogues is the first option. If you continue pressing 1 for ""good guy response"" you will reply with the good guy response multiple times. Then for the VERY LAST DIALOGUE OPTION AFTER A 10 MINUTE LONG GLORIFIED CUTSCENE 1 becomes the evil option. Have fun reloading and paying attention the entire time. I have just replayed this exact scene 5 times. I just spend an HOUR trying to finish a TERRIBLY WRITTEN sidequest (seriously, it's one of the companions, and he's just the most unoriginal and boring character in the game.) Nothing about this is good storytelling or fun. I understand that when you write a video game there is a story, players can't just make up whatever they want. There is a story and they are playing it out, experiencing it. But when you write the story for such a game, you NEED to use MOTIVATIONS for the player to WANT to do these things.

All in all, the only people I can recommend this game to are the people who like combat within the Pathfinder roleplaying system. This is not a game for someone looking for an engrossing story, nor is it for someone wishing to create and play as a character of their own concept. If you do play this game you should not go in blind, you should spoil half of the game ahead of time so that you know what builds are worth playing, what pitfalls to avoid, what necessary items or interactions to engage with, etc.",1675711903,1689566370,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You see, in D&D 3.5 (which pathfinder is based on), to level up, you need around 13 encounters of the same difficulty as the party level. So a level 4 party of 4 needed 13 level 4 encounters. The difficulty of an encounter was set based on the number and level of the enemies, with a single enemy being the same level as the party being the rule. That said, for our level 4 party, a single enemy of level 4 would count as an encounter of level 4.

Following that rule ensured balance. As someone who used to DM, this was a very good balancing rule.

In this game, you play a party of 6, meaning that challenges can be a bit harder. You also have the Mythic path, allowing for even more power to your party.

However, the game has too many high level enemies spread out. This makes balancing much harder, as two levels is a big difference (D&D only has 20 levels, so yeah, 2 levels is a lot!). So, putting a level 16 boss on a 9 level party is just insane! The devs knew this, as the default difficulty is not the same as the core difficulty (which is full pathfinder rules). However, even with the nerfs that normal difficulty applies, the level gap can be too much.

As such, in some levels you'll feel like your breezing through, cutting down enemies with ease, while other times, you'll be frustrated by difficult encounters that feel overwhelmingly impossible. 

I was able to power through due to my love for D&D, but the frustration never ceases.

TLDR: Balancing issues can sour the whole experience.",1689554173,1689554173,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

-In depth story writing and character building that can be played out in a multitude of fashions for adjustable story lines (in a MAJOR way) that play to a players play style.

-A MASSIVE variety of classes and sub-classes to chose from, and even more build variety from the introduction of the Mythic leveling system. 

-A 6 member party system (greater than the typical 4 member party system) which adds additional variance in build opportunities and flavor for groups in run throughs.

-A play time of over 200 hours for an inclusive play through. For one of the 9 mythic paths. For 6 of Many possible classes and further sub classes. Meaning if you like the system and want to know what it would be like to kill everyone you  initially wanted to save and turn them into your mindless slaves- you can do that. Or a number of other amazing or atrocious things. 

-Solid combat system with option for turn based or real time. (Although it feels like it's made for turn based.) The combat can be scaled from easy to incredibly difficult and is accessible to newcomers while also providing a challenge for even CRPG or D&D experienced players. This can come in useful if you've played through the game a few times out of curiosity for different paths.)

Basically your take away from this should be that I'm an eternal nerd. And I have nearly 1600 hours in the game. (Admittedly a fair bit have been AFK, but still well over 500 actually hours played.) And if you are also an eternal nerd with a strong love for good story telling and at least a little bit of interest in video games- I'd HIGHLY suggest this masterpiece from a smaller developer. Who can argue with that kind of value for your time to money ratio?

That being said, if you are in it for amazing graphics, quick action and the narcotic like addiction of head shots and M-M-Monster Kills! This is not the game for you. 

If you like planning the decimation of your opponents, starting a cult of compassion and understanding, or just enjoy the feeling of ascending to near godliness while exploring a new world or an old world in a new way, this is absolutely a great buy.

I figure that my satisfaction is my own and the people involved in delivering the product have received their rewards; there is no need for me to proselytize for any company. I support worker's rights, unions, etc., but a game purchase has generally been a pretty discreet transaction for me.

I say this to say that I think Wrath of the Righteous is the apotheosis of the cRPG genre as it currently stands. There are things I dislike (such as the buffing), and I run into bugs from time to time, but this game is so high quality that I keep coming back for more. The only thing that has prevented me from beating the game is that after a certain point, combat feels like a hassle (which is partly related to the buffing!).

All that being said, I think the base game is absolutely worth buying. I have the DLC thanks to gift-givers, but I haven't delved into them yet, either, so I can't speak to their quality, although the rogue-like one definitely has my curiosity.

Fun game, engaging characters, occasionally poor writing (Wenduag recruitment decision is hard to rationalize), cRPG combat struggles and all, I think this game is a gem. Highly recommend, looking forward to more from the studio. Hopefully with slightly tighter writing, quicker, more engaging combat, and less damn pre-buffs.

Your characters have little chance against the RNG when its so highly stacked against them and they end up swinging about like blindfolded kids with a pinata. The first few rounds of any battle is taken up by buffing and debuffing, while your opponents swing away with 2 or three times the actions you have available.

 My mages were pointless as all demons were immune to their spell effects, its normal for them to have resistances against all energy and an immunity to at least one. couple that with immunities to mind effects and slow effects and there really isn't much point in even having mages. However, you don't have a choice as the pool of characters is pretty shallow. I find it difficult to believe this game was play tested thoroughly.

There are some really good things about it. It feels very epic. The story is compelling. The players get lots of choices in terms of roleplaying and making decisions. The music is spot on. The overworld campaign actually feels fun compared to Kingmaker. The characters and NPCs are neat.

But there are a lot of frustration too. The game balance is completely whack. Much like Kingmaker, the developers seem to have take cruel pleasure in randomly inserting completely broken and nonsensical encounters that require foreknowledge and intense metagaming to beat.

You can dumb down the difficulty, but the difference between the lowest difficulty and the next level is too vast; the balance is awful.

In an actual game of D&D, a DM who ran a game like this would soon find himself without any players. And that's why it's hard to recommend despite it's strengths. So play it. Once.",1689133637,1689133637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The text answer options are not good. The build-in right and wrong is questionable. Most of the companions are so annoying and stupid. And the worst part for me is that the only likeable and interesting char Woljif, you can not even romance. Also most chars can not have a romance with either sex.
I have been waiting since this is out for additional romances for the existing chars. 
I like the battle system that can be changed to turn based. I'm okay with the graphics although the paperdolls are super ugly. I love the option to adjust gamma, colour and contrast. Being able to make the font bigger is great. (There is a lot to read and eyes tire with that serif font.)
But this game can not catch me. I can not feel the story like back then with Planescape: Torment or Baldur's Gate1 and 2. The voices get on my nerve. Especially Camellia after 5 mins.
I'm a girl and my first char was female. So I was quite upset when the first three NPCS you meet and need to take with you are female. I'm okay with Lann but you do not meet another boy for some time. Also if I want to play a boy and romance a boy I have only one option which is ridiculous for a modern game of that seize.

I tend to talk too much about romance because the story is dull and boring and the NPCS are very generic and lame. This is not PS:T.  Unfortunately not at all.

Honestly, I preferred Kingmaker, but I think that speaks just as much to the quality of the tabletop modules as it does the video games themselves. Compared to Kingmaker, the character writing in Wrath is relatively predictable and tropey, in spite of what I consider a pretty great overarching narrative. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, mind you, I also think that the companions in BG2 were extremely tropey, but Wrath seems to lack the same subtle self-awareness and theatrical finesse that BG2 had. I just don't feel like the slightly naturalistic style of dialogue lends itself as well to fantasy settings as campy theatre - something that I feel Kingmaker did a tiny bit better. But I also have to acknowledge that this might just be a me problem.

Outside of that, the combat and enemy stat blocks are a mess, which is par for course for Owlcat at this point, I suppose. There is a lot to love, but it's punctuated by enough frustratingly bad design that it's hard to ignore.

It might be puzzling to see me still recommend it after all that, but if you take away my personal gripes, I do think that the game is... fine. A little better than fine.

3. if you want to play real time mode, make more melee characters. Spellcasters are a pain to manage. Tactical mode uses initiative values and is more true to table top, but you spend more time per fight.",1688758891,1688758891,True,38,2,0.738663852214813232,0,True,False,False

It's a big step up from its predecessor as well. Most of the rough edges from Kingmaker are filed away now and just generally improved all the way around. It boasts a better story, some interesting characters, some of the best RPG mechanics ever.

At the same time, most of the criticisms are true. The game overstays its welcome by about 50 hours, that's out of the 166 hours it took me to finish it. You probably won't be doing multiple playthroughs here unless you've got a LOT of free time. The Kingdom Management mode is the biggest culprit for padding out the time, something fans already complained about to the devs with the last game. It just completely kills the pacing and momentum of the story. At least it is very easy this time once you know what you're doing. Another problem is that the secret ending (which is by far the best ending) basically requires a walkthrough. There are also bugs, but I never encountered anything very serious.

Despite those negatives, I want to encourage people to give this game a try and keep an eye on these devs in the future. I think what they made here is superior to what Obsidian and Larian have done.

I LOVE this type of game, and there's A LOT to love in this game.

Unfortunately the obscenely unbalanced encounters make this feel like you're at work as opposed to enjoying a good story and challenge. There's some lingering UI bugs and whatnot that lead you to waste turns on misclicks (due to the cursor becoming mis-aligned with the map surface) or abilities that clearly are shown as good-to-cast simply not working because the UI decided to show you the incorrect amount of steps/distance taken and now your entire turn became 'walking'.

If you don't believe me just read up on some of the encounters online - this is the kind of game where unless you're -cheesing- you won't even be able to make it out of the introductory act.

If you enjoy speed-running or have severe obsessive disorders you're going to fall in love with this, but for most genuine tabletop roleplaying fans the faulty encounter balancing will make you fall out of love with the mechanical side of roleplaying games.

Completely different games, but I had a blast with Darksouls - punishing difficulty CAN be fun when it's done well. Unfortunately, for this game, the developers still haven't learned basic difficulty balancing. 

I'm rather excited for Baldur's Gate 3, and while I was gungho about playing this I might just drop the game altogether - there are better things in life than glitching your way through something that should be immersive just to make up for the blatantly obvious disregard a AAA studio put into playability.

Rating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)

Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous takes players on an epic and challenging adventure through a rich and immersive fantasy world. As a fan of the Pathfinder tabletop RPG, I was eager to dive into this CRPG adaptation, and I was not disappointed. With its complex narrative, tactical combat, and detailed character customization, the game offers a satisfying experience for both newcomers and veterans of the genre.

The first thing that struck me about Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous was its deep and engaging storyline. The game puts you in the shoes of a chosen hero, destined to lead a crusade against the forces of darkness. The narrative is filled with moral choices, political intrigue, and personal dilemmas, making it more than just a typical good versus evil tale. The decisions you make throughout the game have significant consequences, shaping the world around you and affecting the relationships with your companions. It's a testament to the game's writing and storytelling prowess.

Combat in Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is both challenging and rewarding. The game utilizes a tactical, real-time with pause combat system that requires careful positioning, strategic ability usage, and party management. The battles are intense and often require you to adapt your tactics based on the enemy's strengths and weaknesses. The wide range of character classes, abilities, and spells allows for diverse playstyles and encourages experimentation. However, the combat can be overwhelming at times, especially for newcomers to the genre. A more gradual learning curve or additional tutorials would have been appreciated.

Character customization is where Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous truly shines. The game offers an incredible amount of options to create your hero, from choosing their race and class to customizing their appearance and personality traits. The depth of the character creation system is remarkable, allowing you to fine-tune every aspect of your character's abilities, skills, and progression. Whether you prefer a brutish warrior, a stealthy rogue, or a powerful spellcaster, the game caters to a wide range of playstyles and encourages replayability.

The world of Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is beautifully crafted, with detailed environments, atmospheric music, and well-designed dungeons to explore. The game's graphics are not groundbreaking, but they effectively bring the world to life and provide a solid backdrop for the adventure. The voice acting is generally well done, though some characters' performances can feel a bit flat or inconsistent.

One area where the game falls slightly short is in the user interface and overall polish. While functional, the UI can be clunky and unintuitive at times, making certain tasks, such as inventory management or navigating menus, more cumbersome than they should be. Additionally, I encountered a few minor bugs and technical issues during my playthrough, though none of them were game-breaking.

Overall, Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous is an excellent CRPG that successfully captures the essence of the Pathfinder tabletop experience. Its compelling story, deep character customization, and challenging combat make for an immersive and enjoyable adventure. Despite some minor flaws, the game delivers a vast and rewarding experience that will keep RPG fans engaged for hours on end. Whether you're a fan of the Pathfinder universe or a lover of epic fantasy RPGs, this game is definitely worth checking out.",1688598282,1688598282,True,0,0,0.453474670648574829,0,True,False,False

- crusade management is half-baked and imbalanced

Wrath of the Righteous is a sequel to Kingmaker and uses the same Pathfinder 1E d20-based system. The complexity of the sequel is even higher than its predecessor - the number of sub-classes you can play is over a hundred and most of them have quite a bit of complexity to them. On top of that, the game is based on an epic adventure path involving a 100-year war against a demon invasion. To keep up, the player is given access to mythic abilities that increase their power level through the roof but also add a lot of complexity to playing. By the end, your quickbars will be filled with dozens of spell-like abilities that you will need to manage competently to survive against the rapidly scaling enemy stats. Higher difficulties require buffing before fights and min-maxing bonuses and picking the right feats, which takes time to learn so that the first playthrough can be rather rocky.
                         
The crusade management mini-game is a simplified version of Heroes of Might and Magic. Not enough time was spent tuning it, and the difficulty of it ranges from frustratingly difficult to trivial but time-consuming. The crusade mode exists to tie together the overall war against the demons and the adventures of the Knight-Commander and their party of five companions. The recruitable companions are numerous and range from dark fantasy psychopaths to quirky comedy characters, so everyone should be able to find some that they like. The plot follows the table-top action path and implements close to a dozen different endings with multiple quests being resolved in different ways, and each mythic path involves its own minibosses and quests. Even if not every plotline is equally well written and conceived, there's still hundreds of hours of replay value in this game.

The sound and graphics remain excellent, perhaps even better than in Kingmaker. The isometric view can now be rotated, which is a curse as much as it is a blessing as Owlcat went all in on environmental obstacles that now make many maps tedious to navigate and doors too easy to miss. One area of the game requires rotating to map to open up new passages, which is an interesting gimmick but gets old pretty fast. Battles in real-time feel fast-paced and visceral whereas turn-based mode is more strategic.

You can do that. And Owlcat bent over backwards to make sure it fits into their overarching narrative. It’s ridiculous.

Put in windowed mode and used borderless windowed gaming to correct it.
Character creation is on first look, just a bunch of pictures… fairly disappointing. But it gets so much worse.

Two of the rogue options are just, brute force… I want sneaky sneaky shooty with bow sometimes, picky locky. Not brute force. If I wanted brute force I’d play a warrior.
I can’t choose assassin, because I don’t have the stats for it…
IT’S NOT EVEN DONE STATS YET!

Later, when you do stats, you cannot go back and choose a class that you wanted to choose in the first place. Absolutely bewildering.

There comes a Deity choice later in the character creation. You can choose atheism. Good. Screw the gods.

Yuck, Alignment, one of the worst things ever put into an RP setting.
Alignment should change day by day, it shouldn’e be a thing you choose on creation, that’s very silly. But I guess I’ll go chaotic neutral, least likely to get in the way of a rogue.

Capes clip through tails, great.
The tattoo option is empty.
Why do you choose portrait before you choose character appearance?
Character creation is actually terrible.
There seems to be a second character creation, one for some random human… What even is this? (I figured this out, I chose the fox person race, they have a racial that turns them into a human... seems useless.)

Ah, good, first person to speak uses the portrait I was -going- to choose… Good thing I didn’t.

Honestly, this was my first impression of the game, I wrote things down in the order I saw them. I've put in a few extra notes here, but this is what you'll see.
When choose feats, expect to read a lot.
The character creation starts with some random pictures, that don't match the character you create in the slightest, I guess the idea is to then make a character that matches the picture, but it would make a lot more sense either the other way round, or just to have your portrait be your character. (That's the best option, that one.)
Kinda like in Dragon Age. You don't choose a random picture of a dwarf, elf or human, then make your character. Your portrait is a zoomed in picture of your characters face.

This is, without a doubt, the worst character creation I've seen in years.
You have a few faces to choose from, preset faces. can't touch them up at all. The models look abysmal. 

Honestly, I didn't get much into the game after this. The character creation was so disappointing, that no matter how good the game is, it's going to be very hard to make up for this.

I have played through 3 times, twice I stopped when I reach a darkness enemy near the end of chapter 3 with an obscene power level (ie. it has 51 armor class on normal difficulty), and once I tried continuing into chapter 4, which was a mistake.

The first 3 chapters of the game are entertaining, it's fun managing the crusade and making decisions. The crusade management is great, although even after all this time there are still game crashing bugs in the combat, for example you cannot kill an enemy unit that has summoned another unit, until you have killed the summoned unit; if you do the game will freeze and you'll have to alt-f4 and load an autosave. There is one caveat to chapter 3, however, there is one quest area that has overtuned enemies to a ridiculous degree. I learned how bad it was on my first playthrough and I intentionally skipped it on the next two, but if you don't know how bad it is you'll probably stumble into it and be in for a bad time.

Chapter 4 has you travelling through the worst designed level I have ever had the misfortune of playing in a game. Even while trying to follow a guide I couldn't find out what to do or where I needed to go in order to actually go where I wanted, there were huge sections of the city that I just didn't find, despite looking at a guide and knowing where they should be on the map; couldn't get there. Chapter 4 has you wandering around aimlessly, it's not interesting, just annoying, and I just can't bring myself to try and play through it again.

I recommend the game for the first 3 chapters, it's quite entertaining, a 7-8 out of 10, and it's only that low because there are a lot of parts that have too many fights in a row and it can get tedious, and the game is still a little buggy.

The bugs are egregious in this game, which is somewhat understandable given its scope, but the ones which have the biggest impact on gameplay never seem to get fixed.

+ The characters I'd met so far seemed semi-interesting, at least.
+ A lot of options to tweak gameplay to one's liking.

- Words cannot express how clunky combat and animations feel. Non-intuitive and flavourless. 
- Just simply moving in this game is a literal nightmare, it feels sluggish and bugged, as I have to click multiple times to even trigger it sometimes.
- For a game whose story I heard was pretty good, I was cringing all throughout the intro. Most of that might've been because of the atrocious animations, though the fact that I could check every single RPG opening trope 30 minutes in (important character introduced only to die in the next few minutes, demon invasion, PC turning out to be 'the special saviour',...).
- Actions aren't explained properly and if I didn't already know at least D&D 5E rules I would probably be *very* lost.
- Even when I knew what actions I could take, I have no idea how to do what it is I wanna do. I simply don't. I went to use a feat, tried right-clicking, nothing, left-clicking, it lit up, and... nothing else? That was it? Is it working now? Who the hell knows.
- Absolutely no tooltips whatsoever. That is awful in a top-down game.
- Picked up some armor, went to compare it to my current one, and there were no automatic stat comparisons? Same goes for weapons?

At this point, I gave up. I was bombarded with disappointment after disappointment and cannot in my right mind recommend this overpriced demo of a game.

This game made me mad for the first 20 hours of gameplay. It is normal for me to play and replay intros to test out my characters, builds and etc. I did it a bit less here because the introduction is absolute fucking horse shit, it is one of the most painful things i've had to endure in a CRPG. It is long, has little freedom of movement and hides you away from 95% of the fucking game.

Now, there are 2 introductions, the actual real one, which is like the tutorial, and the first act, where you need to invade the Gray Garrison.
The tutorial is sort of fine. it's not as painful as the entirety of the act one. Let me get to that.

The first act basically locks you inside a city of the game, one that you don't even scratch after finish it. It gives you a lot of quests that hinders you off the actual main objective, which is not clear. Here's some soft spoilers.
To finish the act one you need to go to the market and finish some scounting, go back to your safe-house and fight about 30 FUCKING MINUTES OF ENEMY WAVES THAT YOU CANNOT PROGRESS UNLESS YOU SKILL SPECIFIC FUCKING ENEMIES...
Something the game, obviously, does not tell you, and caused me to be stuck in it for over 2 hours, in which i died once since my characters are not demigods with infinite resources.
Once you do that, you have to find a random ass guy in a library, then show him a random dagger THAT YOU CAN FUCKING SELL so that you can progress through the main quest, but not before you find a thiefling in the market square that you rescue and he tells you how to find the hidden entrance to the Gray Garrison. The game does not make this obvious, nor does it help you at all at doing this, seeing as i did eventually found the thiefling, and got stuck in the act for over 10 hours because i forgot i had sold the FUCKING DAGGER that was NECESSARY to progress in the game.
Mind you that the dagger is expensive to buy back, so you can add a couple hours of pure grinding to your schedule if you are low on money, since this is the initial area.

This game is a bitch. I like to play games on the ""core"" difficulty and this game made me pissed, because half the problems it threw at me were unfair. Not normal, nor hard, UNFAIR.
By act 2 almost everysingle enemy is a higher level than you, all of them have high stats, and most use spells and tactics that you cannot really counter. Like going invisible and spamming summon monster, or undead creatures spamming inflict mass wounds (Which heals them and deals AoE damage).
It got better once i got a party of 6, unique characters, which i forced myself to cheat to get, because the higher your level is, the more expensive it is to buy theses characters, to the point it can take hours to grab a single one. So fuck you for wanting to play your own way, with your own characters. Instead, watch the game force their characters down you throat and expecting you like them after the game spat on your face for over 15 hours by this point.

Once i got the party of 6, the game turned into more of a fair play, and i actually started to enjoy it more, even if the unfair problems never went away.
The game throws you level 20 bosses, that attack 6 times and 2 attacks being enough to kill or heavily injury one of your characters, aswell as making your spellcasters USELESS, since pathfinder uses 1d20+spellcaster level and compare to the spell defense of theses enemies. It normally works, but level 20 motherfuckers have 31 spell defense, so fuck the 4 spellcasters i have in my party, the 2 of them who have healing spells can be half-useful, but the other 2 who only have offensive? Yeah, they are meat-shields, *WHEN* the boss decides to actually hit them.
Mind you, i was about 1 level higher than expected (Did i mentioned i spent over 20 hours more than necessary in act 1?), and my spellcasters all had Spell penetration feat, and some with greater spell penetration.

I lost it when i had to fight about 3 bosses, back-to-back, at the end of act 2, and the game knows how unfair this is because it is the only time it allows you to rest without you gaining curse.
Why in the fuck am i fighting level 20 enemies when i'm only 2/5th into the fucking game? On normal difficulty by now (I could no play this game on core, it was making me insane).

Now for actual meaningful spoilers.
The story is also a bitch. I loved kingmaker's story, how soothing it was and how it allows you to be free while also still making you interested in what it wanted to actually tell, sometimes.
In here, i feel like the story just exists. I have no reason why i wanna enjoy the characters, because everything else is making me pissed that i wanna bitch back and play the game my own way, which pisses me off even more.
They are not bad, this is just how the game makes me feel.
99% of this game is combat, 0.9% is stupid lore and 0.1% is the characters and their dialogues, which are actually mad great, specially the ideas for things like traps (I'll get to it) enemies set for you.

Now, the problem with the gameplay other than combat.
Exploring here makes you feel punished. Sure, demons are keen and they can lay out some very nice traps, now enjoy EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. CHEST. with anything actually useful in them being guarded by high level (level 15+) enemies or have traps that forces you into combat.
I liked to explore so that i could AVOID combat, and make it easier, but everytime i do so the games forces me to fight.
The single-handedly ONLY situation where this was clever was when the game was punishing you for getting VERY GOOD loot by exposing that everytime you do, your troops are closer and closer to dying. You know? Good game design? Atleast they nailed this situation with that.

The fact that Stauton is a brain-rot, and so it seems like everyone else who spoke to him.
Appearently 70 years serving your country does not make people excuse betrayal? Sure, gnomes, dwarves and elves all live a good fucking while. Assuming they did NOT die, and that they managed to spread that he was a traitor for 70 years, and that he suffered for theses 70 years to the point that then, and only THEN, did he decided to betray the Queen again... You know, because he was ""punished"" for betraying her already. My guy, Stauton is a FUCKING cleric (His sheet says so, when you fight him, which is something you cannot avoid), he should have high wisdom and will, can he not fucking learn that betraying the empire AGAIN will only make the rest of his life worse?
I've seen depressive people think more clearly than that, and you wouldn't expect depressive people to have high will, quite the countrary.
You could argue he was being charmed by the demons, but it does not seem so, he was very defiant of them. He just wanted to die and did not have the fucking guts to kill him himself, so now you have to do it bEcAuSe yOu'Re tHe mAin ChAraCter and because the game does not let you convince the sucker otherwise. You have to kill his brother, you have to kill him...
OK, i guess i am fighting against suicide by killing people instead. Lovely. Something very great for my Neutral good character. I am sure a good person would not get depressed after being indirectly forced to kill someone who was just depressed, because the lore of the world is an ass and because someone thought it was REALISTIC to have people shun you for 70 years of good service, just because you betrayed them once.
It's not like it COULDN'T work, they just did not get this to work.

I see the combat, i see the gameplay, i see the unfairness this game is placing before me, i look at all that and i remember that i'm playing a game, and suddenly it doesn't matter.

Now as controversial as this may sound, i am still compelled to play this game, out of rage or pity. I do actually see potential in this, and appearently most of my problems will be ""fixed"" by act 3, which is where i am now.

Instead you're supposed to cast ""Protection from Evil"" because that makes your party immune against mind control, which is stated in the TTRPG but nowhere in the videogame.

The Story is alright (could be a lot better, but for the Fantasy RPG standard it's solid enough, i guess), Graphics neat, the gameplay would be interesting but there's just so many inconsistencies between the Tabletop and the adaptation and a lot of other annoying bugs, that seriously just suck any fun out of it sometimes.

In terms of strategy, pods in dungeons don't usually require different strategies to fight. If you get wiped in a fight, the answer is usually to just buff your boys more pre-fight.

The game allows switching between real-time and turn-based, but real-time is almost suicide on harder difficulties. Which just means painstakingly clearing 10-20 similar-difficulty mob pods before getting to a boss. This is what I mean by tedious but not fun. 

I have to admit character building / RP potential is great, and there is clearly a lot of love given to storyline. It does almost feel the gameplay itself is a B-roll while the story plays out.

I have been glued to Guild Wars 2 for the past few months. During that time, I didn't bother to touch any other game until my brother introduced me to Pathfinder: WotR. When you start, you will probably be thinking to yourself, ""Well, it's a start. I guess they will make me roam around town first and pick up my teammates before I run off."" And then suddenly, as you were just enjoying the festival, BOOM! Some crazy shit happens, your jaw probably drops to the floor, you're forced to make your first real major choice, and then that's when your adventure REALLY begins!

And things only get better from there. Seriously, the writing is incredible, and I love the attention to detail. The game starts strong, and remains strong all throughout. Almost every choice matters; things that happen in the first chapter could bite you in the ass in the last. As for the companions, they are all amazing in their own way. I got so attached to mine, that I called my team ""The Brotherhood"", because they were all like brothers (plus Seelah!).

Have I ever mentioned how great the art and music are? I really love the music especially. The Azata's theme is my favorite...totally not biased or anything...

I don't want to say too much about this game so you can experience it for yourself. However, before you start, there ARE a few things I recommend following to get the best experience:
● Turn off Crusade Mode before you start (enable Auto Crusade in settings). A lot of people think this feature actually bogs down the game for them, but thankfully, you can just turn it off! Poof, gone, problem solved.
● There is no shame in looking up guides for the puzzles (I mainly stuck with the wiki). A lot of them don't have hints. Unless you're a nerd and you wanna solve it, be my guess, but I always hate puzzles in my games.
● There is also no shame in lowering the difficulty if things get unfair, and you're ready to just progress. It's a CRPG: of course it will have its unfair moments.
● Don't skip out on your companion quests. Not only are the companions so well written and charming, their stories will tie in together at the end.
● Apparently some people hate Nenio right off the bat and try to kill her? Don't be one of those people. She has the coolest companion quest out of everyone in my opinion (once you get past the puzzles, of course).
● Don't download the DLC. They barely have anything to do with your main character, which is honestly a shame.

Anyway, I hope that everyone who reads this will enjoy the game as much as I did! Thank you, Owlcat, for one of my most favorite gaming experiences of all time!

+The story is engaging. I like it.

+The choices you can make are pretty fun. I liked the option selection given in most of the situations.

+The branching paths this game offers are quite crazy(in positive way). I love it.
In many games, choices the player makes don't actually impact the game whole lot, and when it does - often it's only something visible in the end, at the game-ending-screen, different dialog there and there. Here you have different NPCs, different quests, different dialogs, units, music.

Something I discovered when I played trough the game for a second time, it seemes each ""mythic path""(a crossroads of sorts at certain[early] point in the game) that the player can choose at some point, has its own campaign. Some are longer, have more to them, some are much shorter, but the gist of it is - each has their own part of campaign! That's really cool!

+Characters are pretty cool. I initially didn't liked most of them, felt like they were just... shallow and/or stereotypical. But over time, grew to like them, at least some of them.

+Music is good, personally - I really liked it. Climatic.

+The voice acting is good.

+Graphics are alright.

+Spells and their animations are pretty cool.

+You can swap the visual reprezentation of the armor you wear into another one. Very cool feature. In case you like the look of one armor more, but statistics of another - you can change it as you like. Very nice.

+The choices for the class as well as the possible combinations - mixes/hybrid builds. It can be a tad overwhelming, especially for a beginner in this gentre, but for one, there are some premade builds, and there are tips/tutorials online. And once the player is more experienced, or they feel like looking trough it all right off the bet - there you go, there are choices to be made and combinations to think of, enjoy.



Cons:
-Constant ability damage/negative levels.
At least in my opinion, it's just really annoying. Curses, diseases - that's understandable and not that annoying to deal with. But that? Just an annoyance, requiring extra repeated action from the player, extra repeated spell casting on each party member, over and over, again and again, troughout the entire game. Not to mention it makes some enemies like a bunch of ticks more lethal than demons... annoying and stupid!

-I don't like ""crusade battles"" aspect of the game much. I can see what developers invisioned here, and I like the idea, but don't like the execution very much. ( Especially since many of enemy units can and will stunlock yours )

-Loading simulator.
Loading and loading again. Literally half the game you are playing it, and another half you are waiting for that load bar to fill up. I get it, it can't be avoided sometimes, but I played many tittles, and it was never as big of an issue as it is here.
And some of those loads could have been easily avoided. For an example, why load a map that's really tiny... (which doesn't load fast), if practically all it has is an entrance to another location - a cave or something like that? (Which upon entering, ALSO has to load.)
Not to mention that when it's time to leave, you exit one, you have to wait for the 'outside entrance' to load, and then have to exit that tiny 'outside' area, and have another loading to the map. Why? Adding extra layer of loading. And if you have to backtrack to such location multiple times? Oh boy...
Not to mention that whenever you travel, you meet 'random fights' which are usually very tiny and trival, and it forces loading of the battle area, and then the worldmap again. Loading being longer than the fight itself. Either make those encounters more rare and challenging, or delete them entirely. At least that's what I think.

-Animations speed. You [b]really[/b] should be allowed to change it, increase it, make characters run trough the world much faster if you're not in a fight. Cast spells faster - not spend so long waiting for animations to play out when character casts buffs on others, or needs to cast many, many healing spells on the team... over, and over, and over again, troughout the entire game. It's just eating so much time unnecesarily.

-Optimalization. I played many games, many with comparable graphics if not better, on highest settings, and it was playing very well. The FPS was high, there were no issues. Here it works well... if I put it on the lowest settings, and it still ocassionally, regularly stutters.

-Very ironically, pathfinding is sometimes really... not working properly. I found myself clicking on some containers or levers, or simply from point A to point B, and the characters sometimes were either getting stuck(dancing back and forth, or shimmering in-place, needing extra input to get to the destination), or instead of pressing the lever that was literally 5 centimeters away from them, were going all the way around something to press it then.

-Whenever someone's revived, for some reason, before you can select it, you have to wait... sometimes 10, sometimes 30 seconds. As if the character and all the effects on it had to buffer before you're able to click on them and make them do things. (or make them a target for healing). I don't know if it's a bug or an oversight.

-There's not very much character customization or character illustrations. And why is hair selection so limited to a race and gender? Everyone's head is in the same place and has very simillar shape. I believe it would be very easy to copy-paste the same exact hair to all the races giving them only a small tweak. Same for allowing any skintone color. If player wants, why not?

-Numerous bugs. (But I saw developers are actively fixing them)

PS: Just a small wish. Would be cool if character that followed demon path, once fully transformed, looked exactly/almost exactly like he does on the picture. Make the player that followed that path really feel just how far their transformation has gone. If not look exactly like it, then at least make visible claws on hands&feet, along with long(longer) tail behind, face/mouth more balor-like. In my opinion, that's a pretty cool idea. That, and make the 'demon forms' duration permanent, require to use the 'turn back' ability to turn back.

- The [b] music & voice acting [/b] (especially the voice acting) is phenomenal. The VAs lean 100% into their roles without coming off as comical or cheesy. It does miracles for the immersion and truly endears you to the characters.
- The [b] companions [/b] and their writing are, overall, excellent. This factor highly subjective (more so than most other game aspects) but outside of one or two companions I couldn't really care for (looking at you, Sosiel) they are fresh, interesting, and their companion questlines are weaved seamlessly into the overall game. They really feel like they're along for the ride with you for their own reasons & motivations, rather than just a tag-along RPG party like so many other games. Minor details like camp banter and reacting to enemies & events while you're going through your CRPG dialogue branches do wonders toward making them feel fleshed out & alive.
- The [b] tone [/b] is perfect for a fantasy tabletop CRPG. The writing makes the grand moments grand, the humorous moments lighthearted and humorous (without being self-debasing or self-referential ""marvel-movie humor"") and you can really feel the care that went into fully realizing the world & setting.
- The [b] gameplay [/b] is extremely close to tabletop Pathfinder experience, and can be played turn-based for hard fights, or real time with pause for fodder fights. Enemy variety is solid and, just like tabletop, there are a million ways to break the game in overpowered & fun ways. Difficulty is highly customizable, allowing complete freedom of choice when it comes to playing for powergaming brutal combat encounters vs playing for the adventuring experience.
- The [b] freedom of choice [/b] is ridiculous. Astounding amount of classes, playstyles, sidequests, and mythic paths allow for a high degree of replayability, although the game doesn't open up in a massive way until a dozen hours in or so.

[b] The Take it or Leave it: [/b]
- The [b] main story [/b] itself is not particularly worthy of note outside of being a very serviceable vessel for a dozen or so very different branching mythic storylines, depending on your choices with where you want to take your character (Angel, Demon, Lich, etc. etc.). It's solid, but takes a back seat compared to the true star of the show, which is that aforementioned branching freedom.
- The [b] campaign map & crusade management [/b] are great for making your crusade truly feel like a cohesive, working entity pushing the demons back, but it can take away from the adventuring since you have to go back and micromanage it at relatively often intervals. Thankfully, it can be adjusted to be easier/quicker or just automated entirely. It's cool that the crusade can provide you with benefits and items for your adventuring & vice versa though, and that makes it all feel integrated fairly well.

[b] The Bad [/b]:
- The [b] campaign/crusade army combat [/b] is like Heroes of Might & Magic but highly simplified and uninteresting. Usually the fight is won by whoever blasts the enemy troops with an aoe spell first. This never really changes. Thankfully, you can just deathstack and if you're big enough, the enemies will run (this is considered an auto-win for you) so it can be over quickly.
- The [b] city/outpost management [/b] is likewise uninteresting. Each building gives you a minor passive bonus to your crusade armies etc., but since that system is dull too this feels unimportant & like a chore. Fortunately it doesn't take up much time. You usually just dump several income/recruitment generating buildings down and forget about the outpost.

Overall, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and Pathfinder WotR is absolutely an easy recommend for anyone who's looking for a CRPG, a tabletop experience, or as a person's first step into the genre. I'm big into immersion & fantasy escapism, and I was blown away by multiple moments throughout my playthrough.  The characters & experiences I had will stay with me for a good, long while (Woljif has insanely good voice acting, Regill is the most based gnome in existence, Camellia is insane in the funniest way, and tfw no Arueshelae gf).

10/10, highly recommended. If you want a complex high fantasy gameplay experience with a high degree of freedom to dive into & truly feel like you're living an adventure along with fleshed out companions, this is it.",1687939979,1687939979,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It is in many ways an improvement to Pathfinder: Kingmaker... but even more than its predecessor it isa  hard son of a b**ch. If you don't know what you're doing... if you're still learning the deepness of the systems and are used to more mainstream-titles like Dragon Age inquisition...  then this is like THE ultimate challenge. 

First of: forget real-time-combat! This games works sooooooo much better with turn-based on. But even then the challenge still remains... the challenge of overcoming armor class and spell resistance. 
Sigh... i am so torn about the combat. So often it feels like ""is this spell even worth the try or am i wasting my turn?"". This is the first time for me to start appreciating 4th edition of D&D... cause there is something like ""overcomplex""... and WotR scratches the limit. 
Yeah, i get it, i DO get it - dice roll, chances and all... but IF a spell  -MAGIC, which is by its definition something that overrules reality- doesn't do what it's description says... then why does this spell exist? If it is so easy to withstand it, then it is simply superfluous. Any form of crowd-control barely works... that is on the enemies. But the other way round it so much different... and that is when a game starts to feel ""unfair"".
When you need spell penetration, mighty spell penetration, legendary spell penetration AND use the school of your proficiency to  even slightly hope to do something... then clearly something isn't balanced for non-veterans of the rule-system. 

Yes, i know what pros would comment now: press ""y"" and look at the sheet, study your opponent'S attribute and skills... and while i do understand and agree on that when it comes to higher mobs or bosses BUT... if i gotta do that for regular or random encounters to be victorious without burning through ressources... then that does not make me feel getting stronger or better. And it does not make me wanna learn it makes combat feel tedious. 
But at the same time lowering the difficulty too far makes it soo easy it is boring. Some prestige classes are plain useless, others are op.

And still, i love the story, the setting, the characters, the writing, little changes (like being able to cancel ones own spells),the customisation, the idea of legendary paths with their own quests and storylines (even though i will most likely never see all the evil ones - like lich or swarm - since i detest playing evil). 

All in all i can't help but love the game... but it IS one hell of a frustrating experience at times.",1687897195,1687897195,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

""Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous"" presents itself as an opus of digital ingenuity, an exquisite tapestry woven with intricate details and profound narratives. The sheer depth and complexity of this interactive tableau is reminiscent of the great works of the Renaissance, where art transcended mere aesthetics to tell stories of heroism, struggle, and redemption.

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous beckons the beholder with its vibrant palette of visuals. Like a meticulously crafted fresco, every element comes to life with a rich and vivid display of colors. From the ethereal glow of celestial beings to the haunting darkness of infernal landscapes, the game paints a world that is simultaneously breathtaking and foreboding. The attention to detail in the depiction of architecture, costumes, and atmospheric effects showcases the mastery of the digital brush, drawing the observer deeper into the visual realm.

Much like the great frescoes adorning the walls of renowned cathedrals, this interactive masterpiece boasts an epic narrative that unfolds with each stroke of the player's agency. Embarking on a heroic journey, the player assumes the role of a champion, navigating a tumultuous tapestry of moral choices, alliances, and personal growth. The storyline, akin to the allegorical narratives of Renaissance art, explores themes of good versus evil, divine intervention, and the eternal struggle for righteousness. It is a symphony of storytelling that resonates with the human spirit.

Just as Renaissance artists experimented with various techniques, the game's mechanics showcase an amalgamation of traditional and innovative gameplay. The strategic combat, reminiscent of a tactical composition, requires deft maneuvering and thoughtful decision-making. The intricately designed character progression system grants players the ability to shape their heroes in a way that mirrors the uniqueness of individual artistic styles. Whether one embraces the path of a valiant knight or an enigmatic sorcerer, the game provides a rich tapestry of choices.

Hidden within the layers of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous lies a treasure trove of cultural references and literary allusions. It is as if the game itself becomes a visual representation of the Renaissance era, paying homage to the great minds and artistic visions of the time. From the subtly placed symbols to the nuanced dialogues, the experience feels akin to a guided tour through a gallery of hidden knowledge.

In summary, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous stands as a virtual masterpiece that, like Renaissance art, defies categorization and celebrates the boundless creativity of the human spirit. It seamlessly blends captivating visuals, a profound narrative, and engaging gameplay to create an interactive canvas that leaves a lasting impression on the beholder. Should you embark on this digital pilgrimage, prepare to be enveloped in a world that transcends the boundaries of mere entertainment, offering an experience akin to traversing the halls of a Renaissance art gallery.",1631150862,1687831982,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I originally pirated this one after having played Kingmaker on the Epic store, and it is the only game I've bought after downloading (and finishing) the cracked version of. For the record I haven't done that even with D0S2.
Unparalleled build complexity, though it does disregard some of the tabletop's details in this field.
Writing is, in my opinion, a step down from Kingmaker but it's better than some of it's peers.(Divinity Original Sin 2 comes to mind)

Combat feels fun with great impact to blows and highly customisable difficulty, you can even switch between turn-based and real-time, a feature that should become standard for other games of this genre.

Another standout feature is the inclusion of mythic paths. These paths empower players, granting them incredible abilities and allowing them to shape the narrative and game-play experience to suit their character.

This is a Pathfinder simulator first and a video game second.

Suggestions:
1) Play on Normal
2) Use a guide for your build and keep in handy. In fact, use all the resources you can. Mortismal is king. 
3) Play in Turn-Based so you can start learning the mechanics. It's slow but it helps a lot.
4) This game is all trial and error. Give it some time. Get a full party and level up a little. 
5) Don't be mad about save scumming, Be glad you finally made it through the encounter.

It throws you in the deep-end almost immediately and for the first 10 hours I was just trying to figure out how I was gonna heal. The in-game encyclopedia is actually pretty thorough but when they give you a two paragraph definition of a mechanic and it's full of hyperlinks to other mechanics you're not familiar with it can be beyond daunting. The basics will start clicking after reading them over and over WHILE PLAYING. Don't hop on a wiki and think you can learn all of these incredibly deep systems before you start because then you never will. This first play-through will probably take me over 100 hours and maybe then I'll almost know what I'm doing.  And that's the real challenge: the time-sink.

As your venture begins, you stumble across a lone enemy of moderate strength and limited ability.  Your mage quickly casts sleep, rendering the opponent unconscious and collapsing it to the floor. 

Your finest archer nocks his cold iron arrows to deliver the finishing blow- the shot narrowly misses.
Your warrior charges the unconscious mass to end his tyranny- the blow narrowly misses.
Your rogue sneaks up behind the incapacitated demon and makes two giant thrusts with dueling daggers- both narrowly miss.
Your animal companion charges and attempts 4 bone crushing biting attacks- all narrowly missing.
Your sorcerer equips their crossbow - since this demon is immune to all spells and fires a blessed bolt - and narrowly misses.

The next round of combat ensues.... as the parody of trained assassins flail futilely with their weapons, the sleep spell starts to wear off. But then a miracle happens - the ranger tries a shot -amazingly, with his eyes OPEN- and finally connects - 1 damage.

The demon is now fully revived and massacres your entire party over the course of about 8 turns while your team of intrepid warriors swing wildly at thin air. 

The game is F*&$ing stupid.... there is so much good, but the battle mechanics are the worst imaginable. Literally 90% of the game is ""a swing and miss"".... against every opponent, even sleeping ones.... and this is on NORMAL difficulty.... I mean holy crap! In my last battle against one opponent, I counted 26 misses. 

And you would think- they would have a setting to just lower AC but Noooo. It's not the game is difficult, it's just dumb- In what world would any group of warriors fail to hit a lone opponent 26 times?! An opponent who was sleeping for multiple turns!! 

And yes, one of my companions did have a high percent chance to miss, but only one, and that was because her spells were not effective against this enemy- so her 100% miss rate can be excused I guess (Nenio).  But my ranger was buffed, with precise shot, my paladin was buffed with a good-aligned weapon.... this was not a build issue.  

The whole game has been just an uncanny amount of missed attack attempts which means an uncanny amount of TIME WASTED.  In many fights even the opponent will miss 60-70% of attacks- I mean wtf?! Make more hits with lower damage- something! anything! This is shameful.

Just play any of the divinity games because the combat system in this game makes it more frustrating than fun and for me- totally spoils immersion. Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss, Miss.... Just dumb. For God's sake- maybe for drunk archers.... but paladins and rogues missing?!?!  every shot?!?! Gimme a break.",1687508889,1687508889,False,10,2,0.555787742137908936,6,True,False,False

- Bugs!!
- Obtuse design (UI for both exploration and campaign mode is not very intuitive)
- 360 camera view causes SO MANY ISSUES. You click in one spot, your team goes to another. Keep that in mind when you reach locations with multiple traps around.
- Pacing issues: locations and encounters often overstay their welcome. At times the game tries to build up tension, but then it throws 5-6 encounters and corridors full of traps that make everything grind to a halt.
- Lots of encounters where enemies straight up break the rules of the system (instant perma buffs, skills they shouldn't be able to have, inflated stats). It feels more like a homebrew D20 game than Pathfinder.
- Many of the in-game locations look really generic and uninspired, which is again, a consequence of the scale being way too big, and Owlcat not being able to add a personal touch to everything.
- The particular RNG engine used has a tendency towards multiple low/high rolls in a row. It's random enough in big groupings, but can feel really frustating and unfair at times (it's as bad for enemies though, if that makes it any better).

Overall, it feels like Owlcat has not learned from their past mistakes. Monster stats are completely rewritten again - yay for enemies with 70AC, 10+ attacks dealing 100+ dmg per hit, with 30+ magic resistance and immunity to most negative statuses. And no, that's not an exaggaration.
You HAVE TO play around with the difficulty settings to make it work in any sort of way, otherwise it's just reloading until you get the right rolls.

The story is fine, but making the stakes so high hurt the relatability A LOT. Companions are EXTRA quirky this time, they're not bad however, and probably the highlight of the game overall.
On the good side - it looks better, there's more and nicer cutscenes, more biomes and an insane amount of possible builds to try.

Owlcat adapts one of the messiest RPG systems in what ultimately feels like a fairly faithful adaptation. 

If you've ever played the TTRPG, Pathfinder has too many options and mechanics and is overly complex. It leads to virtually every action and mechanic being ""See rule X in book Y"". 

Owlcat circumvents all the nonsense of referencing 35 books just to play the game and goes ahead and handles all that for you. 

Pro: Cool RPG choices with narrative that lets you pick your particular power fantasy. Can be a pretty good romp overall if you don't take it too overly serious. 

Con: Stays relatively faithful to the source material to the point that some abilities are near identical to RAW but function differently.

Now you might think that as long as you spot enemies from distance, you will be able to prepare for them... Allow me to explain why that is wrong: The game spawns enemies right on top of you VERY often.

Now take all that into consideration and add this small, insignificant bit of information: THAT was normal difficulty. You do NOT get achievements on normal difficulty.

With over 200 hours invested in my first playthrough, where I took on the role of a lawful good angel slayer, I can confidently say that this game is a masterpiece of epic proportions.

From the moment I stepped foot into the war-torn Worldwound, I was enthralled by the rich and immersive storytelling. The game's narrative is masterfully crafted, full of moral choices, and filled with complex characters that constantly challenged my perception of good and evil. As an angelic slayer, I felt an incredible sense of duty and righteousness, leading the charge against the demonic hordes and striving to restore balance to the realm.

The level of customization available in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is staggering. The character creation system offers an array of choices, allowing me to finely tune my angelic slayer to suit my playstyle. Whether it was choosing feats, spells, or skills, every decision I made felt meaningful and had a tangible impact on the outcome of battles and interactions.

Speaking of battles, the combat in this game is exhilarating. The tactical depth and strategic options available make each encounter a thrilling experience. As a slayer, I had access to a wide variety of devastating abilities and powerful divine spells, enabling me to smite demons with righteous fury. The enemy AI is challenging, ensuring that victory requires careful planning and precise execution.

What truly sets Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous apart is its attention to detail in world-building. The environments are beautifully rendered, with diverse landscapes that immerse you in the war-torn realm. The lore is rich and extensive, drawing from the Pathfinder tabletop universe, and every corner of the game world is filled with unique quests, hidden treasures, and engaging encounters.

Furthermore, the companions in this game are some of the most memorable I've encountered in any RPG. Each companion has a deep backstory and a unique personality that evolves as you progress through the game. The interactions with them are meaningful and have a profound impact on the narrative. Building relationships and making tough decisions alongside my companions added a layer of emotional depth to the game that left a lasting impression.

The developers have also demonstrated a commendable commitment to improving the game. Regular updates and patches have addressed issues and added new content, enhancing the overall experience. The community surrounding the game is vibrant and supportive, further elevating the enjoyment of the game through shared experiences and discussions. The game has some bugs, but the devs are actively patching it as soon as the users report them.

In conclusion, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an extraordinary RPG that has consumed over 200 hours of my life in a single playthrough. It offers a captivating story, deep character customization, intense combat, and a meticulously crafted world filled with lore and intriguing quests. If you're a fan of immersive, morally complex RPGs, this game is an absolute must-play.

The premise of battling demons in an RPG setting seemed promising, but the game falls short when it comes to allowing players to explore their character alignments in the game universe.

One of the major drawbacks is the requirement to obey women leaders throughout the game, regardless of whether their values align with your character's alignment. This limitation particularly affects Neutral Evil characters, who would naturally be inclined to prioritize gaining power and wealth from defeating the demons as their rivals. Unfortunately, such options are not adequately presented, as all other choices, including the Queen, seem inconsequential and uninteresting.

It's apparent that the development team may have faced budget constraints, as creating a true branching story with pathfinder alignment choices can be quite costly. However, the allocation of resources seems to have been skewed towards promoting diversity based on macroeconomic principles, which has resulted in an unbalanced representation of character demographics. The excessive prevalence of gay and female characters feels forced and not reflective of a realistic game universe, and it may come across as an unnecessary political statement.

While it's possible that the DLC offers more content and depth, I personally hesitate to invest more money in a game that seemingly promotes a political agenda that I disagree with. As I progress through the rest of the game, it becomes increasingly apparent that it lacks the essence of a traditional RPG and instead feels like a vehicle for left-wing ideological indoctrination disguised as a demon-themed narrative.

In contrast, I recall running a Rifts Dyval campaign in the past, where I allowed my players the freedom to make their own choices based on their selected alignments, without imposing my personal religious beliefs on the story. This flexibility is fundamental to the nature of a game, distinguishing it from a cult.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of pathfinder mechanics and are unconcerned with post-modernism and subpar storytelling, this game might still be worth your time. However, if you are an older player who finds left-wing politics unappealing, I would recommend avoiding this title.",1687016074,1687016074,False,5,3,0.422218352556228638,0,True,False,False

I originally played Kingmaker and something about it just didn't grab me, but from about an hour in to this one i was hooked.
My playtime currently is from one play-through and it's a great story spanning multiple chapters, really interesting side characters and in depth lore.
I love most of the companions and NPC's, and the writers at Owlcat are great at throwing in situations where there's not always a right answer, which I feel really helps in the decisions you make.
Had some frustrations with some combat mechanics, but mostly the controls fighting me or the game not working when it should - these were fairly minor issues that i learned to work around. It also feels like the spellcasters aren't overly useful unless you spec them into one specific job, which took some of the fun out of playing with the spellcaster builds.

My biggest issue is the crashes - both in this game and kingmaker my PC would crash fairly regularly, and occasionally just the game would crash, but it happened a lot over my playtime - never in combat thankfully (And never at the same point twice) so i never lost much progress, but I definitely recommend quick saving very frequently!

I'm in two minds regarding certain important parts of the game being miss-able with no way to rectify, on one hand I love that you have to live with your decisions and wouldn't change that for most of the story beats and companion quests, but [spoiler] missing the Lexicon of paradox pt 2 and not being able to go back an retrieve it was frustrating and locks you out of an ending despite there being no real reason I couldn't go back to the Abyss [/spoiler]. 

I didn't engage too much with the crusade battles and would highly recommend modding them to make them easier or auto-winning them as it allowed me to crack on with the story and the normal combat that i loved!

It isn’t the ocean of battles you’ll fight against demons. It’s creating characters and their progression. The sheer complexity and depth to it is the only strong element of the game. This strength is the lampshade that hopes you’ll ignore, overlook, or just accept all the other flaws that keep the game from being good. 

Rather than go down an exhaustive list of problems with the game, I’ve devoted a majority of my criticism towards the most ubiquitous gameplay element, combat.

A lot of folks who praise the game laud it for the combat. I disagree entirely. Combat in CRPGs are often a blend of two things, preparation and tactics. Preparations are the decisions you make and resources you muster before fights. Tactics are how you make use of your preparation. The spice to shakeup gameplay is randomness. Randomness can be somewhat structured, like a restriction on tactics via what items you can, can’t, or have to use, party members, spells, features etc. A less structured but more persistent element of randomness is chance. The d20 system, where the success or failure of something occurring happens based on the roll of the dice, is used to add tension and make things not entirely assured. In Wrath of the Righteous the spice is all front loaded to where you’ll spend a huge chunk of time managing the spice to make your character build viable in the long term while your foes will be so bland you wonder why they even roll dice. The game doesn’t blend preparation and tactics; the game is nine parts preparation and one part tactics. The preparation to put it very simply is all in service of the tactic of overwhelming force. 

Difficulty settings aren’t what you’d expect. Encounters barely follow any progression. Instead they vacillate between throwing waves of bodies at you or an incredibly powerful creature. On lower difficulties most enemies will be ineffective and you can ignore everything except the boss. Fights will be grindy and feel very unimportant and the biggest risk you run is being impatient and using higher level spell slots or limited per-day features to make the encounter end faster. 

In stark contrast, harder difficulties aren’t fights so much as rehearsals. You either already know what’s going to happen or you’re quick saving and loading. The fights are so finely tuned, or better described as unforgiving, that there’s very little room for experimentation or mistakes. Minions and big bad? You’ve either killed the minion on the first turn or you’re restarting the fight. The minions have an annoying ability that you don’t build around countering because you are supposed to kill them fast. The numbers on enemies such as health, difficulty class, armor class,and saving throws are ratcheted so far a character's abilities are either specifically built to specialize against them or ineffective. There is no in between. You’ll realize you need immunities to a half dozen conditions, the demons you’re fighting should only have a one in twenty chance of hitting you, and that you should avoid a laundry list of spells/abilities/weapons because their damage types are useless. 

All these factors make it feel like the game is punishing you for leaving anything to chance. It’s not simply better to know the kinds of foes you’ll fight, it’s a requirement to know what you will fight. If rehearsing these fights were fun, maybe it wouldn’t bother me so much. 

If you want non combat related reason I disliked the game, 

The plot is bad. 
Every other character is poorly written. 
Even for the well written characters you’ll find their start and ending strong. The middle story for characters seems to meander almost like they’re waiting on plot points to hit rather than progress naturally. 
Alignment choices feel dumb. Especially if you err towards the side of evil; twirl a mustache and be evil for evil's sake evil. 
Bad tooltips. There will be floating modifiers and conditions without descriptions. You’ll forget what stacks and what doesn’t if you’re not innately familiar with Pathfinder 1st edition. Even worse there will be tooltips that refer to other tooltips. So looking at their description will tell you to look at another description.
The crusade system. The system feels tacked on and is very poorly implemented. 
Bugs galore (still). 
Pathing. Watch your characters struggle to get past a door. I wish that was an element they didn’t transfer over from the tabletop system. 
Inventory bloat. You’ll carry so much crap around with you. 99% of it will be useless but there will be rare instances of non-quest items being technically quest items. Best go find them or repurchase them.
Annoying story flags. Do you want this kind of ending or interaction? Like combat, you should have learned beforehand what to say and when. This wouldn’t be so annoying if the roleplaying choices you made telegraphed what happened and there weren’t some that were just missable. Did you talk to Bob twice? Well you did, but didn’t do it while camping and once more after you scaled mount ‘who-gives-a-damn’. So you’re locked out of this part and he’ll die or leave by Act Z. 

If you're curious, this a reappraisal of the game around two years later. I've left my original review below for posterity. I put 57 hours into my reappraisal and stopped halfway through the game because it felt like a chore. Even after giving up on getting a few achievements and installing the toybox mod for quality of life improvements, the game is still too much of a slough. 


I've put 117 hours into this game and I can't recommend it in it's current state. Game is probably one of best TTRPG to CRPG transitions out there, but that doesn't make up for sheer linty of bugs. There has not been a patch (6 as of this review) where I haven't encountered a bug they listed. Great they have a in-game bug report feature, sad that I'm encountering so many.  

Besides characters clipping into the ground, dialogue skips, missing tool tips, or just missing abilities entirely. The big thing that really made me frown was when I encountered a bug about 25 hours in that made me reset my entire run. Yes my entire run. It broke my main character and I couldn't level them further. Ok, no big deal lets start another run where I'm wiser and know how to better build my character. Then another bug comes up...

The straw that broke the camels back? Geared up for a big confrontation at the garrison in Kenabres (don't worry no spoilers), this is just a several hours into the early game. When I tell the commander that I'm ready to fight, brief in game cinematic plays of my party entering, immediately skips to the last encounter before the boss fight. If I hadn't played through that point in the game, I would have been a little confused but may have missed it. I try to back track because I want the story elements (conversations with NPCs had dialogue options that may or not be important), I want the exp, and I want to loot. Even on normal difficulty you don't want to pass up gold, gear, or experience because combat is always getting harder. Go backwards, find that there is a door that requires a key that can only be acquired while fighting your way through the garrison. 

I search for fixes, it says I have to go back to a point in the game BEFORE I did all the side and main quests to when I was first in the garrison because I sped through one dialogue tree that can cause a flag not to trigger, where it will trigger when you visit it again and just skip you ahead on your second visit to the garrison. Note that I sped through some dialogue, because I was not aware that I had to move slowly through the dialogue as to not break the game.  

This is just too much. Give this game a year. A solid year before you pick this up. I wish I did. Go play Kingmaker, the first game, or another CRPG.",1633663260,1686965611,False,4,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,False

There is a lot to like here, or even love, but there are so many little issues and a few truly massive ones that it just wasn't able to outrun its faults.

There are a number of ideas or goals the game had that were in theory brilliant, and in execution, less so.  For starters, the length.  This is a long, long game, and as far as dollar/hour of entertainment, that is high.  I bought it at $40 and while I just missed a sale, I don't feel cheated at all.  The flip side of this is that the game wears out its welcome.  This is compounded by the main antagonist force of the game, demons, being about 80% or more of what you face.  Compare this to something like BG2, where the Underdark alone has a variety of enemy types to contend with. And there are other foes, but most of what you find is either demons or their worshippers.

My favorite part of the game was the crusade management, which felt like a better-implemented if simpler version than the Inquisition management from the Dragon Age Inquisition game.  You make decisions regarding different events and choose which decrees you will issue, driving what your crusade is focusing on.  The downside to this mode is that it is cumbersome, feels a little underbaked (especially in the unit portraits, which feels like it could have come out of a pre-2000 game), and takes a while before it felt like it settled in.  

Now, allow me to regale you of the horror that is act IV.  Act IV is my least favorite CRPG map, ever. Worse, it's such an interesting concept.  The map shifts and changes as you rotate the camera around.  Sounds like it could be fun, right?  Wrong, it is the worst.  The whole act is bouncing back and forth across a city that is constantly shifting on you.  Eventually teleport points open up but even then, it's not an interesting part of the game.  This is a frustration for other areas as well.  Areas where I'm sure they were designing as ""labyrinthine"" turned out ""merely annoying to traverse."" With the notable exception of Act IV, which elevated to ""mind-numbingly infuriating to traverse.""

And the puzzles!  Just...pull up a guide.  There are apparently environmental clues but I didn't find the lore interesting enough to try. 

The only bad thing I'll say about character creation is, for those uninitiated into the PF/DND space, there will be a daunting level of choice.  As a longtime veteran, I was happy to see that I could make a mystic theurge lich.  Character options abound, and it was nice to see my particular chosen path of Lich was full of interesting choices, even if some of the major selling points such as having a cadre of undead cohorts ended up being a seriously uninteresting bunch.  

For replayability, if you like this game, you'll have a deep, deep well to draw from for hundreds of hours.  Your mythic path shoots the story in different directions, and maybe one day I'll give it a go again, but having to sit through another 100+ hours for a replay seems unnecessarily daunting.  Some sort of replay editor to make major choices and start closer to Act III would be great.  And...maybe skip IV completely?  Something to just check the major decisions.  The game will have these skill challenges every now and then which turn the game into a choose your own adventure.  Obviously content they didn't have time or inclination to actually make into the game and instead left a sort of storyboard version present.  There's a mansion in Act IV especially that makes me think it was in mind for actual content and they just ran out of time.

Oh, and I can't think of playing this without the Toybox mod.  There are a number of accessibility features here, but Toybox brings it up to a more playable state.

Did I hate it?  No.  It's a great showcase of the depth of character options in the PF system, and they are all competently presented in CRPG form. But if I could go back in time, I would advise myself to rethink this purchase, mostly because it stumbles more than it stands tall.",1686774844,1686774844,False,107,9,0.710584819316864014,0,True,False,False

Let's start with the best thing about the game. The RP part of RPG. This game lets you have incredible agency as a player, perhaps more than any other game I have played. You can rp pretty much any character you want, almost every conversation there is a way to approach it that would fit whatever character you have in mind. From always looking to do the right thing to trying to being a sneaky profiteer. There are many conversations even with an option like ""[Evil] [Attack] I don't like you!"" I've seen many people complain when they play rpgs that they can't just kill someone they don't like and just for that reason but that won't be an issue most of the time here. Even your character himself can be customized deeply with class selection(s) and a custom portrait. This player agency is by far the strongest aspect of the game. The only issue with this really is that some paths are not as well written or feel lacking. In some places there is not as much depth simply because they had to already write multiple outcomes.

So what's the worst part of the game? Unfortunately combat and its mechanics are flawed. The wide net of possibilities in character building lead to balance issues, for and against you. Even in the same area you will encounter wild difficulty spikes, going from demolishing everything in your path effortlessly to requiring multiple retries just to barely survive an encounter. Enemies are made tough by stacking them with insanely high Armor Class (affecting your chance to hit them) and spell resistance, as well as abilities that weaken your characters with crowd control or stat damage. Most irritatingly is that luck itself plays a significant role in combat and when it doesn't go your way you really feel it. The game will tell you what roll an attack had to make to hit, so seeing your main martial dps roll less than a 6 five times in a row feels really bad when the margin for error in a tough combat is often extremely small. Then again a boss can roll a 1 to resist a sleep spell then they roll another 1 against your martial using coup de grace on them so a boss dies instantly in one round despite having multiple layers of defense (high ac, concealment, mirror images, etc). Because of the player agency it's impossible to know you're in a bad situation until you're already dead. Typically bosses  go down easy but a random encounter on the map will feel impossible. Quicksave, quicksave, quicksave.

I think part of the problem is that you can switch between turn based and real time with pause game modes on the fly. Owlcat tried to balance having both of these modes available at all times but I think it really takes away from the game because now neither of them feel like the ""right"" way to play as some encounters are easier with one than the other. This also limits their ability to design encounters leading to many of them feeling the same. I have adopted a strategy where I will start a battle in real time making all my martials charge in then switch to turn based to manage abilities.

While the combat is based on pathfinder, it's not literally pathfinder. Knowledge of that system will help you understand mechanics but it won't carry you through the game. For one thing number bloat is outrageous in comparison, but there are also mechanical differences such as undead are not immune to sneak attacks. 

Graphics, sound, and music are all very well done. There are some concessions made of course. Like the textbox describes someone being dragged but the game shows them walking with the person dragging them, but this is a matter of just using your imagination like you would actually playing pathfinder.

On a matter of personal preference, I am not a fan of the world in which pathfinder takes place. It doesn't feel grounded a lot of the time, despite being well fleshed out. If you're like me and prefer settings with low magic the sheer wackiness of some events will take you aback. It's not as bad as it could be but it's certainly there. However this is definitely a matter of personal preference and generally the main story has a smooth enough raising of stakes that it feels natural.

In short the game is a great RPG. The story and freedom are almost unmatched, the playtime is insane as even at 69 hours I'm not convinced I've hit the halfway point. However unless you are the type of person who LOVES to min/max games you will likely find combat actually detracts from the experience a lot of the time. Even following builds posted online you will still struggle and have to retry combat through no fault of your own. If you're primarily interested in just experiencing the story I recommend playing a lower difficulty. I started on daring because I'm very familiar with pathfinder but had to move it down over time as combat became too frustrating to be fun.",1686748215,1686748215,True,2,1,0.499527156352996826,0,True,False,False

However, the game is held back by a bevy of technical problems and quality of life issues which detract from the experience. Given the insane time investment CRPGs demand, I don't know if I would recommend this when there are other, more polished competitors on the market... not to mention the possibility of actually playing the tabletop game version, which I would recommend as superior. However, if you're willing to look past its flaws, it's a perfectly good game.

STORY
Without spoilers, the game follows a player designed character and the NPCs they recruit along the way on an epic quest to save the world from demons. As an RPG, there's plenty of options for how one can play the story out, even though at first glance it seems obviously tailored towards good vs. evil. It's a diverse, wide, and fairly interesting story, but I don't think it stands toe-to-toe with any of the greats. The game's cast of party members also wildly range between somewhat interesting and story relevant to bizarrely uninvolved. Ultimately, while above average, I wouldn't write home about it. 7/10

GAMEPLAY
CRPG in the vein of ye olde Baldur's Gate and the like, based on Pathfinder 1st Edition ruleset, so familiarity with the TRPG can be of some value. The player manages their character's (and optionally the party's) statistics and equipment, slowly building their strength over time. There's a tremendous number of classes, class combinations, and items in the game, providing a huge amount of customizability and variation. The game can be played in real-time or turn-by-turn, giving players plenty of options. However, the game is VERY complicated and is often inadequately explained. Furthermore, the game suffers from just enough technical and QOL issues to be noticeable. Examples I personally experienced included faulty detection of valid Charge paths, touch healing spells sometimes doing nothing and locking the character out of spells, difficulty positioning characters and spells due to cursor snapping despite disabling it in options, and archer characters targeting enemies not visible in fog of war. Nothing here is gamebreaking, but there's enough here to turn a positive experience into a mixed one. 7/10.

LOOKS
More or less equivalent to its predecessor, Kingmaker. Environments and effects are impressive at times, but character models are merely adequate, which isn't a huge issue given that they are rarely seen close up. Illustrations and character portraits are excellent and can be supplemented with the player's own imports in case any of the preset offerings don't match what they have in mind. It's just a shame it doesn't look like any kind of improvement. 8/10

VALUE
An older game which is perennially on sale, and disgusting amounts of replayability due to the huge amount of character customization and branching storylines available. I imagine it might take months upon months to fully experience everything this game has to offer. 10/10.

VERDICT
32/40, 8/10. Pretty good, and like all CRPGs you could practically play this one game forever if it really captures your attention. But it's competing in a crowded field. Older offerings like Planescape Torment and Neverwinter Nights do more with less and offer way more modding capability to boot. Newer offerings like Divinity I and II are more polished. Most unfortunately, against these juggernauts, Wrath of the Righteous' serviceable storyline and cast look lackluster by comparison. But don't get me wrong: it's a good game.",1686696532,1686696532,True,1,0,0.507727563381195068,0,True,False,False

It screws EVERYTHING up in this game. One character cast but didn't apply it to the intended character. The party SLEPT!! You know, where you reset the spells you can cast for the next day??? In the next battle, the beklopte Tussi was still trying to apply the curative spell. I ended up healing my enemy, because I thought that the people who programmed this were sober when they did so. They clearly were not. You cannot finish casting, bzw apply, a spell some 12 hours later, and AFTER YOU HAVE SLEPT. You lose the intended spell.

Also, sober people move to the target, THEN CAST THE SPELL.

Beyond that, the character creation is good. The voice acting is annoying, with the over-emphasized US accents, and having to listen to the same line every time they attack. I'll have to see if that can be adjusted. Even way back in Baldur's Gate I, you were able to adjust the frequency of the character feedback or response to commands. Not all of the voices are annoying; but man some of them really are, for me.

The combat balance is mental. Really completely mental. Now, I don't claim to be the best at fights in a game, because I am far from a power-gamer. I should not have to be one to enjoy a game. This game seems to have two major modes: Stupidly hard and suddenly easy. Even if I turn this down to casual, I'm getting my butt kicked only ever-so-slightly less than on the normal setting, then BAM!! My archer, for example, lands a crit and the thing is suddenly dead. The most boring part of the game is how often your characters cannot hit the broad-side of a barn. IF the opponents were properly balanced for the party level, that would not be a thing. If the devs don't understand what I mean, I recommend that they play Baldur's Gate I or II, NeverWinter Nights I, Morrowind, Oblivion, or Skyrim, Planescape: Torment, or any number of old games. Just don't play IceWind Dale. The balance in it was also off.

If the spell system were corrected, I could shut-off those annoying voices, and the fights were more properly balanced so to reflect the rule-sets, so that you FEEL the difference between them (and yes, I gave-up and tweaked them myself), then this would be a pretty good game.",1661442638,1686692287,False,2,4,0.425000011920928955,0,True,False,False

Positives: Character creation is nice with plenty of classes and races. Most all the computer companions that join your party are actually written well. Very few are annoying (except Lann...moody bitch). Dungeons and environments are made well enough to set a vibe for the setting, but don't expect Divinity or Balder's Gate 3 levels of detail. Game is fun and being able to customize the difficulty on the go makes it a lot less frustrating. Being able to switch between real-time with pause and turn-based is a great feature I hope developers keep adding to their games.

The negatives: the entire crusade mini-game system.
Feels completely separated from the core game, is tedious to a fault, and just not fun the vast majority of the time. Particularly pre-Drezen. It isn't that it is hard, but instead that it just takes up so much time for little reward. Time away from your party and dungeons. In the options, it does give you the choice to automate it. Don't do this! You miss out on a ton of gear and content. Not only that, but automated-crusade mode takes more waiting around than just doing it yourself. Genuinely bad.
---
To truly enjoy the game and save yourself from the crusade-mode, I recommend at least one mod: Toybox. My main reason is that I got tired of the not fun crusade campaign taking up hours of my playtime. The mod let's you check one box and every enemy army now goes straight to fleeing. Even with that though, crusade-mode still manages to be tedious at times for exploring. Toybox also lets you respec your computer companions to level one, rather than only back to what ever level they were when you met (otherwise in vanilla, when you respec a companion you met at level 10, it only lets you respec that character starting from level 10, not ever level 1).
(If you are curious about mods, one spot is nexusmods. com. Search the game, sort mods by most popular or top download and probably find Toybox in the first spot. It'll link you to the Unity Mod Manager in the requirements tab. Download that and run it. After that, all you have to do is drag the zip file for the Toybox (or other mod) on to it and it does the rest for you. Really just drag and drop. Really simple modding. Can find hundreds of new portraits for your characters on nexusmods too if you want more customization than just the 40 or so the game gives you).
---

In conclusion, it's a fun game that you can make as unfairly brutal or relaxed as you want. Gameplay is great and I've yet to experience any bugs in 197 hours. I'd give it a 10/10 score, but it's 9/10 because of the crusade mini-game being 1/3 of the game at times.",1686541261,1686541261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Much like Kingmaker, 70% or so of the fun is all in making characters, not necessarily in playing the actual story. It would have been nice if better options for playing a true neutral or atheist were given in the story. Why does whatever power I have have to come from a god, let alone a specific one? There's some decent flavor text thrown in here or there to keep the game from being unbearable to those who want an atheist play through, but it could have been better. Another minor downside is the prologue. They should have made a skip option where you just answer some questions to say what you would have done, give you xp commensurate to what you would have gotten, and then wake up in camp, or at least in the Defender's Heart.

Last gripe is for when trying to play a baddie. Like, why do I have to help get people out from under a rock at all? Anevia is an anchor anyways with how she hobbles along behind you so you have no chance to use stealth on mobs.

CONS:

-The first group of three DLC's are just crappy cash grabs, but this isn't a review of the DLC's, it's a review of the base game. The newest DLC doesn't seem AS bad, but I still haven't wasted my money on any DLC.

-They refused to implement simple QoL features, making the game unplayable without mods, which they also refuse to let us do through Steam so it's an annoyance and a hassle to even play this damn game. I don't know what the point of playing Pathfinder in a video game is if I don't get the conveniences of a computer doing simple menial tasks for me?

-It's also annoying that every mythic path is tied to a certain class, and to min-max the story you want you have to pick a class you might not like.

-Minor spoiler: one of the companion characters leaves you mid-way through the game for no reason.

-Act 5 is a borefest and should have been BEFORE Act 4, or just left out entirely. The game is way too long and just drags on. All the good stories end and you're just left with fluff put in to make the game longer. You play for hours endlessly not having fun anymore and then question why you're still playing.

-The companions don't even have much dialogue after the first act or two, and the little dialogue they do have is no longer voice acted.

-Parts of the game are also timed...and that's an annoyance, especially in a game that I play as turn-based.

-Patches frequently add new bugs to the game.

PROS:

-Bugs are generally fixed pretty quickly.

-Mods make the game more playable, even though they're a hassle to implement (and you must often wait until they are fixed after patches before you can use them).

-The party system is pretty fun.

-The combat is pretty fun as long as you're not on too easy of a difficulty.

-I really like the King's Bounty-esque ""Crusade Mode"", even if other people don't. :P

-The story is AMAZING...it just seems to drag on too long and I wish companions had more to say after Act 2.

-Lots of replay value, with a ton of different mythic paths, difficulty levels, companions you can use, and classes to try out. But mainly the mythic paths.",1657607547,1686466054,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However if I put it on auto, there will still be so many areas of the map (such as the area to access companion storylines) that I cannot get to.

I really really love that I thought I am not going to like this game, but after persevering, I really appreciate the love put into making it. The voice acting is wonderful. The storytelling (I have not finished the game) is wonderful. The gameplay is wonderfu....ok...soo.

I do have some unfulfilled desires with the game that I am questioning if it's just too greedy on my part. This is meant to let whoever starts playing, ""I hear you...but just try to keep at it, it'll be really enjoyable later"".

The number one thing that I struggled with when I was researching the game whether I should buy it or not is...

The theatrics of this game's mechanics visually is...hard to enjoy/follow. RPGs/fantasy games to me are heavily about the battle ""performance""...how you look when you cast the spells, how the spells look like, how the characters perform the actions...the mythical creatures, the ""Fantasy"". 

This game has beautiful graphics and character/creatures designs...however! 
I think the layout of everything is a tad too small, (except the character portraits lol).  The spells/effects have smooth visual effects, but not dramatic enough is the word I have for it. Lots of colored particles but no ""iconic in your face but well integrated"" looking effects. Like when I recall playing the game I mainly think of the voice acting involved in casting things or giving commands to characters, not the visuals. The menu also took a while to digest, all the information on it..and I don't know if I like the pale background.

Speaking of information, as a ""tabletop"" naive player (I have never heard the term till I decided to play this game), the game had a lot of ""terms"" that I had to decide ok.... I literally got so fatigued just on the first scene of the game, and revisited that scene so many times trying to figure out will I truly ever understand how to play this game. It takes a while to ""translate"" the terms into things that typically describe these stats. And again something about the text layouts is a tad too ""small"" and hard to pin down. I got there though - I think!

I decided I'll just follow a guide on an archetype of a class that roughly I'd like to play blindly...just tell me where to put the points and I'll just autoattack stuff till I understand. The typical words used to describe stats in rpgs, are worded in ways that are hard to understand for sure. Which is ok..not a problem I enjoy the learning of an rpg system, and I enjoy a game trying to be complex rather than dumb down things which is what I love about this game for sure. The game feels like it's so rich with choices and tons of spells and stats to understand and play around.

But...ultimately..there's something about the mechanics of the game that I feel reduces you to have to rely on  basically overwhelming the odds with tons of ""auto-attacks"". This is kinda spoilerish, but the game at least for now, has a high amount of ""miss"" going on (luckily even your enemies have the same problem), and also the spell casting initially feels so limited - for my taste (It'll get much better later), that you just feel like I better build around spamming tons of auto-attacks, and buffing your heavy attackers (as buffs don't miss lol - gulp), and peppering things that prevents your auto-attacks from missing. 

Maybe as I understand the game much better things will change. But this definitely, is a huge point of ""awww what a shame"" cause basically all the complexity I was looking forward to with the spells...is sort of gone. And again the theatrics of the spells is kind of lacklustre and feels like the animations happens too fast, even if you turn on the turn based mode, which further takes away the drive towards learning spells. I always play spell caster heavy things in these kinda games, even if it is not ""the best"", and like to mess around with enemies ""playing with your food through spells"" situation, but I just felt with this game it's not that satisfying...again maybe as I get seasoned things will change (but I don't think it will lol).

The game is very enjoyable though strategy wise, and I have learned to enjoy the real time mode, which when I was researching the game, when I watched other players playing it found very questionable if I am going to enjoy these random pauses playing it my self?. 

Cause as a naive viewer, I found it off-putting it's like watching a movie and and clicking pause every few seconds you know? but when you are playing your self it's actually enjoyable it's like playing  rts/rpg game hybrid at a click of a button which funny enough warcraft/final fantasy is what I mainly grew up on so lol. 

It is very engaging, and enjoyable. Which is why I ranted so much about the spells, cause it's like literally the one thing that would've prevented me from text walling and just say LOVE for a review.

Anyways...I am sorry....LOL....overall ZERO regrets I love the game and all the passion that you can definitely feel was put into it!.",1686333274,1686333700,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game has some issues, of course. The way the Pathfinder system is implemented may be confusing for newcomers, especially with all the different classes to choose from, and the crusade management system (which I did enjoy, weirdly enough) and abundance of things to do and to explore don't help lessen the overall complexity. And many of the puzzles can't be figured out without a lot of trial and error.

Anyone who's familiar with the Pathfinder system (or a fan of D&D) and who enjoys cRPGs is sure to have a blast playing this game.

_____________________
I'll start with the things which are good:
- Character design is awesome. Companions are charismatic, most of them won't leave you indiffent (which is good). Voicing and dialogues are of a very high level craftsmanship. Some personal questlines are quite interesting (~30% of them). Your team is also very re-arrangable in playstyle and builds. this part of the game is done perfectly
- Plot. It is good, it has some twists, it is very nice to follow and it has different playhroughs with numerous forks. In terms of plot the game is re-playable.
- Classes and archetypes variety (nothing to add, owlcat are making some content here)
- More items which are not flat stats (itemisations and builds are more interesting than in Kingmaker)
 Let's list the things which are spoiling the game now:
- Wrong DnD Pathfinder rules implementations mady by owlcat (Mindaffecting abilities like fear or shaken can affect mind-immune creatures; Mage armor stacks with the barding on pets while it shouldn't; Some multiclasses allow you to add Chararcteristic bonus twice to the same place; Some enhancement bonuses are stacking, when they should not)
- Horrible Crusade mechanic is added to the game. It gives you no pleasure, nor tactical thinking (nothing like HoMM experience), it's just a time-consuming part of game which requires very boring and straightforward grind. It was a nice attempt to make something interesting, but implementation just eats hours of your time and gives you zero pleasure
- Disbalanced plot distribution. Most of the important choices are piled up in the ending part of the game (after 50-90 hours of gameplay depending on a difficulty), which makes re-playing this game ways less plausible as you would have wanted to. You have to grind through endless fights again and again from lvl1 to lvl 14, before you can make some important storyline choices. 
- Too much dungeon crawl. You have more encounters then you had at Kingmaker. WAY MORE. Even if you are building something very combat-effective the amount of fights is just draining lifeforce from you. I wish we had more different and EXP-rewarding quests, instead we have got quests giving us same amount of experience as 2-3 of average encounters, and you will have HUNDREDS of them. Despite I liked the game it required too much combat-labour to play through. While conquering Dresen fortress you will have about 50 of them in a single location and each of them requires step-based mode to play if you are playing on Pathfinder Core Cules difficulty. And then you have to re-conquer it...
- Difficulty. Your party gets overgeared by strong and awesome equipment and your enemy is balanced to be way too stronger than CR you would have expected. The game is doable, fights are winnable, but you will press F5-F8 too many times, because of situations like ""Oh enemy have casted 8 heavy controls in one turn and my party have failed initiative/save check/attack roll"" that is a GG, reload the fight. Also you have to apply all the buffs possible to be effective in combat and it becomes boring to do... If I had less encounters it would be sustainable, but applying Heroism to each one of my party members by personal clicks, than doing the same with Deathward, then with Shield of faith... e.t.c. Full party buff after you rest requires about 2-4 min each time, and you have to do it about 100-150 times over the game, or even more if you play it on higher levels of difficulties and save/load a lot. And there is not a single gameplay template to do it automatically, it's just annoying repeatable event you can't avoid.
- Looting. Seriously, some important things might be literally everywhere but you will have hundreds of chests and literally thousands of corpses to loot. Loot management is annoying, and you have to grab everything unless you are playing by reading a guide. It is very easy to miss something important
- Camera management. It was not such a big issue in Kingmaker, where the corridors were wide, and most of the locations were flat and open. Here you will have TONS of narrow corridors and dungeons and reworked trap mechanics will force you to spin your camera a lot. Like A LOT. And in EVERY position some important things would be blocked from your view. You always will be missing something (an enemy, a chest, a hidden passage, a trap lever) because camera you have in this game does not fit the locations you have in this game
- Puzzles. Just leave it. Those are super-boring and time consuming. Probably I will give this game 2/10 for this specific aspect. And some of those puzzles are combining with bad camera and color management (hello to everybody trying to solve the bridge-puzzle in the woods on their own). Just instantly read the guide to skip this part of the game as fast as possible and get back to the story

Overall: game is good. It has some strong plot, it has very nice and touching reference to DnD lore, it has nice gameplay features but it is TOO TIME CONSUMING to play all of the fights. It is too time consuming to solve all the puzzles. It is overloaded with loot. Pathfinder Wrath Of  The righteous is artificially extended game. It could be 9/10 if it only was shorter, more polished, more concentrated and story oriented, but it has too much of a dungeon-crawl playstyle. 
Game is totally worth the money. It is not worth the time spent. If you buy it, just turn on storymode difficulty to enjoy it. You will save about 60-90 hours of your time on a first walkthrough. I absolutely regret playing it on core Pathfinder rules difficulty. I played it for 125 hours and the game is not done yet, not because it has a long story, but because it has SO MANY F****NG combat encounters.

There is a reason that their first game raised almost a million dollars on Kickstarter and their second game raised two million. It has something for almost everyone to immediately enjoy, and the rest sits comfortably as an acquired taste to form a complete package that is almost impossible to find anywhere else in this day and age.

The first and most obvious thing to talk about is difficulty. It is one of the main complaints that you will see and it is a rightful one, because the game is hard, feeling impossibly, frustratingly hard if you do not know what you are doing. To compensate? You can make it as easy as you want to while you learn the systems to get the knowledge you need to take a stab at pushing through higher difficulties. I did it, taking six hundred hours across both this and Kingmaker to get to the point where I have naturally arrived at playing on Core because that is what I am capable of doing and enjoy, and it was the kind of satisfying, incremental progression that is hard to find in this genre. My advice is to not look up a guide and figure things out for yourself, as it will be more rewarding by the end of the process.

That is off the back of a character creation with dizzyingly-deep depths that allow the people who understand it the most to push themselves against enemies who are juiced to the gills, doing up to three times more damage than base with much higher stats in a game where numbers are everything. It is a wet dream for people who like exploring the possibilities of a system such as this, requiring creativity in optimization, but is also intuitive enough to just work for someone who does not really understand it such as myself, providing you with characters who you can feel get stronger with every item and level. Satisfying is the exact word for it, but it does take investment on the part of the player. You have to think and make intelligent decisions to succeed, and if you do not want to or can't then you can scale back the difficulty to the point that the limits of your knowledge allow you to still succeed while being challenged. Like almost every aspect of this game, you can customize it to your liking, and that is something that cannot be found in abundance and should be noted and praised.

The Crusade system is the next sore point for most, with even people who like the game advising to ignore it (which you can also do by literally turning it off in the game's settings. What other game allows you to do that for something like this?). I do not understand or agree with this take, but that is on account of being relatively easy-to-please and I accept that I am in the minority with the opinion. Maybe it is because my mindset is different, seeing it as something that consistently breaks up the gameplay and feels good to progress through, watching your armies get larger and your settlements get bigger as you conquer more and more of the map. It's a ""number go up,"" situation for me, never requiring so much attention and focus that it draws from the main experience while also providing just enough of a break to keep things feeling fresh across the board. That is an opinion that puts me firmly in the minority, but I will say that it is a strict improvement from what existed in Kingmaker, marking the growth of a studio who deserves your time and money in an industry landscape full of glaring greed and increasingly simplifying trends in respect to things such as this. Owlcat chose not to scrap the Kingdom Manager system from Kingmaker and instead decided to change what did not work with it and try again. Another opinion that most might not agree with, but I think it is worthy of praise whether you like the result or not.

As a side note, compare the Crusade mechanic to the similar system in Dragon Age: Inquisition - a team of around a hundred people working off of Kickstarter money to a AAA development studio backed by an industry giant. What I respect Owlcat for is their willingness to do better at something like this than a competitor working with ten times the resources, and not just do better but try again when their initial attempt is not good enough to please all of their buyers. I will bet you anything that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf is not going to have an Inquisition mode or anything similar. Which game design mindset would you prefer the studio to have: to quit or try to do better next time?

The last thing I have a strong opinion on is the game's writing. I will not tell you that it is good or bad because those descriptors mean nothing, and are an attempt to apply objectivity to what is strictly an opinion. Saying that something has bad writing is a useless statement that overly simplifies and objectifies something that is one of the oldest art forms that humankind has to offer. Story telling is so inherent to the human condition that we understand it about as much as what it means to be alive in the first place.

What the game has is writing that I enjoy, enough so that I have played through the entire story multiple times over several play throughs stretching more than a hundred hours each, rarely finding parts that I truly disliked, appreciating the moments it is willing to go very dark, such as that note about a general being boiled alive for three days before being cannibalized by his own men, and its willingness to let off the throttle when the situation calls for it, usually in an intelligent manner. I like most of the characters, and the reason I might dislike any of them is because they have a strong personality that mine does not interact well with, finding their mindsets and quirks annoying (namely Nenio). In my opinion, that does not make them bad characters, the opposite, in fact, because they are strong characters with their own stories and beliefs that I was able to appreciate. Even if I did not like them as people, they felt like people and that is the qualifying factor for me. Greybor and Regill are based, Seelah is an idiot but one I find charming, and Ember is the sweetest, dumbest thing alive that I would go to war with demon lords for. Whether you agree with those takes or not is up to taste and I do not know you well enough as a person to comment on that.

Overall I think this is a good game, possessing more heart and soul than most AAA quality titles, especially in the RPG genre that has devolved into a hellscape of increasingly-simple Mass Effect and Dragon Age clones, none of which come even close to matching the scale, depth and ambition of Wrath of the Righteous despite it coming from a relatively-small studio. It has the charm of a passionate team who is willing to push themselves beyond what is expected of them. It has writing that I find better than its competitors, especially considering said team is based in Cyprus (which I bet you did not know was a country) and Russia. This is not the opinion I had when I first started playing but rather one I acquired over time, and at the end of the day if I can say that an experience only got better after five hundred hours of playing then that is a worthy product worthy of your money.",1686173176,1686173176,True,41,2,0.78026425838470459,0,True,False,False

game is way too complicated for LONGBOW to be the solution to every problem 

SUMMARY;
I am writing this review after playing 100 hours. I picked up this game on sale and havent played the other Pathfinders. I am in the middle of the 5th act, right at the climax, and I no longer want to play the game. All in all, the mishmash of tabletop and digital mixes very poorly in Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous. Despite tons of interesting characters, decent world building, and masterful writing, the game is beset on all sides by bizarre design choices that are indicative of a fundamentally broken system. 

GAMEPLAY; 
moment to moment game play is very solid. clicking around, exploring things and fighthing monsters is fun. However after the first  few hours or so, it becomes clear the monster diversity is limited.  on top of that, it continually shoehorns in new modes and objectives that detract from the dungeon delving adventure you would come to expect. the worst part however is that as the game progresses towards later and later, the complexity of the game doesn't flourish. Where you would expect more interesting and engaging fights, you are met with just beefier enemies, with just a set of higher numbers.

As fights become more  and more number oriented, the longbow party members quickly out themselves as being the most useful. the 2 longbows in my party would do more damage than the rest of the party combined. Its a shame some cool characters got put on the bench because their performance was negligible in comparison. 

The worst part is, that as the game progresses, tactics and strategy take a backseat, as the real game becomes how deeply you can exploit a game system that is extremely confusing. some buffs stack, while others do not. some skills I got specifically failed to trigger when they said they would, while other skills that said they wont stack, actually do and you just have to ""know"" through trial and error. 

QUALITY OF LIFE; 
The bag system, and UI is one of the greater culprits to why I would not recommend the game. The bag system has quite a few sorting systems, but it doesnt sort your scrolls/potions with any sort of level/spell/subtype/school. they quickly pile up and due, again, to the games strange magic system, most of them are useless. 

The character building in this game is, while in depth, one of the more infuriating ones I have encountered. most of the time the best options are a perk or skill that just gives you a ""+1."" the problem is that it is hidden in a mountain of  other strange and banal perk or skills. most of them feel useless,which you have to curate and sort through to find the very plain and basic ""+1.""

GRAPHIC; 
Overall The games appearance is good. The photo mode is dope and the designs for a lot of the armor and weapons is very in depth. Finding a new unique weapon was always a blast, learning what abilities it had. The look of the game is clearly master class. for a top down 3d game they really nailed the classic tabletop adventure look, and even included some exotic races i did not expect to see.  

The appearance tab and armor control is really good, once, again, you learn how to deal with how finiky it is. the gear on a person will sometimes disappear randomly, or wont appear even when it is equipped. but at the end of the day, very good. 

AUDIO/SOUND;
The voice acting in this game goes a long way when it does appear. for how much text is in the game it is always a treat to have voice lines begun to be read. the actors do a phenomenal job and much kudos to them. the sound design for weapons and spells, along with casting gets another A+, def one of the strong suits. No complaints


STORY; 
Probably the straw that broke the camels back for me. It starts of very strong, establishing the world, the main enemy to fight, and what is at stake. However, it quickly gets muddied down after the first act in a lot of esoteric world building. suddenly there are other factions that are more powerful but dont make meaningful moves in the story. there are new allies who rush to your aid, but have no meaningful impact int the moment to moment game play. and finally the biggest blow to the story is the lack of agency. scripted losses and wins are around every corner. tons of ""oh you defeated me, but i get to teleport away,"" and ""even though you won, you succumb to some strange influence."" It creates this strange dimorphism, where there is the actual events of the moment to moment game, where you are fighting huge monsters and acquiring  mythic abilities, and then this complicated pseudo-story that has so many irrelevant characters. 

I don't recommend this game, there is too much that distracts from the overall moment to moment gameplay to make it a worthwhile investment. on sale for 15 bucks is a steal, but i don't think the average joe would enjoy it. it just gets too bogged down by stuff that is not important.",1686070836,1686070836,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I regret probably around 60% of the time I've spent on this game (gametime includes way too many aproaches to this game)
Negatives:
Endgame is a slog, parts of the story branches are blatantly unfinished or lacking meaningful content, combat is completely uninspired and provides only artificial challenge by making enemies harder to hit or have more hit points. On higher difficulty levels requires you to go for cheese builds or to have meta knowledge about encounters, with no option to just use tactics or thinking on the spot. 

Positives:
Robust character creator and build possibilities.
If you just want to play with RPG character creation or testing various builds, then this is where this game shines.

Neutral:
Some characters are good, some are completely forgetable or disappointing.

final edit 6/5/23 This game is so gd frustrating.  i took a break not too long after my last review and now im back trying to play the new stuff that's come out since then.  The bugs are luckily much improved.  HOWEVER since i've already beaten the game on a difficulty i felt was sufficiently challenging for me i decided to try some more casual runs just to experience some more of the story.  Its the story and the character development that keeps this games foot on my throat. (y'all are sick for Ember) The options for defeating enemies in a lower difficulty seem to either i steamroll the mobs and bosses or i get steamrolled in turn.  no middle ground.  not a challenge.  The worst offender being the Mephistopheles fight which oh fun for me managed to be bugged so that my quest failed regardless of the outcome of the fight.  The fight itself?  awful.  impossible on turn based then made cheesy with RTwP.  I'm very disappointed to find this issue with the lower difficulties and can see that the difficulty settings frustrating others in the same way in discussion boards.  I have to say that's disheartening and demotivating. I will probably hit 2000 hrs of playtime on this.

original review 600hrs played: i wish there were more options than yes or no on the recommendation because i do like this game a lot. I really enjoy the characters and their interactions and the amount of choices the diversity of classes etc.  Unfortunately i have to say this game is *still* incredibly buggy and while i have a good amount of patience for bugs on 4 occasions i have had to completely stop playing a character and switch to another due to severe bugs.  I wish these bugs were merely a nuisance as the nuisance ones exist too and i can deal with those, work around them w/e.  But i have had characters unable to leave maps because they were stuck in combat with Orso who wont die, unable to leave a map because the icon to do so just completely disapeared, just plain frozen in cutscenes banners that wont update causing my morale to fall to critical.  Everytime one of these is fixed it seems another completely story blocking bug pops up.  Its so frustrating because when these arent happening i *love*  this game. I simply cannot recommend it after 600 hrs T_T because these things are still happening.  Please wait a while for the devs to sort it out before you buy it and if you've read this far thank you.
ETA: will revise this when i can manage to get through an entire playthrough without a story breaking bug",1635622383,1686010500,False,3,0,0.543379008769989014,0,True,False,False

Act 2 is when I knew I had been had. The game just stopped being fun, as the gameplay changed 180. Isometric rpg turned into baby starcraft. You have units moving across a board, they skirmish, then continue moving. You do have your party represented as a figurine and you can reach ""areas"" to explore, but there are so many random encounters that I just got bored. The rich characters just sorta shut up, explorable areas were tiny and had only junk. I guess if I kept going eventually the game would get back to the isometric rpg for longer than a single skirmish but IDK, cuz I stopped playing before the game decided that trolling me had stopped being entertaining.

I think the maker thought frustrating encounters were clever or something.  For example almost every big demon fight has 3 or more dretches that spam stinking cloud, rendering your characters unable to act for 2-4 rounds after leaving the cloud.  In theory you can have casters cast remove sickness, but they can't do that while afflicted by this spell.  Good saves don't really matter when there are that many active iterations of the spell on the field, so if you can't kill all the dretches in round one you're just stuck waiting for the game to start again while getting attacked by whatever else is on the field.

Frequent use of crit fishing weapons means your team will get one shot a lot without much in the way of counterplay options.  Avoiding melee isn't a viable option when there are this many enemies using that build wandering around.

I've found all the optional party members too unlikable to actually recruit, starting with the ""Genius"" wizard.

starting with my up, the character creation is amazing, LOTS of options for different builds which make you feel like you're building a god tier character.

that said the difficulty curve of the game can be all over the place and very unforgiving at times, i built a monk with a AC in the high 30's and there will still be some enemies who can hit me on a 2+
Or they just flat out one shot you before you can act.

I love the story of the game, but i hope you enjoy fighting demons because they make up 80% of the game so far. i'd like to see a bit more variety of enemies more commonly.

The game has a 'option' for you to add more customised heroes into your game... or at least i'm informed it has that feature if you speak to one of the npc's... i'll let you know when i can actually afford one, their price seems to scale as you level and it can go into the millions (i'm told the cheapest it can be is 500gp when you exit tutorial if you turn off a bunch of features in the settings.

which brings me to the settings which are very flexible in terms of how you want your gameplay, it can be as easy or as hard as you want... keep in mind though if you want a more enjoyable experience first time around, you'll want to put a lot of the features on a easier setting because difficulty scales quickly. and it appears to some degree you can change it mid game too which is nice, but some features when turned off or on they can't be changed back.

the game has two modes of gameplay which is the Baldur's gate style (which this game is heavily inspired by) and does a really nice job of capturing it.
but also this game has another feature where you control a Army on a battlefield (very much like heroes of might and magic) i feel like this feature fails badly in capturing that experience which alot of aspect, loosing battles will heavily punish you, taking too long to get additional troops will heavily punish you, getting resources is also a pain, after reading alot about it online for tips it seems like the majority of players are using the same strategy to get by in the game which is focused around defending the archers and healing which i feel is a bit sad there isn't as much flexibility in army build options as they are with character build options. 

All in all, i do enjoy this game as I've reached about 100 hours, but be warned if you don't know what you're doing you'll want to save you game often and make multiple saves over the story line or you may find you've screwed yourself pretty badly which requires back tracking a bit.

The Conquest Part of the World Map invites a welcome twist on an otherwise mundane part of the genre by adding another strategy/ resource management mechanic that ties into the roleplaying narrative.

The only thing i can complain about (and it is very minor) is the voice acting doesnt follow through the whole game, but there is so much content that adding voice acting for every scenario is nigh impossible.

[h1]The gist of it:[/h1]
I've never felt so mixed about a game before, but Pathfinder: WotR seems to be the queen of them all. On one hand, it's probably the best and most complete crpg you'll ever play when it comes to rpg/d20 mechanics. On the other hand, it has a ton of bugs and issues and a very feminist-focused story, that is way too much on the nose to ignore. 

👍 [u]The good parts:[/u]
+The most extensive crpg mechanics you'll find
+Great soundtrack
+Your choices may impact the game greatly or poorly

👎[u]The bad parts:[/u]
-Weak main story
-A ton of bugs and performance problems

[h1]Story[/h1]
The lore of Pathfinder is great, no one doubts that, it has a lot of similarities to the other fantasies you know so you will never feel overwhelmed by its presentation. They've also made this cool thing in the dialogue panel, that when they mention a lot of lore names, you can click on them and it displays a summary of that person or entity. I really liked that about it, as it eases you slowly into the vast lore of the Pathfinder universe.

But now let's get back to the main topic at hand, the story of Wrath of the Righteous. You play as your custom character, and you seemingly find yourself at an event, wounded, without any memories as to how you got there. Shortly after, things go bad, as a huge demon lord destroys everything around you and you fall underground where you begin your journey into the very long and vast world of Pathfinder. 

The story is huge, the lore even bigger, and I could talk forever about it, but I'll stick to the most important major aspects without spoiling much. It's a very strong feminist story, and what I mean by that, almost all the major characters in the game are female-gendered. All of them are strong, and all the men are kinda weak. If you have a problem with that, you might as well just go and skip this one out. I for one, didn't have much of an issue with it, it's not as bad as it sounds, but it feels very on the nose at times. Some would call it quite woke, which is debatable, but I'll let you decide for yourselves with the following aspect: your companions are a black female paladin, a half white-man/half-mongrel, a bisexual half white-woman/half-mongrel, a female elf, another female elf, a gay black man, a bisexual elf, a furry, and a few others. 

But is the main story any good? Kinda yes, kinda no. It has some great choices for your main character, which are the mythic paths, that can alter story and gameplay aspects based on what kind of mythical creature you choose to be, which again will only be available based on your choices. That means, choices are very impactful and will severely change the way you see and play the game. The main story bits won't change, they are obviously already set in stone, you will fight all the bad demon lords, command a crusade, save or not save the world and you will naturally have the exact same progression as everyone else, but who you bring, how you are seen, and how you get there will be different depending on your choices. 

I have limited space, but overall, my mythic path, the Trickster, was very enjoyable. The first time I played it, which was the Angel one, I hated it. Personally, I think the writers have a vendetta against lawful choices, as almost all of them are seen as bad choices, even worse than the Evil ones. If you can get past these issues with the strong female presence, you'll certainly enjoy most of the story bits and the overwhelming lore presentation. 

Story rating: 7/10

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
It's a crpg in which you can play both real-time or in turn-based. If you're a casual player and you're going to play it on difficulties below the Core one, real-time is your best bet. Core and above on the other hand is best played in turn-based mode for reasons I'll talk about below. 

As is the nature of a crpg, you'll spend hours creating your main character, from picking his religion, how he or she looks, the class and its subclasses, the abilities, the stats, and so on and so forth. Once you're done with that, you're ready to begin playing hundreds of hours. Why so long? For two reasons: one the game has two major gameplay mechanics, the normal crpg mode which you are familiar with, aka the base game, and the Crusader mode in which you'll move and command armies of soldiers and fight enemies on a tactical level, exactly like in Heroes of Might and Magic. The game offers you the choice to disable it if you want, but my advice, the first time at least, would be to enable it. The other reason is that the game comes with a huge amount of content and rpg mechanics. It won't be just your main character that you'll have to level up and carefully pick their abilities and stats, but all your companions as well. You will have to manage multiple classes and all of them with unique mechanics that you'll have to spend hours reading. 

Pathfinder has a ton of spells and mechanics around the d20 dice throw. If you never played a crpg, the short version is, everything you do is based around a dice throw that game automatically draws for you in the background. Wanna hit that enemy with a spell that has an armor class of 20? Well, the game draws the dice and adds your stats and if the sum is higher, you hit, if not you miss. There are a few other things that come into play that would take me too long to discuss, but everything is RNG. If you hate that, this game is not for you. 

While I have mixed feelings about the whole d20 I still enjoyed it overall. Pathfinder WotR has so many classes and so many choices that you can statistically replay this game A LOT of times and the outcomes would almost always not be the same. It is a wet dream for D&D fans. Even if I didn't like a lot of things about it, I still managed to play it two times, which goes to show, that the game's tactical prowess, has huge claws that never let you go and you never want to let go. Even as I type this, I'm already thinking about replaying it one day with more insane class choices. 

Gameplay rating: 8.5/10

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Voice acting for the most part is fine, and before you ask, yes, it is not fully voiced, as that would've taken many years to achieve considering the amount of written text the game offers. 

The soundtrack is pretty good, I like that each mythic path has its own music, and the combat songs are all pretty decent, albeit repetitive considering you spend almost 200 hours playing the game. As for the sound effects, no issues there, they're all standard. 

Audio rating: 7.5/10

[h1]Graphics, performance and tech analysis[/h1]
Sadly the performance is pretty abysmal. It was a lot worse when I first played it, frames would drop to low 20's in certain combat scenarios. Now it's a bit better, but if you play it in real-time expect a lot of under 60 frame drops even on a high-end PC. The engine is pretty bad at handling so many special effects on screen. 

Bug-wise, not good either. This game has received so many patches it is insane, that it has so many of them still. Expect a lot of UI bugs, spells not working as intended, and much more. To be fair, considering the amount of mechanics and content it has, it's a miracle the game does not break down constantly. 

Visually the game looks pretty, most locations and main dungeons look gorgeous and full of details, but considering this is an almost 200hour game, you're going to visit a lot of not-so-pretty designed places. I did love some of the main dungeon's level design. The abyss though? Whoever designed that place can f off. 

Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 6.5/10

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
 If you have no issue with the obvious pandering, Pathfinder WotR will offer you a huge amount of gameplay mechanics and choices for you to play with.

The game has no balance whatsoever even at normal difficulty. I got dropped at level 9 in a lab where the demon enemies are FAR more powerful than any individual party member. 3 enemies is all it takes to wipe the entire party, even with buffs, scrolls, potions, magic weapons (including cold iron, evil outsider bane, etc). For example, a shadow demon by itself is level 18. But it has a level 15 tarry demon thing and a level 15 minotaur with it. This is just one example. Many such areas of the game are like this, which are unavoidable and do not allow you to leave, get buffed, and come back.",1685754755,1685754755,False,2,0,0.510511100292205811,0,True,False,False

Story-wise this game is somewhere between Neverwinter nights 2 and Baldur's gate 2 in terms of quality. Instead of kingdom management from the previous game there is your campaign/crusade management. On the surface this sounded very similar, but seems like they threw out all the parts that just didnt work to try new ideas. These new progression systems work as intended and are engaging/rewarding for your participation. The combat is still pathfinder but with the addition of your plot powers. This means there are a LOT of ways to build a character(yes, you can do the classic pathfinder scumbag gameplay paladin/rogue with a tower shield and dagger). I was also very happy to see that the game is MUCH more balanced combat-wise compared to the first game. A great CRPG experience, recommend to anyone looking something in the genre.

But the story is basically Neverwinter Nights meets Descent into Avernus. It's worthwhile playing the game but if you're familiar with either of these other games (one a video game, the other a D&D campaign module for tabletop) you're going to get a sense of deja vu. I believe it would actually be fair to accuse them of plagiarism.

For the record: I prefer Pathfinder over D&D, this is just lazy writing.

The laziness accusation has more weight added to it owing to the terrible Crusades parts of the game where it suddenly turns into the worst RTS I've ever encountered. The only games I can think of that are similar to it are those ad farm mobile games where the object is to have a character with a bigger number attack an npc with a smaller number, you know what I'm talking about? The ones that are guaranteed to have false advertising. That's the Crusades mode. Its insultingly simple, and one of the top 5 most tedious experiences I've ever had.

I'm genuinely upset about how the Crusade portion just grinds the entire to a halt. It's miserable. I genuinely was able to look past the flagrant parallels and annoying characters for the Pathfinder system and the few characters I enjoyed, I even recommended the game to a friend already. Then I finished the first chapter and suddenly had to command an army of wood soldiers. I'm actually writing this review to avoid starting the game up again. I'm avoiding playing this game that I was enjoying just a few hours ago. This is miserable. The more time I think about this game the less I like about it.

It's a shame because I actually quite liked the previous game Kingmaker (which I'm just remembering is also the name of a popular Neverwinter Nights DLC) and had some high expectations for Rogue Trader, but now I'm thinking I'm just going to skip Rogue Trader entirely. If Wrath of the Righteous is any kind of foreshadowing Rogue Trader will just be a 40k reskin of Knights of the Old Republic, or who knows maybe they'll really push themselves creatively and do a 40k reskin of Skyrim.",1685724143,1685724143,False,3,0,0.474760085344314575,0,True,False,False

To finish the game completing all the side quest's took me 63 hours (rushing everything) , this game also gave me a really strong vibe of Lionheart: Legacy of the Crusader mixed with D&D mechanics.

What I loved about the game
- Great rich and detailed story
- Your choices have consecquense to the world, companions, ending.
- Vast amount of diffrent skills and skilltress that you can choose and tailor to your own gamestyle.
- Many diffrent companions with unique backstories and questlines.
- Huge map that you have to explore with both your armies(fight demons and castles) and your MC (quest's).
- Great graphics , soundtrack and atmosphere
- Many quest's with multiple diffrent objectives, sceneries and enemies (they are not repetative).

What I like in game
- There are diffrent mechanics throughout the arcs.
- 10 diffrent mythic paths that you can choose based on your decisions (although Azata is the most commonly picked in 2nd gamerun)

What I didnt like in game 
- The skill tree and character path can lead to a strong headache as everychange you make has its own pros and cons.
- Due to its huge content the replayability of the game is kinda boring and repetative .
- The RNG of dice rolls is fraustrating. While it gives the game a unique feel for most of the players it will feel akward.

While these are the first things that are coming to my mind , I think this game is a real gem and worth having.

I played a lot of CRPGs: BG, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter, Pillars, Numinera, you name it, and when I wished for more, I didn't mean literally. It's like we take a game and multiply everything ten times. Would be nice, right? Not quite...
Dozens of classes, huge world, gigantic amount of content... Enormous quantity dragged huge problems along. 

Imagine you get into some top of the top restaurant. It's size more like a castle, but you are completely lost there. Menu consists of few thousand entries, but you spend all evening and night to just pick something. Food is made by Michelin 3 stars chefs, but flies circle the rooms, cockroaches run on tables and rats occasionally steal a morsel from plates.

Let's start with problems:

- It is not new player friendly. You need to be a complete pro and know all the nuances and build paths of 50 classes (that can all be combined in tricky ways and on which level), 10 ""extentions"", trillions of skills, subskills, subpaths, spells, supspells, sidepaths, sideskills, over-and-under skills, and item-wise game progress. If you know, game is a piece of cake, if you don't, better use ""auto-leveling"" and go play easy mode.
- Because of immense variety, every fight is played on extremes. If you buff yourself to the moon, you get past with ease, if not, simple mobs will wallop your butt.
- Prevous point leave you to a few choices: savescumming like crazy (which is super boring) or sleep almost after every fight (which most of the time break story narrative: ""Quick! We must hurry or everyone is eaten alive!!!"", ""Ok, I'll just sleep for 24H"")
- Prevous point also brings huge inconsistency: I haven't encounter hard bosses, even hidden ones, but some very basic mobs made me do up to 50 attempts
- Huge.. No, HUGE amount of bugs.
- I couldn't imagine that in such games could be problems with control, but this game surprised me even with it. Moving in tight corridors is utter pain, during fight characters could run completely away or ignore action and waste it, UI can show you options that are not available, lot's of stuff that make you reload fights again and again.
- Game is atrociously unoptimized. I don't know if it mine cryptocurrency or calculate chemisty reactions, but my 3090Ti roars and overheats. I had to put most of settings to medium and low just to prevent videocard burning, although nothing is slow at highest options.
- Wife had left me because she won't live with a looser which throws 1/20 three times in a row in 90% of cases.

Sounds bad, eh? But let's look on the bright side:

+ Main story, side stories, exploring, world - everything is super interesing and exciting.
+ Many characters, antagonists and most of companions have striking personality, marvelous individual stories and quests, they'll stay in your heart for long time for sure.
+ Vast variety of how to progress the story, who to become, who to befriend, who alienate and which way to use for resolving the crisis.
+ If size of the world, amount of classes, characters, items, spells, quests and other things is not enough, there are built in ""Heroes of Might and Magic"", literally!
+ Most of DLCs are superb.



After 400h of only just the first playthrough, and after so many downsides, can I recommend it? Of course! Game is definetely made with love and it is seen with naked eye how much effort devs put into this product. 

Will I play it again? Although there is tremendous replayability, ulikely, just because is too much time consuming. Will I remember it? 100%, many characters are with me forever. Will I play next game devs are doing? Shut up and take my money!


So, forget about job, kids, wife, frinds, life, deep dive into troubled world of Golarion, take the burden of chosen one and save mankind from demon hordes (or don't, but gain your own pefidious profit, you rascal). 
[b]Besides, where else you could do such fantasy and mythical things like: making friends as an adult, earn money, travel the world, make decisions which count, and, most importantly, sleep for 8 hours a day.[/b]

It's absolutely massive, has crazy amounts of depth in build making, has a great story, and even after finishing my first playthrough at just over 110 hours, I'm thinking about what I want to do differently in my next run. You can pretty drastically alter the story at every step. It's hard to put my finger on what is stand-out quality because it's generally very consistent. At just about every step, it does what it tries to do and does it well. It's just a very well-executed CRPG overall, and you can find just about all the trappings you'd expect of the genre at its best.

As for what's not to like, there are some minor interface bugs from time to time, in addition to the interface functionality overall being slightly below what I would have liked. On top of that, there's some places where balance could use some work, particularly in the weapon types and favored enemy departments. What's the point of a shortbow? Nothing. Who is crazy enough to make anything other than demons their favored enemies for classes like ranger? Who knows. The macro-level stuff with crusade management also felt particularly unbalanced, but was less of a bother because it's not bad once you figure it out and it's not really the main attraction to begin with.

As for what I'd like to see in the next game, the first thing that comes to mind is a build planner. A way to sort out what I'd like to do in advance without having to use out-of-game resources would go a long way for organization. I'd also like to see some more companions. There's a lot already, which is great, but because they spread it out by alignment, it narrows back down again. You have a lot of choices for good or evil companions, but not a lot for good or evil companions *that fill a specific hole in your party composition.* Want a good-aligned frontliner? You get Seelah. Some of the companions are more flexible than others, but it's an issue overall. Both of these things feed into my last ask: let us respec NPC companions from level 1. When you get a companion that starts at a higher level, the choices for their previous levels have been locked in stone. Even the respec tutor won't let you change them. Sure, you could use mercenaries instead, but really, who *likes* mercenaries? Oh, and maybe add a few more character portraits, too. I get that there's too many combinations of age, race, and class to cover them all, but more are always appreciated.

Overall, it's a fantastic game and I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoys buildcrafting or story-heavy games. I've put a lot of hours into it and I can see myself putting in many more.",1685638233,1685673107,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Loving it.  This game is wide and deep.  If you always wanted to play a tabletop-like campaign, but have no groups, this is the next best thing.  

Being ""evil"" is actually cool, interesting and exciting again.  Aside from being the first game to ever let me play a lich, it actually goes beyond ""grr I'm evil, I'll kill ya!"".  

The dialog option to kill people (sometimes opening combat, sometimes scripted, depending on whatever) is always there for people doing ""mass murderer types"", but don't let that fool you.  RP your way through dialog to discover more intelligent and thoughtful ways to be evil.  

11/10 game for me.  Like Dragon Quest 11, it's a very long game.  But just grab some tea and have at it a little bit here and there.

Small note about companions, I'd rate these above average.  You feel a little tropey on the first glance, but they are deceptively deep and interesting.  Usually in these games, every companion is running from something.  It gets pretty old.  ""Ok, tell me about your huge regret.  Who'd you kill?""

But these ones ... some of them are perfectly comfortable in their own skin and are only traveling with you because either someone is forcing them to, or you're forcing them to.

As an old school RPGer, this game has it all to be amazing, only to fall short on execution when it comes to mechanics and gameplay. 
I commend the devs and writers, they had an outstanding vision.

The good:

+ The story. What can I say, who doesn't like a solid D&D campaign.

+ The length. A complete game! We haven't had a complete game without 20 DLCs since 2010. What a treat! A single gameplay could last past 100 hours!

+ The characters. Someone took a lot of care creating them and their stories. Bravo!

+ Daeran romance. I've been playing RPGs for 20 years, and Daeran is by far the most original and best written. Great character overall and his arc is just fantastic. I commend the writers for being able to write an Evil character who has depth and is believable, who's comprised of shades of grey instead of a shallow ""durr I am evil lol.""

+ Very original and imaginative. Even the absolute gameplay disaster thats act 4, I understand the dev's vision.

+ Nice graphics and visuals.

+ Every gameplay can be so different. VAST options to create your character, who knew there were SO many options if you just want to be some run of the mill sorceress. Witches, Oracles, Arcanists... similar, but what to choose, I guess I have to replay this a few times. Ha.

+ Every choice you make in game has a different outcome by endgame. Not all your good choices assure a good outcome, sometimes you have to make hard choices to get a more or less satisfactory outcome, sometimes following your heart ends in disaster. And by the end of the game you have like 30 end slates depending on everything you chose on your journey. Wow.

+ You don't have ""fake choices"" like we're used to seeing in new games (looking at you Bioware) in which no matter what you choose the end is always the same. No, here you have clearly different outcomes. Heavy is the weight on the Commander's shoulders!

+ Replayability: YES, very much so. Just get Toybox to save you the gameplay annoyance.


This game could have been a 10/10 masterpiece were it not for:

- LOADING SCREENS.

- Updates that may break your savegames and you'll need to start a new game.

- Too many  unskippable cutscenes, and many more to skip! (press ENTER)

- Terrible game flow. I have the feeling that developers wrote this without taking into account that someone who hasn't played before wouldn't know what to do. The Journal entries are absolutely useless unless you've already played this game and know where to go next. Quite impossible to finish important stuff without a walkthrough. Most of the times quests get solved by you just stumbling on them, otherwise, time to google a solution.

- Act 4. God awful mechanics of the Abyss city. It's a complete waste of time walking/waiting for isles to move/ loading screens/ useless cutscenes. (Add the pain of having a useless journal entries and you'll find yourself walking/loading aimlessly without knowing what to do next.)

- Crusade mode is painful. If you are a casual player and don't want the hassle you'll still find it very hard. Don't make the mistake to choose the ""auto play"" for the crusade. It will most definitely break your game (even if devs think it won't, it will- the storyline will be very reduced.) There was no way for me to have a decent flow with this mode without using mods. 

- Navigating the map: This one sucks because I love exploring every last corner of maps. Every 2 steps you need to rest or get ambushed, corruption setting in, back to Drezen to rest and remove corruption, back outside, loading screens, 2 steps- rest... ad infinitum. Again: Mods are absolutely necessary.

- On mods, please be aware that if you install a mod, you'll also need to install yet another mod to re-activate achievements. I found this too late...

Gameplay: Exactly what you’d expect from a game like this. Fun engaging combat. Lots of talking and choice making which the game does remember and peppers it with flavour throughout. The kingdom ruling section is back from the last game and they’ve streamlined it a bit making it more obvious what you’re actually choosing. 

Graphics: Very pretty, if you zoom in you can tell a lot of care and attention went into the models and textures. It’s kind of a waste though as you almost never zoom in. 

Puzzles: You have limited time on this planet, no one is going to judge you if you look up a guide. 

Difficulty: There are lots of options for difficulty and they’re great but you’re still going to hit difficulty spikes from time to time. Those spikes can be ultra frustrating, even after two years of bug fixing there are still some crazy encounters even into the late game that are just, frustrating. 


There is one late game quest where you are forced into a turn based combat situation with never ending spawning enemies. Everyone knows which quest I’m talking about. **** you Owlcat games. 


Story: There is a big hole where demons come out of and it’s your job as the ‘chosen one’ to fix it. The story is typical fantasy with a few odd balls scattered throughout to make the game slightly memorable.

After thousands of hours playing it and similar TTRPG systems, I have concluded that Pathfinder, 3.5e and like systems’ incredible complexity yield remarkably little reward for the player. I, too, was once awash in the sea of numeric complexity and apparent potential of class and feat combinations, but playing WoTR was an exhausting experience that helped put the final nail in that coffin – after over 100 hours and numerous character builds I am exhausted by the endless bloat. Let me explain.

Though it is engaging to think about ultimate character build ideas and make something creative from an unique combination of classes, feats, and equipment, the end result for each character is to become very exceptionally good at one thing and to do it in every fight, at all times. Therefore complexity of decision-making emerges at the party level, not within a character, and is not all that deep in the end anyway. The amount of buffing required to safely engage in combat is excessive and should either have been automated or adapted for the game; a human DM is the factor that normally lessens this issue and is sorely missing. I almost can’t believe that I find myself thinking ‘Nintendo would never have greenlit this gameplay’: say what you will, they get ‘the basics’ right and keep repetitive chores out of their games.

Many enemies are arbitrarily affixed with permanent buffs, some of which are not possible to dispel, which undermines abjurative casters for no good reason, and even the beatable spell DCs are often unreasonably high – another thing a human DM would have adjusted to avoid invalidating character concepts. The creativity allowed by the many spells and combat feats is undermined by inflated enemy saves (meaning getting spells to work without specializing in one school, using debuffs, and crossing your fingers is unlikely) and the opportunity cost of consuming your multiple attacks by trying a manoeuvre instead.

On the other hand, the game can be easily broken using specific class combinations to inflate AC and other stats, by buffing to extremes, and by noticing as the many Magus players did that touch attacks are the solution to grossly inflated enemy AC – to the extent that spellsword hybrids are often far more effective in melee than dedicated physical attackers. Eventually flatfooting or touch-attacking are everything, and so normal, enjoyable gameplay goes out the window while you focus on achieving reliable, repetitive strategies. Realtime-with-pause mode is exciting but gives up a level of individual character control compared to turn-based mode, which is far slower, and drags on. Despite this, I tended to prefer turn-based mode because it enables you to control the application of necessary Hexes and other debuffs in a more rigid order, and lets you soak in the team-wide strategy of the fight. But in the lategame, it sees characters taking the full brunt of enemies’ (sometimes 4+) attacks before you can react. Any remotely normal character seems not to have enough AC to get reliably through a turn, and besides many ¾ AB-growth classes struggle to connect at all without the use of specialized flatfooting strategies. This lends to the feeling in difficult battles that you are battling an Excel statistics chart rather than a fleshy enemy; the gap between viable and suboptimal strategies is a chasm of punishment.

To top it all off, the story and companions are nothing to write home about. Tastes vary, but it is inescapable that the total amount of dialogue is excessive compared to the number of interesting things said, be they about the plot, characters or world. The crusade mode is a poor HOMM clone and could be removed at a great benefit to player time and stress, for it is yet another layer of complexity that detracts from the overall experience. The battles are rarely strategically gratifying, and come down to your preparation of a sufficiently fast and numerous archer zerg bomb most of the time. The rare even matchup often leads to such costly losses that reloading and taking a safer fight is the result anyway. As for performance, I play on a system newer than the game and still get stuttering when moving about some large areas as the game loads. Lowering various settings seems not to alleviate this immersion-breaking issue.

To sum up, Pathfinder is a system that requires a human DM to stitch together at the failing seams in order for the experience to be reliably fun. As the numbers go to extremes in the teen levels, it falls to an absent human DM to adjust creatures so that his players’ characters can continue to have interesting engagements, instead of themselves becoming mere damage pumps with one optimal partywide strategy for most efficiently wiping the field. The grid-based 5e combat simulated by Solasta is far more interesting because of the importance of positioning, the overall better reliability of status-effect abilities (including pushes, stuns, and so on) and spells, of light, and in real terms sacrifices little in the way of complexity. Pathfinder and especially WoTR are defined by shallow bloat, giving you 300 ways to achieve the same full-attack-user gameplay, 30 viable routes to become the same offensive evocation specialist favouring the same eventual spells, and so on – though 5e lets you achieve these outcomes in fewer ways and with fewer names, the combat scenarios end up more diverse and cognitively engaging.

I took a lot of punishment hoping this rare adaptation of beloved tabletop classic would get good: respeccing, thinking my character was the problem; using mods to add new feats, to substitute an entire custom party, at one point – but the pointless time-consumption of constant buffing continued to worsen, the story failed to improve, and the viable combat approach continued to narrow and sharpen. There is just not a place here for various characters that I have played in past tabletop situations and D&D-like games, despite that they were well-statted and optimised within their roles in those environments (and here, in fact). I think this irony best explains the bloat problem in Pathfinder. If you insist on playing this game I recommend you play a Magus and make friends with Haste and Ray spells on other party members, also Sirocco.",1632530541,1685412235,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you just want to enjoy the game 'normal' is a good diff lvl: the fights go smoothly and you don't need to buff up for every single trash mob. At high difficulties it is the opposite and you really need to know the system, but the challenge is definitely there if you are seeking for it. A huge amount of character classes, feats, spells etc. and ten mythic paths gives the game a lot of replayability. All in all excellent worth for money. If you're a completionist prepare for many, many hours of fun. :-) One more thing: I didn't encounter any bugs which is good for a game this big (vanilla, no dlcs).",1685120219,1685120361,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

endless CRPG fun. 
if you love pathfinder 1e you'll love this game. 
I dont even have the dlc I dont think I need it.

Finally beat my first run of the game. Ngl not a huge fan that the crappy army / kingdom management also has a say in your ending BUT I can understand why. All in all this was a fantastic experience. It was fun, the characters were all strange or weird or over the top but in that corny, fun TTRPG way. I actually had an artist doing the art for my characters endgoal (Demon Lord) and it perfectly arrived in time for the mythic rank 9 portrait swap. Though I didnt achieve mythic 10 so I guess I missed something. 

Also im sure the secret ending isn't THAT hard to get but I read the walkthrough and like naw I just wanna enjoy the video game / story that is presented. But if you wanna 100% this game know you can always run a beeline for the secret ending!",1684481554,1685114986,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many of the game's flaws aren't really Owlcat's fault - they're just things that suck about Pathfinder. The main things I can fault the devs for are the boring army management, the poor balancing, and the general level design of Act 4.
The army management needs to leave and never return. It adds nothing except 30 extra hours of playtime; I got no enjoyment out of it whatsoever.
The entire game could have really done with a second or even third pass when designing encounters - you'll get difficulty whiplash where you are falling asleep for most of a dungeon and then instantly get a game over when a pack of demons suicide bombs you.
Act 4 has this really irritating mechanic where the map can change depending on how your camera is oriented.

While the DLC can be hit or miss (barring the shifter dlc, that shit slaps) the core game has VASTLY improved since launch.

You wanna smite your enemies with holy fire from the sky while Lann plays a literally mindblowing solo on a lute? yup, you can do that too. The builds of your party characters are up to you, with the option to go with a preset build that the game levels for you or you can go buckwild and create a party of maniacs who turn into manticores and recreate the arrow scene from 300 with spikes and demons. The crusade management is a bit divisive as its basically just dumbed down heroes of might and magic but I personally enjoyed it. The mythic paths combined with the absolutely insane number of classes and dialogue options give this game a ton of replay value and the graphics range from decent to beautiful depending on location and setup.

Maybe a scene or two that you actual care about mixed in with loads of dross ...oh and of course more mind numbing combat and [b]tedious crusade mode[/b].

Combat and skills as I understand it are far too ""faithful"" to tabletop, it translates horribly leaving you to drudge through boring and nonsensical combat that requires an absurd degree of stat management and horrendous amounts of buffs for you to do (sort of ) well and (maybe) succeed. Did I mention most of the games runtime is combat? Yeah... You'll be utterly bewildered by character creation and all the vague class and skill descriptions it provides until you realise most classes are the same. Martial hits things until they die, Caster shoots magic very slowly then stops halfway through to give up and stab  the enemy because not only are their spells on a set limit each day they also don't do much damage :\. Turn based or real-time you just sorta walk into enemies and hope you'll win, there isn't any tactics involved bar buffing before a fight and praying.

Skip crusade mode, once again no real tactics nor fun to be had. You move your army slowly around the map and they fight enemies in a turn based grid arena that similarly takes too long. Your reward for your toil? some random artefacts that's about it.

Mythic paths are spread far too thin and ultimately feel inconsequential. In a drawn out and linear game with such little replayablity as WOTR I don't quite see the point. Sure some dialogue flavour changes and a quest or two but really it has very little impact on the story for most paths. Super underwhelming, and I don't have the time in my life to play multiple runs frankly. It was very ambitious like much of this game but I'd prefer less options with more focus.

The writing is strongest at the beginning and gets weaker the longer you go, not to mention you're likely to be tired of caring after all the combat. There are some weird dips and tonal changes in certain characters even as early as the very beginning you'll notice with the first two potential companions have some wild shifts and inconsistent character. Personally I only found two characters particularly compelling [spoiler]Wenduag and Areelu Vorlesh[/spoiler] maybe thats just me.

If you get this on sale I'd suggest downloading toybox to make the experience more tolerable.

I was in the mood for a good D&D game so went searching.  Found this one & fortunately it was on sale for $11.99.  Figured I eat\drink that in about 45 minutes, so $11.99 for hours of entertainment was worth it.
While it was d/ling I watched a review video.  ""Umm....what was I getting myself into??""  Figured I'd play it for about 90 minutes and if I didn't like it, ask for a refund.
3 hours later I was deep into it.  But about 1+ hour of that was character creation.  And even that 1+ hour I sort of rushed through it!  :O  I guess hard-core players spend a good evening just in the character creation after which they may play for a while and go back to the character creator again.   ""I ain't got time for that!""
Onto the game itself.  This part is very, very important and bears reading, re-reading and re-reading again!  This is as in-depth a video game you are going to get with stats that resemble RPG AD&D!!  That's not a bad thing mind you.  But be warned.  [b] YOU REALLY NEED TO PAY MIND TO THE STATS!!![/b]  We're not talking your base 12 or 14 stats.  We're talking dozens upon DOZENS of stats you should really pay attention too!  That's why I think I got in over my head.  I don't have the focus like I used to (I'm closing in on retirement age) to keep track of all the stats that this game requires.  I really, really, really wish I did because this game is AWESOME!!  
I won't bash it at all because there is nothing TO bash!!  Will I recommend it?  Definitely yes...[i]with a caveat[/i]!!  Go into it knowing you must really pay heed to stats, abilities, traits, shoe size (joking), but quite a bit of stuff.  This isn't an easy game to play and will take a lot of focus, concentration and lots of reading!

I will sideline it for now.  I'm about 18 hours into it, and not that I'm getting bored, but I'm playing it like a barbarian would.  I'm just picking up shiny stuff, things with good stats and hoping my group can use it.

The story is a bit slow and I don't think the it's as tightly interwoven as Kingmaker (their last game), but the prose is better and the UI is slightly improved. It's not the most effective game in offering you problem solving options, but it's okay. The story and characters are why you should play the game.

Gameplay tl;dr: Don't play on hard, because Owlcat has no respect for your time.

*Long sigh* Gameplay! Just boilerplate for Owlcat's questionable design choices: All CRPGs have you  wading through hordes of identical enemies and having inventory headaches (although... why? That's never been the fun part), but this game takes it to another level- the kind of level where saving takes longer the further you progress because there are too many items for the game to track. Just have enemies drop gold, assholes. The harder difficulties in particular are more tedious than mentally challenging. Choosing your actions well and building your characters perfectly are a prerequisite (and Owlcat balanced the classes poorly- the best builds break immersion), but reloading and working around the constant ambushes are also prerequisites. You have to keep your buffs up constantly and spend a couple minutes debuffing and saving, because every encounter gives you permanent debuffs. It's tedious, not challenging.

Pros:
- Dialogue is the best I think I've ever seen. Not too many scenarios where I thought ""Why can't I ask this?"", there were even some moments where I had to sit and think deeply about not only what was being discussed, but also the implications. I haven't felt that feeling in a while, and to experience this in 2023 is a breath of fresh air to say the least. I don't feel like I'm getting subliminally mind-fucked by some hyper-sensitive neo-whatever agenda.
- Combat is fine, I wish more games of this genre would implement a real-time option instead of boring old turn-based
- Pricing was actually insane. I bought it for like 10 bucks on sale, dumped over 100 hours into it. As far as hours played per dollar spent, this is one of the best game purchases I've ever made. I haven't even touched the DLC yet, only the main game
- Impact of decisions is critical, and that's really what makes an RPG an RPG. It's not as hardcore as other games in the genre (you can do some extremely evil things and still be considered good with 0 negative repercussions), but the number of decisions which change the outcome of things further down the road is pretty high, and I didn't really see any bugs pertaining to that which shows a lot of effort on the devs' side.
- Essence of each alignment (good-evil, lawful-chaotic) REALLY shines through in the companions in this game, and the writers nailed almost every one. Camellia, Arueshalae, and Daeran all have super unique stories while the rest were somewhat generic but still decent (except Nenio, really could've left that one out).
- The story itself is pretty solid, although it gets a bit repetitive by the end (scary demon who is supposed to be the epitome of all things cunning, self-serving, and opportunistic underestimates you because you're a lowly mortal, you rip their head off, repeat). You'd think by the end they'd see you as the doomguy and turn tail. There weren't really any major surprises or plot twists, although I feel like the devs wanted you to be the one to make those happen.
- Mythic path is implemented extremely well, it gives you the option to play your own way and adds many interesting outcomes while not forcing you into a 1-dimensional arc.
- Definitely a step up from kingmaker. Much more of a metal vibe, in contrast to the flamboyant vibes of kingmaker.

Cons:
- Crusade mode feels like a chore, kinda takes away from the experience. Like Kingmaker's kingdom management, I wish the devs would stop implementing these mechanics.
- UI gets a bit confusing. I shouldn't have to go to the map under crusade management to be able to upgrade a fort. There are one too many menus in this game, it sometimes feels like finding a hidden easter egg when it should be something that's easily accessible. Still better than kingmaker though.
- minor critique, but if I'm a good-hearted trickster I shouldn't be able to murder an entire courtyard of servants in cold blood with a serial killer and face 0 consequences.
- feels like 80% of the mobs you kill are demons, 10% are humans who serve them, 5% are beasts and undead, 5% is everything else. I get that it ties in to the story, but it helps to mix it up a bit.

I will try to remain spoilerfree throughout.

As with the predecessor Pathfinder: Kingmaker(PK), Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous(Wotr) have very high highs, and very low lows. It is worth mentioning (as is tradition) that if you have little/no experience with DnD type systems and roleplaying games, this game will be VERY punishing on normal difficulty.

[h1] The Good [/h1]

This game offers FANTASTIC variety in character building. If you can think of a character type in a fantasy setting, there is a high probability that it either exists in the game, or that the game gives you the freedom and tools to create that character.
If you (like me) enjoy just sitting down and figuring out synergies and combinations of abilities, spells, and stats while still holding yourself to the limitations of the character type you're roleplaying as, you are going to LOVE this system. The freedom is staggering, and the systems are complex in a (mostly) satisfying way.
This is in my view by far the best thing about this game, and I cannot give enough props to the dev team for managing to adapt this kind of system to a videogame, and still getting so many things right.

Connected to the point above is the choices in expressing and molding your own character, aswell as the characters of your companions, through dialogue and story options. There are in most cases plenty of different choices to make, and a lot of times these choices have at least some effect on the story and its characters.

Graphics, soundtrack, etc. are on point. It is nothing groundbreaking or anything, but for this kind of crpg, they are very well done and the different areas you explore throughout the game keeps things fresh and interesting, even though the nature of the story and setting kind of limits this aspect to some degree.

[h2] The Bad [/h2]

Enemy and encounter balancing. This topic has been talked about so much that there is little I can add, especially since I am far from an expert when it comes to these systems, but let it be said that it is bad. Very bad. Unless you are playing with a minmaxed party with very specific traits and builds (which runs counter to the freedom which I think is so important) Be prepared to miss. And miss. And miss. AC is through the roof for many enemies, and the difficulty is all over the place. You will most likely have stretches where you are just stomping through everything without a care in the world, but then suddenly your entire party just dies. And this doesn't have to be because of bosses or anything, sometimes regular enemy packs in dungeons will straight up murder you, even though the packs you defeated before in the very same dungeons posed no threat. SAVE OFTEN.

Bugs. There are still way too many of them. This game has been out for almost 2 years and there are still a concerning amount of bugs that will (most likely) never be fixed. Another reason to SAVE OFTEN.

Voice acting. This is just a personal note but I thought the acting was weak. There are some gems, but overall I was dissapointed and felt that this game is a stepdown in quality from PK.

Story. This is my biggest gripe, and I have pages upon pages to write about this, but as you've probably already noticed, this review is already dragging so I will try to keep it brief. In a nutshell this story is pure powerfantasy, in its most boring form. If you enjoy being the superhero who everyone thinks is amazing and awesome all the time, then you're going to love this story (There is nothing wrong with enjoying this by the way, but I do not).
The story in PK suffered from similar problems, but not to the same degree as this game. The first 30% of the game is pretty tight and focused in this regard, and even though the YOU ARE THE CHOSEN SUPER COOL GUY stuff starts early,
it only ramps up as the game goes on. Be prepared for many, many instances of the villain having you in his grasp, but then saying ""Huehue, I won't kill you now, but I will get you later!"", or you having the villain in a similar situation and them simply going ""Blast! I'll get you next time!"" and then jumping out of a window.
The writing is bland. Very bland, and while this is true for many of these kind of crpgs, the story is only a backdrop for the interesting and loveable/hateable characters that you meet. I think Wotr mostly fails in this regard, and the weak characters combined with the extremely unimaginative story really starts to wear on you as the game trundles along.

Speaking of trundling along, game length. This is not a strict negative mind you, and if you can overlook or enjoy the negative things I've mentioned this is a positive. But expect a normal playthrough to last at least 100 hours. Probably more.
What is a negative though is why the games takes so long. The staggering amount of backtracking, aswell as the half-baked crusading management system takes up a significant portion of the playtime.

[h3] Conclusion [/h3]

Buy this on sale. I got it for 10 euro, and for that price I would say it is very much worth it. I know it may seem strange that I give the game a thumbs up even after all the negative things, but there is definitely a diamond here burried under all the dirt.

This is a super dense game and the world is fairly reactive. However. There are far far too many choices, in fact I'd refer to it as redundant choice bloat. As a new player you can spend 3 or 5 hours in character creation alone, such is the amount of things you can choose for even a first level character. There are many methods of making nonfunctional characters that work for the first few levels. Strategies need to be hyper-specific for each character or it will not work from mid-game onwards. You can find yourself in random encounters where every save an enemy can make (fortitude/ reflex/ will) has a D20 +20-25. A natural 2 means they'll roll 22 minimum against your DC 18 save without heavy feat/ buffs and debuff investment. Beside that you'll be commanding armies in a chess-like minigame, it makes sense flavour wise as you are helming a crusade however it detracts from the core game and is more of a chore.

Despite all that I still recommend this game. Because if you can survive those hurdles and enjoy what is presented, every other facet of this game is A++. Your character really feels like their own thing, its super easy to get into an immersed roleplay mindset.

But if the question is indeed ""Would you recommend this game to others?"" then most of the time, I'd say no, with some caveats.  If you're a longtime veteran of CRPGs like me and have devoured just about every other one of these games on the market, you'll find this to be a passable experience carried by the strength of *some* of its characters and roleplaying, but let down by the faults in the math of the Pathfinder 1E system itself, which this game has stretched beyond breaking.  If, on the other hand, you've not yet played the much better fantasy CRPGs from the last 20 years like Pillars of Eternity, Divinity Original Sin 2, Planescape Torment, Neverwinter Nights, NWN2's Mask of the Betrayer and the like, or indeed other non-fantasy CRPGs like Knights of the Old Republic/2, go play any of those instead.

This game leans in *hard* to the breakability of the RPG systems that underpin it, not just encouraging but requiring you to min-max the systems in order to overcome the ludicrous challenges you're put up against.  Is it hard?  No, quite the opposite.  If you're familiar with the genre, the game gives you more tools than perhaps any other to break it over your knee.  The problem comes with the Pathfinder 1e system that provides the game's mechanics, which is a derivative of 3.5e Dungeons and Dragons.  This is a game of stacking bonuses upon bonuses and getting all-or-nothing results of a single 20-sided die roll. 

When the math of this tabletop system is pushed to the extreme, as it is in this game, fights end up feeling ""coin-flippy,"" devoid of any challenge but instead entirely dependent on luck.  In a *very* simple example, there is a hex that has a chance to put an enemy to sleep until they are damaged, and a standard ability that allows anyone in melee to execute a sleeping enemy.  The devs know this and expect you to be exploiting this sort of ""if I roll above a 10, I win"" strategy, and as a result the enemies have to be wildly overtuned for your current level in order to stand a chance.  There's very little in the way of interesting tactics or strategy to be had, mostly standing around rolling dice at one another until whoever gets luckier wins (which is usually the player, as it is the player's job when building their characters to weigh the dice in their favor).  Turning up the difficulty don't solve this, it merely exacerbates the problem, making there even less room for unlucky rolls. It's largely a fault of Pathfinder itself, but it is also a fault of the devs for deciding to go this route.  Worse, the combat is clunky with numerous irritants in the controls and targeting that make it a frustrating slog, and there's a hell of a lot of it.  During the most important moments in the story thus far, I've felt bored and irritated, not excited, just waiting for the endless string of samey combats to be over so I could get back to the story.

On the subject of controls, this game's UI is terrible.  Just awful.  It is often difficult to tell what is a bug and what is an intended feature of the UI.  I could get into specific examples, but suffice to say it's one of the worst UIs I've ever dealt with in a CRPG.  Important information like what various status effects do are not available to view where they would be helpful, despite there being an integrated hyperlinking system in the game.  I haven't played Pathfinder on the tabletop in nearly a decade, so my memory is foggy on some of these things, and I can only imagine this would be a nightmare for a newcomer.  And despite being 2 years old and on its ""Enhanced Edition,"" the game is quite buggy as well.  The worst I've had, aside from the occasional crash, is the game locking me out of control of my characters, which has happened many times so far.

As for the positives, there are some genuinely fun and interesting characters present, and the plot so far is decent if unsurprising. There's amateurish writing here and there both in the characters and in the roleplaying choices, but more often than not I found myself enjoying the characters and roleplaying opportunities enough that I wanted to keep playing; indeed, enough that I'm going to finish my current playthrough.  Unfortunately, WotR also contains the worst companion I've ever experienced in a CRPG, the character named Nenio.  It seems she jumped straight out of a bargain-bin JRPG, and is the archetypical ""aloof anime scholar"" character.  Everything about the character immediately breaks suspension of disbelief and reminds the viewer that they are playing a video game. She's surrounded by a cast of characters who are believably written with a careful eye put to their motivations and quirks, especially as they relate to the fantasy species of the setting. By contrast, nothing about Nenio's character is written in that way.  It is a truly exceptional character that is so bad I'll take this much time to write about it in a more ""general"" review like this one, but Nenio stands out across all time as one of the worst CRPG characters ever written.  Stunningly awful, though I suspect if you're a profoundly annoying person who doesn't care about tone, isn't much interested in roleplaying, and thinks yelling in people's ears is the peak of humor, you'll love her.

This has ended up as the longest review I've ever written on Steam, and for good reason.  There are many things to like about this game, and I don't even necessarily disagree with the people who love it.  I can see why.

-Interesting story and NPCs (better than Kingmaker), particularly the early part of the game
-Excellent replay value thanks to the multiple mythic pathways and class options
-Great musical score
-Many of the more annoying aspects of Kingmaker were corrected. E.g. no rations necessary for resting

The Bad:
-There are tons of enemies that will drain your level and/or ability scores, and you can only fix it with limited use restoration spells. This often forces a rest when you otherwise don't need one.
-Some puzzles are overly cryptic. Specifically, a series of tile puzzles plays an important role in one character's side quests. Once you know the rules of how these puzzles work, they are difficult but solvable. The trouble is, the game never explains rules, so you're almost forced to look it up online.

In my mind, normal difficulty is something, that doesn't require extraordionary skills from a player and won't be frustrating. And I'm going to post my opinion (very important ofc :D) using this statement.

And yeah, I understand that there are players which beat the game on unfair difficulty.

Some points of my review my include some [b]spoilers[/b]. Be careful.

[h1]Bugs[/h1]
The game consists of many bugs, very annoying bugs later 1.5 years after the release!

Lets consider Turn-Based mode. In the first act one of your party's member every fucking time wont do anything just because. In my the first game it was Camellia, in the second game it was my character! Some spells just stop working. For example, when I tried to Cast Camellia cure light wounds, she just consumed the spell slot and nothing happend. Moreover, the problem character could stop do anything just because; in its turn the cursor will look like the last bugged spell and that's all! You have to switch on real-time mode and back.

In that mode, sometimes when you try to use some abilities (like learn enemy from Slayer, for example) character just lose all actions.

I've met another gorgeous bug: some figths require from you to kill N mobs (for example, [spoiler]fight with mongrels in Savamelekh's palace[/spoiler] or the second stage of the fight with Areshkagal). How I said the fights require from you to kill N mobs to continue moving story-line. BUT these fucking arenas don't include collisions for frightened mobs and they just run away from you behind the arena! And you can't kill them, they can't return back, it is just fucking soft-lock. Go fuck yourself owlcats, because I had to restart 4 times the fight with mongrels and 3 times the fight with Areshkagal. If you think that it is awesome, just stop developing the games. Boss fights are one of important things in the game and they HAVE TO BE polished. 

[h1]Crusade[/h1]

Holy fuck... I think that the idea is really interesting (it could add some epic in the story), but implemenetation, agh, it just too raw and looks like something redundant in the game. I don't think that it is interesting to skip days to collect an army to defeat one of the enemy armies. Fights itself also are very boring. Sea of units is useless about 90%. And yes, you may say ""just set it automatic"", but in that case you will skip some quests and points on the global map. Verdict: useless time-consuming activity.

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]

The game punch you at the face when offer you to create the character and give you the list of classes and archtypes. You just start realizing that it will be difficult to learn this bunch of opportunities.

Some locations are very hard and open to early for a player, the game doesn't notify you about this. And good luck try to clear [spoiler]the Black Water, if you don't know that the gates will close after you enter the location, if you don't know that ALL enemies have self-heal effect and you HAVE TO have weapon, which disable this ability to defeat them[/spoiler].

Another point which I consider as a problem is every damned mob has TONNES of AC, tonnes of mage resistance, elements resistance and so on. Good luck to try to break throught the AC or roll critical hits (which you have to confirm!).

Too many enemies have abilities to decrease levels or stats of your characters and they just spam it. It is a good design to get -4 levels or -8 strength\whatever after the first bunch of mobs, isn't? And yeah, you can use spells, potions and so on, but some of them just doesn't work and don't heal curses (although, description says opposite things) or you just hasn't got enough such items to heal all your mates. And yes, there is opporunity to heal such effects after the rest, but in that case it just destroys immersion in the game and you merely stop to believe in the ongoing events.

Enemies have big set of AOE spells. Good luck to survive them. It is very intersting to meet 3 demons, which as a free action cast curse on you, which gives you disadvantage on ALL d20 rolls (you have to roll 2 d20 and choose the worst) and then start SPAMMING stun. Wow, good design, very intersting fight, good work. Or it is very interesting to fight with two fucking Gallu Stormcallers (it seems), each of them SPAMS 2 or 3 AOE damaged spells every round and for one round they may make damage around 150-200 HPs for everyone in your party! And yes, you can buff your party with many casts, like defends from elemens and increase your elements' resistance, but they just continue spamming this bullshit. You might think that maybe they are weak and easy for kill? HA-HA-HA-HA. Each of them has 60+AC, mage's resistance around 35-40, touch armor around 30-35 and ~1000 hp. Moreover, they are surrounded by marilit, deskari's grasshopper and 2 succubs-archers, each of them has AC around 40-50 and ~300 hp. Good fucking job, owlcats. [spoiler]That fight is harder then Areelu Vorlesh itself![/spoiler] It's terrible game design, I think the person who implemented that bullshit is talantless.

And such situation in every damned aspect of a game. Every fucking time when you tried to discover something interesting the game just punch you, using mobs with incredible AC, which you can break only on Critical Hits. And yeah, sometimes they have weakness to touch attacks or something else, but common, the game just draw out spells and abilitites from you characters using previous group of mobs and then force you fight to such bullshit. I play on NORMAL difficulty, I shouldn't do minmaxing.

[h1]Decision[/h1]
Sometimes I really enjoyed the game, sometimes I hated it, but I don't want to give positive mark for all of these, because I often felt that the game is raw or developers just laugh at me.
But it was interesting experience and may be, after some time I'll decide to play again (and will skip Nennio's personal quest, because it just will choke me).",1684583962,1684596222,False,44,5,0.629405677318572998,0,True,False,False

It's a solid RPG.  
Just know that if you don't want to micromanage battles, pausing every two seconds to have all your people cast different spells and stuff, if you just go at it and trust the AI to do it's thing.. You will get your ass handed to you in the second half of the game. This game clearly expects you to spend 10 minutes with each battle.
The AI controlling your characters never actually uses any of their magic and for many characters, that's how they do damage. Also because it's based on dice rolls, it's hillarious to see late in the game how there is a huge monster, tall as a building, yet all your attacks miss while the swarm of locusts, those were easy to hit :D

So if you do not want to micromanage battles, or if you're unfamiliar with DnD and stuff.. Get yourself the mod called ""Toybox"" and bind at least the quick rest to a button.

Replayability is rather high, I replayed the whole game a second time just to see how an evil playthrough as a demon would turn out.

this game is a complete waste of it

The game is entirely RNG based, and in my experience with RNG it's either a cake walk of constant 20's or your highest roll is a 5 for 60 rolls straight and nothing gets done, I've had combat encounters in my 8 hours playing (not even to the beginning of act 1, mind you. im getting beat down in the prologue) where a single enemy on 4hp refuses to die and proceeds to wipe my party over the course of 6 complete turns.

Where the game isn't RNG based is character creation, and unless you decide to take a precreated character you'll be sitting there for potentially hours wading through a swarm of feats and masteries and skills and addition spells and races and attributes. Pack some tylenol and hope you don't make something that's entirely useless. 

Protip: mages are useless until shortly after the beginning of act 1, when you get to level 2 spells and you can apply metamagics. Would not recommend doing a mage build, it is only suffering and most melee characters have spells anyways. If you don't want to do a melee build or a character carrying a lascannon disguised as a bow, you're useless for quite a long while.

Bought for $11 on sale, fully regret the purchase, and unless you're still in highschool/don't work/study/anything besides beat off, I would not recommend this game. Absolutely no satisfaction. I can't wait to slog through this game some more with it's unskippable cutscenes I don't care about the for second third etc time so I can eek out some kind of satisfaction, if I can ever get the energy together to go back to it.

The game feels like it's trying not to hold your hand, like this is supposed to be a difficult game, while at the same time making you the undisputed powerful hero. It cannot be both, and so it just ends up being a game of pressing F5 before every door, because some combat encounters you will just lose due to RNG and it's expected you reload.

1) Character creation is way too complex,
2) Your race has no impact on how people treat you (Example - everyone being completely fine even if you are a dhampir)
3) Story forces you to be a good character, even if you pick all the evil options or choose to use necromancy. Side characters straight up go ""Wait a second, let's do this instead"" and you can't advance dialog unless you pick the good options.
4) Combat is bad. They made a turn-based combat system real-time and it suffers for it. Being a mage sucks because any melee companion you have just runs down the enemy before you can cast a spell, and most of the time your spells miss.

People say in response that having bad guy and good guy story paths would be too hard or complex- is just wrong. They have all the assets made as is. Just do different dialog.

Kidding aside, I thought [i]Wrath of the Righteous[/i] was in most respects an improvement over [i]Kingmaker[/i]. It has a far more interesting story and keeps most of the same mechanics, but drops a lot of the annoying aspects.  The kingdom management is now crusade management (with the villages and towns replaced with outposts and bastions), but you no longer have to assign advisors and sit idly for days waiting on your decrees to be enacted.  Now it all just happens in the background.  In addition, there's no time limit; you can take as long as you want to complete each chapter, although in some cases you're rewarded for doing it quickly (ok, there is a soft limit due to the morale counter, but a normal playthrough is unlikely to hit it).

The big thing they added was large-scale battles. Every now and then you have to take a break from dungeon-crawling to play a bit of [i]Heroes of Might and Magic[/i] - recruiting armies and generals, and battling the demon hordes.  Didn't really bother me that much, as I enjoy the HOMM games, but I think there's an option to turn that off.  Just be sure you recruit a mage general, which turns late-game fights into a joke.  I literally LOL'd when my army went up against the (alleged) strongest demon army, and the general wiped them out before anyone else even got a move.

Another welcome addition was turn-based combat.  I didn't use it much at first, but it really grew on me later in the game as the party needed more micro-management.  Fights run a lot slower, but I found that my survival rate tended to be much higher with it turned on. (And again, kinda hilarious - my Commander was so strong by the end that he could singlehandedly take down a demon lord in a turn or two.)

And then of course there are the mythic paths.  It's basically just an extra class on top of your main one with some nifty new abilities, which progresses at certain story points.  [spoiler]And toward the end you can switch to a different path, or reject the mythic power altogether for a nice bonus[/spoiler].  But which one you choose has a significant impact on the story, which, when added to the wide variety of class choices, supposedly adds a lot of replay value.  I hear there's even decent support for playing an evil character, if that's your thing.  I'll probably play through it again at some point with a different path.

The one thing that gave me a lot of frustration was that most of the optional bosses, and even some of the story ones, have crazy-high stats.  We're talking AC upwards of 60 (70 in at least two cases!!), plus spell resistance, saves that are all but impossible to fail, and just in case you get past all that, immunity to just about everything.  You'll quickly find out that the Ascendant Element mythic feat (ignores immunity to one energy type) is required for any caster.  And even so, these fights mostly boil down to throwing on every buff you have and hoping you roll enough 20s before the party is wiped.  But doing all the side quests and killing the bonus bosses will easily put you at the level cap for most of the last chapter.

I played through this on an absolute tear—racking up 150 hours of a complete playthrough in 13 days. 
I've been a DM for pathfinder for the better half of a decade and was eager to see how they implemented the mythic system into the existing engine from Kingmaker and while it does have its hiccups and simplification compared to the tabletop game, it was a lot of fun. 

This game does kind of force players into the weeds around level 15 onwards, as the difficulty spikes up fairly dramatically; requiring the player to constantly be adjusting strategy, gear, and often—the composition of your team.

It's a wild ride. I loved my time going through and am more likely to run through WOTR again than I am Kingmaker. It just polishes a lot of what I felt needed attention from Kingmaker and proceeds to add even more on top.

I will explain this in more detail, but the game is designed to be incomprehensible, the combat design is so stale, and the bugs are battle breaking. Time to ramble.

[b] Unnecessary complexity [/b]
     I've never played a tabletop d20 RPG game, but I have played similar titles like Divinity and PoE without feeling so drained. I heard that the Pathfinder ruleset is more complex than regular D&D, but when put into a single player video game, it doesn't really have to be so confusing does it? To begin, the game is simply too bloated on text. Every tooltip is like 2-7 paragraphs of worthless information to the average player. Especially if you play in real-time, the formula for how each 'check' is performed is basically irrelevant. I'm not going to be calculating those values, the game engine will. Even in turn based mode, how many players are actually going to sit there and inspect every enemy to then calculate their chances of hitting. It's not like I have a virtual die that I roll on the screen either to be excited about the roll outcomes.
     Furthermore, the game also does not provide any point of reference for how good or bad your current characters actually are. The game does not show you any percentages such as melee hitrate, spell hitrate, damage reduction, etc....These arent even calculated to you during combat. I understand that these values will drastically be different depending on the foe you fight, but maybe at least tell me percentage wise how I fare against an average enemy of my level? How do I min/max anything when I don't know how much impact a +1AC gear is going to provide me? This makes gearing so boring as I am just equipping whatever gear has more stats. It doesn't matter what stat, just give me the one with more stat. On top of this, spellcasters don't even wear armour, so if my party consists of mostly mages, there's not a lot too look forward to in looting at all.

List of other things that are just exhausting to have to deal with and bring no fun value to the game:
[list]
    [*] Crusade army management (It's so half baked, why even put this in the game? It's another exhaustion point on top of the game already being exhausting to play)
    [*] Resting and resting corruption, plus the forced dialogue wait-screen (is this skip-able? if not why not?)
    [*] World map walking fatigue + random encounters (The encounters are way too easy and it's just extra loading screen time to go into a 1 minute combat sequence)
[/list]

[b] Combat slog [/b]
     Combat design is a complete mess. Some enemies just have super high AC/SR values. There does not seem to be a visual indicator for any of this, I guess you just are expected to deal with it as it comes. Miss rate is way too high, and you don't even know what your chances are. I have had a melee character miss 7 turns in a row on a regular enemy. This makes turn-based mode unplayable for me as it's not only too slow, I feel like I have no control over the outcome of the battle when its just a 50/50 coin flip on whether or not an attack hits. On the other hand, real-time mode is better in my opinion, but you end up dying a lot because things happen too fast and you simply cant have your attention on every character in combat.
     Combat length is also too drastically different. At first I played the game in turn-based mode, every fight was maybe like 5 rounds (~5 minutes) and then the camp attack mission happened. It took 25 rounds (1 hr 30 min) for me to complete. It took so long because I had to watch the 5 or so friendly units take their turn followed by the 10 enemies take their turns before I could even move. In real-time, it's just too much to handle. It was fine in Pillars of Eternity, since the party size is 5 and each character did not have that many skills/spells, but I found myself not even watching the combat in Pathfinder. I was just watching my character health bars and then pausing to assign spells and going back to watching hp bars when I resumed.
 [list]
    [*] Also lots of copy and pasted combat (including the world map random encounters) = poor gameplay.
[/list]

[b] Bugs [/b]
I don't know how bad the bugs were when the game launched, but even now at the time of writing this review some still exist. They are made worse because the game already has a big problem with RNG in combat.

[b] Closing thoughts [/b]
There's gotta be a better way to adapt the Pathfinder ruleset into a more enjoyable video game format. You may have to just change it a bit to make it more accessible to the average non-tabletop gamer. The game is massive with lots of customisation and subsystems, but it does not excel in any of them. Btw, the UI visual design is a 10/10 from me. It's really nice to look at, but it does not save the game from the slogfest that it is.",1683866147,1683866147,False,4,0,0.481907755136489868,0,True,False,False

  Combat can be either turn based or real time and you're able to switch back and forth as you please by the press of a button.
  Art / Graphics are very nice, though I truly wish there was more in the character customization aspect... There really aren't a lot of options to change your characters face/build/hairstyle and so on. The world is very pretty and detailed though and character portraits during dialog have a nice style to them.

Here is my experience as I played turned based combat:

1) EVERY fight is a series of 4-5 player controlled characters vs 3-6 enemies. ALL units (player controlled and ai) miss each other 95% of the time from point blank range until ONE rng hits and ONE unit deals damage to another...usually if the enemy hits you it barely scratches you, and if you hit them you often one shot. I don't know about you...but that is intensely boring. That is mind numbingly boring. I cannot fathom something more boring than that. How do I sit there for 15 unit actions for ONE thing to happen?

2) This rng crap applies to ALL attacks by the way: as in range attacks, melee attacks, and spells - all roll % to hit. And by the way, if you rolled a mage, your spells (which deal vastly less damage than weapons) have the same % chance to hit as a weapon:
Example: My wizard can do the typical caster thing and cast a cantrip [a spell that does not require a spell slot...[you have more powerful spells that have a limited number of charges. (At 1st level, you have like 2 level one spells...good luck and have fun!)] My 1d3 (as in 1-3 damage) cantrip has the same + chance to hit as my crossbow...which deals 1d8 (1-8) damage....WHAAAAAAAT? It's not like there's even an advantage in casting the lower level damage spells instead of using crossbow...they BOTH get -4 chance to hit from attacking something already engaged in battle. (Oh and btw, I rolled my character with +5 intelligence as a wizard...that is +5 to hit...doesn't make a difference)

3) Balance is actually a joke. I am pretty sure the developers actively hate you and want you to suffer. I mentioned before that you get scratched by enemies but one shot them back...unless u got to random rooms where (so far in the beginning dungeon only like 4 rooms) enemies get 1/10 damage from you and yet 1-2 shot you. But...but why? Why are you doing this to me game? It's not even on the hard difficulty...

4) Speaking of difficulty and balancing, I don't know about anyone else's experience, but my characters CONSISTENTLY (even with +7 to +9 to bonus to hit) were rolling <8 against 20....TWENTY?!?! ARMOUR?!?!??!?!. Let me clarify. In dungeons and dragons 5e, +9 to hit is insanity. You are a god that can murder all of the everyone. In here, rolling a 8 + 9 (17) still doesn't penetrate 20 armor because 17 <20. WHY ARE THE ENEMIES TWENTY CLOCK SUNKING ARMOR!?!?! Meanwhile the enemies CONSISTENTLY rolled 13+. I know there are ways to min/max to have a better chance to hit (which sounds like the most unfun, on the rails, restrictive gameplay I can possibly imagine), but if you are gonna sit there and tell me that I just have to min max to get an extra +2/3 to my rolls...when my characters just roll 1-7 for 85% of their rolls, you are having a laugh at my expense, are a bad person, and should feel bad about speaking in my direction. In the example above, I still would miss 2/3 of my shots as 17 < 30 and 17 + an extra 1, 2, or 3, would only hit on the +3...if I got the 8. If I got 7 or below (which happened so....so many times) then I'm crap out of luck huh? I should git gud I guess.

Anyway, I am tired of ranting...but the game is just unplayable. DO not buy unless $5 for EVERYTHING, including all dlc. I bought at 75% off for like $25 or whatever, and it is a Waste. Of. Money.",1683840898,1683840898,False,4,2,0.400446712970733643,0,True,False,False

Characters blatantly dump exposition on you in the worst possible manner. ""We've just met, here is 3 pages of how my mother had a miscarriage. None of it actually conveys tragedy but is rather just a recollection of events.""
Also, for some reason the alignment as well as the romance options seem very forced. You just met two people, you fight a demon, and afterwards the game tries its most to shove you into asking ""but were you guys more than JUST FRIENDS?! TELL ME IF YOU PUT YOUR NOODLE INTO HER, JOHNNY!!"".

Bugs... a lot of bugs. Quest breaking, conversation breaking, pathing being horrible, AI simply being bad is the norm. A lot of design choices simply works against common sense (ie. if you are lawful good and you pick enough lawful responses without picking good ones, you become lawful neutral. If you are chaotic evil and you pick enough evil responses without picking chaotic ones, you become neutral evil). I love discovering a trap and having to micromanage each of my characters' steps, cuz the autopath will inevitably trigger it.

The combat is nice, but the sheer amount of enemies with high spell rez/elemental rez/elemental immunities even in early game make the divine spells way too good compared to arcane ones. Only a few companions and builds are effective on harder difficulties. Mythic paths are extremely unbalanced (both in combat power and ""unique"" content provided) and ""locked in"" early enough to not realize which are good and which aren't. So good luck playing 10-15+ hrs to reach the ""point of no return"" (end of act 2), before realizing that you have locked in a subpar choice.

Companions and NPCs are a coin flip. Some of them are very well written, with a good character arc. Others are as flat as a board. Others seems designed by Netflix writers.

The choices matter... a bit, especially if you are RPing. The problem is that there is no worse feeling when RPing than feeling smarter than your character. I can't count the times that i've to break my RP after reading the options, smh. A ""bad choice"" in a dialogue can ruin 50+hrs of building relations with that npc. I've only encountered 1 character (Regill) that i was able to convince to not leave the party with a persuasion check.

Apparently, the Devs thought that a normal ""turn-based party-based RPG"" game wasn't enough, so they added a very poorly balanced and even worse executed HOMM rip-off mechanic (army management and battles in a 4x checkboard). Disabling that function in the menu locks out loot, quests and resources from the ""normal"" game. Just because.

[b]For crpg enthusiast[/b]
If you are looking for a fantasy d20 rpg, this is it, the best in the market now, surpassing even Baldur's Gate 2 in all aspects. 198hrs for my 1st playthrough. No need to read further.

[b]For new/non-crpg players[/b] 
After you read some pros & cons, please read the ""Tips & Recommendations"" below to enhance your enjoyment of this game. 

[h1] PROS[/h1]  
[b]Content[/b]
A massive amount of content, with massive amount of replayability. Evil paths in most rpg tends to lame, it is understandable because it is hard to implement. We mostly get some items, powers etc and that's it, but the stories and world rarely change. 
Here, the evil path is actually really fun to play, the gameplay really changed according to your deeds, from your companions, world, alliances, reactions, power and stories. The whole game is built for evil players too, the mythic paths changes a lot of things. 
Hence there is a lot of replayability for you to try other paths, for they don't just give you different powers, but also different story and progression. 
There's also an enormous amount of combat mechanics, spells and builds that allows you to roleplay and experiment, although this one comes with a caveat.

[b]Stories[/b]
Most of the stories are actually really well written, with a compelling narrative and villains. Your companions also have a substantial stories to themselves, and some of them are really insane. Let's not forget that you have more than 10+ companions and a number of them are exclusive to certain mythic paths, so there are a lot of stories to be discovered. Their personal quests are also mostly long and pretty significant, not just some side throwaway stories. Story wise, this game is choke full of it while still allowing you you a lot of freedom to roleplay. 

[b]Soundtrack [/b]
The soundtrack is absolutely fire, I can't explain it, you have to play it yourself. Pathfinder doesn't have fancy cutscenes, so when you can actually feel the moment through the music, it really means a lot. 

[h1] CONS [/h1] 
[b]Crusade system[/b] 
There's not much cons to the game actually, but the biggest one of them all is and will always be the Crusade. Well..... any Wrath of The Righteous (Wotr) players will know what I'm talking about. Wotr is like a beautiful pristine white gown stained by a spilled red wine that is the Crusade. In short Crusade is an army/war management system kinda like the old game of Heroes 3 of Might & Magic. 
The purpose of this mode is to make you feel the constant pressure of war against the demons, and i get that, war is complicated. The only HUGE problem is that... it isn't fun, I am not sure if I have found anyone who claims that they fully enjoy it. The UI is a hassle to navigate, the fight itself isn't balanced too. You can actually turn on ""Auto Crusade"" mode so that you can really be hands off with it, but the huge issue is that a lot of stories all also tied with it, you will miss out on a lot of cutscenes and areas if you just let it run auto, as well as being locked out of certain significant items and secrets. Might be a different story if they implement it really well, and it will be difficult as it's akin to making 2 different games in 1. But right now it feels like playing an excellent rpg, then once in a while you have to stop and do your taxes, it's a mega chore. 

[b]The Combat System [/b]
As robust as it is, Pathfinder's entire system is..... incredibly complex for any newcomers. I'm not exactly new to crpgs, having played the entire Baldur's Gate series and all the others like Icewind Dale and Torment etc, although I'm also not a hardcore fan who plays the pen & paper too. But even I find the entire mechanics overwhelming and confusing at first, and still a bit overwhelming after finishing it. 
I know it's not easy for Owlcat to implement it and they have done pretty well actually, but I believe this kind of complex system upfront is putting off a lot of new players who will otherwise enjoy this game. See, Pathfinder is a game of stacking numbers, if you stack your numbers right, fights are easy peasy, but this isn't Dark Souls, you can't git gud, there is no way you can do a ""naked no-hit run"" simply with sheer skill. Here you win by studying a PHD on Pathfinder system. But if you don't study, you ain't gonna make it unless you are playing on casual mode. I was playing on ""normal"", and on plenty of battles I almost get party wiped. Don't get me wrong, I like the difficulty actually, but I believe many won't. I heard Pathfinder 2.0 system has dropped and it is many times better, so there's actually hope in that. 

[h1] TIPS & RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEWBIES[/h1]  
So you might be put off by the complexity and difficulty of them game that you often heard about and miss this incredible game, so don't worry, I got you covered!! 

[b]Crusade Tips [/b]
Just set it on the easiest mode, or get the mod ""Toybox"" and cheat your armies, really trust me on this one. The crusade is not worth your time, it's not what this game excels in. Play the crusade manually, but give yourself great armies, add morale and resources through the cheat, you are not missing out on any of the fun(none) and you will still get to see the stories, cutscenes and secrets. 

[b]Combat [/b]
If you are a newbie, set the difficulty to ""Casual"", there is an even lower difficulty that is ""Story"", but then you won't get to learn and understand the system on Story, and there is actually a lot to enjoy when you understand the complexity and depths that it has to offer. This way you don't tear your hair out by being wiped out every single battle while still having a lot of room to experiment and make mistakes.
The thing about ""Normal"" is.... it is still hard to play if you don't set up your character efficiently, and you definitely won't when you first try out.  
And as for your companions.... just ""look up a guide online about their build"" and TURN OFF automatic levelling for them. I don't know what Owlcat is thinking but they are built rather poorly and thus doesn't offer you much help even on ""Normal"" mode, absolutely dead weight on Core mode and above. 
Save your time from trying to build them yourself and rather learn from the guide on why they should be build that way. This way you have a decent strong party while you learn and enjoy the game. After you have played and understand a bit, you might want to use the ""Bubbles Buff"" mod to streamline your buff spellcasting process. 

Also, get used to the Real-time-with-pause combat system, it's really not bad like some people say it to be. There is a turn based mode, but there are a lot of combat and enemies, and if you use turn based, every battle will take a very long time when some can end in less than a minute. 

[h1] CONCLUSION [/h1] 
Despite it's certain flaws, this is still an incredible game. Very few rpg games in the market offer this much story content, exciting combat encounters and tons of replayability. Don't compare it to Divinity 2, it's rather different. And due to the sheer amount of content, it's understandable that you don't have fancy 3d cutscenes, but if you really want to experience and rpg that is filled with excellent stories, adventures, combat and surprises, this is it.

Massive, head-crushing depth in terms of character customization with more builds to try than you will ever have time for. Endearing characters that you grow very attached to throughout the game. An epic, sweeping story with a healthy dose of intrigue and mystery, and a gradual build up from killing giant bugs in a cave all the way to taking down Demon Lords.

Now the bad parts. The game can be a bit buggy at times, but almost never in any truly gamebreaking way. The game can also be a bit obtuse, the puzzles in particular are a bad case of either trial and error or looking up a walkthrough, there's frequently no good way of actually deducing the solution. It's good that the game has quite varied difficulty settings that you can change on the fly so you don't get stuck on any part, but it sometimes feels like the developers used that as an excuse to not have to properly balance the game, as some fights are just flat out unfair on anything higher than the easiest difficulty setting, enemies having AC so high that they're essentially impossible to hit being one of the biggest offenders. Also, do yourself a favor, and never go to Blackwater. It is an optional area in act 3, and easily the worst part of the entire game featuring a massive setting mismatch (an area that looks like it belongs in a fallout game, not a fantasy setting), countless enemies that have nigh unbreakable AC, and it locks you in and doesn't let you leave until you complete the quest, no idea what the developers were thinking.

And yet despite all that I've just said, this has become one of my favorite games of all time, and even 580 hours in, I'm gonna keep playing it for some time to come, trying out new builds, making different choices.

I am not very far in as of this review, maybe 1/3rd of the first act. But the game's very pleasing so far. Interesting budding of a chosen-one story as far as I can tell at least. 
Only gripe I have is that most of the main characters all talk and act like some version of a hyperactive child. Even the well brought up one sounds more like a teenager from a better middle class family than one stemming from a royal family. They are all acting way too informal. It is set in a form of medieval world where chivalry, honour, adhering to strict morals (or at least the age old game of pretending to do so) and definition  of one self by different upbringings and social classes do matter. There should be way more intense classism, racism and disdain between the different groups and races. This makes the world less believable and thus lessens immersion for me.

Also difficulty setting is weird. On casual is like waaay to easy, on normal is too hard in terms of that I just dont want to spend dozens of ours in boring combat.

Especially if you like long journeys with lots of choices both storywise and character build-wise.

This was my first introduction to the Pathfinder world, only previously knowing that ""it's a lot like DnD but different"". While I'm in a biased position to say so, I do think this game overall is a brilliant introduction to both the Pathfinder system AND the world that comes with it. The story was cliché in many ways, but it felt that choices did matter to a great degree. At the time of writing I've only completed the game once. I was very slow with many things and analysis paralysis did make me tab out for a while so I'd say my ""actual"" playtime is more close to 250h rather than 400. But this game was very fun to me, difficulty varied a bit though. I played on Core. Which was one of the middle difficulties. Not the highest not the easiest. After some time on this difficulty I realized I had to drop a few difficulty sliders down because I did not know the systems well enough. 

The good:
Fun epic story, classic hero's journey. The way it's constructed allows you to learn a great deal about the Pathfinder universe without it feeling like a forced exposition seminar. 
Characters that felt a bit too ""quirky"" at first eventually grew on you, and also served as good vehicles to discover more Pathfinder lore. 
The option that not all CRPGs have to use turn-based combat. 
LOTS of story choices that influence both the journey and the end. 
LOTS of character build-choices that can(if you want) influence both the journey and the end.
VERY customizable difficulty. You can choose to take unfair damage while being granted a 2nd chance with deaths, for example. Plenty of choices here.


The bad:
Some buggy quests that were impossible to complete due to said bugs. Though those quests were relatively minor. 

Crusade mode did feel like a chore after a while. Especially when you had defeated everything and you focused on adventuring with your character. A method to stop the random armies from interrupting you would be nice. 

Some quests were a bit too particular on having certain conditions met, for example using a key at the right hour or else you had to skip time to do it properly. Some quests were also insta fails if you failed a lore check, where you'd think that in an RPG if you fail a skill check at first, then return to the place after having learnt a great deal more, that you'd be allowed to try and pass it again. 

Some minor choices like item rewards could've been more clear. While it's not the end of the world, having to tab out to check the rewards on a wiki before making a choice is a bit meh. I absolutely support it when it comes to sparing vs killing a character or such, but when it's about you restoring a relic to full power and deciding just how to restore it I think all the info should be shown in-game.",1683214282,1683214600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It doesn't feel like Baldur's Gate inspired gameplay anymore. Kingmaker did, but this tried something new and ended up bad. If the camera rotation was just an extra feature, cool. The forced usage instead of keeping a main direction of perspective and letting people momentarily rotate from that point of perspective, not cool. Feels like a jab at the playerbase for ever asking for camera rotation more than an authentic attempt to introduce a cool new feature.

Kingmaker in my opinion was 9/10, only missing the truly epic story. WotR is a somewhat fake 5/10 because it has a lot of great parts, but... Story seems epic so far. Character customization is improved (still had to download mods for a lot of things missing from Pathfinder in the game).

First with what's good; the story, worldbuilding and characters are all very good and I constantly felt compelled to learn more about the world and surroundings, some of the quests are interesting too and the game succeedes in providing entertaining scenarios spattered throughout the map. This is obviously a huge success for a game like this that lives and dies on its storytelling, somewhat. 

Sadly I think it has a few aspects that weigh it down tremendously. This initial point might not be an issue for you if you have played the boardgame or enjoy the very traditional DnD combat rulesets, but for me the combat just sucks. There's no way to sugarcoat it, it's just absolutely awful. When doing turnbased; it feels like the characters miss 95% of all their hits and only spellcasters have anything even remotely interesting to do in a fight, otherwise its mostly just autoattacks for the rest. After stepping off games from Larian studios where the combat is fantastic it just feels like such a miss. For me the only way to even get through the encounters without being bored to tears was to play with RTWP, the other issue with combat is the difficulity. It is near nigh impossible via the difficulity screen to select a worthwhile challenge, either its nails-hard or its a walk in the park. Character progression is my other major gripe, and once again its probably based on the boardgame. Despite that its so boring, you never get to make any important choice, its all passive buffs that ever so slightly buffs your character, its never anything interesting. 

To me these points were enough to tilt it into the negative but like I metnioned, if you have played the boardgame and liked it or liked the first game in the series, this game will likely be for you. Otherwise I'd say its a safe skip as there as so many other crpgs competing for your time that just flat out does it better.",1683137854,1683137854,False,97,11,0.696274757385253906,0,True,False,False

I did not enjoy playing it, but I wanted to finish it just to see if it gets any better as you progress.

It did not get any better.

First of all, the crusade mechanic is completely unnecessary. It is extremely boring.

It's similar to Heroes of Might and Magic, yet it is very shallow and repetitive. You have the option to automate it, but then you end up missing certain magical items.

Secondly the game is VERY unbalanced:

[list]
    [*]You have scripted events that happen before fights that leave your team at a disadvantage (e.g. cutscene comes into play, your team bunches up into a single location and then get nuked by an AOE spell when the fight starts)

    [*]You have swarm mobs that are highly resistant to all types of damage, yet they can decimate your team in a single turn.

    [*]You find strong weapons then you fight enemies with AC so high, all of your attacks miss.

    [*]You find strong armor and trinkets that immensely increase your survivability, then get wiped in a single turn by an enemy that can somehow cast 3 level 8 spells in one turn.

    [*]You acquire strong spells that inflict a series of debuffs, then end up facing enemies that are immune to all of these debuffs.
[/list]

Eventually every fight turns in to a one-shot fest, either you kill the enemies in one turn or they get you.

There are also so many unimaginative puzzles which just slow down the gameplay.

I did not have fun fighting the fights.

I did not have fun solving the puzzles.

I did not enjoy the story (You are the chosen one & you have to save us all! - How original), and did not even bother chasing the ""secret ending"".

This game has no depth. It is a shallow tactical strategy and RPG bundled up together.

Here's flash news Owlcat: Stacking up multiple shallow games on top of each other neither creates depth nor ends up as an enjoyable game.

Owlcat did not skimp on any aspect of game design when creating WotR. It has just about everything you'd want in a good CRPG - great music, great writing, great dialogue and voice acting, fun, branching storylines, a good amount of reactivity to your choices, a depth of game content and mechanics, and an interesting setting with interesting characters. The game is more accesible than its predecessor, Kingmaker, with a number of quality of life features.

You'd expect a lot from a game that takes you from the mundane to the truly mythic, and it delivers.

It has a story with branching paths based on your chosen mythic path, and each feels unique. There is a large number of classes to choose from and consequently a variety of playstyles you can adopt. Together these features give the game a lot of replayability, and after you run through the game once, you'll find it difficult not to jump right back in to another campaign.

The companions are very well written and developed. Each has a decent set of quests forming a storyline with different outcomes, good amount of dialogue, great voice acting, and reactivity to your choices and mythic path.

If you're looking for a challenge, the game certainly has that. Try to get the Sadistic Game Design achievement, play through on Unfair difficulty, or try Last Azlanti mode. Or if you just want the to enjoy the story, you can do that too.

I've now finished my third complete run through the game, and it probably won't be my last. Each run itself can be quite long, especially if you are newer to Pathfinder, taking well over a hundred hours if you want to complete all available content. That's not to mention the time you might spend trying out different builds, backtracking if you want to undo a choice you've made, etc. This can honestly make the game feel a bit daunting, but you will probably be all the more satisfied by the time you do complete it.",1683055724,1683055724,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. Only some dialogues are voiced. Most of the time, I have to read the dialogues to understand the back story. It gets exhausting. 
2. You characters miss a lot, and enemies do too. Especially in turn-based mode, the joy of combat runs out really quickly when you mindlessly click attack and your character missed. Combat is fun if you are not using turn-based, however, it is extremely punishing to mistakes, and I find myself only do that when the battle is very one-sided.
3. Encounter design is monotone. Typically you and the enemies are placed into some open space; they are on one side, you on the other, go! Compared to popular RPG such as Baldur's gate 3 and Divinity 2, there is little interesting encounters where you can abuse the terrain or throw stuff. 
4. Your combat is won by using optimal builds, not by your wits. The character creation is an optimisation game. If you pick all the traits with stacking effects, and you know how to buff your characters with spells, combat is in easy mode.

Yet only about what? Ten builds overall actually work? 

The game is a slog to play through, with a majority of your experience being a dungeon combat crawler with the odds stacked against you, but not in a good way. Playing WotR is like playing Pathfinder with a DM who has an adversarial outlook at running a game. They don't want you to win, but they want you to lose and be ok with it enough to come back next week. If you're not intimately familiar with Pathfinder, you will need a guide in character creation. Combat does get boring fast, with much of it devolving into both enemies and allies missing each other until someone dies. 

The storyline is interesting, with characters like Lann, Camellia, and Ember being moreso over the polarizing others. Its however nothing to write home about. Demons bad, Crusade good. And I cannot stress this enough, if you wish to enjoy the actual game...please turn off crusade mode entirely. I wouldn't say its broken, but its a mode that has zero place on this table. If someone tell you they enjoy crusade mode, they are lying to you just to try to sleep with your ex. 

I've gotten to Drezen at the time of writing this and its an overwhelming slog. Rooms of same enemies with the ""Whispers of Madness"" debuff that makes the combat even more boring. Everytime I think I'm almost done...it keeps going. The dungeon is so long that your characters end up suffering with fatigue statuses if you don't rest. The game doesn't offer a rewarding challenge like Darkest Dungeon, just a frustrating one.

At the end of it, I understand TTRPGs are hard to emulate in videogames because the human, DM element is the biggest factor for enjoyment. TTRPGs are a social game, and whomever thinks differently probably has a history of being let go from jobs for not working well with others and blames management for it. This one isn't any different.

I don't know what the deal is, but Pathfinder just doesn't work for me in this game. Haven't played it tabletop but honestly I'd hate it there too.

The amount of bloat on the screen is outright insane. There are 500000 modifiers, hundreds of obviously useless fodder feats, obtuse-as-fuck information just everywhere.
Enemies seemingly have massive, just outrageous stat bloat as well, where normal cannon-fodder basic-bitch thieves got 18-20AC easily which just results in 10+ misses in a row from all 6 characters, some doing 2-3 attacks/round.

I got to Market Square in Act 1 (is it?) and playing turn-based the game it just ground to a halt. I cannot imagine how this would play out in higher levels and honestly micromanaging not 4, but 6 characters individually is nigh retarded.

I'm willing to put in the work, but having to sift through pages on pages on pages of useless garbage just to find the useful build components (and not search by the way!) is just not good game design.

Pathfinder, to me, is complex for the sake of complex and I imagine the game's story would be best enjoyed on that difficulty as well - fuck the combat and fuck 50%+ of the mechanics, what a boring slog of battling numbers just to get some hits in.

Pathfinder: WotR is still very D&D heavy, unlike Divinity 2's efforts to expand and move on from D&D conventional mechanics, but still a bit more flexible than most D&D games with many classes being very unique with nice twists that will suit any playstyle- so long as you search for them (took me 5 tries before I made a character that was more to my liking) and understand their mechanics. I also feel Divinity 2 was a bit more mod dependent. Pathfinder has mods, of course, but they're not as necessary to improve the overall experience.
I have always been a bit disappointed with the lackluster mechanics involved with any D&D-oriented game, but this one makes up for that. Keep in mind, this game is still more of a story than a gameplay distraction; gameplay is slow, even on the realtime setting, and it is not captivating. The story, world immersion, character development, and plot development are fantastic, however. The depth this has is immense. Lots of love put into it. I'm barely into this game and am enjoying it very much. It's a great game when you feel like reading a good book but still want more than that.
This game is not easy. I like a challenge but playing on Unfair difficulty really does feel unfair haha

It's a good game. Definitely worth putting time into, only so long as you actually have time to do so. The cons to this game are:
1) it is very time-consuming even when you're trying to rush everything. It's a slow game. This is typical for D&D games, though, so if you're used to that then you won't notice. 
2) The graphics aren't quite optimized. I have yet to see any artifacts or bugs with the visuals, but they are nowhere near impressive enough to put that much strain on my RTX 3080Ti. I have seen no reduction in performance on max settings, but the memory usage and heat generated doesn't jive. Something's up.
3) The visuals for your character are rudimentary and disappointing... and also kind of cartoonish looking? But not in the anime way. Seems out of place in a game like this, for my world-saving (or ending) legendary hero to look goofy. Might want to pick up some mods for that.

- There are literally dozens of classes and archetypes, that actually play and feel different
- The story telling is quite good, I like both the overall story and the companion stories. Also, depending on your alignment and the chosen mythic path, you can get very different conversations or even branches of the story
- There is a large variety of different companions with a broad range of classes and alignments, so you're not forced to play with the same party every time

I do have some small complaints, for example that the crusade mode feels more often than not like a chore that is mostly intended to stretch the game length, but these are generally minor issues.

There is however one very large complaint, which unfortunetely overshadows all the positives: balancing, or the lack thereof.
The balancing in this game is easily one of the worst examples in any RPG I've played so far. The problem is not simply that the game is too hard, its more that its completely inconsistent. It is completely possible for a given party to defeat one of the demon lords, one of the strongest beings in the game lore, without taking a single point of damage, and afterwards to get completely wiped by a random demon in a random cave on the world map. Also, the game suffers from ""stat inflation"" due to an overabundance of magical items and inflated character levels of enemies. This doesn't effect physical damage as much, because for every +5 sword there is a +5 armor, which keeps things more or less balanced. However, similar items for spells are much rarer, which leads to the effect that it becomes much harder to affect enemies with spells (because saving throws and spell resistance increase faster than the difficulty class of spells). Therefore, only a small selection of spells stays valid, mostly buffs and touch spells, and most of the ""interesting"" spells, such as curses, illusions or summons are more or less worthless. And this unfortunately means that much of the previously mentioned freedom in character building is lost.

Still, for the most part the game is fun, and I'm definitely going to finish my current campaign because I want to know how everything ends. But afterwards I'll probably put the game away until there is a very large rebalancing patch or mod available.

 [updated review following this:]
 I've since played dozens more hours of this game, and while all the above issues are still more or less in play, I've seen a lot more of the upside of this game. It was worth it for me to get on sale. The game has a ridiculous amount of content, seems to have legit branching story paths where choices actually matter, and not some KOTOR/Jade Empire nonsense where there's 3 endings and you can just choose which one you want before you fight the last boss. The various builds you can pull off are quite amusing, but I am left sorely wanting a way to respec my characters in a way that doesn't burn them to the ground back to lvl 1 - like maybe I just wanted to change up ONE feat selection, not the whole damn character. I probably would've like the story arc for kingmaker much better than this one, but it ends up being decent. Army management is a little jank, and breaks up progress in an irritating way, but it's not a deal-breaker.  One last thing: early (and even mid) game Grease spell is just absurd. Use it. Love it.

PAIZO should revoke the license for this developer and their publisher. Owlcat does nothing to make its forums and discussion groups safe for anyone who doesn't either hate or fetishize queer people. One of the reasons Pathfinder exists is because queer folks got tired of the bigotry in the D&D community and took the opportunity to follow PAIZO into a new story that they could see themselves in as more than the villains, seductresses, monsters or two dimensional saints that you'll see in Owlcat's games. Owlcat, you write terrible hetero romances; your queer romances are even worse, pure closet-case wish fulfillment. 

People like PAIZO, Mike Pondsmith and the folks behind Cyberpunk, and other decision makers in the roleplaying space need to stop sending queer soaked material to developers who in the case anyone in Russia literally aren't allowed to write anything nice about us, and in the case of Projeckt Red pushed us to the furthermost back of the narrative when they weren't fetishizing trans women. So MANY of us have put our whole hearts into the hobby, writing it, developing it, running Actual Plays and other important backend stuff that keeps gameshops in business. 

So if you're queer, don't spend money on this garbage. If you're not, don't waste your time either; either for the 'romances' or the game play you LITERALLY NEED MODS TO FINISH.

I genuinely loved about 60% of this game, with 20% being a nuisance ([i]I'm looking at you, Crusades[/i]) and 20% being pure, unadulterated, uncut hatred. So much so that in the final chapter of the game, I reached the point where I just wanted to be finished, uninstall it, delete all the saves, and never touch this trash again.

Also, I really enjoyed this game.

Did I mention I'm kind of ret**ded?

Anyway, allow me to explain.

Firstly, if you do NOT care about achievements and only want to play this game on Normal or Story difficulties, then you're going to have a blast, and I would actually give this game a 9/10 if you do. There is just SO MUCH content in this game, so many interesting builds, the story is passable--the writing is a bit weak, ([i]too much ""21st century modernspeak"", but we all know that decent writing is dead right now[/i])---and it really is worth the price tag.

IF, however, you want to get those juicy achievements, you're in for the most inconsistent experience of your pathetic nerd life. In order to get the majority of achievements, you MUST PLAY THIS GAME ON CORE DIFFICULTY ([i]or higher[/i]).

What does this mean?

This means that while the actual MECHANICS aren't that brutal, Owl Cat's balance 100% is. When I say that Core, and higher, difficulty is inconsistent, you better understand that I mean inconsistent like, ""[i]your brother who's addicted to drugs, but we all act like he's not to keep the peace in the family, but you all know he's stealing from you, and he swears he's clean but you never know what's going to trigger him and his addict rage[/i]"" inconsistent.

There are MULTIPLE moments in the game where standard trash fights are S T A C K E D with crazy mobs who are often stronger than single key bosses. The transition from Ch. 5 into the final act of the game is surreal. Go read some of the threads on R*ddit, people talking about how they've got their party built, they're finally feeling like demi-gods and having fun, then they enter the final Act and trash mobs are wiping their party in 2 - 3 turns or less. MEANWHILE THE FINAL FEW BOSSES ARE straight mid.

This happens CONSTANTLY throughout the game, and it's a genuinely frustrating experience.

Plenty of people have talked about Crusade mode, and I'm with them. It's not ""bad"" per se, but it's just a waste, imho. Even with all the updates--which have genuinely made it a better experience--it's still just the perfect example of adding something that didn't need to be added for the sake of being clever. Even God wouldn't judge you if you cheated Crusades.

Finally, if you're going to play this game and chase achievements in Core difficulty, or higher, I cannot stress enough that IF YOU ARE NOT A PATHFINDER NERD, and know the rules, spells, buffs/debuffs, and all the other minutia of PF, go and get party builds from someone like cRPG Bro, Mortismal Gaming, or Werglia on YouTube. Additionally learn how the party shoudl work and synergize. You cannot beat this game on Core ([i]or higher[/i]) without proper gear, proper party composition/builds, and practical knowledge of buffing and debuffing ([i]which is legit cool and gives the game depth[/i]). 

Still, even then, get mentally prepared for wild balance swings. You will encounter standard mobs who will just suddenly be immune to all your CC and then blast you in 1 or 2 turns, or even mobs with 75 - 90+ AC, while the boss they're gatekeeping has 50. As another individual stated, in the actual Pathfinder game, the highest state creature is [i]Lucifer, Prince of Darkness[/i] with a 39 CR and 74 AC. There are standard mobs in Core difficulty--CORE DIFFICULTY, THE ""AS DESIGNED"" DIFFICULTY--that can shove a ball gag in Lucifer's mouth and make him crawl around in a gimp suit.

Cool story, guys.

So.

However I've just gotten to the crusade mode, i didn't want to auto mode this (just as well, as looking around it seems this would have locked me out of plot and character development choices).

It's utterly terrible. I'm not even sure where to begin, it's unclear, slow, unbalanced, repetitive, and totally unskippable if you want to be able to explore everywhere or open up options to develop your character (selecting certain paths). Auto battle is utterly awful and the unit loss is massive compared to manually controlling (apparently this can result in a game over due to the AI being so bad with your units), the difficulty rating given to a fight does not actually seem to relate to how difficult that fight will be due to the enemy having a massive amount of options that as a player I don't have (troop size limits - i have 3 turns per round, they have 6, leader ability damage - their leaders can wipe out entire units with spammable abilities alone)

The bad: this game is convuluted, buggy, and poorly-documented.

The UI is a disaster--I cannot tell you how many times I wasted a turn in battle from a misclick or accidentally moving too far. The management section of the game is loading screen after unneccessary loading screen, which took an *abominable* amount of time for being installed on an SSD. There are dozens of little annoyances like this. If this game was shorter, this would be something I could brush off. Unfortunately, it's a proudly 100-hour RPG, and the niggling little issues only become more grating with time.

It's also very poorly documented. The wiki is a joke: expect to jump between wildly speculative reddit posts playing your favorite guessing game, ""bug or bad design?"" This unfortunately extends to many quests and characters, smashing the immersion that the lovely writing created as your trawl through forums and save editors looking for how to trigger some relationship flag with your waifu.

1st run 20 hours in quit because my paladin lost all his powers as a paladin because he was too good (yes because he did 1 too many acts of good he lost his powers...)

2nd Run realised I'd locked myself out of an important mythic quest because there are 3 possible solutions and all are easily missed (should be mentioned that one of them was I told the guy not yet, and now he doesn't talk to me anymore so not yet is now not never) and right now I can't face going back 5-6 hours to keep playing through the most tedious part of the game so far, a super fun city in the abyss (think hell but with edgelords) where the buildings move as the camera pans, so you can't just run across the city you have to micro manage all the way there. And yes everyone is out to betray and decieve you, how unexpected and not at all really over done and boring as hell (pun intended) by hour 10 in the place. If you played kingmaker and were bored by act 2s Fey HP sponge enemies who all have Dr and blur (20% miss chance) making them not threats just tanky and boring, its that with horns and 50 shades of grey dialogue, the level of cringe makes me suspect it was written by people who haven't met other any people let alone been touched by one.

That and the difficulty jumps all over the place so save scumming is near mandatory, expect by act 3 that 90% of your fights will be you walking over the enemy so hard that I didn't even bother to use buffs only to get instantly one shot out of nowhere by some random dude buffed to infinity. To give an example slaughtered everything no challenge, then fight a guy who in 1 round takes my tank from 100% about 200hp to -50 in 1 round, then the same with off tank with mirror image on them. But thats how it is just like an bad dm plans encounters, 95% cake walk 5% look at my super cool OC (do not steal).

Buy it on sale if you get it at all. 

Oh to give an example on the silly difficulty spikes I have a list of what 1 relatively normal guy you end up fighting (no indication he's a boss or anything) has as PERMANENT duration enchants on him (so he has this turn one of your fight, name is Latverk and he hes your average npc)
Bull's Strength
Cat's Grace
Owl's Wisdom
Fox's Cunning
Bear's Endurance
Barkskin
Heroism
Freedom of Movement
Spell Resistance
Echolocation
Protection from Good
Delay Poison
Mage Armor
Grand Mutagen Dex and Con
Shield
Death Ward
Shield of Faith
And this guy was by no means one of the tougher ones it's just one I happened to have screenshotted on discord to a friend while laughing at this games attempt at ""balance"".

The last thing I will mention that really really can ruin it for you is the bugs, these are minor and not gamebreaking BUT sometimes an NPC interaction won't occur or something similar, not a big deal, well no, unless they are required to complete a quest or get the games hidden ending, and because not only did they not happen but you (unless you're going through with a guide) would not know about them means you can be 20 hours into a playthrough only to find out that something that should have occured 6 hours ago didn't, and you now are going to either reload and do the last 6 hours over or accept you're going to miss content.

Encounter balance is all over the place which is my main turn off. It goes from NPC's being exploded into chunky salsa by your party members to one ""mini boss"" single handedly erasing your entire party from existence due to overinflated stats. Having an NPC encounter for lvl 6-7 party, with a ""boss"" who's over level 20+, has 5-7 permanently on/unable to dispell buffs, AC of 40+, immune to nearly everything with the remainder being high resistances, this is just idiotic.

Difficulty is arbitrary, there 2 types of fights, types you engage and fights that are engaged by dialogue/cutscene, if you engage the fight the person who gets spotted first gets ALL the aggro, in the latter case the main character receives ALL the aggro. This is obviously an outdated barebone type of ai, but this is also the main reason for difficulty, if you play a squishy mage you will have a bad time in some fights, enemies will beeline for you, they will ignore everything on their way to beeline to you. Hosillia is a random NPC Boss in the Shieldmaze, fight get started by cutscene = she wants to kill you, you can bodyblock her (with a tank, she will attack the tank then), once she hits 50% another cutscene will trigger, 2 imps spawn, all 3 enemies will now attack you, there is nothing due to spawn positions you can do to avoid her next attack, because you start inside her attack range, you might die there, its not something you can avoid. That’s the kind of difficulty you can expect from the game. Pokemon Gen 1 had more ai than this game, which is an achievement of its own.

They tried game design and failed horrible, shield maze, they did okay there, there is a miniboss who does cold damage and throughout the dungeon you find ways to circumvent cold damage so you have an easier time fighting the boss, on the other hand 1 act after that you can fight a miniboss who may give a character blindness, there is no potion or scroll at that point given to you that could help you there, you either know that that miniboss might cause blindness and have a way to remove ready, or you might suffer horribly (because if you move maps you might trigger an unavoidable “random” battle, it might be annoyingly hard with 1/2blinded charackters), because in order to dispel the blindness you need to buy that scroll, you might not know that there are scrolls that remove blindness, there no introduction to any ailment or to way to prevent ailments like these, then there are other mobs who are overtuned which might lead to instant game over screens, because once your mc dies the game over screen follows, even if there are ways to resurrect, and its fine reviving companions, unless your companion dies on a map with their specific quest, that also causes instant game over, which is not explained, of course.
It does not stop there, the performance is bad, and I’m pretty sure performance is bound to inventory space in some twisted way, at least with my hardware, also not really a lot of ways to increase performance, this game runs worse than cyberpunk, for me.
Its also riddled with bugs, to the point where you adjust your gameplay to accommodate the bugs, its very dangerous to cast touch range spells on party members unless you manually move to them, if they move you might lose the spells/scroll and look like a wanker, workaround: move manually inside the cast range and then cast that spell (in turn based mode). Tons of visual bugs: Main Model Male Human Body clips with every cloak in game while wearing heavy armor, if you dare to wield a 1 handed weapon with a cape, your cape suffers a permanent seizure. 
There is no difficulty curve to speak of, you start to outscale enemies heavily past act 4, to the point where fighting becomes a chore, there are also no special mechanics during boss fights or anything to spice gameplay up, in that sense a mean lord of locust is the same as puny imp, maybe that imp knows blindless so he might be worse.
I don’t want to talk about the might and magic minigame, its bad, its very very bad, one of the worst minigames in video game history.

Developed by Owlcat Games, this new iteration raises the bar in almost every aspect. With a richer story, more immersive interactions, and an upgraded visual and audio experience, Wrath of the Righteous stands tall as a must-play for fans of the RPG genre.

Story:
The story in Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is more captivating than its predecessor. Set in the demon-infested Worldwound, players are tasked with leading the Fifth Crusade to close the abyssal rift and save the world. With a variety of branching narratives and numerous potential outcomes, the plot keeps players engaged from beginning to end. The well-written dialogue and fleshed-out lore further immerse players in the world of Golarion.

The game offers a wealth of side quests and storylines, each populated with memorable characters that help to make the world feel alive and authentic.

Party Building and Companions:
Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous boasts an impressive array of potential companions, each with their own unique skills, abilities, and personalities. This allows players to customize their party to their liking, encouraging experimentation and replayability. The game also introduces Mythic Paths, powerful abilities that significantly impact gameplay and narrative, adding another layer of depth to the character progression system.

Graphics and Visuals:
Graphically, Wrath of the Righteous is a significant step up from Kingmaker. The environments are more detailed and varied, and character models and animations have seen substantial improvements. The game's distinct visual style effectively brings the world of Golarion to life, immersing players in the vibrant and dangerous landscapes that await them.

Audio and Sound Design:
The game's audio is top-notch, with a fantastic soundtrack that complements the on-screen action and heightens the emotional impact of key moments. Sound effects are crisp and immersive, and the game supports surround sound, further enhancing the player experience. The voice acting is also noteworthy, with talented actors delivering engaging performances that bring the characters to life.

[i] While many aspects of this game are good, or even great, it's held back by a slog of difficult, similar combat encounters, and a crusade management system that feel there to ultimately drag out gametime. Trim most of the fat away and you're left with what could have been a great game with many interesting ideas. If you enjoy these kinds of games I'd recommend you take a look at games like Knights of the Old Republic, Pillars of Eternity 2 or Divinity 2 Original Sin instead. [/i]

[b] For the full length ramble: [/b]

After what was apparently 160 hours of playtime I finally managed to get through this game's campaign I have some thoughts, and figured what better way to get them out of my game than throughout a review? So let's begin!

I think many aspects of this game was done well, the music pulled you into the action and especially in combat. The story felt competently written and while not incredible by any means it served it's purpose of setting the stage for the gameplay. A big part of these kinds of games is creating your character, and the game provide many tools and options for you to do so. 

Many of the characters was interesting or at least interesting to interact with. I think much of what made me finish the game (beyond a sunk-cost fallacy) was to see how many of the companion stories ended. 

A big part of this game is the Mythic powers you obtain throughout the story. You have many options for the source of those powers, from angelic to demonic (which I went with), to liches, superpowers. With every power comes a different story and different mechanical benefits, and if I'll ever play through this game again it's going to be to explore the other paths. Beyond their stories and benefits they could also be used in different conversations, many times for your benefit but seldom to your detriment, as I once found myself having to solo a boss and promptly died.


With that death in mind let's talk about mechanics and the gameplay, and I have mixed thoughts:


If you have played games in the series of Neverwinter Nights, or Knights of the Old Republic, the pathfinder games will have a lot of familiarity to you. All these games base their mechanics from the same tabletop game, and in the realtime game mode these games handle very similarly. I thought with this previous knowledge I wouldn't have much trouble with WOTR (Wrath of the Righteous) and I was very, very wrong.

The difficulty in this game is brutal, even on normal difficulty. I had fights in this game where my team had a 5% chance of landing a hit on my enemy, while they had a near guaranteed hit on any of my characters, and were very likely to take even my tankiest of characters down in one round. 

Part of the problem is 95% of your enemies are demons. Demons, while usually being strong on their own, all have elemental resistance and immunities, and a flat % chance for your spells against them. Many of of them are immune to conditions, or have very low chances of succumbing to your spells. The opposite is usually true for your own team, and there were a few fights throughout the game where fights felt unfair because of this.

To even be effective in one aspect such as offense, your other abilities usually suffer, and when you find yourself in a fight when your speciality will be ineffective, that character will be useless for that fight. Such was the case with the companion Nenio in my party, who after a certain point had little use beyond the (admittedly very useful) hastes she could provide. 


There's also a lot of combat in this game, and a lot of difficult combat encounters. You have to prepare for many of these encounters, cast buffs beforehand, which was a timeconsuming process. Sometimes a character would die (but depending on the difficulty options they will come back to life after combat, an option I eventually chose), which leads to them losing all their buffs and sometimes forced me to start the buffing process all over. The annoyance of this process has to be experienced, it can't merely be explained. A simple fix such as an action queue for each character, or an autobuff feature would really have helped with this aspect. 

Anyway, point is this game has too many copy paste, meaningless and difficult combat encounters. Encounters that forced me to use the time consuming turn based combat (rather than the much faster real-time one) for better control so I didn't waste too many resources. 

The game even ends with the same brutal combat encounter 4-5 times in a row before the final boss. 

While I sometimes enjoyed the challenge this game offered me, you'll have to be a glutton for punishment to enjoy all the difficult combat in this game. You'll need a lot more knowledge of the classes, their features and interactions to make the most minmaxed and optimized builds for yourself and also your companions, or you'll need a higher degree of patience to find these builds other people have put together online. 


Another gripe I have with this game is the campaign management system. Throughout the game you'll eventually become the commander of a war against the invading demons. I went into this game blind, and it's a part of it I'd rather be without. (There is actually a difficulty option to automate this part of this game, so you can ignore it, just know that enabling this option will lock you out of certain endings). 

While I appreciated the choices being the commander let me make, the campaign management system itself was a slog to get through, with a lot of waiting to get projects done, and the fights while sometimes challenging and engaging was usually a slog and a timeconsuming process. 


Another part of the game I had an overall negative feeling towards was exploration and puzzles. 

The exploration itself is serviceable, but a few areas are timeconsuming and annoying to navigate. This is especially true for many of the areas in the Abyss, with the labyrinth and Alushinyrra being particularly chaotic. Alushinyrra, a city of demons, is particularly worth mentioning. 

A whole act of the game is spent here, and in the beginning it's a breath of fresh air compared to the combat filled and sloggish act it follows. It's a location filled with many interesting characters and quests, and while still offering quite a bit of combat it's not as frequent as in the former acts. Unfortunately it's held back by a few annoying mechanics. 

Many of the areas are linked by portals and can't be walked between, making clicking on the map to go where you want unfeasible, making all the backtracking required in this act more arduous and annoying than it needed to be. 

And another aspect adding to the annoyance is the mechanic tied to this place. Certain aspects and part of the city rotate and change based on the rotation of your camera. This means based on your rotation aspects of the area will change, opening some paths and closing others, it is a novel idea when you first begin exploring the city, but quickly becomes annoying when you are walking to and from. I think it might have been an interesting idea and could make for engaging dungeon design, but how it was implemented in this city made it a hinderance and annoyance. 

The puzzles are frustrating. I can't decide whether they are hard, or just obtuse, and many require detailed reading of books and notes found in the environment or on characters. Something I am less inclined to do after slogging through the combat. I am usually not opposed to the occasional puzzle, but I ended up googling for the solution for 90% of them.

Also install either the Toybox mod or a save editor since this game is amazingly buggy.

The Good:
•The story is on point.
•The voice acting is good.
•The NPCs are varied.
•There are fun and unique items that aren't just cookie cutters out of the core book.
•The game is pretty.
•The devs have a good ability to tell a story.
•I don't use it, but the ability to put the crusade on automatic and just enjoy the party focus is nice.
•There are fun little puzzles in the game that make you pay attention.

The Overwhelming Bad:
•The amount of weapons that only do something unique on critical hits feels over done. It feels like I'm being handed gimmicks rather then a useful or story interesting thing. That covers most of the weapons.

•There's content you'll pay for and silently never realize you missed without looking it up online. Which sounds like a pro for later replays.  In practice think game-master that thinks their puzzle is simple because they already have the solution. Think game-master that is also forgetting to hand out critical clues. The game doesn't do this with the main plot, but that's all I can say for that.

•Spell resistance is almost everywhere in the game to the point of being broken. It feels like someone threw the sheer amount of Spell Resistance into the campaign on a whim without understanding or because someone kicked them.

The only real problem I have with the game is the insane AC some enemies have. On Normal Difficulty there were some enemies, who weren't optional bosses or even really bosses, that had insane AC.

The gameplay is fun, the story is cool, but at the same time the script is cool it is a bit dumb.
While playing an evil character, I eventually turned into something that people should be shocked when they saw me, or at least make them uneasy, but besides some people acknowledging that I was evil, no one seems to care about the huge, winged, horned dude talking with them.
At first the game didn't feel like the choices would have repercursions, but most of the decisions impact in some way or another, but depending on how you wanna roleplay your character, some answers are really disconnected from some alignments, Chaotic answers, for instance, seem more like ""free spirit"", which would be okay for a chaotic neutral char, but if you are chaotic evil they mostly make no sense at all.
But the worst part, that was kept from the first game, is the balance, you can breeze through past most monsters, then suddenly every monster has 60+ AC and it's pretty much impossible to play it without min maxing, that takes away a lot from an RPG game. Sure, some people like doing combos and such, but if you don't do a little research on combos you won't get past some bosses, especially the last one, the last act you can pretty much leave it on auto until you reach that bitch. I had to reload and change all my tactics to get past that thing.

The Good:
*Engaging story with lots of mystery. 
*Variety of playstyles between classes and mythic paths. There are many directions you can go and all of them are viable (for normal difficulty, at least)
*Variety of party members who are both memorable and feel fleshed out.
*Robust difficulty system. You can interact with almost all aspects of an rpg's difficulty to tailor the game to what you want to experience.
*There's a lot of content, I mean A LOT, but you don't have to go through all of it if you don't want to.
*Crusade mode is a marked improvement over Kingmaker's Kingdom Management.

The Not-So-Good:
*Crusade Mode still has a bit to go. It's not something you can just ignore, as certain paths require you to have to manually do Crusade Mode
*The story can have pacing and scope issues.
*The game will sometimes railroad you into situations that make it seem like your prior hard work was for naught.

It has such a plethora of Roleplaying options and gameplay mechanics that you can play through it multiple times and it still feels fresh. Managing a kingdom feels fun and meaningful. The story is intense and dark, rife with twists and turns that leave you wondering whats next. 

The real drawbacks are twofold. First, the army system. Its a basic grid you move some soldiers around on. Frankly, its boring and nothing more than a hassle. I would suggest either ditching the mechanic and making a large scale battle along the lines of the seiges, or lean further in and have the battles take place on a Fire emblem esque board instead. The second issue spawns from how ambitious the game is. It simply cannot flesh out every option as much as others. There are certain mythic paths and questlines that didnt get nearly as much love, and when you run into them it becomes very clear. There will be moments where you clearly should be able to do an action in character, but it just wasnt implemented. This isnt the case for the more popular paths though, so I dont think its a major demerit. 

I run through the two issues so much because I want the games to continue to improve. I LOVED Kingmaker despite its flaws, and WOTR is a HUGE step up in quality. I pray they continue this trend as I believe they could eclipse even Larian Studios in quality soon. Their storytelling is already rivaling Larian and their gameplay just gets better and better.

For a 60$ base tag, and an another 60$ for the DLC-s, it is not worth the full price.
Here is why:
- an enormous amount of bugs and glitches
- unpolished combat (lots of random breaks and mistakes happened)
- quests often broken or not registered
- choices are usually just of the Y/N type. Rarely do you have options that TRULY matters.
- character alignment switching is sometimes just dumb and make no sense (paired with the lack of valuable choices)
- higher difficulties are just stupid sadistic and not fun to play
- the entire crusader mechanic (the overworld management and the army battles) are probably the worst part of the experience.
- achievements not being registered correctly (had to roll back a save multiple times)

However, what did make me think of this game in a `positive` light, is that the game is extremely good for a deep RP session, exploring everything and trying everything out. Mythic path choices do matter a lot, but sadly that is the gist of what actually matters during the entire game. Anyway, there is a lot to do, a lot to explore, and a lot to read through. 

I was really hooked from start to finish on my first campaign, but in the next ones, those feelings dropped fast, because there is a long haul until you can choose a different approach to things. What also is sad, is that you can only try out your character and party to the fullest in the last chapter (not counting `epilogue`), which for me is way too late. You have already completed 80-90% of the campaign and only NOW I can do what I was building my character for? 

Characters are mostly well made, with some `basic filler` characters as exceptions, but the deeper connections with them are so strict...like the game only gives you the options to either romance them or ignore them, which is really limiting the whole roleplay factor (all actions with them lead to two paths, romance or rejection...).

Other than the story, the one other place where this game shines is the combat and how complex things can truly be, so big props to that.

Overall, its a solid 8/10 game, that should have received a lot more love.

(while i recommend this game, essenitaly this is a negative review. be warned.)

i wanna like this game. i really wanna like this game. i find it reall hard to like this game.
first time i played it on release - i didnt like it for the most part. didnt find the story too engaging, characters were kinda meh, gameplay was fine for the most part, bit more interesting than in kingmaker, but alot more unbalanced and broken.
months later, after lotsa patches and big updates, i finally played and finished it and, well...
insane difficulty spikes, straight up OP bullshit encounters, the outrageous amount of bugs even after so much fixing... broken buffs/debuffs that last forever and even if u manage to remove em they will apear again after a save/load, or just disappear and then appear again spontaneously; broken turns and initiative in turn based mode, bugs that force u into RTwP (pretty often enemies who's been knocked prone will be stuck in the prone animation, effectively makin their turn last forever with no way around, which forced me to go into RTwP), sometimes even side quests broke, not playin the intended cutscenes makin u stuck or have u to load ancient saves. the game can be beaten tho, i havent encountered any game-breaking bugs, and havent seen anyone who did, but those little things just pile up, reducing the enjoyment of the game.

in my previous review, which i wrote after quittin the game at act 4, i was complainin bout the whole mythic thing, callin it OP. i take my words back. without any mythic things, i think this game would be nearly impossible to beat. because there r alot of very... interesting encounters. usually it's just side bosses or random nameless mobs in a dungeon, who r way stronger than any boss in the game lol.

next: the overall story, lore and characters. lore is fine, i do like pathfinder lore and this game has alot of interesting things to say about it, things to learn. story... subjectively, is not really good, i enjoyed kingmaker alot more, here i was not engaged in the story for the most part. characters... again, subjectively, i liked about... 4 characters in the whole game. the rest i either hated or didnt care about. (if u unironically enjoy being violent, selfish, cruel and overall evil - u will probably have a blast, but this aint for me personally.

crusade managment is okay, i didnt like it at first but got into it and it turned out to be quite fun, not as time consuming and overwhelming as kingdom managment in kingmaker. 
overall, even tho this game has lotsa replayability with mythic paths, while i would be interested in seein the story from another side, i dont think i can suffer throu the gameplay again (been playin on core btw, switched to easy one time for the sake of seein the difference - it's huge, too easy aint fun either)

conclusion: better go play kingmaker again. and this time just quit before the C A S T L E, so u could have the most fun and the least amount of frustration. the only ppl ive seen on the interent who seemed to enjoy the game, r those who played for the story on easy modes, or those who know the ruleset from A to Z and minmax on unfair, only caring for gameplay. and thats fine, im glad at least some ppl found this game enjoyable. but sadly, i didnt. but whats even more sad - is that we dont have alot of games like this, u know. huge rpg adventures with some fun party based combat, i think ive played like literally every modern game like this and most of the older ones. so the point is - i dont really have alot to choose from...
but anyway, dont listen to me, if u like games like this, if u enjoyed the kingmaker - go for it, i encourage u to try and i sincerely hope u will have a different experience and actually enjoy the game. just be warned and expect to be somewhat frustrated at times. peace.

P.S.: i also didnt like the fact that there isnt a bestiary..? like, if i meet a demon who wants to talk, i wanna read all the common knowledge bout this demon to know what to expect, like i did in kingmaker and lotsa other games.. this game dont have that. ;-; but then it hit me - they prolly didnt add bestiary so the fact that a certain demon has a certain buff/effect on them wouldnt be questioned more than it already is. like, seriously, sometimes the affects and abilities ur enemy has make ZERO sense, given who or what ur enemy is. its just there for the difficulty. and its meh.",1664973214,1681310271,True,0,0,0.492537319660186768,0,True,False,False

As you get into act 2 the game really does start to develop and display why it is such a popular title. However, Crusader mode being in this game is a mistake. It's bad. It is a cool idea executed poorly, and can punish an unsuspecting player pretty harshly. I imagine after certain events this system also develops more, however, I opted to turn Crusader mode off, which cannot be undone and may cause you to miss a small number of side quests. Small price to pay to skip it I say. It was just a bad decision to have the possibility of a game ending scenario BEFORE you are even given full access to the system.

 In my opinion there are far too many spells, many of which are useless nine times out of ten. So out of the vast spellbooks I tended to rely on a small handful that consistently were effective. Casters seem pretty crappy honestly. 
********
 It really lacks quality of life stuff, has some small issues with, ironically, pathfinding...and the UI is abysmal. It's like they said ""let's take familiar concepts and complicate them for no reason."" Story is good, dialogue is good, characters are cool...controlling them sucks. Leveling sucks. Action economy sucks. Inventory management sucks. I am not big on graphics generally...bad graphics don't bother me, but spell animations and combat in general is bland and underwhelming. This game took some of the best elements of crpg's, but also somehow came up with a few of the worst interpretations of those elements as well. I saw massively positive reviews, heard all the hype, watched it on streams...and once I got in I cant help but feel like this game is fighting me as I try to play it. This game hits some awesome 10/10 notes and truly sets the bar in some areas. The classes themselves and versatility of the level up process seem awesome. Unfortunately for me, a lot of the basics lack refinement and polish, causing them to get in the way. I know it has a ton of content...I bought it at $15-$20 on sale. So far it feels like a $20 full price game. It just isn't quite there. I keep faith I will change my mind as I get further, and if I do I will change the review.

I'm not sure I should recommend, because I somehow packed away close to 60 hours over Easter after starting the game. It must be doing something right.
On the whole I'd say the writing and quality has improved since Kingmaker and I think the game also benefits from a stronger theme and core plot, that is, the 5th Crusade. Most of the world does agree that the Demons are kind of prickish and we'd rather they do that sort of thing on their own Plane in their own time.

The combat and class system are all still there and still Abyssal-ly deep, ha ha.

There are few point where the difficulty spikes hard where every trash fight only for it drop down hard and everything is a breeze again (Blackwater I'm looking at you) but the combat is still fun after the buff so not that big of an issue.

Updating my review here.  Just finished the game.  The 2nd half of the game is much better than the first and the story line is actually quite cool.  I don't own any of the DLCs so this is based on a ""vanilla"" verion play-through from start to finish.  In the end, recommend this one if you like party-based RPGs.


 there is a in in-game mechanic called ""abyssal corruption"" which necessitates returning to your home city often to rest and ""cleanse"" - i feel like this adds a lot of unnecessary travel back & forth.  overall, definitely not a bad game.  if it's on sale and you like RPG games like baldurs gate or neverwinter nights you will probably enjoy it.",1679250322,1681089535,True,9,1,0.617116093635559082,0,True,False,False

Beyond the rules, this is just a classic tabletop RPG campaign. No multiplayer is a little sad, but the story is absurdly flexible with nearly infinite character customization options for yourself and your companions (which can also be streamlined by auto leveling if you're less worried about that). While the overall structure of the story follows a relatively set path, the ways your choices color that path and change the world state are awesome.

Its definitely better Kingmaker. Most of the shit that would make you ragequit is gone. The game isnt so unforgiving anymore (default difficulty is actually one step lower than in Kingmaker). There are almost no timers anymore and I dont think its possible to fuck up your crusade by accident, while in Kingmaker leading your country was like walking through a minefield. 

Voice acting is fantastic, I just cannot praise it enough. Minagho, Arueshalae, Areelu, they all sound great, Areelu sounds actually exactly like what you would expect, looking at her artwork. Actresses did a stellar job. Camilia is well done too. Men sound good too, but I found women roles more memorable. 

The story and writing... Is actually pretty good. While you can have a few gripes, particularly with Nenio character, or that many people dont really behave like their aligment suggest (paladin girl especially isnt lawful, more something between neutral/chaotic, theres literally just one moment in the game where she behaves lawful stupid. Arueshalae definitely doesnt show much of her chaotic side too, but as she is the best girl, she is forgiven). While I find Ember amusing, she could be written better. Some characters, like Woljif, are too ""quirky"" and can get on your nerves. 

The story itself is a righteous crusade against demons. While it sounds boring at first, its written in such a way, that it is actually quite refreshing. It really has its moments. Its over the top epic, demons are cruel, people die left and right, angels and gods themselves take part. I am impressed.

Mythic part of the game is quite well done, too. Throughout the game you gain lots and lots of power, and you really feel it, both during normal encounters, as in the story. You ever wanted to be a real angel, smiting evil? Yeah, in this game a demon will beg and cry and grovel before you, while your sword shines blue from your (and your godess) righteous rage. You want to be a lich, leading an army of undead? You can do that too, however I didnt test that path yet. There are many possibilities, and while some paths are done better than others (particularly swarm-that-walks supposedly sucks), 

So, whats the problem? Well, one of the problems Pathfinder has... Is the Pathfinder roleplaying system by itself. In this game, sick power creep is real. Stats are often bloated and that leads to bullshit. For example - lvl 20 Arueshalae skill lets you kill your favoured enemy in an instant, if he fails his fortitude throw. For my Arueshalae, this throw difficulty is 29. Arueshalae herself has an fortitude save of 24. That means, to die from her own max lvl skill, she would have to throw 4 or less on d20. Thats 20% chance of the skill working. One in Five tries. And many, many enemies will have a lot higher save than that, so that skill is, for most part, completely useless. There are many examples like that, many spells that are just completely worthless or require from you to stack all possible bonuses to that one thing to even have a chance for them to work. 

I also fail to understand why in this game are still items with plain wrong names, like Hellknight Full Plate +3, which is named just ""Full Plate"". Isnt it a mistake that should be found and corrected really early? 

Also, the carnivorous cristals and their subsonic hum. Normally, they should be able to stun you for one round and then youre protected from that stun. The second part isnt implemented. Three of these guys can stunlock your whole party forever, more so, they can stunlock absolutely everything forever. They also petrify on hit, and then next hit is an instant death. A stunned character is helpless and attacks against him hit automatically. Jesus christ, one room with three of these guys made me reload more than Demon Lord Baphomet. Yeah, there is one spell that protects you from that. But you have to have it. I didnt. I suppose the devs know about that problem, as Carnivorous Cristals in DLC do not have subsonic hum anymore. Then why not patch this shit out of the main game, too? Is it really so hard? Those arent enemies that you meet once and never more. While they are rare, you will fight them more than few times. 

Also, DLC for this game are plain shit, dont buy them at all. Not worth any money, not worth your time at all. I am playing through treasure isles right now and its just boring time sink. Its actually made in such a way, that if you want achievements and good loot you would have to sink a LOT OF TIME in it. While theres absolutely nothing there other than just combat without any narrative with boring, repeating enemies, boring, small modifiers and loot full of swords +1 and cloaks of protection +2. Also, mindless Zombies with MAXIMIZED MIRROR IMAGE. ALL OF THEM. Care to explain, how a fucking zombie casts on himself an illusion spell of what, 6th lvl? Yeah, I know why it is like that. So they wont die in one hit, you first have to waste 9 attacks to dispell the mirror image, or waste your spell slots on true seeying. 

Well fuck you, I would like it better if there would be 10 zombies, not one zombie with 9 mirror images.",1681034977,1681034977,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you like party management, crusade management, companion side quests then that's all well and good. I like the solo play for the XP boost and not needing to share items.

First and foremost are the bugs, every patch seems to ""fix"" some while at the same time making more or in some cases things that are meant to work just don't and you have to wait for the next patch for it to hopefully get resolved. Example: Dhampir characters are considered undead yet when targeted by enemy negative channel/Inflict spells they aren't healed when they should be.

Next, the companions are planks of wood that I would use just for the side quests but really I would rather not have them as most of their character bios are pretty generic and predictable. You are forced in the Prologue to keep hold of them until you can (finally) make it to the start of the first act. I attempted killing them early only to have the prompt ""X is dead!"" and have to reload because X companion is supposedly detrimental to continuing progress. 

No reason is given for why they need to be alive, just simply ""oh they are dead, now restart."" Even with resurrection items the game wont allow you to continue if one plank of wood drops to the floor (in the Prologue anyway).

Eventually after all is said and done you will eventually get fatigue or exhaustion when travelling, there are only a few ways to prevent this but if you don't dip into certain classes (Oracle) then be prepared to camp. The game starts you off by telling you time is of the essence and you have maybe two days at most to clear a whole map of enemies without getting tired. Lesser/Restoration potions/scrolls are available but as soon as you use them the effects just return in literally a blink of an eye. 

Enemies in certain difficulty levels receive permanent buffs that cannot be dispelled or removed, Daring/Core to be specific. They get high natural armor, high saves, high BAB, ability to see through invisibility and a plethora of other BS. Also note that monsters which in typical D&D tabletop settings have challenge ratings due to their abilities, but in WoTR monsters also have class levels. Let's take the Babau demon for example, these are typical challenge level 4 monsters on tabletop, but in WoTR they have levels in rogue and sometimes are invisible. Run into a group of them and it's sneak attack damage done to you in massive amounts. All they need is just one ally to flank you and that's it.

I return to this game only if I have the time and patience for it, waiting and hoping that some aspects will be fixed or will actually work as the game says it should. DO NOT buy this at full price, wait for a sale as this game is needing more time and tweaking.

While for some it may be a bonus but the game contains a lot of unvoiced text, a decent amount of time spent is reading text, every question usually has multiple paragraph replies, after a very short while I just ended up skipping most of it until meaningful options appear. While, this isn't necesscarily a bad thing if you are into it, and want to spent a decent time getting engrossed in the lore through written text. 

The mixed combat is actually good classic dice rolling affaire, with the ability to switch to turn based on the fly, this is where the game shines, and you will be doing A LOT of it, being able to adjust the difficulty on the fly is key, If i am struggling with a fight to the point of no longer enjoying it, i will just bump it down touch for the fight. Character creation has an insane amount of variety and complexity, with every spell/ability being accompanied by a really long explanation of how it works, and there are a lot of them. Character levelling feels like a chore, having to read through a butt tonne of abilities; especially if your character has any kind of magic. Once again, if you have plenty of free time on your hands, love geeking out an insane amount of abilities that all seem to confuse to average player and love reading fantasy text, this game would be pretty neat.  After adjusting my ego, I dropped the difficulty to Daring ( just above normal), this has actually made the game more enjoyable, as I dont have to constantly worry about Min/Maxing my characters and reading every ability I dont really want to read, I can just pick what I want to without worrying about if it was the optimal build for my character ( which is key on harder difficulties) 

Ultimately for me; outside some combat this game sometimes drag a bit, (get the run fast out of combat MOD!) Even though I love fantasy and the world and premise felt good, I just couldnt read that much text and still pretended I cared about how someone joined the knights of the silver pink ladys paladins, I do skip a lot of text and just read the core story, I may be missing some major lore building but feels pretty good, there is actually some cool battles/ideas as you fight the world of demons, and its not always just meaningless fight after meaningless fight. The game seems to have alot of bloat complexity, with a decent amount that could be trimmed.  For me there is still a lot of bloat, abilities, boring looting(ugggh),

Still big shoutout to the Developers for making something so complex, I can see people who are into it, being super into it, especially fans of Pathfinder Table top etc, I'm sure it must of been one hell of a job, 

I would give it a 7.5 abouts, I am just a sucker for these kind of games, ( still i wish they would just implement well done action points, which i know is sacrilege and going against the pathfinder system, but divinity 2 nailed the challenging set pieces and combat!) , i would probably prefer less fight but more meaningful, well curated ones. either way im still playing it so it cant be too crap, ( and thats after deleting it outa frustration and later reinstalling it!)

Developers, who I like, are constantly fiddling with the game, trying to fix bugs and causing additional issues in the process. After many hours of playtime without issue, the latest patch has made it so the save file doesn't load. Custom Portraits no longer work properly, and on it goes. Even switching back to a beta version of the game, that does seem to fix some of the problems caused by the new patch, doesn't allow your saves to work, meaning at any point while you are playing, the developers could screw things up and kill hours of play time.

I was the Game Master for a Pathfinder campaign I was running for my friends. A custom campaign in a hand-crafted world made just for us. The plan was to have the players go from level 1 nobodies to mythical heroes upon whose shoulders rested the fate of not just the world, but all of creation. And you know what? For almost 3 fantastic years, they were those heroes. This was only the 3rd campaign I have personally run in over a decade of playing ttrpgs but it was by far the best I had run. I knew that I wanted it to be a mythic campaign, and that I would hit them with a big twist at the end of the first act so that they could go into act 2 hopped up on that mythic juice. The silver dragon who protected the realm would fall and the players would have to harness powers rivaling the gods to defeat the foes responsible.

Imagine my surprise when there I was on launch night, streaming the start of my new playthrough of the highly anticipated Wrath of the Righteous for all of my Pathfinder group, when the opening scene plays. You know, when Deskari first appears and slays Terendelev? That opening scene. Yeah. Everyone saw it. I tried not to make it obvious, but failed pretty miserably. Then, and at many other points in my first playthrough of WOTR, I would run into another minor or major thing that I had prepared for my campaign, only to find it in WOTR. This birthed the inside joke of ""They stole my idea!"" within the party. Just to name a few besides the silver dragon thing: I put a Mecha-Succubus into my world? Blackwater quest happens. Mephistopheles starts to take an interest in the players? I see a youtube video of The Merchant of Souls himself in a future mythic path's story.  One of the players was going to get an intelligent magic item? I run into Finnean. And many, many more.

When I was approaching the climax of my first playthrough of WOTR I encountered a very unfortunate bug that broke the game. See, I had made a poor choice earlier in the story, and when the time came for me to slay Deskari, all the badass one-liner dialogue options were tied to a mythic path and, well, I didn't have a mythic path. So I was faced with an option. Reload a prior save, or start a new game. I chose the latter and am so glad that I did. Instead of going Trickster>Legend I went Angel>Dragon and while it still had it's fair share of bugs as well as just bullshit difficulty spikes, none of that could take away from the Awe I felt when I first got mythic powers. When the soundtrack kicked in every time you gained a mythic rank to make you feel like the most incredible badass to ever grace the planet of Golarion. How poignant and touching some of those stories were. At first I joked that ""They were stealing my ideas"", but the more I played the more I realized that I was now starting to look to Owlcat's amazing adaptation of the Pathfinder system, and the incredible story that they and Paizo put together, that I realized that I was playing not only because it was a beautiful and empowering story of overcoming all odds, but it let you do it your way. I started looking to the game for reference. How do I communicate the otherworldly sensations of gaining mythical powers?How do I help my players feel like there are great things at stake? How do I deal with a budding romance in my story? How in the Hells am I actually going to build the statblock for this Mecha-Succubus? WOTR helped me with those questions, and inspired me to ask many more.

Wrath of the Righteous is such a faithful and masterful adaptation of the pathfinder setting by Owlcat that it is what I as a GM now look to when planning out my own stories. Despite the issues I suffered with my first playthough, I enjoyed it and the next immensely and am looking forward to my next venture into the 5th crusades. Oh, and Anevia helped me realize some things about myself too.

Unfortunately, the campaign I was running dissolved. I will not go into details about what happened, but it was deeply personal.

So there you have it. WOTR is a masterful adaptation of the Pathfinder setting that teaches you more about the world and it's characters than some books, it has a number of fantastic storylines that reflect the choices you make. It has amazingly written characters, some of whom were able to move me to tears with their personal journeys. It helped me process parts of my own identity though exposure to like-minded individuals with whom I could relate. And most importantly, It makes me feel like a fucking heroine. And sometimes, I really need that.

The main selling point of this game is being able to really live your fantasy. 

This is a TRUE rpg, unlike some other titles that always markets itself as open world but nothing you do have any consequences. 

The game really starts poorly, it's incredibly linear and slow at first but eventually you just get absorbed into this world. Act3 is about when the game really gets good (~30 hours to reach..). This game knows how to immerse the players. Simple things like camping, companions banter, having a base, a pet and etc just add so much to the core fantasy experience.

Major cons are the level design and puzzles.Level designs are just poorly thought out. Cleared dungeon? Backtrack all the way. 

What's truly horrible are the puzzles. The puzzle clues are extremely obtuse, if any clue at all. Overly complicated, tiresome, 1 in a million possible solution, 50 steps to solve, no reset, stuck in puzzle room. It's just the stuff of nightmare fuel.

Most of the other shortcomings of this game is due to it's low budget production, understandable, since the devs aren't some big studio. Sparse voice acting, boring VFX, low poly asset, low enemy variety. All of these can be resolved by having a larger budget. BUT, the original price of this game is so much more expensive for how low the production value is. Divinity 2 has much higher production value, and much cheaper. By selling your game at $40/50, there's certain expectation on production value, and this game definitely did not deliver. I would not purchase at full price.

The story, art and character writing are all fantastic. It's rare that I sink my teeth into games anymore but this one has had me by the balls for a good while now. 
But I have to warn people who've not played pathfinder or more specifically, the previous pathfinder video game before jumping in. 
This game is based on Pathfinder 1st edition, an older tabletop system that has a lot of depth and potential player expression. It's good fun once you wrap your head around it even if I personally prefer 2nd edition and D&D 5e as they are more straightforward. If you're unsure what you're doing you can always look up some build guides but I never follow those too strictly. 

There is also a crusader mode which is basically a simplistic army management sim, you recruit generals and soldiers and go fight armies and capture territory etc. It's nothing special but I enjoyed it. It's also entirely skippable, you can have it be done all by the ai and you'll just win overtime, letting you focus entirely on the rpg part of the game. 

The biggest stinky poopoo yuck booty part of this game is it's incredibly psychotic difficulty curve and encounter designs. Owlcat made this game as if they were DMing for a group they wanted to kill as quick as possible. If you don't want to be forced into either playing VERY specific builds of get molested by encounters built for party's 5-8 levels above you, just play on normal or lower. Even then enemies will sometimes start with 10+ buffs and have AC 10-20 levels above what you possible can.

I wanted to love this game. I'm a long time fan of the Pathfinder tabletop game. I loved Kingmaker. This game however, was boring. I've tried several times to get into it and give it a chance.  I have never made it past act 4 because I just get too bored. Too much time is spent going around the map, and moving armies. Maybe some players like that aspect. I found it too diverting from the character story. Half the map locations are just garbage item pick-ups. They don't even have encounters. The mythic levels are a fun idea, but advancement is so linear, you don't get to fully enjoy the abilities until the main story is over. 

Most of the companion NPC's aren't really useful. Seelah is a great tank, but the others are better replaced with custom mercs. For example, the Hellknight you get is a gnome. One of the worse races for a plate wearing class. NPC interaction was much better in the first game. The kingdom management is ok. The armies feels like a cheap way to add time to play hours without any benefit. 

I get many people like the game. At its core it could be fun. Just too much wasted time on things that have nothing to do with the story. That would be ok if the gameplay was enjoyable enough to be worth the distraction.",1680450971,1680450971,False,3,0,0.502801835536956787,0,True,False,False

Had to make a break at 150h because i couldn't stand the absurdity of the game. Welcome to reload simulator 2.0. I think half of my gaming time is watching at the loading screen. So i strongly advise anyone new to Crpgs to play the game on the lowest diffculty to enjoy it. And every seasoned player, enjoyer of this kind of game to play on normal if you don't want to have a mental breakdown at some point. The game is good, the story is excellenty and well written, the companions, for the most of them are intriguing and have a great development. the management part is far, far, better than in the previous title, thanks to Heroes of might and magic 3. The only downside is the combat system, wich is the core of the game, but i think and read that its linked to the difficulty. And Core difficulty and above is insane. I played a lot of Crpgs and adore the style, finished Kingmaker, the previous title on challenger after 240h. And it went a lot smoother than this one. Your knowledge of other titles or the genre is irrelevent, only an extensive understanding of the mechanics of this particular opus is required. I think the most frustrating fact of all is that if you play a wizard/mage/spellcaster, don't even think about a specialization like fire/cold/acid/sonic, dude, you're a grease wizard, for like the first half of the game, yes fireball can work, but making the floor slippery for the ennemies and having three other characters waiting for them to stand up is far more effective than a magic missile or a lightning bolt. And after that, oh man, there's lot of spell available, yep, worth nothing for 99% of them, but rays, man, rays are your best friends. Because ranged touch attacks works different with AC, lalala. It's just dumb. And your archers, warriors, man you better build them the intended way because, even with a careful build, they won't be able to hit shit at some points. Act 4, dude, only two of my chars could do something because of the untouchables ennemies. There is so much classes you can choose, so much talents you can go for, so many feats to choose, wich allows you to build an amazing and customized to your taste character, but it wont work for most of them. Because only a very few specific builds can work on the highest difficulties. And you can tell me : why did you start with a maybe too challenging difficulty for you at the beginning ? Because i know how it works, and if you start with a friendly difficulty, have a nice run and go for a second one upgrading it thinking your knowledge is sufficient, you're gonna have a bad time. Because what works on normal and is enjoyable, doesn't in core or above. And since the beginning of the game translates with a lot of restart praying to the Rngod that everything goes well, you can advance to a certain point. Until you realize it can't go further and you have to lower the difficulty or restart a run beacuse respecialization and talents redistribution is prohibited. I think the main problem is the use of the d20 evrywhere. An i think it's link to a hope that the players of this game will go play the board version. I don't think they will for the most of them, but that's only an opinion. But if i have to state a fact, if i ever feel the need to try a boardgame DnD like, i will never, ever choose the Pathfinder game, because if it's anything like the PC version, it's badly designed. So lads, to summarize, it is a very good game, a great experience, a very rich in text experience, you have to be prepared. And i recommend it. But be careful to your choice with the difficulty, there's an achievement called ""sadistic game design"" and i think it can make you understand what you're up against. If you love difficulty, have a lot of time and are a bit masochist, you have a great thing ahead of you.

The writing in this game is by and large stellar, I love most of the characters and found the story compelling, but the gameplay is just flawed in many ways. I started the game on normal difficulty and found midway through chapter 3 that I was just hitting a difficulty wall. The enemies AC and to hit scales very fast and if you aren't optimising your team you will NOT have fun. Even after turning down the difficulty while the fights weren't particularly hard there were several (especially the final boss and other big bads) that were just slogs because they had ludicrous defences (High HP, High AC, high saves, etc.). Puzzles were mostly fumbled tbh and the crusade mode was not awful but was very unbalanced (generals with abilities that kill multiple enemy units are busted and those without are kinda trash).
If you love really poring over a system and min-maxing I think you'll really enjoy this, and that just wasn't what I was looking for with this playthrough so had fun with an easier difficulty, if you want to play on something harder, iomedae watch over you.

It's basically Kingmaker but with a vastly improved UI, somewhat better music, and slightly better graphics. Oh, and the turn-based option this time is *significantly* better, so huge thank you to the devs for that.

I WANT to like these games so much more than I do. However Owlcat learned nothing from the balance issues with Kingmaker. The game suffers from absurd difficulty (difficult in the ""chopping down a tree with a dead herring"" sense, not fun difficult), which requires you to build these soulless min-maxed characters based on exhaustive optimization guides. It's not fun, and I LIKE this stuff. 

I went on a massive rant about the balance issues in my Kingmaker review and everything I said there applies here too. Classes are balanced poorly, with classes often just being written off as worse versions of others (poor barb). Min-maxing your characters properly often requires multi-classing into THREE TO FIVE different classes. THREE TO FIVE. Sometimes more! It's BS. Some options, like Monk, Fighter, and Alchemist, just seem to always pop up as requirements in class builds no matter what you're trying to do. It's both enraging and soul crushing. 

The game itself in terms of encounters and combat presumes an absurd level of PF1E system knowledge. If you're not PhD level knowledgeable you can expect this game to extract a corresponding amount of suffering from you, with prejudice.

There's more that could be said here. If you're not a real glutton for Owlcat's version of fun then don't plan on playing this game without turning the difficulty waaay down, and potentially installing mods to just cheat away some of the more egregious aspects of the game. Seriously. Mod this game. It helps. 

To be fair I think they do a slightly better job at this whole balance thing than they did with Kingmaker, but it's such a marginal improvement I'm not sure it wasn't just an accident. 

Moving away from balance. The story is really good, and I like the characters. The voice acting is also (usually) pretty good. Being the knight commander of a crusade against a demon incursion is also just awesome. This game is super big on the power fantasy too so if you like the idea of going from a random nobody to being someone who literally fights gods, you've got that here. I've seen no other game that gives you the ability to make your character an evil Lich and really run that to its logical conclusion of you becoming a literal undead deity and killing your story companions to force them into becoming undead minions. They added a lot more race and class options too, which is awesome if you ignore how much it contributes to the optimization maelstrom. 

The Crusade management is this game's version of the Kingdom management from Kingmaker. It's a step back as it's more complicated, significantly less intuitive, and weirdly hard for a game that isn't a strategy game. Like, when you first start your crusade you're just dropped on a world map and expected to know what to do. Oh, and get things wrong and you'll cause yourself tremendous amounts of unavoidable suffering down the line. 

There is a big sense in the community that the game isn't really finished, as many storylines are obviously thin, and the game rushes its final act. It's a shame they didn't commit to actually finishing what they started. As this game really has a lot to offer. 

So essentially with this game you're basically left with an improved upon version of Kingmaker that unfortunately wasn't improved in the ways it most desperately needed. 

It's like you went to a pizza restaurant and saw someone adding stale and moldy flour to your pizza dough. At that point nothing else matters. It's ruined. So you complain, and force them to substitute in some stuff that won't hospitalize you. They promise they'll do better next time. You come back a year later and they're super excited to tell you about all the ways they improved things. You say great, and order another pizza. You look back, and they're using literally the same flour from before. Same container and everything. Though obviously it's even worse now. They may have improved the sauce and gotten a better pepperoni supplier, but the fundamental base ingredient is still unacceptably bad. 

I wouldn't be this harsh if it wasn't for the fact that Pathfinder 2nd Edition came out while they were in development. I know many will disagree with me on this, but in my opinion it was a bad call to not switch systems. Pathfinder 2nd Edition is SIGNIFICANTLY better as a system, and it doesn't encourage this soulless minmaxing nonsense anywhere near to the extent 1st edition does. It's not really even a possibility there. I don't care if it would have lengthened dev time. I'd have paid double for the game if it used the better system no question. Triple even. I'm serious. 

There's enough improvement here I'm giving the base game a recommend, even without mods, which I didn't do for Kingmaker. But even so, don't get this game without planning on tuning it down a lot, or buckling up for an unnecessary and un-fun level of suffering.",1680234806,1680234806,True,64,2,0.823804020881652832,0,True,False,False

Divinity Original Sin II is still a better game, and I'm really excited for Baldur's Gate 3, but WotR seems deeper thank Kingmaker, with a more interesting story and mysteries that keep pushing me along.

I've got no idea if she's really what she seems. I HATE ghouls and demons, because the descriptions of what they do to people make my skin crawl. My character is good, but he's got blood in his mouth over the evil of these demons, and I as a real person despise them and look forward to kicking them out of the world. Choosing Atheism has been a real kick, even though it blocks me out of a lot of class options.

Very well written, like only this kind of game can be. I've noticed a lot of people trying to min-max builds. In Kingmaker I felt pretty frustrated by never finding the weapon I wanted to use for my class so I rolled a Monk this time.",1680186526,1680187777,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I like the addition of different archetypes and the prestige classes, the only one I wish they would have still added is mammoth rider (Even though you can imitate it with cavalier and taking a mammoth companion). Theres lots of room for unique builds, and even more room if you use some mods to mimic how 2e dual classing works now. 

Crusade management is a bit....difficult. It's unique, but overall it works against the player in a lot of regards.

But if you are a fan of RPGs, love to go on epic quests to save the world, meet a colorful cast that will become your party, and depending on your actions, some of them my leave, and some my stay, and if you are up for it, your character can have a romance with one of them.

I can't say how much I loved this game, how much the twists honestly caught me off guard. If you want a great RPG then this is the one for you.",1679975552,1679975552,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Wrath of the Rigtheous is a Isometric RPG with first edition pathfinder mechanics. These mechanics work very well. Technically it's a good game.  

The TLDR version: the story is overwhelming. So much story and so little freedom to just play. 

The long version. I love playing D&D and Pathfinder. Been doing table tops for 30 years. When I bought this game, I expected a similar feel to it as Kingmaker. In kingmaker, the best part for me was the part of the game where you explored the frontier. Discovered places, and did things. Killed monsters found treasure. I did that for hours. 
I have seen a bit of the travel mechanics, but it feels different. Everything is bound to a story arc of some sort. Very little is done out of curiosity. Don't get me wrong, the story arcs in this game are good. If you’re into immersive stories, this game has it. For me it’s just too much. The game starts with an apocalyptic event and some how you’re the center of it. And it sets you up for either an evil path or a good path. I mean I wish they started with something more simple like a rat in the basement quest. This good vs evil trope is just so overdone. 

Things I like:
-	Customizable difficulty
-	Game play and game mechanics are really good
-	Great graphics
-	Lots of classes to pick from 

Things I don’t like:
-	I only get to create one class to play with. 
-       XP from combat is low. It’s like combat isn’t that important. Quest XP is a lot higher.
-	Easy difficulty enemies are the same xp as hard difficulty xp enemies. 
-	More enemies generate more xp. So the sweet spot is loads of easy enemies. 
-	You start with roughly 3 companions that you are kind of railroaded into taking along. 
-	They have their own story arcs. And you get xp for these arcs. So in a way you’re following story arcs 
        you might not even give a flying f*ck about because you want the shiny xp
-	The game is filled with these arcs

The battles are not fun, and it just takes so much tedious work to get anywhere or do anything. The music is also considerably worse and more repetitive in this new area, making it even more unenjoyable.

The combat and strategy starts out fun but becomes tedious and is never expanded on. (lower the difficulty past act1, combat never really evolves)
The crusade mode is uninspired and unbalanced. (install mods to skip it if you can)

The storytelling however, is the one redeeming factor in this game.
The story is expansive and diverse, and the lore that fills the game is well written and full of depth. It can sometimes feel overwhelming and you sometimes might get lost, but you can always ask the characters any questions if you feel like you missed something.

But I wasn't putting them together in a way that I was enjoying. I was trying to ""get the levelling"" correct. I was trying to ""win"" instead of enjoy. But that's just one complaint. Some of the old complaints hold true. A skill check system that is at times punishing that lacks having a human DM there to say ""well, this is important/cool enough that I let this pass"". I never went back to the depths once I learned that not getting all the lore before moving farther down meant not completing it. These are still valid gripes. I haven't played through this enough to really come up against this though. I will say that the DLC scheme seems different. I don't have any, can't really comment. But all in all, I've come to terms with the franchise. I play for my enjoyment and currently, I'm finding that finally. Maybe enough to go back and do the first one again.

Pros:
Great story and voice acting. Choices matter
The mythic ability system.
Most companions are interesting.
You can reroll your character at the Starting Inn as many times as you like with little consequence. 

Neutral:
Complex system that is very deep. If you like learning how to build a powerful character from 300 options available then this is one of those game. However, this game does a bad job at teaching people new to the pathfinder 1e system (Like me) how it works and the default difficulties absolutely punish you for making sub-optimal decisions.

Cons:
Difficulty curve is all over the place. Stats are inflated on the default difficulties, but not for all fights. Sometimes you can get destroyed and the next fight you won't even need to spend any resources. Turning down the difficulty by one or tweaking it on custom can suddenly make the same fight the exact opposite and offer no challenge.
Too many filler fights
Too many fights where you just start on the opposite sides of the battlefield and move towards one another. No real use of the environment or reason to pick up more niche spells.

The amount of hours I've put into this game is an indicator of this but when Steam asked me if I would like to recommend this game to others I just couldn't bring myself to say yes and here is why.

The first reason I would tell people not to get this game is because it isn't designed for casual or new players to Pathfinder, which I was.  The normal difficulty will destroy players who are new and have no experience with these kind of games and can give people who have played similar games in the past a good beat down frequently.  The major culprit for this is incredibly inflated stats on almost every enemy you encounter with permanent buffs and 5+ levels over your parties max level.  I've looked at forums to confirm this and even the people who argue that it isn't an issue still don't deny that the stats are super inflated.  Their argument is you just need to know how to min/max and team build and the game is a breeze.  Which supports my claim that the base difficulty isn't new player friendly because you wouldn't have the knowledge or experience to know how to do that.

So just turn down the difficulty you say.  Well that brings me to my second problem.  The stat shift on enemies is huge between difficulties.  I was seeing anywhere from 10-15 point differences on base stats and + to hit just switching one setting.  This means you can go from getting absolutely steam rolled to being the steam roller which can be no fun for a complete lack of challenge.  Now they do let you manually tweak things to make a custom difficulty but IMO normal difficulty should be hard enough to be challenging to new and casual players without making you pull your hair out and the fact that I have to balance the game myself just so I can try to have some semblance of fun is a negative.

My third problem with the game is RNG hell.  Since this game runs off D20 rolls you will be finding yourself hit streaks of bad luck from time to time... or if you are like me your D20 will roll only 5 or below 90% of the time with 1 being your most common roll.  This unfortunately means that no matter how well you prep and learn the games mechanics at the end of the day you may be loading saves and replaying fights against random mobs as frequently as boss fights.  

So in conclusion I would like to say that my experience has been more negative than positive and I just can't bring myself to recommend this game.",1679481147,1679481147,False,4,0,0.498181968927383423,0,True,False,False

I wasn't expecting to be kept guessing over the motivations of various demons and seeing them in-fighting rather than being one amorphous bad guy was a good call.

The gameplay is leagues better than Kingmaker, and better than Pillars of Eternity by miles. The kingdom management is back from Kingmaker, but it feels more interesting and better designed. The rough edges from the previous game sanded away. I enjoyed the various council meetings where my companions would suggest things that would have lasting consequences. The game is hard on anything higher than casual, it's pathfinder meaning you can very much gimp yourself. There's also the knowledge that 90% of what you're fighting is demons so things like certain subclasses are useless. You really need to know what you're building ahead of time or you might end up at a point of no return. 

You might also just.. fuck up certain quests, or miss certain companions. I've restarted quite a few times and it was never frustrating to do so. I enjoy the experience of going back through as another class. So bare that in mind before getting it that unless you plan to crank the difficulty down you might be in for a tough game.

Background: I loved Divinity Original Sin 2, and I've played a bit of Pathfinder 1e tabletop - here are my thoughts 3 hours in (at least 1 hour was spent in character creation lol):

Pros:
-Fun fantasy game with tons of character options. this is what I wanted and probably the closest thing to scratching the Divinity Original Sin 2 itch
-Thank god for Turn Based Mode why on earth would you play RTWP in a game system literally designed around turns
-A bunch of fun classes and archetypes including stuff missing from/not yet in Pathfinder 2e like Bloodrager and Kineticist (I went with Paladin tho)
-Story and characters and world seem pretty cool so far. 
-I like the options available in dialogue, including skill checks
-Tons of difficulty options, I think there was like 6 or 7 plus a custom difficulty where you can tweak just about everything. I went with Normal and it seems fairly forgiving, which I'm fine with because I do want to experience the story before I decide whether its worth challenging myself, but it gives you plenty of information to decide which one you want
-They also just give you plenty of information on EVERYTHING. Like you can hover over words in dialogue to get more lore on people, places, deities, etc.

Cons:
-VERY crunchy. Arguably a good thing if that's what you're into. But if I did not have previous Pathfinder 1e experience the mechanics would be incomprehensible to me. They do their best to explain everything but that means paragraphs of reading tutorials. I'm sure even I'm missing stuff, but again, on Normal difficulty I think I can get away with fumbling around for a bit. If you don't have much Pathfinder experience or aren't a Crunchy Numbers Gamer I would recommend an even lower difficulty I think.
-Usability, UI, readability of the game overall is.......... eh. There's a lot of info going on and its not as intuitive as I'd like. Took me a while to remember that once you use up your move action, further movement cuts into your standard action meaning you can't attack, for instance. There's an indicator for that but it's easy to miss. Plus some QOL stuff I'm used to from DOS2 isn't there, like chaining your party together (you have to select everybody every time) or a clear indication when you're targeting an ability (you know how in DOS2, you select an ability and there's a magical chime sound and your character lights up and does a pose before you click on a target? Yeah this game has no sound effect, no visual indicator other than the range around your character IF it's something that has a range... so it was easy for me to misclick stuff at first)
-Why on earth does the auto-follow camera trail behind my characters? When I need to see where I'm going?? I guess I have to manually move the camera everywhere I go
-Voice acting is... hit or miss. Some are great, some I have to skip. Also it's not fully voiced, which is fine IMO until it's a character that was previously voiced and then suddenly isn't, I find that jarring.",1679336315,1679336315,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most importantly, the writing is fantastic and there's a sincerity to it that's straight out of another decade. Sure, it's got a bit of ""the message"" and panders to ""modern audiences"" to ""reflect the world we live in today"" for reasons we're all aware of and are all more or less for or against, but the nihilistic entropy that usually accompanies such cheap and soulless utopian gas-lighting simply isn't there. The characters are all quite earnest in their attempts to survive or overcome some inner flaw and modern staples of media like cheap irony and sarcasm are just colors on the palette rather than the entire canvas.

When it comes to gameplay, being 10% competent in Pathfinder has made learning the system more intimately—so I don't mess up my build—a good source of fun (although I apparently chose a terrible class at the start lol). Beautiful, intuitive, expansive turn based fun. Character creation you can spend weeks researching and an adventure you can roleplay with 100 different shades of hero.

If you want to replicate the experience of a properly run traditional TTRPG without a GM, well, this is it. This is as close at it comes. BG3 eat your heart out.

1) The Game doesn't start until Act 3. Before then you have limited exposure to the corruption system and even the crusade system. The crusade system, on none trivial difficulties, feels unintuitive and you can easily softlock your playthrough if you don't understand it in depth, which you probably won't. I really enjoy the feeling of both the crusade system and the kingmaker system of the previous title. I did not enjoy making mistakes early and realizing I could never advance without changing the difficulty from the standard crusade mode difficulty on Core to what was basically ""story mode"".

2) Avoid Blackwater. Most of the time put into this game was ultimately wasted because I entered Blackwater, hoping to explore more of the map, and, ultimately, I wound up locked in a dungeon. At first I thought I could handle it but it's extremely imbalanced compared to where you are when you can get to it and once you visit you're locked in until you beat the entire dungeon. My first playthrough, most of the 140 hours so far, ended because I no longer had saves before entering Blackwater and it just felt better to restart entirely than to reduce the difficulty to a trivial level as I had to do already with the crusade part of the game.

3) Spellcasters are BTFO. A lot of the enemies I encountered had high SR and high DR against fire. This necessitates a 3 feat tax of spell penetration, greater spell penetration, and mythic spell penetration if you want to play a caster who does anything other than buffing or conjuration. One of my friend's favorite characters is Ember, who is a witch focused on fire spells. Beyond the feat tax for overcoming SR you also need to spend an additional mythic feat to allow her to ignore that fire DR. D&D is a choice and consequence based game at its heart, I'm okay with suffering a bit due to bad choices. What I'm not okay with is a game handing me a companion, who presumably has an interesting story to explore, and then basically requiring a 4 feat investment to ever use them. That's not choice. That's not fun. A lot of other companions have similar issues when it comes to viability. On harder difficulties, this gives you a hard choice: do you explore these subpar characters' stories or do you just get better NPCs from the pathfinder society since those will actually help you progress the overarching story of the game. 

To end this edit, I still really want to explore the world and story, I know it was based on Pathfinder Adventure Path campaign, but Jesus, is it that hard to make some changes to the source material to improve the pacing of the game and the playability of it? Are you really sacrificing authenticity just to allow people to do something other than min-max for a specific campaign? My latest character is an Aasimar with a martial class. No worries about SR, DR can be overcome with cold iron, and Aasimar take no stat penalties but still get +2 bonuses to 2 stats. I've never played this way in regular D&D, but the cost of finishing the story without just changing the difficulty to zero feels like compromising my playstyle to just try to build a character who will succeed at the campaign.

Pre- Edit:


I haven't gotten much past the first chapter of the game so far, but that is far from an endorsement. A lot of gamers see long play time as an implicit endorsement. If by the end of this game I feel like I've experienced the greatest story in gaming history, one that will take decades to top, I'll still be unable to recommend this.

The first 30 hours of play were me grinding through the absolutely horrific first chapter. I could never in good conscience recommend someone drop $50 on a game that greets new players with an incredibly alienating experience, and I say that as someone who played their previous title, Pathfinder: Kingmaker, and as someone who has been engaged with a Pathfinder based campaign for several years now. Much like Kingmaker, playing WotR is a frustrating, buggy, and extremely clunky experience. I can not imagine playing this game without a decade of D&D experience, and I already just quit out of it the first time I encountered the tavern defense in chapter one because I was just exhausted by what a relentlessly tiresome experience it was. I want the story, so I'll slog through this mess of a game for the story. But it's not good. Owlcat Games does not make even remotely enjoyable games. They make stories. Nice stories. But god damn would the stories be better if it was just a book that wasn't oppressively awful and unenjoyable as a gameplay experience.",1675314213,1679215007,False,2,0,0.510840356349945068,0,True,False,False

Pro's:

- Your choices matter - a LOT. Your ""Mythic Path"", of which there are ten, and your active companions all have large effects on the story. Multiple playthroughs will be wildly different, narratively speaking. You can become a Lich and forsake everything good in the world, be the pure embodiment of universal law, anoint Mimics as holy crusaders, and everything in between.
- This is a mostly faithful adaptation of the PF1E rules system. It's as close as you'll get outside of playing the TTRPG.
- Character customization is incredible. Lots of classes and subclasses to mix and match. You've got all your standard fantasy stuff, and then some. Wish they ported Gunslinger/Swashbuckler, or more Occult classes.
- The writing is great. You will feel terrible about many of your decisions.

That said, this game is very buggy and rife with poor design choices. The good news is the devs are generally responsive to these issues, but many have persisted since release.

Con's:

- If your main character dies, you get an instant ""Game Over"" without the opportunity to have your cleric revive them. 
- I frequently click a skill icon to use, but the game doesn't register I was hovering over a UI element and makes my character walk to who knows where in the middle of combat, usually killing them.
- Enemies will have upwards of 10-15 buffs at the start of combat. This would be fine, except the game doesn't have a description for many of the buffs so you're left wondering. Sometimes buffs just refuse to appear in the ""conditions"" area so you just won't know about them.
- Your characters will frequently be subject to debuffs that last minutes. You don't want to progress with these active, so optimal play will be to literally sit and wait at your computer until they go away.
- I don't believe this game was playtested on higher difficulties. Throwing multiple enemies with 40 AC, 30 Touch AC, 20+ SR, and revive when killed at mid level PC's is frankly ridiculous and just actively encourages cheese strats.
- Mid to lategame is incredibly ""rocket taggy"". You WILL have to reset encounters until you get lucky on your initiative rolls, or immediately lose. This is more a problem with PF1E in general, but it's pretty bad here.",1679196338,1679196444,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

And I will probably play it until the end. But not because it is so great. I am cussing the whole time while I play. The dialogue is heavily railroaded and I am really grateful that some people (before me) fought their way through this game and discussed it on the internet. The crusade system is a pain and I play it on ""story"" difficulty. I still think it's unbearable. Some fights are unfair not only because the developers seem to be sadists, but also because there are bugs. At my third try I usually turn the difficulty of the fights a tad down. So why do I play at all? I only wanted to know if it runs on Linux. But as soon as I started I had to continue playing. Because if I would take a break, I'd forget what I had done wrong, where I were and why I were there. But I already told friends not to buy it, not even on sale. I have played Pathfinder:Kingmaker and it had some flaws too but I liked it. Wrath of the righteous is just too much of everything.
Edit: I fight in turn-based mode btw and that causes deadly problems (bugs) too, so don't think turn-based will solve all problems.
Edit2: Yesterday ""romantic scene"" with Lann. Main character and Lann brawling on the walls of Drezen. Naked (!) and HIS dog is attacking him all the time, Lann trips and lies on the floor. Main character runs away in fear to kill him. Dialogue says that he won.
Edit3: I think the spell rift of ruin casted by an enemy deals damage as if the fight was not turn based. That means my party can't react but the spell continues to damage us. There were several demons in the Colyphyr mines in Chapter 4 that continued to hit my party, while we didn't do anything in turn-based mode. My party can't rest in the Colyphyr mines. The DC of the Camouflage is 50. I'm playing on normal difficulty. I tried to turn the difficulty down, it doesn't change the DC. We're f...ed. I don't know if this is a bug or the sadistic Devs. I am so angry. Got to mention Blackwater. I was there first with a level 13 party (I think). They couldn't find a way to break the door and Dimension door- mass didn't work. The scroll is useless. So they got level 14 and came back with Dimension door - single. I never was able to break down the door. But Ember teleported around and we finally killed the boss. It took me SO long. I can only warn everybody, not even to try this. I never know if things are bugs or meant to be awful or if I did something ""wrong"". The kind of ""wrong"" an insane chaotic evil school teacher would have invented. I don't use THE mod. I play on Linux and those mods are made for Windows. I don't know what to say about people who use THE mod and get achievements nevertheless. And then they probably tell newcomers that they just don't do it right. I'm using character builds by InEffect btw. Sometimes slightly changed. I don't think they suck. I'm glad somebody read all the requirements for this and that. So I don't have to make a doctor in wotrology. Oh, that word doesn't exist? It's wotrlism?
Edit4: Yesterday my party got into chapter 5. I noticed that an important NPC has died. Checked in the internet. With this game you never know if you did something ""wrong"" or if it's a bug, but this time I guessed I had done something ""wrong"". And I found, that I have made a decision in chapter 1 that made an NPC die in chapter 5. Consequences! Am I in John Wick, or what? I had to reload the last save of chapter 4 and managed to rescue this NPC and didn't rescue others. And I was angry again.

Let me start here, WotR sucked me in right from the beginning - everything is just bigger and better than the prequel, from  companions to character classes and even the setting, the mythic paths are an extremely cool addition to the game and gone are the hard timers and camping supplies and other annoyances, you still benefit from managing supplies and time - none of the roleplay is lost, it's just not shoved down your throat in a tedious manner.

Therein lies the crux of the matter, now I'm not one to stress it over having to restart the game once in a while but there are some pretty major issues right now that could potentially corrupt your savefiles permanently and it seems to be getting worse the further in you get, I thankfully didn't have any gamebreaking bugs for the first part of it but in chapter 5 I'm at a point where I can't take a step without worrying that i'll lose my 200 hour savefile, the gameplay seems to be falling off a bit too which just makes it all too obvious that the game is not finished, and wasn't ready for release.

In the end my recommendation is this; Absolutely 100% play this game! But please do yourself a favor and give it another year or so, thankfully the devs seem to be very hard at work fixing bugs - but it seems new ones pop up just as often. I'll definitely be coming back to change my review in the future, but for now the game needs more time.

Edit: After replaying it recently I'm reminded how great this game truly is and I'm changing my rating to a recommend, I didn't finish the whole story so I'm not sure if all the issues are fixed but I didn't have any significant problems up towards the final chapter. The game is just so good that any RPG fan should try it regardless.",1632507471,1679056456,True,0,0,0.519642770290374756,0,True,False,False

I got one play-through of this game and I could not, physically bring myself to play another because I knew I would have to go through crusade mode again.

I've played Pathfinder: Kingmaker, the sort of prequel, (although I got halfway in, lost all my progress while trying to transfer save files to a new computer, and gave up), and this is definitely an improvement.

This game does a lot of things well. The voice acting is very good, and the dialogue is too. There's one voice line that Arueshalae says if you click on her that makes me cringe when I hear it, (something about how much she likes her wings), but beyond that, it's well done. Most of the characters are interesting, and the romance options in particular are a massive improvement (I didn't really like any of the options in Kingmaker, while in WoTR almost all of them are pretty good. As with the previous game, the options for straight male characters are the worst IMO, although I'm not bi so it's hard to tell. Galfrey isn't that likable and Camelia... well, spoilers, but Arueshalae is fantastically written and possibly the best character in the game. I wish there were more interactions with her after her questline is completed.) Daeran is the only character that I would say is annoying - I didn't partiuclarly care for Sosiel (Seelah just outclasses him if you're looking for a lawful good religious character) or Greybor, but I could see why someone would like them. The stories are pretty good overall. You go to many different locations, and there's always a lot of interesting stuff to do and see.

It's similar to the last game combat-wise which makes sense as it's the same system. I'm familiar with D&D 5e but not as much with Pathfinder, so I chose the auto-level up option for everyone but my character. I don't know if that was the right decision, as many of them turned out to be pretty bad at dealing with high AC enemies. I was lucky that I went Magus and had Dimension Strike which allowed me to take care of most of that. Difficulty wise, it's mostly balanced? I know that games in this genre are notoriously difficult to balance, but there are dungeons where the difficulty just randomly spikes. Most of them weren't the result of being underleveled, either. Most of this is just minor griping, though: the combat functions quite well and is enjoyable.

The crusading is the weaker part of the game, although it functions well most of the time. I would STRONGLY advise to get a mage general, as it makes army fights far easier. I greatly enjoyed the meetings with the advisors, where you would have an issue and everyone would suggest different things to resolve it. I don't think I can give a really good review of the rest, as I inadvertently did not progress as far as I probably should before ending act 3. Wiping out demons and leveling everything up to max does get tedious after a while, though, because the stakes become low. It's honestly not worth it as it mostly impacts one or two screens you see at the ending.

There weren't that many outright negatives in the game. One of my personal issues with the game is really just a result of the genre - you can make an extremely impactful decision and, by the time you've realized you fucked up, you're 30 hours past it and have to replay the same content in mostly the same way if you want to change it. There seems to be a decent amount of replayability, but I don't really want to replay a 130 hour game where decent portions of the game will be the same anyway. I could be an evil character, but after 80 hours you just feel bad about yourself, and if I'm a good character, most of my decisions would be similar anyways.
The puzzles were not good. The UI really isn't suited to the matching-block puzzles that this game likes.. I didn't do the Secret of the Ancients quest for that very reason, and More than Nothing falls flat due to the long, painful dungeon you need to go through, which is a shame, as it's conceptually one of the most interesting questlines, despite the ending being a bit short.

The ending of the game was underwhelming - I would have liked more cutscenes after the final boss (I didn't do the secret ending), or maybe an epilogue quest. You get a sense of how you've made an impact on the world, but you don't really see it for yourself.

Nonetheless, this game is a solid buy. It does a lot of things generally well. I know most of this review seems like complaints, but it's hard to really go into detail about the story without spoilers, and it's hard to elaborate on ""the combat is fun"". I would recommend this to anyone interested in buying the game.",1667266107,1678851668,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The problem here is that this game is thick in Pathfinder at the expense of story (wilderness travel sucks!) and play (real-time combat sucks for casters!), right up until the story dictates the Pathfinder rules don't apply (""Important NPC dies in front of you!"" ""Well I cast Raise Dead."" ""...But, uh, Not Like That.""). You hit level cap long before the end of the game (why is there even a cap?) but are tired of the NPC companions well before then anyway (some of whom are so awful you can legit kill them *as a Good character* and your other companions won't bat an eye).

Really, Divinity: OS2 was soooo much better on the companions...

One cool thing about Pathfinder, though, is that (assuming you haven't pissed the retrain NPC off) you can reroll your main character *entirely* at almost any point in the game. And if you take the mythic power of cheating (Trickster, Knowledge World rank 3?) then you can cheat in your first-level feat selection. So that's nice, but I'm not sure it's nice enough to give it replay value. (Do I want to try out the Lich options, for example? Yes, but not so much that I'm willing to suffer through casting spells all game or slowing down every tiny combat to turn-based...)

If you want to gnaw through this anyway I recommend a Half-Elf Rogue Master-of-All going for Mythic Trickster. There's oodles of skill checks in the game, way too many traps to ever be rogue-less, and the Trickster Persuasion power of Jedi Mind Tricks is laughably OP.

Pathfinder is a similar rule set to DnD but with slight differences to allow for much more customisation, but if you've never played any TTRPG before the, don't worry the game starts you off easy and explains everything you need to understand and progresses you along with more complex spells, systems and statuses and you progress through the 100+ hour long storyline (No joke, i've played for over 300 hours over multiple characters and i've still not reached act 5 yet!) . 
The Good Stuff: 
Customization - There's over 100 character classes and subclasses to choose from, each with their own features and playstyles, plus the fact you can multiclass and control both your own character and your companions levels and feats means you will NEVER be able to run out of ideas or things to try out each time you play.  
Story - Some prefer to be good, others prefer to be evil. Pathfinder says, why not both? Want to be a lawful paladin emboldening the ideals of truth and justice? done. Want to be chaotic necromancer who doesn't really see much difference between life and death? done. Want to play as a dude called Kevin who plays pranks on people and hits them with rocks from afar, and after one prank gone wrong accidentally ended up as the commander of an army? done. There's no punishment or downside to not keeping to an alignment or path (unless you actually are playing a paladin - Stay lawful good), so each story and consequences of your choices will be different each time. 
The Bad Stuff: 
Voices - some lines are voiced and some aren't which is a shame as it kind of breaks the immersion, especially if you literally just spoke to that person and know you have to switch from listening to reading. 
Effects - I personally have a half decent graphics card so it's not as bad for me, but with beautiful spells and effects you'll be spamming by acts 3, 4 and 5 expect a LOT of particles to render which will probably lead to some performance issues if you can afford to fork out for a shiny new GPU.

Overall Rating: 9 / 10 
If Paizo fully voiced all the lines, and maybe improved a few choices to make them more fun and/or viable (looking at the devil mythic line in particular, only open to aeon or azata but not to a fallen angel or an actual demon?) then this would be one of my all time favourite games.",1678730514,1678730514,True,2,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

It has high replayability, the characters and story are super interesting and the combat, as a pathfinder newbie, ages like a fine wine with so many ridiculously overpowered builds just waiting for you to understand the mechanics well enough to build them. The caveat, and it isn't a small one, is that this game is BUGGY. Big bugs, small bugs, bugs galore and that can really get in the way of enjoying it. Luckily the Toybox mod exists quite literally makes a lot of those bugs a non-issue as well as giving the player the power to tailor their experience and cut out the fat that gets old on your 3rd+ romp.

So if you like CRPGS with crunch combat and a awesome story, and can install a mod, pick this game up. If you don't want to play with mods, just be careful, save near constantly, and go into it understanding that sometimes a bug will likely prevent you from doing something you want to do.
EDIT: Original Reviews below

So it's been a couple of weeks since I wrote my initial review and try as I might, I was not able to rip myself away from this game. OWL CAT has been steadily updating the game and broadly, those updates have been good.

That being said this is still not a perfect game. It's still rough and there are bugs. But I have confidence it will be fixed and it is basically playable. Also there are a lot of incredible modders doing some incredible work. With just a couple, you can create workarounds for most  of the bugs that exist in-game.

I can't wait til this title is firing on all cylinders.
___

*Note: if you're thinking about purchasing this game to figure out if it's as buggy as everyone says, the first 20 hours are pretty well polished so you will not get the full extent of the existing problems until it is too late to refund*

I love this game. I've played 95 hours. But like other reviewers, I've had so many issues with bugs that I cannot in good consciousness suggest anybody touches this game before this game has more updates. I had a ton of bugs in ACT IV and V from missing NPCs to missing quest items and I powered through it until I got to the point where a bug made it impossible for me to finish my mythic quest going into the final hours of the game. I will come back to this game when it is fixed and I'll update this review. Until then, great game, horrible bugs. Buyer beware.",1632181582,1678669212,True,1,0,0.5071868896484375,0,True,False,False

There is something for everyone in the game.  Puzzles, combat, spells, resource management,  and so on.  At times, its maddening because it allows you the freedom to do what you want, to an extent.  However, with that freedom comes the chaos of being pulled in every direction.  There are no straight lines to what you need to do or where to go.
At times, you won't know you are making a mistake or choosing the right path until its too late.  SAVE OFTEN.  You may need to go back and do entire swaths of the story again, because you find out you needed to do something way back in the past, because you didn't know that you needed to do this if you wanted to go this route in your story.  
Having an understanding of the pathfinder gaming system is a MUST.  Myself I never played before this, having cut my teeth on D&D all the way back to 2nd edition.  While there are things that are close to the same, there are other things radically different.  the control system could use a major overhaul.  Moving around the map, trying to see where you are going, attacking and doing can be hair pulling frustrating at time.  You think you have set your character to move, but they don't move and you accidentally hit the space bar to speed the movement up, only to find you just passed on your turn.  Forget using a controller for the game, absolutely no rhyme or reason to how that is supposed to work for the game.
The graphics aren't bad.  The AI is decent.  Battles can become a real slog as you wait for all the computer controlled allies to do things.
Character classes can be overwhelming.  At least they let you know up front how easy or hard it might be to play.  However, the whole subclass aspect of it is very confusing.  They don't really tell you when you might qualify to change your class and go for what you wanted from the start.  It reminds me of WFRP where you work through classes to get to what you want.  However, they won;t tell you are eligible, you need to check each and every level to see if you can finally go the path you wanted.
The mythic paths are confusing as well.  They say there are no wrong choices, but if you want a specific path, then yes there are plenty of wrong choices.  Take advantage of online tools, walk throughs, and so on to figure out what you want to play, and how to get the most out of it.
Don't get me wrong, it was fun to play, but there are times when it feels like a slog.  Having completed it, I will go back and try something completely different and see how that goes.  Only this time, I will use the guides to make sure I go the way I want to play the game, to get the most out of it.",1678663213,1678663213,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

I'm excited to share with you my detailed review of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, a thrilling role-playing game that takes place in the fantastical world of Golarion. Let's dive right in and compare it to Baldur's Gate, another classic RPG.

Both games offer immersive storylines, deep character customization, and intense battles against supernatural enemies. However, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous has a more complex combat system that emphasizes strategic positioning and the use of buffs and debuffs. In comparison, Baldur's Gate offers a simpler real-time combat system that can be paused to give orders to your party members.

The storyline of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is a standout feature of the game. It's a classic tale of good versus evil that immerses players in a rich and detailed world full of fascinating characters and lore. The main story takes you on an epic journey to stop a demon invasion, and the choices you make throughout the game have a significant impact on the outcome.

Character customization is also a significant part of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. You can create your character from scratch, choosing everything from their race and class to their skills and abilities. The game also features a variety of companions, each with their own unique backstory, personality, and combat abilities.

The game's humorous and ironic moments add an extra layer of fun to the gameplay. For instance, despite being a game about battling demons, you'll find yourself doing mundane tasks like collecting herbs and running errands for NPCs. Additionally, some of the character animations are a bit wonky, which can be hilarious in the midst of intense battles.

In conclusion, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an excellent RPG that offers a rich and immersive world, deep character customization, and strategic combat. The storyline is compelling and full of twists and turns, and the game's humorous and ironic moments add an extra layer of enjoyment to the overall experience.

It surprised me much like Divinity 2 Original Sin as a game that can stand beside Baldur's Gate 2 and other Black Isle classics. Also, judging from other reviews and friends who enjoy it, the replayability is off the charts. Get it!!

It is by no means a perfect game. I encountered only a few bugs, but the two things keep it from the 10/10 for me: the Crusade (mini)game and encounter balance. 

It's a diluted Heroes3 minigame that quickly loses its challenge after your generals rack up some spell levels. It is therefore not worth the amount of time that you have to put into it. The only thing it achieves is convey the slow and dredging process of mounting a military campaign, which I guess has some narrative merit. Still, it's a very weak aspect of the game. I understand that you can automate it in the options, but I haven't tried that out.

The encounter balance is not too bad, but you might run into hard walls when facing certain monsters. There are enemies that are clearly overtuned, while others might feel like a pushover. Fortunately there were not that any of these during my Core difficulty playthrough, but those that were REALLY left a sour taste in my mouth. I'm sure around 10% of my playtime is reloading.

But yeah, despite these flaws, it is still a great CRPG and definitely worth your time. What's more, it's bursting with build options so the amount of strategies that you can do are just way too many to count. And judging from the achievements that I've missed... yeah, it's a full package.

Modding community has matured nicely, and I've had fun using stuff like Worldcrawl. Can't speak to the DLC as it's simply too expensive for me to consider worthwhile -- $70 CAD for the season passes when I paid $60 CAD for the base game is too much.

Expect to play on standard difficulty or lower if you're new to Pathfinder, because this game has a tendency to throw extremely lethal encounters at you out of left field that unoptimized parties simply won't be able to handle. These are satisfying to beat once you're familiar with the system, but frustrating on a first playthrough.

Despite these annoyances, a lot is done well. The translation of tabletop rules to a video game is especially gracefully done, with character builds that I'm familiar with working pretty much exactly as I'd expect them to in the game. Real-time mode is also a lot better than I expected it would be, but I still largely prefer playing on turn-based mode.

Additionally handles most of its story elements extremely well; in particular, Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes to mind as a comparable game when it comes to how it handles your character gaining power. Good-aligned characters will probably have a better time here, as a lot of the early evil options are terrible. (To directly quote a line of dialogue with a random peasant: ""[Evil] I don't like you. Die! [Attack]"")

Overall pretty easy to recommend if you're into CRPGs, and especially easy to recommend if you like Golarion as a setting. Lore nerds will have a great time here.",1631930067,1678604939,True,0,0,0.526542305946350098,0,True,False,False

I've consciously picked every character in my party with the skills needed to unearth the respective information in this game. Don't you dare force me to reload 3 times because my autistic anime cat wizard keeps rolling a 1 on every f*cking skill check. 

I'm 140 hours into a single save game that would have taken me 60 in my prime years when I didn't have a single responsibility other than making it conscious to my senior classes – so the likely hood of me wanting to invest another semester just to find out what happens if I pass the random arcane knowledge skill check on quest X is fairly slim. 

Every boss fight is just another exam I failed to prepare for with the wrong party comp missing that one character that has that correct spell that I needed (true sight) to go from getting bent over and f*cked by every demoness slut to then reversing the metaphorical and often literal tables, having it my way in some of the most guilty pleasurable revenge slug fests I have ever experienced in my life. 

That said, there is something momentously unsettling about a literal 2 story steroid infused cybernetic demon guerrilla being untouchable by my archers because they are 2 levels apart. If you want to scale difficulty just change/up the DR so at least I get some satisfaction that I'm living in a reality where a towering tree ent from lord of the rings isn't also somehow Neo dodging every crusader axe, flaming arrow and my hopes and dreams of not being stuck in a 2 hour fight where neither side is able to land a blow on the other.


On the other hand, learning to live without a perfect narrative going my way is part of where the charm lies in this game. Learning to let go and not become enraged every time my special wizard school dropout drops the ball. That maybe she is doing the best she can. That life really is a series of uncontrollable randomized chaos and that it's just more peaceful to accept that maybe your reality is just controlled by an angry drunk dungeon master. 

As it turns out, all I needed to do to enjoy this game was to put the difficulty to baby b**ch easy storyteller mode, take a quick 20d critical to my pride and continue on my merry f****** way to enjoying the video game equivalent of psychology 101.

I don't know about the rest of you, but I never realized how little I knew about myself and my subconscious desires until I realized the potential of a relationship with a reformed succubus turned to the side of good. I've had so many ethical questions posed to myself that I'm starting to actually understand Carl Jung's books on the masculine archetypes and collective subconscious without having even touched a page.

I don't know if it's an actual demoness that developed this game but for the love of all that is unholy please, on the next one, can you just make some physics based hack and slash mount and blade equivalent so that more normies can enjoy what this game seems to actually intend – introspection into one’s psyche to discover their questionably dubious moral compass in this psychoanalytical masterpiece disguised as a isometric rpg.

I've waited a long time to find something that resembles Baldur's Gate 2's grandeur and while Pillars of Eternity 1 & 2 came closest in terms of optics, I sadly abandoned them after 20-40h due to certain mechanics that just spoiled the enjoyment too much (still enjoyed them though). Tyranny tried as well, but failed me after just a few hours, due to an unnessecary ton of deities and way too much politics.
Since I also abandoned PF Kingmaker after just a couple of hours for various reasons, I didn't have much interest for WotW, but then stumbled over a Gamestar video review having the game score a 91%, which definitely intrigued me. I'm glad I did.

To sum it up, Pathfinder WotW is a game that requires its time to really unfurl its potential, and becomes highly rewarding after that time's been invested. If you want to get into this game, prepare to learn and read A LOT, and prepare to spend at least 50-100h with it, otherwise don't bother - you won't have a good time.
If you're looking for an elaborate and challenging RPG gaming/digital tabletop experience that can easily fill out half a year's time or more, go for it, and I promise you won't regret it. 

PROs:
-choosable real time battle OR turn-based combat (I'm playing real time and having a lot of fun with combat)
-insane amount of content and options
-mostly enjoyable story and character writing (after the innitial demons vs. angels cringe aspects have passed, more to that in CONs)
-well made campaign & strategy system which really unfurls its quality after a while and adds an actual great layer of variety to the game, instead of just being an annoyment on the side (which often is the case with such mechanics)
-choices actually matter
-good, informative and helpful UI (which is utterly important in a game like this)
-good optics for the biggest part - especially spell effects/battle effects can look impressive
-sometimes really feels like playing more than just a video game
-didn't encounter many bugs so far (glad I didn't play it at release though)

Serious CONs:
-class/spell/ability choices can be overwhelming at times due to the sheer amounts
-a LOT of loading screens, which can quickly become annoying considering the constant screen switching the game requires
-the quick fatigue/long travel hours and numerous random encounters in campaign mode also quickly become an annoyment. I wish they'd reduced the travel distances on the world map a bit. This is probably the biggest contra for me.
-dialogues can appear bland and childish at times, mostly due to the ""good vs. evil"" approach, but also due to the often silly, comic-like demon portrayals - a bit of a shame in my opinion. The game surely would have profited big time from a much darker, more serious and more mature approach here - considering the dire, bleak and positively dramatic narrative in Baldur's Gate 2 for example. This is something I still miss a lot in every single newer CRPG.
noteworthy CONs:
-army portraits in the strategy part of the game really are an eyesore
-every now and then different abilities/spells/status/effects have the same symbols as others, which can be confusing. They should have invested the time in at least changing colors or so to avoid this.
-a lot of american voice acting which, in my opinion, just doesn't fit the atmosphere very well, but that's a matter of taste of course

The good:
* Rich character system with even more choices than its predecessor. Decent adaptation of pathfinder rules, and (unlike its predecessor) most information is accessible up front.
* Turn based combat mode. Finally.
* Great story which rewards different styles of play (good, evil, ...). NPCs are fleshed out well.
* Nice graphics (but see below) and voice acting
* Plenty of content.

The bad:
* Bugs and more bugs. Some will stop you from completing quests (missing NPC, dialog ending abruptly) or prevent resting & casting out of combat. 
* The graphic card requirements are wildly understated. I found a GeForce GTX 1060 3GB to perform horribly slow in some areas, as well as causing bugs with area loading. After upgrading to a GeForce RTX 3060 12GB those issues went away though.

Neutral:
* Normally the ability to retrain your character would be a nice thing to have. Here it's a necessary thing, as you may find yourself using it frequently because feats or class abilities are bugged / don't work as advertised.
* Some classes and mechanics work significantly different from Pathfinder PnP.

Update: With version 2.1.0, many of the really annoying bugs that made entire classes or archetypes useless have been fixed.",1647155578,1678249543,True,0,0,0.537556052207946777,0,True,False,False

Revision of my Review after the game's been out a long while:

There has been many fixes and I managed to beat the game and get the secret ending, doing and seeing pretty much everything.

I can say that the game is a solid RPG. There's plenty of hours of fun to be had (though some points can get tedious at times). The mechanics of the game however you can only really enjoy if you start out on hard or harder, otherwise the game is much, much too easy. If you're looking for a challenge, do yourself a favor and bump up the difficulty. 

HOWEVER! If you want an enjoyable experience, go grab yourself the Bag of Tricks (Toybox) mod. There'll come a time where your quest will bug out still and you'll have your perfect ending ruined due to it, and without it, you'd likely get angry and quit your tens of hours long save. I can't stress enough how much that mod improves the game in all regards. I'd likely not be changing my review from a negative one to a positive one without it.",1630778306,1678096646,True,0,0,0.532594919204711914,0,True,False,False

Simping aside, personally I would've preferred that they implemented the Crusade Management similar to Kingmaker's management. Would've been a lot better than what is done in this game.
The story writing is great but the puzzles were awful. Only a few puzzles actually made sense and half the time the clues were too vague to even be considered useful.
I particularly enjoyed the occasional text-based gameplay in this game. The outcomes were so unpredictable that it made the story that much more interesting.

This basically closest thing you could get of pure power fantasy rpg that feels like you are a god that walk on hole ground... if the game feels like it.  Let me explain first the positive what i love this game about is mythic path is game changer literally it can change a scenario of main quest so no 2 playthrough feels alike hell there is even an additional scenario if you chose specific mythic path ( the fact the mythic scenario tree branch is longer the civ 5 development tree is impressive) and second classes holy crap there are many classes subclass i have ever seen not even baldurs gate, divinity or pillar of eternity have this much classes so this a major thumbs up on this game, and lastly act 1-4 is really great pacing it like your making your own epic story climbing up to the ranks becoming a legendary figure for the people and there many more positive that done right for the game that i can think of....but there many more negative as well especially some glaring issue on the game now the bad stuff the whole act 5-6 in general yup the whole section feels incomplete,rushed, anticlimactic and an overall lack of direction there barely reactivity on what you do on the acts itself like the game really you to finish and go straight to the ending and it really shows, remember in the beginning   that if the game feels like it want to be a power fantasy this is it the moment where the doesn't want bother that vision the enemy bloated stat out of the wazoo in general especially in act 5 where some bosses are really easy defeat and the next an unbalance mythic level with an inflated stats come out of nowhere that one shot you and you entire party team it and lasty there so many bugs in game like both enemy and your companion ai are buggy do not follow order when it need to, the turn based is broken (some say it has been fixed but i have a debuff that i can't end my turn so i need to restart my game) and some many frame drops during big opening fight if you so many summon ugh.... this review is taking too long all in all a like the game if your are a fan of crpg in general pick this game up and if this your first time into crpg i recommend playing 1 or 2 other crpg in the genre first and then pick this game up. i hope owlcat continue making crpg game and improving them in the future they have a very bright future awaiting them.",1677906258,1678075581,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

you might find some of the reviews to be somewhat divisive, and there is a reason for it: Pathfinder is a very difficult game, it is also a very LONG game. If you just want to breeze through it without much thought, this is the wrong game for you.

To succeed in and enjoy this game, you will have to spend time and get familiar with the Pathfinder system. If you sleep on optimizing your character, you may find certain parts of the game to be unbeatable. My advice for interested beginners: don't make the game more difficult, or you will hate this game very quickly.

I believe the most intimidating hurdle that you will face is the sheer information overload in the beginning. 

Aside from the enormous amount of character build choices, you'll be confronted with a substantial amount of phrases, keywords and names within the first ten minutes alone, each of which has a (hefty) supplementary text explaining it's meaning. You just need to know this: Kernabres is the city you are in, Mendev is the nation that you are in, Golarion is the planet that you are on. Anything else that is important to the story will be repeated a million times, so have no fear that you're going to miss crucial information. As you progress, the story will become more tangible and interesting.

All in all, after the initial bump, it turned out to be a very enjoyable experience. If you're in a fix for a good C-RPG and love strategizing and planning your characters, I would warmly recommend this game to you.",1678058236,1678058236,True,1,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

The whole game consists of railroading and savescumming. You're either watching endless and extremely simplistic (Warcraft 3 quality) cutscenes, or you're staring at a loading screen trying to figure out how to win/avoid another unwinnable fight.

Battles involve little to no strategy or tactics. Instead it's a quiz! Let's see how well you master the outdated mechanics of Pathfinder 1st Edition! Among the 200 spells in the game, which one counters this particular ability of this particular boss and does nothing else? Don't know? You lose the game! Didn't prepare it ahead of time? Too bad you're not a f#cking prophet in real life, you lose! None of your characters have this spell? You lose!

From a role-playing point of view, it's no better. Instead of reacting to your character choices, the game judges your character based on the mythic path alone. For example, if you choose a trickster mythic path, you are treated like an immoral and insane drunkard, regardless of whether or not you actually did something immoral or insane (there are one or two exeptions like the Hand of Inheritor, who has hidden trust counter). It does not feel like role playing game, more like watching someone else's story. And it's not even a good story! It is littered with all sorts of cringe tropes. Every cutscene involving ""your"" character is either: 
- I's over 9000!!!!! *points finger at you*
- Nothing personal, kid! *Teleports behind you*
- I'll kill you next time! *Teleports away*

I'm not even joking or exaggerating, that's literally how this game is! All this constant teleportation will make you feel cheated with no way to change the outcome. Until, at some rare moment, the developers point their finger at the screen and say, “Here! Here you can actually play! Look, it's totally earned! This time the bad guy can't teleport because... well... just shut up and consume the product, you stupid pay pig!""",1677741251,1678036404,False,10,0,0.498529493808746338,4,True,False,False

To clarify where I am coming from with this review, I think it might be useful to know my frame of comparison in the form of the various RPG's I have played and completed throughout the years. These include:
- Eye of the Beholder 1
- Eye of the Beholder 2
- Lands of Lore 1
- Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn (did not finish the Throne of Bhaal expansion)
- Neverwinter Nights 1 (plus the Shadows of Undrentide and Hordes of the Underdark expansions)
- Neverwinter Nights 2 (plus the Mask of the Betrayer Expansion)
- Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines
- Dragon Age: Origins
- Dragon Age: Awakening
- Dragon Age 2
- Dragon Age: Inquisition
- Mass Effect 1
- Mass Effect 2
- Mass Effect 3
- Sacred 1
- Sacred 2
- Drakensang 1
- Drakensang 2: the River of Time
- Fable 1
- Fable 3
- Skyrim (plus the vampire expansion)
- Fallout 3
- Pillars of Eternity 1
- Witcher 1
- Witcher 2
- Witcher 3 (plus both expansions)

RPG's that I played for quite a bit, but did not (yet) complete, include:
- Baldur's Gate 1 (Enhanced edition)
- Divinity: Original Sin 1 (Enhanced edition)
- Fallout 4
- Code: Vein

I generally play at an intermediate difficulty setting and (even if I do say so myself) do reasonably well. Sometimes there are difficult fights that either require some levelling up before re-attempting, a whole bunch of retries or some serious strategizing to get through. Like the fight with Letho in Witcher 2 or the fight with the Ancient Rock Wraith in Dragon Age 2, but eventually I always got through. Rather *unlike* even the first chapter (after the prologue) of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous. 

Now, it may simply be that I am getting too old for games, as I turned 50 last year. Still, I can't help but feel that something is off with this game. One good example is the fight in the Topaz shop, where my level 2-3 team faces a mimic with 75 HP in the guise of a chest with teeth and a Cambion wizard with 85 HP. (A second mimic chest can be avoided by maneuvering carefully.) While the mimic is dangerous, it would probably be manageable by itself. The Cambion wizard is another matter entirely, since:
- it is impervious to attacks from my fighters, even when they are wielding weapons that match their martial ability
- it can wield a crossbow even while under melee attack without any apparent penalty (which is highly unusual in RPG's)
- it can make overhead tosses of bottles of acid (again while being under melee attack!) that do enormous damage to the party members engaging the mimic chest. 
Basically, this combination of invulnerability and ability to launch devastating range attacks while under melee attack itself means that the Cambion can obliterate whoever is trying to hold off the mimic. And then the mimic can finish off the fighters attacking the Cambion. And this isn't a boss fight or something the player encounters a bit further into the game. No, it is one of the first missions the player is apprised of during chapter 1 of the game...

An even more telling example is the attack on the Defenders' Heart base that takes place while the team has barely had the chance to explore more than 3 or 4 locations in Kenabres. My team of level 2-3 fledgling dungeon explorers was utterly obliterated by the waves of attackers that take out all the defenders (even with the help of the assassin that takes out the two enemy leaders) , leading to a game over while the game had barely begun... 

And that while playing at an intermediate difficulty setting, that seems reasonable given my experience with RPG's.. 

What an incredibly unwelcoming, mean-spirited piece of game design! 

Maybe this is part of the ""Souls-like"" trend toward including a great many really challenging fights in RPG's. Or maybe I have simply become too old for games?",1678013170,1678013170,False,2,2,0.469208955764770508,0,True,False,False

The bugs are kinda terrible though..

This game really punishes you for miss clicks as well you might click someone to go into the middle of a battle and then realise (in horror) that there wasn't enough space to get past a choke point resulting in your character slowly wasting his entire turn running around an obstacle essentially in the wrong direction with no way to stop them. 

If you aren't familiar with how dice are rolled in the table top games the descriptions can be frustrating since half of them don't specify what type of dice you rolled they only give you the result so you kinda just need to pay attention the the rolls and round up from the high results.

If you open the inventory in the middle of combat it doesn't open on the character whose turn it is for some reason super tedious if you are poping in and out of your inventory constantly to grab potions and scrolls. 

Remember to save before setting up camp you might think you don't have to since the game auto saves after camping but it has an ambush mechanic that triggers before the auto save just to make you extra mad if you forget to save after a big fight.

EDIT: 
After hundreads of hours (many AFK, i ll admit) i can say this:
As someone that has played every single major Crpg that has been released in the past 25 years i can say....this is a new peak.
It has some flaws, but it improves drastically over Kingmaker, which already was, at release and excluding the technical aspect (now fixed) the best Crpg i had ever played.
Some may find that, especially from the story/writing point of view, this was easily obtainable since both Kingmaker & Wrath of the righteous are based on two of the best Adventure Paths of Pathfinder 1st edition, but i disagree on this point.
While the overall plot and most of the main protagonists are indeed part of the original campaign, the way they represented them in this game is akin to what a good Dungeon Master would have done playing those games for his-her table: take them as a skeleton and build upon them an entire world.
I can't wait to see some DLCs and what Owlcat has in store next (edit: didnt buy 'em cause they suck apparently)

The main critiques i have:
-first off, the most important, as it has to do with the main companions:
While some of them really feel like full fledged and complex characters (Lann, Seelah, Woljiff, Wenduag and Arueshalae for example) i have to say that some of them really feel like they have 1 trait of personality and..nothing else (Ember wants the world to stop fighting..Regil strives for discipline...) not to mention that some ""mysteries"" have the most predictable outcomes ever (Camelia's storyline...i don't think there is a single average person that wouldnt be able to predict every single aspect of it)
 The only instance in which this ""being one note"" kinda works is with Nenio, given that she acknowledges how her entire personality is driven by science and the scientific method and that nothing matters to her, thus making it make sense when she starts doing seemingly nonsensical stuff like interviewing the main villain on torture methods before the fight, to the extent that she may be one of the best examples of ""true neutral"" characters..ever?
-the fact that while the game is playable both in turn based and RTWP mode...both modes seem to interfere with each other.
Some battles may take literal hours on hard difficulty mode if played in turn based mode, due to the fact that there are dozens of units each having to play out their move (cough cough Kenabres tavern and Gargoyle cavern)
On the contrary, some battles require too much planning and micromanagement to realistically be beaten above Core difficulty using RTWP on your first try (unless you do stuff like prebuffing with all spells and then rush every single pack of mobs)
therefore the game kinda seems to best be played shifting between the 2 modes, which luckily can be done at any time...RTWP for trash easy fights, turn base for bosses etc.

-Another complaint is that, while i'm pro random encounters...i felt like there were WAY too many when compared to Kingmaker for example...during the end of ACT 3 going around the map would often result in 5 or 6 random encounters with monsters over level 16, making each one draining both for resources and time.

-Skillchecks: while i understand and love skill checks, because they are a core component of pen and paper and roleplay...i think that, especially in videogames, dice rolls are better left in combat (Or do it like in Underrail and New vegas: no dice rolls for skill checks, just thresholds to be met. Because people will, 99% of the time, just save scum their way out of it)
not only they can often cause some annoyance, but its kind of ridicolous at times.
During a quest my level 19 Ecclesitheurge cleric was shown basically the equivalent of her religion's holy symbol...i rolled a 1 and failed the skill check..which is pretty much the equivalent of a high ranking bishop not recognizing a crucifix.
Also, in my opinion having huge chunks of content locked behind hidden skill checks is more often than not just a frustration.

-DEBUFFS DEBUFFS DEBUFFS...i dont know you, but personally i kinda HATE when battles pretty much have a ""push this to win"" switch...there are encounters that go from borderline impossible to complete cakewalk by simply pressing one button...
A simple example of this frustrating design are the Abyss crystals toward the end of the game...did you put ""Shield of Law"" on your group? No? Guess you're perma stunned, and good luck making enough Will saves (45-50 DC btw) for it to matter before you are all dead...(note: in the tabletop version the DC is less than half of that, and once you save you are immune..but here the save check is WAY higher, and there is no immunity after the save)
what's that? You DID put shield of law on you? Well then why even bother, you ve already won. Fighting ghosts? Did you put Death ward on you? NO?!?! Guess you are dead in 3 turns...oh wait you do have Death ward on you? Literally immune from their only dangerous attack.
It's actually one of the main problems i have with most Crpgs based on Pen and Paper, in that often they dont require strategy and planning during battle, but simply...knowing what is ahead. And the whole fantasy of having your rogue scout for enemies ahead and be able to plan doesnt really work due to the spell memorization system DnD and Pathfinder use, making you have to rest and re allocate your spells if you need a different one.

-Lastly....loading screens..due to technical reasons, the longer you get into the game, the bigger your save file gets..there are a couple mods that help optimizing this issue, and they added an option to destroy uncollected loot from areas to mitigate save file bloat...but it only helps a bit.

In the end tho..this is one of my favorite Crpgs ever.
It's not as ""smooth"" as Pillars of Eternity, it doesn't have the masterfully crafted story of Arcanum: of steamworks and magicks obscura and it doesn't have the perfect atmosphere of Fallout 1..but it has something that no other Crpg i've played has managed to achieve:
it actually makes you feel, as close as possible, as if you are going through an entire Pen and Paper campaign, and with many improvements over previous games.
Baldur's gate had the scope of a campaign (especially if you combined BG1+Dragonspear+BG2+TOB) but...it doesnt take much of your choices into acount from a story-worldbuilding point of view.
Temple of Elemental Evil may have followeed DnD 3.5's rules perfectly...but it was a very short game with borderline no story to it (which is a shame considering the original book)
That's why, as a complete package, this is a (slightly flawed) masterpiece

PS: A little tip for people who use Mods (i used various mods that add keybind / improve the UI)

The puzzle quests are an absolute sh*tshow.  And take forever I might add.  Furthermore, combat is the absolute worst in a turn-based game that I've played in a VERY long time.  To say it is unbalanced is being generous.  Thankfully you can adjust the difficulty on the fly, but this is indicative of a team who didn't do the hard work of balancing combat.  Combat is either painfully easy or painfully impossible..  Boss battles are generally impossible unless you are min/maxing or save scumming.  Also, I still don't understand why Pathfinder requires you to buff so extensively before a battle.  Hence the problem, without knowing what you are getting into, you don't know exactly HOW to buff and a serious battle cannot be won without first buffing properly.  It's a game breaking mechanic in my mind.  It's a shame because the story-line can be quite immersive except for the fact that you frequently have to reload, readjust the difficulty, reapply buffs...etc.  Last thing, I can't imagine playing this without mods.

The second hour will be realizing you have no idea what to play, so you'll go online and read a guide or watch a video about how to level up. You'll then realize that all of the choices aren't really choices because there are a handful of very strong builds and a lot of trash. A strong build boils down to: spamming animal companions and spamming attacks of opportunity. Spell casters exist to spam buffs and crowd control, which is understandable because, while this system has a lot of spells, most of them are trash. This is kind of a reoccurring theme with Pathfinder in general: lots of options, most of which no one will ever take.

Once you've got that down, you'll finally start playing the game only to run into a host of companions that are annoying as balls and feel like they were added to the game just so Owlbear could troll you (a trend they started in Kingmaker). While there are characters that will make you want to stick around, the annoying ones are straight up psychopaths with no redeeming qualities and I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying these characters except as a niche while doing an evil campaign. It's not even one or two of the companions, it's five out of twelve.

If you're looking for a CRPG to sink time into, this does have an interesting story and the army mechanics and battles were fun little minigames. However, I can't express how tedious I find the Pathfinder RPG system and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Having to activate 12 buffs before combat to ensure you're being effective is a massive waste of time and I'd much rather those buffs are just removed from the game and the numbers for everyone scaled down. That way I could spend more time enjoying the tactics of combat and less time buffing everyone.

I got to chapter 4 in the story, which is really boring in my opinion and removes the player from the fun mechanics of army command. I understand it's a temporary change and you go back to the core game play next chapter, but it felt like it was going to drag on for quite some time and it forced me to interact with NPCs I just couldn't find the energy to care about or even pay attention to. It's at this point that I felt like the story had lost all interest for me and I stopped playing.",1664762273,1677784072,False,3,0,0.356092244386672974,0,True,False,False

Story does not grip me like Kingmakers, Companions are dull, encounters are all over the place in terms of difficulty. Turned based combat was a great addition but some encounters appear bugged so they HAVE to be done in turn based or else damage calculation instagibs your party because its broken. Pathfinding ironically is a constant effort of wrangling cats. The worst sin by far is the ideological corruption afflicting developers these days that shall not be named. I play these games to escape from the 24/7 spew of propaganda from all sides. I don't want to be force fed it on my time off. Might try to slog through to the end but more likely I will just go back and play Kingmaker again and enjoy myself.

Addendum: Finished this god awful game out of spite. Even put in the extra effort to go for true ending. Only problem being a flag from a quest in chapter 3 (sword of valour research) did not properly activate thus blocking me out of said true ending and ruining my run. I had to use a cheat engine of all things to activate the flag to be able to complete it. Was sort of a final fuck you that summed up my experience with the game.

My original assessment remains true. This game took all the negatives of kingmaker and turned them up to 11 them while simultaneously watering down all the features that made kingmaker great and exciting.

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an isometric RPG developed by Owlcat Games and based on the Pathfinder tabletop game. As a fan of RPGs like Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Divinity Original Sin 1&2, and Pillars of Eternity 1&2, I was excited to dive into this game, and I wasn't disappointed. After spending over 200 hours on my first playthrough (The Demon Mythic Path), I can confidently say that this game is well worth the time and money.

One of the standout features of the game is its story. From the beginning, I was hooked by the rich lore and intriguing plot. The story explores themes of redemption, sacrifice, and the nature of good and evil. The pacing of the story was excellent, with meaningful choices and plot twists that kept me engaged throughout.

In terms of gameplay, the character creation system was a particular highlight for me. I spent way too long tinkering with different classes, abilities, and appearances to create the perfect character. The companions were also fantastic, with their own unique personalities and stories that made them feel like real people rather than just NPCs. Exploring the varied environments was a joy, from dark and eerie dungeons to lush, vibrant forests.

While the game does have its flaws, such as performance issues and bugs in some areas (such as Alushinyrra), these were minor inconveniences that didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the game. The one aspect of the game that didn't quite click with me was the Crusade Management system. While it was interesting at first, it quickly became a slog and I found myself dreading those sections of the game.

Overall, if you're a fan of RPGs, especially games like Pathfinder: Kingmaker, Divinity Original Sin 1&2, and Pillars of Eternity 1&2, then you'll love Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.

Some combats feel like a puzzle to be solved and the Crusade part is not that bad although I liked the kingdom building from Kingmaker more. Compared to Kingmaker every mechanic is improved in some way and they really gave enough polishing to quality of life features.

The story is somewhat bland ""oh, you are the chosen one, now go kick some ass"" with angels and stuff. It does improve the deeper you get, but it will take some time. However the story is good enough to be enjoyable if you don't pay too much attention.

But the companions, especially all the initial ones, feel shallow quirky-girl-power agenda fillers. It doesn't get any better, just more layers of ""depth"" added, only tolerable ones being Woljin and Ember. And of course, none of the warrior companions will be male, can't have that in 2021 (or 2018 in Kingmaker for that matter).

There was a comparison of stories with Divinity: OS 2 in comments saying that story there is worse - well, at least companions in DOS2 are properly written.

As for bugs - game freezes every hour so save frequently. This might be due to the fact that I run it via Proton on Linux though.

In the end I want to play Kingmaker more as the story there, while not so complex and ""epic"", is still more believable and cozy.

I have a lot of conflicting thoughts on this game. While I love the world, characters, and voice acting, the gameplay itself makes me want to throw my computer out the window and slam my head against a wall. Here’s my breakdown of what I love and hate about this damn game:

-Love: The Companions. I really didn’t like a lot of them in the beginning, if I’m being honest. Lann and Woljif were really the only ones I liked in the first act. I found many of them to be either too over-the-top and/or too shallow. As someone who puts a lot of stock in the quality of in-game companions, this was very concerning. However, as I got to know them better and progressed through their respective quests, they felt a lot more in-depth, and I grew to love almost all of them. Most of them opening up in a personal way felt organic to their characters, and I really enjoyed spending time with them.

-Hate: The Puzzles. Poorly designed, usually felt nonsensical, and too many repeats of the same types of already terrible puzzles. I normally like puzzles, but not if they piss me off and make me look for a guide.

-Love: The Voice Acting. The only thing I wish in regards to voice acting is that there was more of it. I loved it. The voices matched well with their characters, and made important scenes far more engaging.

-Hate: Combat. I have A LOT of thoughts on this. The amount, the pace, and the difficulty of it. Listen. I like to focus on the story my first time around because that’s more important to me than having a challenge, so I played this on story mode for my first run, expecting to one to two shot most of the enemies other than bosses. I’m shocked. The frequency of random encounters, the number of enemies, especially trash mobs (which cannot be lowered from standard), the enemy ACs in late game, the magic resistance, all make the combat entirely unenjoyable for me. I play PoE. It’s my favorite modern CRPG series, and I can see where fights in those are perhaps too sparse, but this game takes it to the complete opposite side of the spectrum and just spams you with fights seemingly just to slow you down. And as you progress, even trash enemies get higher ACs, which just artificially drags out each battle because your characters without touch attacks (even those can be useless with high magic resistance) need to rely entirely on lucky rolls to even hit the enemies let alone do damage. As I’ve seen online, story mode is way easier, as it should be, but it really doesn't feel like I’m focusing on the story even though that’s what that mode is supposed to be for. 

-Hate: Crusade Mode. Both in manual and auto modes. I played it manually in Act 2, and it felt like an unnecessary time suck. In Act 3, I switched it to auto, and I felt like I had nothing to do. I think I prefer manual because of this, but the whole map traveling system just sucks imo. Fair warning as well, once you turn on auto mode, you CANNOT switch it back to manual later, so make sure you drop a save unlike my dumbass who forgot to.

-Conflicted: The Story. It’s good, but could be better if there wasn’t so much padding in the rest of the game. I had a really difficult time staying engaged (and even forgot what I was doing at times) through all the slow pacing and fits of frustration. Mind you, I think if you took the story on its own, say put it in a novel or something, it wouldn’t have pacing issues as glaring as it does here. However, with everything AROUND the story, especially the combat as detailed above, making it feel entirely too slow, that’s difficult to gauge. In the end, I didn’t feel like the story was really worth finishing. It felt more like an obligation because I had already come so close to finishing. I was exhausted from just playing this game once.

Luckily, I got this on a big RPG sale, so it wasn’t as much of a waste of money as it was a waste of time. It made me angry on countless occasions, which is not something I look for in a video game. I anticipate some occasional anger coming from games, but this was too much for me. I play games to relax, experience a story, and feel like a badass. Unfortunately, the devs seemed more interested in ""beating"" their players than telling their story that could've been so fun. I’ll probably come back for the companions at some point, but it’s safe to say it will be heavily modded.

Edit after another playthrough: Modding makes the game FAR less frustrating. But a game shouldn't need mods to be enjoyable, so this review will remain negative.",1675538161,1677249328,False,51,2,0.677133500576019287,0,True,False,False

To me it brings the classic crpg experience to a whole new level. I love Baldurs Gate 1 &2 and this maintains the real-time combat while including its turn based system as an optional feature. The Camera is now fully rotatable and the dissolving of the terrain as you look around is very seamless. Story is interesting and leaves a lot of room for you to make choices in the how things transpire, the voice acting is fantastic I wish there was more in certain parts. 

One thing I really appreciated was the custom portraits for characters and how easy they made that system. I used Midjourney to AI generate character portraits and it definitely adds to the experience. My major gripe is the character models, everyone is round in the face across all the humanoid models and after a few hours you begin to notice the similar faces showing up. The Monsters have some really fantastic models and effects but the human models stick out sometimes in the overall quality. Wish the Devs would go back and maybe redo that character model system.

Every game studio had a weird little quirk that can make it hard to recommend their games. Owlcat's problem is that they don't finish games before starting on DLC or new games. Sure, Wrath of the Righteous has engaging combat and a passable story. It even has possibly thousands of player character combinations to make a truly unique character. But what you'll find is that half of those combinations don't work right. You'll find bugs in the base game that still aren't fixed despite four DLC and advertisements for the next game on the way.

You'll play it, and you'll have fun if this is your sort of game. You'll also play it and hate it because it's a buggy mess with no realistic likelihood the bugs will be fixed. There's no reason to pay full price for this game. Buy it, but wait for a drastic sale.

First 4 acts are solid, last 2 were disappointing and felt rushed. Most of the side content is handled worse as well, either has little to no story or consists of puzzles. Random encounters are brutal early on, at least on hard and they are so unrewarding and annoying you are better off reloading for stealth checks and cheesing them. In the same spirit the Crusade battles are fun the first two or three times, before you discover thats it for the depth of a system you are supposed to participate in all throughout your 200 hours playthrough.

Companions are mostly a mixed bag as well, you will either want to keep them in your party forever or never touch them regardless of how good their class would complement your party composition. The story overall is as I said very grand and it starts out great, but keeping the stakes so high all the time got tiring fast and while you uncover more about your circumstances and main villain, the end goal is clear from the start and the plot doesnt really evolve much as a result.

Oh and ofc the game meeting the woke standards of current age doesnt help it much. I am just a bigot ofc and most people welcome this(right?), but if you are like me and arent a fan of this subversive stuff, then be warned this one is about as far out there as I am willing to ignore and look past to enjoy a game.

Jokes aside, Pathfinder is a top tier RPG that is unmatched in the fun and variety it offers while role playing, as well as how well written the story and characters can be. It's probably the game that is the closest and most accurate in the freedom that a normal D&D session can offer. The amount of different routes and how varied and enjoyable they can be is extremely encouraging for multiple playthroughs (If you are willing to let go of the game length that is).

The only two negative or discouraging things about it are the combat and the average playtime that is required to complete the game. 
The combat can be hard to understand and will more than likely require you to respec your entire party if you are unfamiliar with the pathfinder's rules and system. If you want a more traditional RPG combat, you should definitely play around with the difficulty settings, unless you want all enemies to be a dodge-tank that can one shot all of your characters.
Regarding the game length for example, I'm at close to 170 hours game time, yet I'm still at the stage of the game that could barely even be called as the midpoint.

Pathfinder is admirable in what it does and and what it offers. Which is an RPG game that finally managed to have a good roleplaying elements and a full, yet interesting game world.

The designers do a good job at putting consumables and gear near the next encounter that hints how to overcome it.  For instance if you start finding cold resist gear and potions, then you can count on a cold damage dealer up ahead.  No complaints about that.

My first gripe is the ally AI.  There basically isn't one.  You can toggle them to automatically attack nearest with melee/ranged weapon and to use one skill/spell automatically.  That's it.  If you have an enemy that runs, your little locked on AI's will follow the target, opening your allies up for attacks of opportunity(AOO) by his/her buddies.  You chose to have your melee character auto-cast something?  Well, get ready for it to do that during melee combat, which also produces a AOO against you.  Better AI/Scriptable AI has been around since games from the 1990's, so this shouldn't be an issue.

That isn't my biggest gripe though, the main problem I'm having is the enemy AI clearly makes a beeline for the MC.  Albeit sometimes this is just poor game design where certain bosses/dialogues will reposition your mc to the melee range of a horde of bad guys.  That's awful, but I'm talking about normal encounters.  I've seen fan boys saying it's based on nearest target, lowest armor, lowest hp, etc.  It isn't.  I purposely ended up specing heavy armor and hp mc because of this non-sense... and guess what, in the far back of the formation with two unarmored spell casters in the middle, with melee tank/dps in far front....the enemy ai will leory jenkins style my MC.  Fanboys usually chime in with ""that's great! You get free AOO's on the enemy!"" It isn't at all.  The casters and archers will instant snipe MC which is gameover on Core+ difficulty.  Enemies also generally have the hp pool of a melee tank, so 2-3 AOO's does next to nothing, and there numbers usually too many for you to AOO.

Some classes/feats/racials don't function properly or at least their ingame text says one thing, but it does another.  I've had curses/hexes/spells completely go missing from my toolbar.  The only fix being to reload. 
 The keyboard will randomly malfunction, it's a known issue.  You have to remove a dll from the game to fix it.  I've read about most of the bugs I've encountered on the forums and ... no fixes.

Personally I hate how most of the encounters are setup as you go further into the game.  Enemies can't spring their own traps, aggro in some areas pulls the guys from two-three rooms down, several encounters put your party into a kill box while multiple AOE casters/alchs spam you with mass spells or alch bombs.  This is just dumb, every encounter shouldn't be a puzzle of ""this encounter uses max DR!"" ""this encounter uses immunity to almost all forms of damage"" ""this encounter sickens, diseases, level drains you"" ""this encounter has a bunch of guys that one hit tanks"" ""this encounter has enemies with extreme AC+invisibility+"" etc.  The further you go it becomes obvious that enemies are stupidly level and stat bloated with their normal spell roster becoming mass spells, magic pen enhanced, level enhanced, etc, along with having triple hp|ac|dr|sr/feats/immunities/etc that aren't remotely normal.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with having some trash mob encounters, you didn't need to turn encounters into a game of guess the right consumables/buffs/grease|pit combination to use!

Lastly please remove hagbound witch from the game.  It is so poorly implemented versus it's table top equivalent that I have no idea why you still have it listed as an option.  It's claws are bugged and feats that normally work with it on table top, don't in this game.  There's a known bug where your hag will get AOO'd for melee'ing with her claws.

+ it feels like TTRPG (but by yourself)

+ the companions are well done. they are a bit cliché but that also means they are easy to grasp. and they also do experience growth within their assigned stereotype.

+ the mythic paths add a really cool new layer on top of ""just"" typical D&D alignments

+ there is a lot of great female and gay representation without pointing fingers and yelling ""oh look! how amazing! a woman warrior! so progressive!"" - it's just part of the world. i like that. 

+ it's very classic high fantasy. it's easy to grasp and get into if you're familiar with basic fantasy tropes.

+ it has funny moments and jokes but they're not overdone and they don't ruin the tone (looking at you, Larian...) 

+ custom difficulty. like, VERY custom. love to see it. 

+ switching between realtime with pause and turn based combat is fluid and instantaneous

+ the character portraits and generally the art and UI design,... it's all very... ""cut from one piece"", nothing sticks out, everything looks and feels like actually part of the game and world.

+ the music (though there could be more of it) is very good; sound design for ambient soundscapes is also very appropriate though sometimes a little gross (suddenly heard someone coughing directly into my ear but I guess that also happens irl sometimes lol)

+ the backgrounds and maps are absolutely gorgeous

+ alignments are well done - evil is EVIL and good is GOOD. but evil isn't always cartoon-evil. it's appropriately mature evil, and even when it is, it is often still possible to understand, it's not automatically just cruelty for the sake of shock value. several party members are evil, but i can still empathize with them - to me, that's ""evil well done"". 

+ this game is HUGE. like ~150h for everything. this might be a huge positive or negative, depending on what you're looking for. it is also SLOW. like the first bigger area alone is like 30h. again, depends on what you're looking for, might take some getting used to. in any case it's a lot of ""bang for your buck"", definitely

~~~

- fights get very cluttered very fast, even in turnbased mode

- no option to turn off friendly fire, even on low difficulties

- the D&D/Pathfinder ruleset can be extremely daunting and you can mess up really easily if you don't know what you're doing and playing on higher difficulties (though that's exactly the appeal for a lot of people so, eh~)

- could benefit from a LITTLE more streamlining concerning abilities and leveling up (like, on lower difficulties, only show options that make sense for the character/class) 

- needs questmarkers OR better instructions in the questlog. seriously. i do not have time to wander around a huge city map for 30mins to look for one NPC. not everything needs a marker ala Skyrim, but at least tell me ""oh mr. mercenary captain likes hanging out a tavern X most evenings"". for new locations on the worldmap, tell me where they are in relation to locations i already know like ""we found this old temple north of river xyz"" or something. 

- generally needs a little more and clearer communication about specific goals, especially in side quests

- let me turn off fatigue and (especially) corruption meters on story difficulty or when crusade management is turned to auto. i know these systems are there so you come back to your base regularly but they're just annoying otherwise. in a game that's already so customizable, one or two more switches shouldn't be a huge issue.

- might be positive or negative but some quests and puzzles are extremely obscure and you WILL need to google the solution, especially if you're not overly familiar with fantasy/rpg logic. some people are into this, though, so eh~

The kingdom management is better than Pathfinder: KingMaker. Again, lots of options & must be aware of ""In game time"" for building completions, meetings, visitors.

I love CRPGs but honestly, this one's a [i]hard[/i] no from me. I've played D&D for the better part of 25 years now, but WotR is making me seriously question whether a system designed originally for a tabletop / pen and paper setting translates well to video games nowadays.

The game gets some things right. Visually, it definitely hits the nail on the head when invoking the great old CRPGs of old. And the music is good too. However, the story and characters weren't really drawing me in much and the voice acting on some of the characters is poor to the point of being annoying. To be fair, I didn't progress far enough into this game for it to convince me otherwise.

What really made me give up on this one is the combat. Granted, I only played a few hours, but it confirmed what I've read in so many other reviews: the combat is just not well-balanced. The (considerable) annoyance of RNG aside, the number of encounters here is simply too many for spellcasters to be effective due to their limited spells per day and the mismatch in challenge ratings between enemies sometimes just leads me to save scumming until I beat tough enemies with a little help from the RNG-gods. That's just annoying, and boring.

So I've tapped out. A shame really, as I really was expecting more from this experience. Somehow the Neverwinter Nights games managed encounters and combat [i]better[/i] than this more than 20 years ago.

I've always been a hardcore crpg fan. Baldur's Gate 2 was my all time favourite game and ever since I played it when I was 14-16, I never found a game that I liked more than that.

That was, until I played Owlcat's Wrath of the Righteous. after 20 years, I finally found a game that is not only better than Baldur's Gate 2, but it blows it away by miles. This is now my favourite game of all time!
In every sense, Owlcat's pathfinder games (Kingmaker and WoTR) are the spiritual successors to BG.

There's so much I could say about this game. I love the game mechanics, the difficulty/challenge, the writing, the characters, the voice acting, the art. I just love the game and I know I'm going to be replaying it A LOT to try get all the different achievements and see the different story options.
I [b] EXTREMELY [/b] highly recommend this -if you are into crpgs-!

Owlcat, if guys are reading this, there's only one thing I feel you could work on/improve: The visual side of things. Not that it is bad now, but you can make it a lot prettier, (without going into crazy 3d graphics or anything). Like in the inventory mode, jazz up equipping the items, cosmetics etc. More variety for the character customisation and cosmetics, that is all.

There's a lot to unpack for someone unfamiliar with Pathfinder, DnD, or cRPGs in general. I wouldn't suggest this game to that person, if i'm being honest. I'd say start with BG and if you like it then check the newer ones like this. Yet Owlcat is more welcoming than i, they've obviously gone out of their way to make this as newbie friendly as possible. Well, maybe not as much as that, but surely a lot more than i would have asked. They've added Turn Based combat first of all, which is controversial but it attracts a lot more players and i understand. They have many difficulty options, from story mode to very hard to satisfy everyone's needs. They have AI attack, though not as advanced as in POE, but they do have the option to automate the crusade mode and all the companions leveling up process. Which saves a lot of time and hassle, in exchange for losing the optimal builds of course. They have so many classes and subclasses to choose from, it's crazy. Different story paths, depending on your alignment, also different Mythic Paths to choose from. It has so much that it's overwhelming, mostly in a good way, but i won't deny that it takes some effort to learn about the mechanics if you're completely new to this.

Now for every Pathfinder or cRPG fan, this game is a no brainer, and a success in my book. There aren't that many out there to choose from in the first place, and Owlcat has obviously done so much work on this to make it look good, with so much content that it's hard to see it go unnoticed or unloved from any cRPG fan.
I'm not saying that it doesn't need some polish. There are still ways to improve it with QOL stuff and some minor bugs to fix, a couple of quests that got stuck and didn't disappear, but it's understandable with the size of this thing. A company five times the size wouldn't do as good of a job in my opinion, mostly because you can tell that Owlcat above all are fans just like us and they truly care about this game. For that alone, i am grateful. 

The story is deep, but to some it may be dragging. The fights are tough but mostly balanced, in my opinion. I only struggled with a couple of them and that with the companions from the game. Anyone with a custom party surely won't have an issue beating this game. Even solo, for anyone that knows what they're doing, even at higher difficulties. Which i will attempt at a later date, since there are so many things that i still want to try.

To conclude, if you know what this game is about then it's a safe recommendation. If you don't, i'd say you might be overwhelmed but it's a world worth exploring.",1676592856,1676594167,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

  There are a few games that are so obtuse that they actively deter new players from trying them and I have to say, this is one of those games.  Many don't like this games difficulty but once you understand the systems the difficulty should no longer the problem.  The problem is the systems are SO UN-INTUITIVE that you are forced to read an online guide to figure out what went wrong when something does.  I have played tabletop Pathfinder and I fail to see how they could have made this game so much of a slog. Yes Pathfinder is a bit more meaty than something like 5E D&D but it feels like this game took all the bad parts and enhanced their importance.  
  Something as simple as resting, this game turns into a micromanagement mini-game.  And you will probably have to rest quite often, so I hope you read a guide on how to do this action properly! Otherwise you will come out of a rest worse than when you went in, even if nothing eventful happens.  I have rested several times with proper rations and inexplicably, one of my party (who started the rest fine), ends up with fatigue or exhaustion.  There are several other game systems that work similarly and intertwine with rests, for example corruption levels, and each system is poorly implemented and explained.  The game devs had to make videos about mechanics because of this, but that info should HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME TUTORIALS.

This game's saving grace is that the story is above average and the writing is, for the most part, pretty good. Companions in particular have some varied and interesting stories to tell, while the main story is, well, good enough to carry it to the end.
And if the above was what you spent the majority of your time on, then I wouldn't offer my recommendation  so cautiously. However, there's so much filler content that dragged down my enjoyment. First, be prepared to spend hours on the very mediocre Crusader mode. Secondly, be prepared to spend additional hours fighting the same enemies over and over again. At the end, I probably audibly groaned each time I failed to sneak past enemies on the worldmap, because every such encounter was simply an utter waste of time.
Oh yeah, and speaking of combat, don't be afraid to just lower the difficulty. I started on Normal, but gradually ended on Story as the game just throws insane AC and spell resistance at you until whatever investment I had in mastering the Pathfinder system was ground to dust. Towards the end, enemy stat blocks come with walls of feats and traits, many of them redundant (""Fire resistance: 10"" and ""Fire resistance: Immunity""? And one end-game boss literally had the same domination immunity listed 3 times. It's like the devs built up a monster they could barely control themselves.)
There are so many questionable design choices in this game. For instance, playing as a Paladin I ended up losing my powers because of making too many Good choices (?!) - apparently, if you don't regularly do something Lawful, simply being Good will pull you into Chaotic Good territory for whatever reason. Luckily, you can reset your alignment with a scroll sold by a priest, but the fact I had to look this up is kinda ludicrous.
Speaking of looking things up: the riddles in this game were the antithesis of fun, designed by a person so miserable that they simply had to share their unhappiness with the world.

*takes deep breath* Okay, I think I've gotten every major complaint off my chest. Phew. But yeah, the story was nice.

BUT!

- At this point, the game is literally crumbling under it's own weight.  
- The UI screens are struggling to keep up with the amount of content/kruft.  Cleric shops listing hundreds (thousands?) of spell in a scrollable flat list, feat picking with sub-abilities nested 4 levels deep, lists upon lists, pages of rules and text to absorb, mousing over the hot text which you got by mousing over the hot text which you got from mousing over a hottext, etc.
- I salute the devs for implementing the gamepad controls, they are surprisingly usable, if supremely tedious.  I think the series is past being played without a keyboard (at least to search in shops or feat screens).
- The cognitive load for someone who wants to know and understand everything is crazy (I spent 15 hours researching my builds and party composition before my first playthrough).  There are hundreds of classes and subclass with so much overlap and sometime minute/pedantic differences. 
- And as if this wasn't enough, let's introduce yet another levelling track that runs parallel (mythic paths). Oh, also, let's add riding and animal companions who have their own classes levels and feats.
- They have implemented so many feats from small obscure source books, I never thought I would say this, but we've reached the point of ""just too much, degrading the experience"".
- And clearly it's nerd heaven, but really, it's unsurprising that stuff that makes sense around a table (when you have a single character to care for and where a single combat round take 3-5 minutes of real time) doesn't translate super well in a game where a single person manages a party of 6 to 9 characters (including companions) and which game be played in real time (with pause).
- And yes, you can just ""ignore all that complexity and go with the premade builds"", but the complexity is there, it's nagging and begging to be tackled.  The answer to this problem cannot be ""just ignore the problem duh"".
- Same goes with difficulty.  Of course, you can play on normal, skip buffing (except for big fights) and just waddle through, but that's not super challenging. If you want challenge though, that means to need to play turn based, tediously rebuff before fights, and slowly control the fight. A fight that's over in 2 minutes in real time mode can easily turn into a 10-20 minutes chore. I wish there was a way to be challenged and get that fun without having to sink hours into minutia that's more tabletop appropriate.
- Balance wise, it's also not great. With such breadth of content, it's unsurprising. When everyone add levels of monk (crane) and witch (iceplant) to literally every character build, you know something is off.
- It's also very sad that armours are only relevant for the first quarter of the game.  A medieval fantasy settings where it's better (AC wise) for knights to be naked with bracers of armor and high stats is not that inspiring to me.
- And finally, there are still bugs. It's improved a lot, but it still feels like a boutique game in many places.  The gamepad UI, in particular, bugs and glitches now and then, requiring a restart to make it clean.  There's also exploits (mounted shield bonus to mount with shield swapped out) that I wish weren't there since the optimal play now involves cheezing.

This being said, it's not all bad.  There's also A LOT TO LIKE.

- It's sprawling, it's epic. The story, the features, the options, everything.
- It's the ultimate high fantasy power trip. Play as anything, become anything: [spoiler]angel, demon, undead, GOD![/spoiler]
- The writing is good, the characters are ok. They manage to include the now mandatory ""representation"" without veering into woke moralising/proselytising.
- It's customizable. So many great mods out there.  You can easily import your own content in the game, you can reskin companions (VisualAdjustments2), etc.  Again, it's nerd heaven.
- If you are a stat maxing DnD nerd, prepare to be served. There's too much stuff for a good clean video game experience there really, but boy, is there a LOT of stuff. So if you like all those rules and debth/fiddliness, you'll be happy.
- Documentation. The game self documents admirably. You have hottext, tooltips, screens upon screens of rules and details. I'm convinced there's too many rules and too much complexity in there at this point, but at least the game provides you with all the meat to understand everything if you are willing to invest.

I love the Pathfinder part of this game. There are so many options for characters and parties. You can play the game however you want, Lawful or Chaotic, Good or Evil. The complexity of the combat system is really up my alley and I could spend days just pouring over all the possibilities. I'd *love* to replay this game with about 10 different builds and parties. That's the good part. Unfortunately ...

The Crusade system totally kills this game for me. Acts 1 and 2 are phenomenal. I loved them. Then you get to Act 3 and the Crusade system really kicks in and totally takes any joy out of the game. There are settings to skip some of the tedium, but they are game breaking for some builds (Lich for example). There *was* a mod at one point that would allow you to win the Crusade battles, but that got was discontinued and is out of date.

It's still easy to recommend to any CRPG or Pathfinder fan. I think that the characters are absolutely lovely, that the world of Golarion is fascinating, that the story is really nice (especially considering all the path variations), and that the score is solid. 

The gameplay is a bit of a harder sell because it does get a little repetitive once you know how things are supposed to go, and because the barrier for entry might be a little high. Prior knowledge of the PF1e ruleset helps, but it's not necessary. There's absolutely no shame in lowering the difficulty as this game does not hold back its punches.

All in all, it's a game for people who enjoy roleplay, complex tabletop systems, and don't mind when a game is a little rough around the edges.

The whole scene this game makes is wonderful. For example i love how you can revitalize land, let trees grow; actually my choices have some meaning, at least small. BUT. After 246hours i must say this game is huge mess. Starting with combat: absolutely unintuitive tooltip hell. You are not certain with anything. Also sometimes i felt certain feat or mythic power doesnt even work....I quite enjoyed the Crusade management and map movement, but something else fucked it up (like always in wotr). Namely by story and map locks and constant unability to go back or not knowing if you can go back. What can i say: mind torture and spiral of massive loading and internet searching; lol  and the biggest pain in the ass was Perception check needed on almost every location in the game. Finally today i lvled up to 13 and i was REALLY looking forward to my transformation into a dragon, then i realized i can do it on lvl 15, not lvl 13 because of spell 6 and THEN I REALIZED that my magus wont be able to transform into that big Dragonkind II and III BECAUSE ITS A FUCKING SPELL LEVEL 7 and 8!!!!! I came to this game a priori, saw dragon character with ability to wear heavy armor with no arcane failure so i grabbed it and now...my fantasy and RP is gone, and im strongly considering leaving thegame at this point.

If not for the 70% discount, id want my money back in first 10 hours of game actually. Game was awesome and i had really good moments, but it is too much by now. If you havent played tabletop game or Kingmaker, i strongly recomment not to buy this game. Not for the full price at least. There are so many SO MANY great cRPGs, namely: Icewind Dale, Baldurs Gate 1,2, maybe 3, Divinity, Pillars of Eternity.... so if you havent been through these, buy it instead.

Also i must add that dubbing AT LEAST for companions should have been completed. Its just 30% of companions dubbed and it stains their cleverly done dialogues, especially Nenio.",1676324281,1676324281,False,3,0,0.476196378469467163,0,True,False,False

I've played it 50 hours at this point, and plan on finishing the game, probably another 50. But god is playing this game such an enormously frustrating experience. 

Let's start with controller support, because the only reason I've even writing this review in 2023 and not 2021 is because it took over a year for them to release the controller support that had been promised for 3 months. And it is so, so bad. It's not just the inability to remap buttons or set inverted x/y axes. It's the interface. Somehow, no one at Owlcat has yet managed to figure out how to show the name of the item you have currently selected on the loot screen unless you opt for ""comparison view"" which literally covers the ENTIRE SCREEN in massive windows of text just so you can see if a plain sword icon represents a regular sword worth 2g or a Masterwork sword worth 100g. Rearranging your skill bar feels like you must be descending into madness, and targeting allies with healing or buffing spells relies on an unavoidable mouse-cursor-with-thumbstick mode that has you scrolling all the way across the screen just to click on a portrait of an ally. Once is OK, but with healing and buffing you're going to be doing this a LOT, a good 10-20 times before entering a tough fight and then a bunch more after to heal up.

Here's what I love: I love leveling up and digging really deep into my character stats. I love gearing up. I love the absolutely insane amount of options given to you. Combat, as an extension, should be fun, but frequent, glaring balancing issues kill that. Enemies with unhittable AC. Enemies that take 9 attacks per turn, each one at +28 and with 12d6 damage, slaughtering even your tankiest tanks in a single turn. A lot of classes and entire playstyles are unplayably bad. Others, such as anything that involves sneak attack (apparently shooting an enemy in the face from 5 feet away can count as a sneak attack), are powerful to the point of breaking the game. Mage characters will get so many spells, so many variations on spells (via metamagic), so many potions and scrolls and tertiary abilities that it becomes nearly impossible to manage it all (especially the aforementioned awful UI). And then you get melee characters that literally don't have a single skill on their bar, maybe some toggles that are permanently on, and they just run in there and one-hit everything. Ugh,

Money is really badly balanced. All of the cool, level-relevant gear being presented to you by vendors is always just outside of your price range. You'll save the entire game, maybe 30k up to act 3 for instance, you've never bought a single item, and hey all the cool new stuff available is 35-50k. By the time you have enough to afford even one relevant item, you've outleveled the gear. The end result is that vendors are stocked with hundreds of cool, interesting items that you'll never get to use. Nevermind the restrictions on hyper-specific gear categorization that forces you pick a weapon type during  leveling--and not a broad category here, like axes, but more like ""Axes - Light - One Handed"" and then if you want to use an Axe - Heavy - One Handed, well tough luck, you don't get any of your bonuses anymore. 

All of this adds up to a system where modding starts to feel like a necessity. There are so many pointless frustrations that can be removed that can give you a better, more fun gaming experience. You can fix weapon categorization issues. You can fix bad money balancing. You can just have your entire skill bar cleared each time you get new spells because starting from scratch is 10x easier than trying to move things with this interface. Unfortunately, there is no mod to fix the awful controller interface, so instead we mod for unlimited carry capacity and just take all the mystery loot each time, most of it is worthless anyway but at least we don't need to manually pick through hundreds of swords to find the valuable ones. (Also, who in their right mind enjoys encumberance limits for loot anyway? The industry figured out 20 years ago that that is not fun.) We can fix the badly specced NPCs, we can fix the slug-tier movement speed, we can remove the relentless random encounters that give you no loot and no experience but are happy to provide an extra few minutes of loading screens. 

But the most frustrating part of this all is that *nearly all of these issues already existed in Pathfinder: Kingmaker*, the previous title in the franchise. All the broken skills, broken interfaces, broken balance, it's all carried over from Kingmaker. Even typos in spell descriptions have carried over! And I'm sure the next game will continue this grand tradition, as well; they've certainly made it clear for Wrath that their focus is on providing ever more badly balanced, untested, buggy content in the form of 50 more hours of DLC than actually fixing literally anything. 

And so, like all the other masses of negative reviews here with 100+ hours played that obviously enjoyed the game, I too will leave my numerous pages of complaints here in hopes that someone, anyone at Owlcat sees them and considers them and thinks about refocusing a little less on content and a little more on polish next time around. I'm so sick of choosing Dazzling Display! This game could literally be the best CRPG ever made, but instead just feels like a haphazard stew of hundreds of ingredients randomly dumped into a cauldron and called a decent meal.

The game is set in the Pathfinder universe and draws upon its rich history and mythology to deliver a truly epic experience.

One of the standout features of Wrath of the Righteous is its turn-based combat system, which offers a high level of tactical depth and allows players to carefully plan and execute their moves. The game's character customization system is also noteworthy, offering a wide range of options and choices that allow players to create truly unique characters with their own distinct abilities and skills.

The game's world is brought to life with beautifully rendered environments and detailed character designs. The storyline is complex and multi-layered, with a vast array of factions, characters, and lore to explore. The side quests and other activities, such as crafting and diplomacy, serve to further flesh out the game world and keep players engaged.

In conclusion, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is an excellent example of the RPG genre and a testament to the development team's commitment to delivering a high-quality gaming experience.

The auto option to crusade will cut out content that you cannot get, though apparently you can still complete the game.
How could anyone testing this believe that the crusade system was in anyway good?

Medicore companions with far worse dialogues than in Kingmaker.
Almost all enemies have pretty high spell and elemental resistances, which is quite annoying when your main character is supposed to be a nuker. Generally your tank can't tank anything. Every boss will pounce him to death within one round or two. Most of the time my tank was idling while other characters were spamming skeletons as a meat shield. At the same time many enemies have insanely high AC, meaning that often only one character is able to deliver damage, while the rest members of the party are having miss festival.
Generally I found encounters to be tedious. Instead of having fun it was tiresome and quite boring. You have to micromanage every shitty fight, otherwise on real time your mage gets killed almost instantly.

I got it on sale, and hit 150 hours for $15...so that's a good deal in my book. Early on, I considered this game to be the best D&D game ever. Great characters. Great voice acting. Great graphics. I gave it a thumbs-up review, because you can really enjoy the first 100 hours or so before Wrath of the Righteous becomes one big CHORE.

Unfortunately, I have now reached the point in the game where every single encounter is a nail-biting boss battle against overpowered enemies who are completely immune to 99% of damage and I have to scour my spell books and inventory to see if I can find anything that can help me...over and over and over again.

It's just a joyless grind when the only reward for leveling up your character is that your enemies become infinitely more difficult and complicated to fight. You never get to feel powerful. Whatever spells or upgrades you just got are eliminated almost immediately by the ten upgrades your enemies now have, and that you have to research and investigate to figure out some way to move ahead.

The game acts like super-powerful demon princes are common as dirt. Every dinky dungeon and cottage basement is crawling with high-tier demon/devil/daemon royalty by the bucket-load and it gets really old fighting only one type of hyper-complicated enemy.

Another annoying problem with the game are the many ""save traps."" By ""save trap"" I mean areas where you cannot back out and need to progress forward for a long time before you exit the area. The Gray Garrison is the first good example where the journey is so long, that even with an abundant number of saves (and autosaves) you can end up making mistakes that eventually mean you have no saves left from before you entered the closed area. At that point, you have no way to go back and reset your mistakes even if you want to.

If you are so badly affected by corruption from sleeping too much that you cannot finish the long and difficult area, you would have to start the entire game from scratch. There is nothing to warn you about these ""save traps"". You just find yourself in the middle of one with no warning.

Another dangerous ""save trap"" comes when you move into Act 2 and start commanding armies. The armies are required to remove several forts that block all progress for your party of characters on the world map. If, like me, you thought you could ignore the army stuff while you ran around playing RPG for a while...you fell into the same trap as I did. The armies rapidly lose morale as they sit idle. With bad morale, you cannot increase the size of your armies and they will panic and run away from combat. 

This is a huge problem if you need to clear a fort out of the way for your RPG characters to be able to make progress later in the game, but your armies suck so bad they cannot do anything to help. There is no way to improve army morale except killing demon armies and if you cannot win those fights, you cannot move forward.

I'm currently in another ""save trap"" where the devs decided to unexpectedly whisk me to some inescapable laboratory with no warning. Every encounter is a boss fight. There is one shadow demon that is invisible, can charm half your team with one move, and that teleports away as soon as you use up all your inventory and spells to almost kill it. This is not some level boss or anything special. Every room has this guy and several OP companions and you have to rest after every battle while your corruption level goes up and up with nowhere to escape. I just don't care to figure it all out anymore. Too much stinking homework when I just want to have FUN.

I'm sure hard-core fans of the Pathfinder series have a great time sinking infinite hours of research into discovering every tiny advantage offered by some spell or item or artifact, but I'm not one of those people. I play games to relax, not to make work seem like a more relaxing pass-time than gaming.

For anyone who does try the game, I recommend a very elaborate system of saves where you basically create permanent saves every 2-3 hours and just leave them aside. You can still run your regular cycles of saves or quick saves, but you never want to overwrite your permanent saves.

As a Lawful Neutral character, I enjoyed having to balance my answers so I still remained Lawful Neutral throughout my Abyss wanderings.

It offers the best adaptation of a deep character build system I have seen in a C(computer)RPG.
You really can make hundreds of different builds and half the fun is thinking about what choices you will make.

Cons:
The encounter designers at Owlcat have said they assume players will reload to beat encounters and they plan encounters around that belief. I strongly dislike reloading in RPGs, it ruins my immersion. I always play ironman mode in any game, in this game it's called Last Azlanti. So a game designed around expecting you to reload fights multiple times is aggravating to me. I don't like the philosophy Owlcat employs here.

As an example, Owlcat employees have said on reddit that most people immediately reload when a companion dies. I do not. Yet resurrection scrolls are limited and prohibitively expensive in act 1. So... why exactly did Owlcat decide to implement res scrolls in this way? Who are the scrolls for, if by Owlcat's own admission player do not use them and instead reload? They should be for players like me who prefer to let every action stand as part of the story. I am a small percentage of the player base, less than 1% I imagine. Why did Owlcat decide to go out of its way to punish a tiny number of players by making an item essential to our play-style so difficult to obtain?  According to Owlcat almost no one is buying these scrolls, so why limit the number and make them so expensive? 

I strongly dislike how Owlcat views their players and the design stance they take.

However, there is no other CRPG that offers this level of complexity with modern graphics and a respectable budget.

Long explaination:
I really liked the Pathfinder Kingmaker game, i liked the story, the companions, how the events unfold, even the Kingdom management and decisions. I liked the non cliche antagonist, the secret ending and so forth. I actually enjoyed reading the dialogues in Kingmaker. The way the main story in Kingmaker was made, where the protagonist was just some random guy, not the chosen one, with no help from superficial beings and no superpowers, he heard about a opportunity to become the lord of some lands and took it, and everything that happened later happened because of what he did and how he solved the problems there. And then I found out that i was just a cogwheel in a even bigger story in some powerstruggle between some magnificent eternal beings. I felt immersed in the game, when my subjects were dying from some plague i wanted to end the plague and punish the ones responsible. 
Wrath of the Righteous is different. I did not enjoy most of the companions, i did not enjoy most of the dialogues, I did not enjoy the Main Character having superpowers, i did not enjoy the main character being the chosen one from the start of the game. The best moment of the game for me was when that dragon got killed by that bugmonster. That cutscene was great, but that is sort of it. I played for 150 hours made it quite far, but i really dont have a feeling where the ending of the game interests me at all. After spending 150hours in this game i still dont really care what happens to the worldwound or its inhabitants. I dont feel immersed at all.
I am at some magic city where turning the camera opens paths, and instead of enjoying it and trying to find secret spots i feel annoyed by this mechanic. 
I played the game on core difficulty, my main character was is a inquisitor sacred huntsmaster, riding a mammoth. making the character was fun, but i am already bored of it. I should have not picked the mythic path of an angel, but all the other ones did not work with my class alignment restriction. I had to restart, because on my first playtrough i tried being a inquisitor trickster, and i could not continue with my mythic quest because of alignment differences. 
The whole crusade management thing felt incredibly intrusive. Like for example I was chased by this dragon trying to find his lair, getting attacked on the road by him several times, but every few hours i need to do crusade management, since i dont want those army movement points go to waste. And then i am now chasing the wounded dragon, and it should feel thrilling and so on, but still while moving towards the location of the dragon i fought several Heroes 3 of might and magic turnbased battles versus some demons, so i already forgot that i was chasing a dragon. 
I never liked turnbased games, and have never used the turnbased mode in Pathfinder, now i had to play this turnbased chesslike combat simulation. It was boring, my armies crushed the demons in a record time. i havent lost a single soldier. still it was boring. And again because of the infirmary i dont really care how many soldiers die on the battle field since as long their number is lower than infirmary they will all get resurrected. No attachment to those armies again. All i did was i built alot of hospitals.
Maybe at some point i will try to play this game again, and maybe i will feel immersed the next time.",1673276118,1675559805,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

One: The character creator requires that players already understand the system. For example if a class requires you to select a favoured weapon, you will need to determine the stat associated with the weapon. There is no indication of the stats for any weapon.
 
Two: From act 3 onward, random encounters can become extremely frustrating. Whilst there does appear to be a logic to the threat of these encounters this is not communicated to the player.  For example a player can set out and with very little travel encounter demons that martial classes struggle to hurt, and which between high saves and the spell resistance mechanic neuter casters. 

Three: The spell resistance system result in damage and debuff spells being extremely inefficient. Spells already have saving throws to govern if they work. The only efficient way to utilise casters into the later game is in support roles which is extremely disappointing.  
 
Four: The Crusade system is it's own mess, and the use of auto-crusade creates its own issues. 
 
In Summary, while the game has incredible depth, it gets lost in its own systems and lack of clarity.

WOTR is a dense, epic crpg with deep levels of customization, functional plot choice, and a sweeping story that will take you from level 1 through 20.

The combat and mechanics leave a lot to be desired, While the rules are a faithful translation of the Pathfinder first edition ruleset, the encounter and enemy design is horrendous.

While I finished the game on Core, I would not recommend it. On Core or greater difficulty, combats are a nightmarish slog of failure in which group without precisely optimized combo's will spend 20 turns missing and no spells will hit. ACs is insanely high (80+ in some cases), enemy saves are in the +30 range, everything has hundreds of hitpoints, and most bosses are immune to the useful statuses. On lower difficulties the combat becomes rather boring and simple; you can just steamroll most encounters. Add in the baffling decision to double down on Kingmaker's kingdom system with a somehow worse and more tedious version, the crusade system, and you end up with a game that outlives any fun or joy it might have managed to induce.

Owlcat obviously puts a ton of love and detail into their games and I really hope they keep at it and manage to improve, but it takes a special kind of masochist to enjoy a game like this. On a lower difficulty is probably worth a play through, but for the typical players that enjoy this kind of game, it's probably going to be a long, frustrating experience.",1675472172,1675472172,False,4,0,0.507087051868438721,0,True,False,False

The enemies you encounter will either die from 1 attack, or be resistant to 90% of damage and immune to 100% of status effects. 

""_____"" failed to overcome targets spell resistance is basically the anthem for this game. So basically half the offensive spells available are useless because casters are gonna want to save spells for bigger fights, and then lose their turn because ""mildly more difficult mini-boss"" is also immune to everything but straight damage.

Game simply isn't fun as-is.. Can be salvaged with modding, but if you ain't about that don't bother.

I hate to leave a negative review on something I actually enjoy, but I literally can't enjoy it without essentially cheating, so that's bad. If anyone is planning to make a game, please do everyone a favor and make your debuff spells reliable, making every single enemy that is worth trying to use them on immune to all of them is just flimzy design.

I see all the time the most ridiculous shit in the ""rolls"" this game does. It 100% cheats to get an edge, so don't feel bad if you have to cheat as well to stand on equal ground.

There is a lot to like about this game. But ultimately, to me, it was more annoying than anything. Character builds are fun. Characters you meet in game are often also fun and interesting but just as easily flat or annoying to interact with or hard to emphasize with when the game expects you to. Some of the decisions you make are really interesting, others.... just leave me scratching my head. There are a lot of moments where your dialogue choices don't let you do the straightforward or reasonable thing. There are a lot of moments where characters suddenly act shitty or incompetent, and it never feels like it's due to these characters undergoing stressfull moments and more like some writer had no idea how to advance the story. Some of the quest progressions and riddles follow bizarre logic (but that might just be me).
I can't say I like this game. The small issues compound, until playing turns into a chore. Which is why I ultimately feel like I can't recommend this game. A game that's only fun for it's first act and then continues to spiral down during the second is not something I would recommend spending money on.",1675439878,1675439878,False,2,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

I like this game a lot. I like the character progression, the companions are all interesting, the story is engaging and I really enjoy the art style. 

That being said, i did not enjoy the crusade management portion of this game. I definitely don’t feel like this component was tacked on and all, but the game requires you to dedicate a huge portion of your time to playing sections of the game that do not progress you as a character or the plot along. In lieu of exploring the map you are moving armies around and engaging in tactics based fights. And while some fights can be won with an under-leveled army, other fights are absolute s***shows and you won’t know until you engage. 

And this experience with combat encounters is not unique to the crusade components of the game. This is how almost all combat felt during my play-through. These combat encounters are a min-maxer’s dream. You really have to dedicate yourself to the underlying systems and any mistakes made through character progress will greatly hinder your experience. The game is so brutal that it feels like it robs you of being able to experiment with what skills you pick up and really requires that you stick to what your class is proficient in. And that makes sense right? I get that, but I also want to the freedom to change how I approach these encounters.

I also didn’t feel like there were any really interesting choices. Don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of them, choices that is. But looking back now I don’t think I could recall a single one that stands out. Off the top of my head, I can tell you in Baulder’s Gate 3 I ran into a goblin and he tried to get me to kiss his feet. As a barbarian, i take no S**** and made him kiss my feet and when he backed off, i was like….no seriously dude…kiss my feet and he did. That’s dumb as hell, but it is more interesting than any other choices presented to me in WotR.

I will come back to this game and give it another chance, because there is a lot to like here. But at the moment I’m just having so much more fun with other cRPGs

To keep my overall review simple, Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is one of the best tabletop - to - video game experiences out there, and in MY opinion it is by far the best one. The game makes its tabletop roots very clear at all time, and somehow it works wonderfully: numbers and mechanics that would be overwhelming on pen and paper make total sense in a game. There are limitations that dont exist in the normal game that make sense for the game not to include as well. 
BUT THE STORY! THE MYTHIC PATHS AND THE ROAD TO YOUR ASCENSION!
For that is the true winner winner in this game, the story line is just so fun to experience. in fact my ONLY critique is there isn't anyway for Owlcat to make a new game in my opinion - as far as I am aware, wrath of the righteous is the only mythic level module in Pathfinder, And with out that, they are going to have a really hard time improving from this point out. Similarly, the improvements this game has over is predessesor Pathfinder: Kingmaker are such a QOL change I doubt I will ever be able to play it again. 

However, One big thing to remember with this game is that the story and its quality revolves around the mythic paths: 10 paths towards being something far more then the average hero. As such I think it is important to address the pros/cons of each of them. See, in the original module the game is based on, the paths were VERY different, as they were still built with a cooperative adventure in mind. The developers took advantage of the single player focus to significantly up the ante. SO HERE THEY ARE!

Angel - It could be argued that this path is the intended first time playthrough that Owlcat intended. Built around becoming the titular definition of a holy warrior of light, the angel truly benefits from the girth of good aligned characters you travel with and as far as I am aware is one of two paths to have a unique romance option. It should also be noted that the Angel is easily the strongest spellcaster of the paths, with MAYBE one path that could compete. It also fits the themes of the game quite heavily, sometimes a little TOO heavily. All in all, a fantastic and fairly easy to build path with good plot and interaction with your companions. 

Demon - So far, this is my favorite Path in terms of world interaction with your choices. The WORLD fears your wrath and anger, and you truly see some key differences once you lock the choice in. In fact, while its still not my overall favorite (see below), Demon just kept pleasing me in terms of what it offered. It also synergizes VERY well with Wenuag, aka the best companion. FANTASTIC option if you are okay with a mild amount of genocide XD

Lich - My favorite path in the game. VERY few games let you go down the path of lichdom properly, and it is so bloody satisfying to build my Kingdom of Death. In fact, my ONLY complaints happen to revolve around one of the paths best features, your full party of unique undead companions. As COOL as that is, there are two big issues I would love to see Owlcat fixes with a patch. 1.) There is essentially ZERO interaction/reaction involving your undead minions after you raise them. NO ONE seems to care that major figures are just wandering around. and 2.) some of them have jsut bad class builds that you cannot really change, ESPECIALLY the final one. (Seriously owlcat, I get that you couldn't keep their normal class, but BARD??? gross.) But the ENTIRETY of the rest of the experience is just pure loveliness, and I was ESPECIALLY sold on how this path resolves the end of the game. Truly my favorite run. 

Trickster - In process
Azata - In Progress
Aeon - In Progress

Note: The below three paths all share one huge problem: you don't choose them or get any real benefit from them until essentially the last section of the game. ALL of them require you to play most of the game going in one direction, only for you to lose most story benefits for that path. With legend this makes sense, but all of them feel forced and unsatisfying so far. While I understand the idea they were going for, I think Owlcat made a huge mistake with Gold Dragon and devil by locking them so far from the majority of the playable game. Switching from one path to another is also hugely jarring: For example, it typically makes the most sense to go grom angel/Azata to Gold dragon, but the amount of interations and story that gets erased by the change is so painfully noticible and make it impossible for me to reccomened. This is also true with Devil. Its just not fun to lose everything just to play with okay thigns for an hour. 

Gold Dragon - Of the paths I have completed, this one marks my least favorite. Mechcanically, it has some pretty sweet perks, don't get me wrong! your stats by the end are fat, and you get a ton of immunities. Its just.... boring and unfulfilling. Maybe it was the differences in how pathfinder and D&D handle dragons, but I think its more just a lack of time and content. Like all the mythic paths, the journey through this one should have started in act three, and there's nothing special or rewarding enough about gold dragon to waste time switching to it.

Devil - While my Devil run is still in progress, I want to note that so far it has the same exact issues as Gold dragon: It takes way to damn long to START being a devil. In fact so far, it took me LONGER to become a devil and came with LESS reward for doing so. I cannot reccomend switching at this time
Legend -

You shouldn't have to walk 5 hours to get to a small map you'll finish in 5 minutes. this game is far better before you finish act one. This game ends up feeling like a shallow non-linear slog fest that you have to crisscross a boring map to play. and because travel time is insanely long you have to CONSTANTLY REST just to keep your spells going. I love pathfinder 1e and i really want to like this game, its just ruined by the stupid map/travel/rest system and crusade mode, and of course if you disable it they lock you out of the secret ending, so the tedium is mandatory for completionists. (100 hours later)..... we'll I've modded the crap out of the game, using toybox to ignore and bypass the crusade and corruption makes it playable. Normal or custom difficulty (with -Much Weaker Enemies - gives you a semi-close to pen and paper level of difficulty, but no matter how much you try to fine tweek it the bosses are still extremely overpowered. You fight bosses with 65 plus AC at levels where even my fully min maxed fighter topped out at plus 45 to hit, Even on normal classes that cant make touch attacks struggle to hit bosses (and yes that's with every buff spell in the game running).
For extra fun one of the bosses auto dispels all buffs at start so your SOL if you don't bring Ray spell casters, kineticists, or dimension strike magus's).  If there was simply a mod to reduced every monster to pen and paper level and disable enemy pre-buffing it wouldn't be too bad, but as is this game would be unplayable with out mods.  and no difficulty setting feels good to play, reducing difficulty doesn't lower insanely high spell resistance enough (its not terrible later on but early game beating SR is basically impossible in some fights) and if you take enemies below the much weaker setting their health becomes way to low  (for comparison setting enemies to much weaker will have them STILL be stronger than they are supposed to, sometimes massively so.  Owlcats fundamental mistake was balancing the game around the strongest classes and rendering  90% of classes and archetypes as unusable on any setting higher than core difficulty.  Do your self a favor and stay on normal or lower, core is not core at all, its probably twice as hard or more than pen and paper pathfinder.  and the game difficulty isnt skilled based at all, it has nothing to do with player skill and everything to do with class choice. The decided to make AC, saving throws, spell resistance, health, and monsters stats insanely inflated to the point that any martial charecter who cant make tocuh attacks will struggle to hit boss AC, and may only hit on a 20. People get all smug about dealing with the difficulty but they do so not by ""overcoming it"" but by ignoring it, they ignore AC with touch attacks, they use spells that ignore saves/SR so the insanely inflated saves don't matter. Sure a kineticist, sword saint, ray caster, or any merged spell book lich or angel can probably handle it, but we shouldn't be stuck playing a RPG where the list of viable classes for anything above core can be counted on two hands. it's a fundamentally unpleasant design philosophy. an i enjoying it modded to all hell? sure but when i have to mod, bypass or remove 30% of the game to enjoy it something is wrong, and rather than just put in a pen and paper mode where enemies would actually be balanced you get shafted by a normal difficulty that makes normal enemies mostly ok but bosses are still  OP (if you playing a classes that cant make touch attacks for example), but then on anything lower than normal it becomes way too easy. they really need a pen and paper accurate difficulty setting with no stat inflation. one of the points of pathfinder was to make 1-20 builds of a single class more normal and functional but the vast majority of classes in this game would struggle to play through the game on normal and be effective, and  that's just not good design at all.",1673198137,1675052920,False,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

After finally seeing the credits roll I can say the game did not let me down on my opinion I made so early on. The game is great, the story is great, the look- the choices, the impact all great. I felt so good playing this game I already wanted to start it again before I was even done like asking for seconds on meal when you didn't even finish the first. 

The only grievance I can say if any is that the rolls are brutal. I could be just bad but I started playing on 'core' difficulty and missing constantly to enemies who always countered with nat 20s was incredibly depressing. But if that is something you can look over (or if your pride is better than me and you can play on lower difficulties) This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who wants to have a tabletop RPG experience on the PC.

The overall plot doesn't seem very enticing. Some of the party characters are 'ok' but I don't think there are any that I really like. There were a few points that I found to be totally BS, such as an unkillable boss that the game forces you to 'lose' to, or having to wait around for a mission to trigger.

Mechanically it's also 'fine' but didn't resonate with me. I have found my archers are frequently able to shoot, and be hit, through walls. There was a few times where I was not able to cast a spell on specific targets (but could on other targets in the same fight), and it wasn't clear on why I couldn't. Lastly, there has been a few dialogue situations where I (and my character) have figured something out, but for some reason will not act on that information. This was just a minor annoyance until I ran into a situation where several useful NPCs got killed, despite my character knowing they could have saved them, and how to save them, but I apparently don't get the option to do anything about it.

So I'm leaving at 'its fine'.",1675007705,1675007705,True,1,1,0.505833923816680908,0,True,False,False

On the surface they look very similar. CRPG’s with an isometric view.
But let me warn you all. The combat within the games could not be more different.
If you come to one on the recommendation of it being similar to the other.
Be prepared to be disappointed.

If you want a game with a beefy story (tons of reading), yet bang average gameplay: 
Get Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous.

If you want a game with phenomenal gameplay, yet a bang average story:
Get Divinity: Original Sin 2

Final verdicts is i DO recommend it, with the understanding of the following:

-The Pathfinder system is pretty complicated. Fortunately, there's a TON of useful posts and videos to give you tips and understand things better. But yeah, it's a learning curve.

-The number of possibilities are overwhelming. This is a positive for the most part but it can get intimidating. All in all, I think there's 199 classes total (Including prestige classes) and you can level in multiple classes. Add the fact that there's several races, many of which have their own sub groups, and you're looking at 10's of thousands of possible characters. Not all of these builds are a good idea though, especially if you play the game at higher difficulty levels.

I definitely liked this game better than Kingmaker, both for the story and the game mechanics. In this one, you're asked to help close a century old portal to the Abyss known as the Worldwound. This is done in the form of a crusade (the 5th one) that you are put in charge of.

Enhancing this are the existence of Mythic paths...Angel, Demon, Lich etc. that augment your powers and affect the story line moving forward. I certainly enjoyed this part, though some of the paths aren't available until fairly late in the game. Not sure if this was because of stretch goals or always intended to be that way (game was originally kickstarted for those who didn't know.) Either way, would have enjoyed being a Devil earlier, as I liked the dynamic of Demons & Devils hating each other, despite both being evil.

There's a good amount of loot and a city/kingdom to run, similar to Kingmaker but done better. Another improvement from Kingmaker is the removal of most of the ""Timed"" events. In Kingmaker, you would have something like a barbarian invasion that you had X amount of days to prevent (resolved through story line quests) otherwise you fail the game. This has pretty much been removed, somewhat exchanged for a morale system where your army's attitude erodes if you don't defeat a demon army or capture a demon held fort in so many days. Not as pressing as the Kingmaker system but still urges you to move forward without clubbing you over the head if you don't.

They've also added pets and mounted combat, so your beastmaster can charge into battle on a smilodon or a triceratops. It's as cool as it sounds!

The negatives wold mostly be the Dev's propensity for putting traps in what are bound to be combat zones, with the device that deactivates them being in another room filled with enemies. This was rather annoying, bordering on troll-ish in some cases. It doesn't break the game but does get quite irritating.

Also, some of the loot is...In question. Like a +1 letter opener that, on the 3rd day of the seventh month during an eclipse, inflicts an extra point of damage when you score a critical hit while dancing the macarena. I'm exaggerating. But not much.

If you enjoy Kingmaker, hard to believe you wouldn't like this, as they've definitely added positives and removed negatives from that game.

I'll end this by saying in light of recent events (Jan. of 2023) I think Paizo has shown themselves to be a company deserving of support. You can help do that by enjoying this game and helping them bring more adventures like this to us in the future.",1674929078,1674929399,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pathfinder second edition feels like a completely different game and all the mechanics run so much smoother and have a lot more meaning to them. I really, really hope that any future Pathfinder games use the newer rules and I will salivating be all over them.

One of the best RPGs I've ever played. Very polished (less polished near the end). A very very super complex system of classes and abilities, buffs and debuffs. It's almost too much to enjoy at times, but very rewarding. As an example, there's a few spells that have multiple page descriptions detailing what they do, and most or all the spells/abilities are so complex in nature that you're forced to read them many times in order to understand what they do. I could say paragraphs about how much I liked it and how good it is from story line to graphics and sound and sound effects, to music to combat and to just about every aspect of this game, but instead I""ll just say 'go get it'. This is a must play for everyone

Also, this game has a real-time combat feature with pause AND a turn based option button. You can switch back n forth at anytime and even in the middle of combat. The turn based combat is by far the best way to play the game, but it can't be very time consuming. I like to use real time combat for anytime I'm only fight small amounts of trash, just FF them and steamroll them. But for more complex fight the turn based part is WAY more fun and slows things down so you can enjoy and appreciate the combat.

I wasn't able to finish the game. I had several of my favorite companions perma die  in combat with no way to rez them. I later found out, it's good to carry rez scrolls around and to have someone in the group that can cast them...and don't let your scroll caster die in combat. It's a complex game and you can't know everything in one run.

I found the 'permanent' debuff spells to very unenjoyable. Often you are forced to run around with multiples of these on each party member for long periods of time. This gimps the party and causes a lot of wipes and reloads...would rather not have them in the game but I'm a fussy puss teddy crotch bish when it comes to dying a lot.

Overall, an epic amazing and surprisingly bug free (annoyances but no real bugs) game for how complex it is. This game offers SO MUCH content. After 40-50 hours in the game you still feel like you're in the tutorial, still learning parts of the game and the constantly added new stuff to learn about that just never seems to end. They could have left out about 20% of the game and it still would have felt like a full, option packed game with crazy complexity.

These devs have finally brought the Pathfinder game system into full glory. I can't imagine them coming out with a game better or more complete than this one or with more bells and whistles but I hope they prove me wrong. If they kept making games similar to this one I would keep buying them years and decades into the future. Even will few changes or improvements because it would take 3-4 games to fully understand how it all works.

Owlcat - keep up the amazing amazing work. You guys are at the top of my list of devs and I really can't understand why I had not heard of you prior to this game.

It, like Path of Exile, has some glaring issues like utterly blindsiding the player with options and leaving you with crippling decision paralysis. 20+ classes, multiple subclasses (archetypes) for each, with even further choices for each class either on character creation or while you level up. There are a dozen races to pick from, with all of them having multiple heritage variants. There's a huge list of backgrounds that give minor bonuses and skill options; beyond that, once you finally get in game and start playing you notice there is within an hour or two of playing you learn about mythic paths of which there is nearly a dozen that all change the way the story plays out and grants you even further character customization. The story is engaging, the characters are well written, and the voice acting is solid, but not perfect.. As a whole the characters and especially companions are well voiced but there are just some lines that fall totally flat. Unfortunately the entire game isn't voice acted, its mainly the story quests and cutscenes along with important character moments for your companions. So if you're coming in expecting a game to be fully voice acted all the time like DOS2 you'll be pretty disappointed. You can romance a number of the companions and let me tell you, aside from one of the options they are pretty horny and at least one will make you question your morals. You have a huge effect on your companions' well-being, you can either decide to help them overcome their trauma (they are all traumatized little creatures and they need your help), or you can decide to reinforce their bad habits and be an evil asshole. The choice is yours, you can even destroy someone who is effectively a recovering narcotics user and turn her back to the dark path if you so desire. But she doesn't deserve that :( 
This game throws huge amounts of choice at you and doesn't always tell you whether or not they are actually important and most importantly, this game DOES NOT expect you or even want you to choose every possible dialogue option so be careful. They can ruin romance or friendship opportunities if you're not careful [spoiler]for example, Arueshalae's romance can be ruined if you try to be too forward with her, and she won't want to talk to you anymore.[/spoiler]
All in all, This is a great game and I highly recommend it, if you enjoy CRPGs. Unless you are familiar with Pathfinder already, I don't recommend this as your first CRPG though.

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore.

1) The ""strong female character"" trope is overused: The dragon protector, the paladin in your party, the scout, the first boss, the spider girl and the orc paladin. 
2) Men are not important and/or ridicule. In the opening scene the man can't heal you properly so we call for a strong female character who can do the job. The other middle-aged man is a rich, snob, worthless and can't hold a sword, so he must be protected by someone more capable. 
3) After a fight scene one the strong woman goes for an orc, hugs it and says: ""Guys, that's my wife!"" Sounds forced and soulless, you barely know them. If the characters were extra caring with their counterparts over time and you would notice something else, it would be a fine roleplaying, but if the most important thing to tell your audience after a fight scene is their relationship status … well it clearly draws to current political discussions and breaks immersion. Is it a medieval fantasy society or a progressive world dressed up as medieval fantasy?

I finished the game once on standard difficulty.

[h1]Message to Owlcat[/h1]
(they won't read this anyway)
If your turn-based mode has a game-breaking bug that makes combat stuck (which is present in your games for a long time and still unfixed), then don't have a quest that forces you into turn-based mode that I don't even care about. It's not like it's even needed for the quest to function, it's just forced onto the player for what? Designer's ego?

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
Through this game's brilliance there are some black gapes of creator's ego showing through and messing up an otherwise near-perfect product. This is one of the best cRPG games I've ever played, easily being compared favorably to Baldur's Gate 2 or Planescape: Torment.

If you care about proper cRPG experience from devs that didn't sell out to action-RPG or turn-based-tactics craze then please support this dev by buying their games. One of the best D20 cRPG experiences ever made bogged down by side-mechanics, lack of performance optimization and light amounts of political preaching.

If you never played a game based on a d20 system - give it a try. This or Kingmaker, although Kingmaker is a weaker game, it is also a bit simpler.

[h1]Description[/h1]
This is a classic RPG similar to the titan of the genre - Baldur's Gate. It uses Pathfinder RPG system ruleset, which itself is based havily on Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition. This system is fairly complex, so playing it on lower difficulty or with a build guide would be a good idea for people who never played any d20 system like DnD.

As a classic RPG, this game will give you a lot of freedom to pursue different quests and objectives in any order you like. There's a lot of side-stories and quests that are not mandatory to finish the game and there's a lot of secret passages or puzzles that you can solve if you pay attention to dialogue and items you pick up.

This is also a party-based RPG, where you create your main character, but will also control a bunch of others who join you for different reasons and may have different expectations of you. Some may even betray or leave you if your morals differ too much from theirs.

Combat in the game can be done in turn-based mode - which is self-explanatory - or in real-time-with-active-pause mode - where game is working in real time, but you can pause and issue commands at any point.

The amount of available classes, subclasses, prestige classes, feats, weapons and spells is vast. It's the biggest high budget d20 game to date.

The story puts you right in the middle of a demonic invasion, which is a rather high-end level plot, but this gets remedied a by your main character gaining access to mythical abilities - godlike traits that are supernatural even in a world of Pathfinder. There are even different mythic paths for you to follow, some of them letting you become a paragon of good and justice, others... not so much. There's a lot of story that depends on your chosen path.

The tone of the game is somewhere between High and Dark fantasy. There are some pretty awful things happening, but at the same time a lot of it is very heroic in nature.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[b]+ A linchpin of modern cRPG[/b]
There realy isn't any contest here. Baldur's Gate 3 is just another Larian game (heavy focus on mechanical, turn-based-only combat) instead of being a proper sequel to original Baldur's Gate games. Nearly all other RPG games with good budget are action-RPG's, like Witcher 3. Nobody except Pathfinder cares about people who want the good old times of active-pause RPGs. Games that had deep systems and a complex story to engage with, but no emphasis on hardcore, almost tactical-strategy-like difficulty.

If only for this alone - I believe this game is worth buying and supporting.

[b]+ General writing and story[/b]
Most companions are interesting characters, even better than in Kingmaker. There's a bunch of optional writing related to chosen mythic path, so replayability is both in mechanics and story.

[b]+ UI improvements[/b]
UI is better than in Kingmaker, especially feats screen now shows you what feats require and what they unlock.

[b]+ Involved gameplay[/b]
You need to be able to adjust to a situation. Having different effect purging spells, protections, buffs, etc. is just a tip of the iceberg. It's deep, but not too complicated. Most classes use 1 main attribute to do their stuff well and it's pretty self-explanatory. Some more complex classes exist if you want to get into them too.

[b]+ Tons of viable options[/b]
It's easy to find people arguing what is the correct way to build a character, using 1 level dips into several classes, specific combinations of race and origin, etc.

If you know any d20 system- meaning you can read and understand your stuff, you don't need to pay attention to that crap. As long as you don't make silly choices like focusing multiple weapon types or putting your wizards in melee combat - you'll be fine.

[b]+ Bag of Tricks[/b]
Ok, this isn't a part of the game, but a mod you can download on nexusmods site. I'm putting it here because it's really damn good. It can let you cheat, but can also give you some qol improvements, like highlight toggle (seriously, Owlcat, put it into your game as an option).

[b]+ NPC VA[/b]
Most available MC voices still sound goofy as fk. It would be better to mod some others to replace default ones.

However, some NPCs have really good voice acting. Some of the best in cRPG history.

[b]+ Classic gaming experience[/b]
In general this game feels like playing something from the golden era of PC gaming, which to me was from 90s to early 2000s.

Game is unapologetic in it's complexity, while not being unreasonable, there's a lot to read, villains are shown to be competent and women are beautiful.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[b]- Forced turn-based quest[/b]
I already described it earlier.

[b]- Crusader army[/b]
Turn-based strategy and army development aspect of the game is too shallow, takes too much time for what it offers, has clunky interface, requires you to go through annoying loading screens whenever you want to do anything, obfuscates mechanics like morale from you and is overall just a very bad version of Heroes 5 with all the fun sucked out.

[b]- A bit preachy[/b]
I will call out stupidity when I see it and writers of Wrath could use some time off their cool-aid. If you want to explore a touchy subject, then give us - the players - means to properly respond to it with different outcomes depending on your choice. Don't strongarm your own agenda onto us.

This isn't as bad as Dragon Age Inquisition Iron Bull's ""THEY ARE MEN AND WOMEN (you bigot, -influence lost)"".

[b]- Performance[/b]
There are some areas where you will dip below 15FPS if you have minimum-requirement PC. There is also a bunch of unnecessary loading screens (like construction) that should have just been a menu or something to save time.

[b]- Difficulty spikes[/b]
This is a minor complaint, because in my experience all spikes could be overcome by returning to the difficult part later on.

I recommend saving in a new slot every time you visit a new area.

[b]- Some minor problems[/b]
Things like double-sided weapons being described only as ""two handed"", which isn't enough to convey what they do. Obfuscated morale mechanics, very annoying puzzles that aren't explained at all and other, minor issues.

[h1]Lowdown[/h1]
Why are you still here? Either play this or Kingmaker. Don't make me come over to you and force you to do so.

I'd give Wrath of the Righteous a
[h1]9/10[/h1]
Fuck lack of optimization and crusade mechanics, but the rest of the game is mostly nothing short of fantastic.

Just one more time - fucking get your shit together, Owlcat. You have the talent to make a perfect cRPG, stop with the idiocies that only pump your ego like forced truns or bad side mechanics.

I can understand if you do like it and this is only a mild not recommend from me so you can definitely find some enjoyment here, but for me the unhappiness outweighed the joy i got from the game.

writing had its good moments but was way way more inconsistent, likewise with the characters. arue, ember and greybor were very cool but pretty much every companion from kingmaker was better than the rest of wraths. really liked <that evil succubus'> segments in the game as limited as they were.

gameplay somehow managed to devolve in a lot of ways from KM. stat bloat is insane, way too many tedious puzzles with no explanation, really weirdly placed enemies that are way too overtuned, god awful boss fight design (yes crpgs always struggle at creating good bosses but wraths are an exemplary illustration of how to do them terribly). For some reason now if you move a character out of an aoe to a safe spot they will immediately run to the closest enemy (usually in the aoe) once they reach the move point. This can be circumvented by making them hold position either before moving them or after they reach the spot (since toggling hold position cancels any movement) but then you have to either click every enemy you want them to attack one by one or toggle off hold position. this may not sound like a major issue, but this wasnt even an issue at all in kingmaker, characters would just move to where you tell them to, automatically hold position in that area and then when you told them to attack they would resume their normal attack ai (this is an example of the really odd ways in which wrath has devolved in comparison to kingmaker)

more customisation options was quite cool, always nice to see new classes,  abilities etc. mythic paths were also cool, it seemed from what ive played that almost every one of them significantly changes the game and events in it which is very pog. Apparently owlcat intentionally sacrificed game length in order to increase replayability which i could not agree with more since my biggest problem with KM was it dragged on too long.

for some reason a lot of the dialogue (especially the ending like what if theres one thing that NEEDS to be VA'd its the ending of an rpg) didnt have voice acting which is strange considering owlcat was a bigger studio when they made wrath and afaik also had more resources to spend so its quite baffling that a lot more of the dialogue is text only.

Story was quite boring and predictable, literally the exact same ""chosen one but theres something nefarious about you going on in the background youre unaware of"" storyline thats been a staple of fantasy media for decades, compared to KM which was genuinely really interesting and unique was a big letdown.

the crusade management was really strange, it was laughably easy and unbalanced to the point of why even have it in the game at all, felt like some weird ""hey remember the first game"" type of thing. as rough as KM could get it still felt cooler and more impactful.",1674657466,1674657506,False,4,0,0.519531130790710449,0,True,False,False

Story is ok-ish but with an obvious downgrade at writing when compared to kingmaker. Not only in quality but in also means of fun. 
In an attempt to add to the replayability, Owlcat decided to hide all story keypoints behind between the lines in text, which are note remotely connected to the flow of the story. So much so, even the guides online can not point to story flow accurately. The innumerable and insignificant quests remain incompletable(because of horrible game design) while they shine with bright warnings, on the other hand main quest cornerstones fail without you noticing them.

Just like the other games that were released recently, trying to be authentic with their characters and such without giving a thought why classics are so, this game has only ugly faces, abominations and bad demeanor on all companions, in addition to being cumbered with low quality and insurmountable number of useless classes, clutter items and puzzles; which somehow became a standard on RPG games lately.

If you want a cRPG with better optimization, characters, and replayability - play this game.

The combat in this game is generally terrible. Smack it / shoot it until it dies. Casters are basically buff bots, crowd control, or meat bag summoner because their damage is laughable compared to even the worst melee / archer builds.

Combat has very little depth and most challenging fights are just because they gave the enemy stupid amounts of AC and you'll just have to keep reloading your save until you get a streak of lucky rolls. Sometimes you're supposed to work around the AC with spells but as mentioned previously, spellcasters are so bad at killing stuff that even missing 19 out of 20 attacks your martials are still better at it.

Game has a lot of frustrating stuff, but I still put 100+ hours into a first playthrough and probably going to do another playthrough. Game reacts heavily to your choices and it makes for one of the most malleable and living worlds in any game. 

Also, GET THE TOYBOX MOD. Use the toybox mod to change or remove mechanics that you find stupid and frustrating.

But:
It is a frustrating game in some ways and requires much patience and a firm believe the developers were not out to intentionally f*** with you and make your life miserable. because it feels like this all too often.

The game is hard in the adventuring phase - in the way that encounters (especially in the beginning: why confront me with ability/level drain in the first two hours when I can only heal this by resting WHILE BEING ON A TIME LIMIT!) are very seldom a no brainer. Most of the time, they pose a real challenge and kind of a puzzle: Which character to expose, which to hold back, which buffs to use and when, which enemy to attack first.... Now, that is good, challenge is good. But in this game, it is highly overdosed and there is no indication whether the area you are in is suitable for your level.

So my advise: Save. After every battle, because the next one might just instant kill you. Not only Quicksave, mind you!

Finally, and that's what really bugged me: Making a game hard is fine, but then I expect it is not made harder by bad documentation. If you give me a challenge, I want all the necessary information presented to me in an accessible way. But there ARE bugs/errors. Like missing tool tips or incomplete information on abilities/debuffs (my request for the next installment: add dynamic information for every ability/condition how to adress it - like in the tutorials but much more consistent).

No matter how much I enjoy the game, I cannot give it a recommend if it required modding to beat. They seem intent on patching the game for these bugs, so I give them a lot of credit for that. I'm not sure if my issues are universal, or if they've been patched since I started playing, or if they're very niche issues. 

[spoiler] For the Gold Dragon questline, I was unable to collect the cheeses from the tavern because the interaction bubbles never appeared. Had I not cheated, I wouldn't have been able to finish the Mythic path. 

Several times when confronting demon lords and using Midnight bolts on them, I was not given the crystals required for the secret ending. 

I also got locked in the council room with no way to transition to another screen without reloading.

If you crossed a door with enemies behind it in turn-taking mode, it would create an invisible barrier that you could not cross. This sometimes split people off from the rest of the party.

I kept running into enemies who were still gaining concealment from greater invisibility even though I had truesight active. What's the point of truesight if it doesn't work?
[/spoiler]

On normal, Combat began to feel very pointless after about level 12. Casters generally didn't need to cast anything except buffs; after that, just let the archers and frontline mow down enemies. Hostile spells feel very weak unless you have hyper-specialized in them (overcoming saves AND spell resistances AND immunities is a joke). Want to dispel things? Nah, you failed unless you specialized in it. This all adds to the problem of everything feeling samey from fight to fight since you are forced to use the same bag of tricks over and over again.. I played in both Turn mode and live combat mode. I eventually left live combat on because of the aforementioned issues (Why take turns when my point and click heroes just obliterate everything? Why waste limited spell slots if I might need them later?) I picked the Magus class, and ended up barely ever using my spells, just sending them in to attack because the time it took them to cast the spell was a waste of time that could have been dealing more damage. I should have just picked an archer. Normally, I'd set the difficulty higher. But I began to realize that running into enemies who were immune to my damage were not interesting puzzles to be solved, but frustrations. The battle log does not explain very well why your damage did not go through, and it requires delving into sometimes 15+ wordy monster traits to figure out what you need to do to scratch it. 

I feel like a morning buff ritual is very time consuming, and it made me genuinely hate resting unless I had no other choice. I kind of wish the game had a ""Cast X spells on Y target after waking up"", or a ""Pause to cast X spell list with a short time skip"" mechanic. I eventually used Toybox for buffs because I got so tired of it.

I got browbeaten by the game saying that the army mechanic is required for certain quests. But the army management is really under developed. There is no reason to take any other general than a mage, and to scorching ray/fireball/icestorm/firestorm enemy armies, and to take tanky units with powerhouse archer picking off enemies who didn't die. Anything else just doesn't work. I wish I had just turned that off. 

I think the game is strongest in it characters, and having each mythic path feel a bit more unique. The writing is good, if a bit long in places. The music is great, and I love the artwork.  If you know Pathfinder mechanics, you'll be able to understand combat for the most part, though you'll probably still get stumped a few times for why you can't deal damage like I did.  I really liked the introduction of the turn taking version; it was better when there was a decent challenge, worse when you were in a fight where everything would explode if you breathed too hard on it. 

Would I recommend it to someone coming from a Baldur's Gate I & II, Pillars of Eternity, or Pathfinder Pen and Paper background? Maybe. There are some really fun little nuggets in there, but it requires a steep learning curve for both Pathfinder mechanics, and straight up bugs.

Combat (I play in turn based mode) is pretty fun, until you get a bit deeper in the game and you keep running across enemies that have absurd AC ratings or other effects that make  them an absolute chore to fight. Yes, I'm aware of buff spells and items to potentially/maybe counteract these but so what? I'm held at gunpoint to  bring along a companion with these buffs or else I'm in for a bad time? What if I'm simply out of these spells or items because I'm up against the 4th demonofdigbickenergy or whatever of the same dungeon. Point is combat can quickly become a case of ""holy hell PLEASE land a single hit Lann, I'm begging you"" and reloading a save for better rng over and over. As for the real time combat I seldom use it unless I'm going against something trivial or dealing with an enemy with low offensive capabilities but an absurd defense (aka, a total chore of a fight).

Crusader mode...it's pretty bad. At first it just seems like a rather basic tile based strategy game with different units then you realize it's actually ""use a commander that can cast offensive spells to kill enemies or you're a fucking idiot"". Occasionally you come across a demon general who can also cast offensive spells and it really sells the point that all of the units you can get are just there to (maybe) buy time while your general does all the work. Combat of crusader mode aside you eventually get to the point where there's a bit of management involved and it's...there, ig. You can build buildings in outposts to increase energy reserves of your general or you can build any of the other buildings for some reason, you are occasionally presented with dilemmas that effect your troops in certain ways depending on your choice so you can watch them die to one spell from an enemy general regardless, you can issue decrees that have various effects like crafting a relic for your party to use or grant you crusader xp to level up one for crusader stats that...that uhhh...ummm...yeah. The biggest falling of the crusade mode is how it's not just some side thing you can ignore, forts need to be cleared to reach areas of the map, armies need to cleared out to avoid constant random encounters, armies also need to be repelled once they start acting up in act 3, and some of your companions will have issues that can only be addressed via crusade mode...so buckle up buckaroo.

Resting and corruption...I hate it. I get it's there to be faithful to the tabletop or to add a sense of realism I guess (or maybe it's there as an excuse to advance time for the crusade mode teehee) but it is just not fun to play around. You'll start a journey to some place on the map, get maybe half way there before your party gets exhausted and your should really stop, rest for however long you need (usually 9-18 hours) maybe get ambushed by some enemies, and go about your way. Resting will also restock your use of spells, get rid of nasty debuffs, and if done at a ""safe"" location get your characters off death door (there's also the option for potion/scroll crafting but I haven't messed with this yet). These are all aspects I'm alright with so maybe it's just the exhaustion system I have beef with, oh and the corruption thing that says ""yeah if you rest too much we're gonna drop a penalty on you that forces you to back to the nearest safe location to do a proper rest"". What are safe locations you may ask? Well it's forts that you conquered and built a building in to make them safe in of course you silly goose : )

That's a lot of whining I just did so what's keeping me here (other than maybe sunk cost fallacy)? Well the companions, role playing, and story I guess. Companions are...hit and miss for me tbh but the ones that do hit (Neino, Regill, Ember, Lann, and arueshalae) hit hard enough to make me want to know what happens to them. Some of the other companions fall into the grating or just boring category, and this could be because of the...charming voice acting this game can have ( I am helpful, am I not :) ) or because they're so generic or otherwise uninteresting (I can't go into details because I haven't actually come across the ""twist"" yet but lil miss helpful has a twist that's so obvious I'll feel like I've been bamboozled if she doesn't turn out to be a completely deranged psychopath). Maybe I was just spoiled by Divinity though.

As for the role-playing the game presents you with some meaningful choices for the story and how your character grows, the thing is I find myself asking ""will I really want to sit through all of this again to explore these choices?"" but at the very least it makes for one good playthrough.",1674232206,1674246513,True,1,0,0.515437722206115723,0,True,False,False

The pacing is to shit as well, with chapter 4 being a hard e-brake pull for many of the storylines.

A tedious slog of endless combat in badly scripted maps with a party of anti-social assholes you have to take if you want a story. But said story was also written by THAT GUY about his super special NPCs who don't play by the same rules you do and can't die because he's not done with them and fuck you for trying.

Just, awful, fucking garbage. You know RPG is spelled ROLE playing, not ROLL playing. Combat should be the spice, not the whole dish, which is why your spells and abilities tend to have very low limits on how often you can use them. If a level 8 wizard is out of spells, it should either be because you're in the climax of the story, or because they're a moron. Not just because you decided to nip out to market district only to be waylaid by 8 packs of giant spiders, 3 level draining succubi and a random band of marauding paladins that have decided their oaths mean shit compared to their hunger for your blood.

They also have still not learned the fucking rules of Pathfinder, making shit up as they go based on a very loose interpretation of the source books. Stripping out key features of various classes or character types because they couldn't be bothered to integrate them in their bizarre combat centric game, and then just flat out ignoring the rules when it comes to making enemies, with early game threats having armour classes as high as 60, on fucking casters, everything having spell resistance rendering early game wizards even more worthless, and four attacks being the norm. Enemies still spawn out of thin air, so if you go into a fight with preparation then you just wasted your time because no sooner does that last mook fall then twenty of his buddies will spawn on top your backline, and no, it's not because they were stealthy, it's because the game doesn't approve of your attempts to out fox it.

Owlcat has not improved, this is the same rubbish, by the same people, in the same badly written engine (Some programs like NVIDIA control panel even see it as the same program). The only way to play this game is with mods, and cheat mods at that, simply to remove Olwcat's awful decisions and let the game clip along at a reasonable pace. Oh did I forget to mention the save bloat and memory leak are still in this game from Kingmaker? Because they are, and you still need third party mods to fix one of those and just have to swallow the other.
The story is garbage, the gameplay is a number cruncher's nightmare, the rules aren't worth toilet paper and the characters are hard written as goody-two-shoes bland doe eyed babies, or razor chewing, eyes bleeding edge grinding bad guy morons.

After pushing through this game for the sake of bloody-minded self gratification (twice for the secret ending which bugged out by the way), I just kept wishing I was playing Neverwinter Nights 2, with a couple of mods, the fan patches and dlcs etc. It was by no means perfect, but at least fighting, problem solving, and story design all felt satisfying and balanced. Even the late game slog of combat at the end of the default campaign was better balanced, had better stakes, and was over in a more reasonable time compared to a random fucking encounter you have in this title. Monsters were from the manual, with reasonable tweaks to make you sweat and feel good when you won, they did not have ACs of 50 with permanent true-sight, spell-immunity, aura of fear (DC 30) and 9+ attacks a round.

There is no good to be had in this title, and anyone who tells you this game is a paragon of CRPG's is a moron enthralled by ""choice"" in numbers, who never looked at how story, gameplay and source material combine to make the whole product. You can make an insane murder hobo in this game, sure, and it seems the game wanted you to do that, but you can do the same with a calculator and your imagination, save your money and spend your ego elsewhere, far away from my tables and all good role play games.",1665090011,1673992307,False,3,0,0.473302453756332397,0,True,False,False

I'll start with the positive aspects. First and foremost, the game's plot is nothing short of legendary. It is well written and the amount of variations it can have due to the impact of your choices is insane. I am truly awed that a complex story like that can be placed in a game and that it can actually be functional.

Complementing the first aspect, character legendary is also great. I won't get into much detail since I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep it at that.

Thirdly, character building is incredible. The amount of class combinations you can make is virtually infinite and most classes are fun to play as, especially when you see them yielding the expected results.

Now, for the negatives. First of all, the original point of my previous review still stands. Even though I've learned much about specific class abilities/combinations, which definitely aided me through the game, some portions of the game are gruesomely hard (where you have to resort to gimmicks or sheer luck to go through), while most of the game is simply annoying. Not hard, just annoying. You always have to keep an eye out for sneaky ability drains/poisons/diseases that enemies can lash out on you which just hinder the fun. If only they were rare but alas, I can safely say that more than 75% of mobs can deal permanent debuffs onto you.

Because of the first aspect, you will be forced to always have few specific spells at your disposal at all times. If you don't have these spells, the game will be rendered virtually unplayable as enemies will drain your stats until you are nothing but a walking corpse.

Thirdly, class balancing in this game is even worse than its predecessor. Many classes are simply useless if you intend to play on medium difficulty+, whereas others are a MUST if you intend to play without having to resort too much on luck. Of course, it is understandable that the game is like this since there are what, 30 classes in the game, where 20 of them have 6 variations? Balancing that must truly be complicated, so I'm willing to let this one slide.

All in all, the game's story is legendary, whereas gameplay itself is annoying and even infuriating at times. In the end, my verdict is that you should definitely get it if you enjoy complex, well-written stories or if you're a masochist who wants to torture yourself in your spare time.",1657926628,1673882160,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Technical issues aside, the biggest problem I have with this game is mechanically, it's just an overbearing mess that all but requires you to sit down and do hours of research on class and party build synergy. This game punishes you for not making the best possible builds you can on Normal difficulty and above. If you want to just turn your brain off and play the game for the story, sure, you can do that, but here's the problem - the story and characters are not particularly good or well written.

There is something very wrong with this game when I cannot stand any of the party members in the first five hours of playing. Their voice acting is annoying, their emotions feel forced and not appropriate for the moment. They info dump a lot of stuff during conversation that doesn't come off natural. The writing in this game is pedestrian and not up to the quality of CRPG's I expect a big game like this to have.

And then there's the game itself. This developer, well frankly I'm going to avoid every game they make from this point on. They have a deep enjoyment of overly tuning encounters to be stupidly difficult and annoying. Playing this game on Normal or above is like playing tabeltop with a DM that only wants to kill the party for his own enjoyment, complete with badly voiced characters and a plot so stupid only he could have made it up during his free time.

This game is made for a specific kind of gamer. That gamer is the type of person that posts and reads Neoseeker crunchy min-maxed builds and wants to break the game making a multi-classed monstrosity with 100AC and 55 AB, full spell progression etc. 

When you see the best ""builds"" being talked about being something like an Angel Oracle/Cleric or some sort of Trickster, you know the meta is designed around min-max.

The main issue is the pacing. Everything is bogged down for no reason other than no being play tested it seems. 90% of the dialogue is throwaway. 90% of the encounters and fights are throw away. And that basically 90% of the game.
It feels extremely discounted through the entire play-through like your just being warped from one zone to another and theres no continuity of terrain or movement. Camping is trash and so is the abyssal corruption mechanic. 
The plot is OK. But its nothing memorable and its actually really linear hidden under loads of fake depth with classes and spells and stuff. You cant play the way you want, you may as well have just let it do the story and combat for you because its boring and uninteresting. 

What could be done to fix this title is mods. In game mods already ready to be used to get rid of these fake features. I already had to change crusade mode to auto and combat to casual because their so boring and tedious to use. 
You could also get rid of all that terrible blacked out map camera nonsense. I get it. You wanna be baldurs gate, but just stop be pathfinder and do it well. 

Theres loads more, but i would say skip this and read a book or write one with all the time spent doing absolutely nothing of value to push the plot forward. This could be great, but absolutely under no circumstances should you play this without a way to Mod the hell out of it.

detailed character creation is the stuff I LIVE FOR in video games, especially in a fantasy setting like this. When i saw that i could do that with companion characters i was DROOLING! its what got me to buy in the first place. 
The tactical game is fine and the ability to change between turn and RT is amazing. and should be adopted by everyone who works on this type of game in the future.  

The written characters never came alive for me. I never found myself going ""wow, I love this character"". I enjoyed the lack of black and white. The grey look at life of  most of the characters was a good try. the voice acting is decent. not great, but decent. 

 And if this was the worst i could say about any of it. Id say get it on sale and you'll get your moneys worth... but I cant. 

The army portion is a larger portion of the game than it should be... and MAN IS IT BORING. I mean slice my wrist with a butter knife bad. I enjoy turn based games. If it says Civ in it, I own it and have sunk more of my life into it than i want to admit...  THIS IS HORRENDOUS. its janky, its ugly, I never found myself excited about it. the ""battles"" are terrible. if this was an attempt at what Total war does... move around the board and fight with armies. Id be overjoyed. but this has none of that. you go from that map to a chess board in a game that has shown it can handle tactical fights and chooses not to do that. and so much of mid game revolves around it. ""main character, go to this area, oh wait you have to clear out this army first"" isnt a bad idea, but this games execution is horrible.

I started of by not recommending it (i was mad at a few things that i pointed below), but i changed my mind because the game if really fun, and only found one game breaking bug that stop progression on one of the DLCs, i love how hard the game can be and how well written it is, BUT:

Year old reported crashs inside the gray garrison still happens... 
(fix by decreasing graphics quality, not sure exactly what the cause is)

Playing for long periods cause the game to glitch/bug, delete items, etc 
(fix by restarting the game often)

Game crash at start up if not allowed internet connection.

Has some really hard sections and battles, which might put some players off



30sh hour in:
Game still very buggy (lost over 30k worth of items to this bug)... after playing for a few hours or so a bunch of bugs/glitchs appears, was sorting my inventory after playing for a few hours and i noticed that some items from my stash disappeared... for some reason clicking with the left button on my shared inventory was deleting my items, and dragging and dropping items from shared inventory to stash was dragging the selected items plus some other random items... 
restarting the game every hour or so of playing fix this and also fix the frame rate drops, plus character sheet/inventory bugs

First hour:
I experienced game not launching with fresh install, at least hundreds of players have the same problem.
Looked for a long time for solutions provide by other players, and there several different reasons affecting each player that suffer from crashs and failed start up.
I tried many suggestions, and In my case my firewall was blocking the game from connecting to the internet and without internet connection the game simple would not launch, after allowing the game to connect, it did launch, but after blocking the internet after launch the game crashed and game gave me the message that i had a problem with mods ?!?! that the mods were causing my game to crash?!?! 
So... to play this single player game i need to allow it to be connected all the time to the internet... why??!",1672763136,1673809445,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

There are few games with such a good history, so much role playing potential and interesting world and companions. I say there are few like this one but I just don't know any as good as this, even the previous pathfainder kingmaker game is not as good as this.

I recommend it to all people who like rpg, hardcore rpg. Beware that this is a very long game, it can go up to 150h(you can obviously do it much faster though) or perhaps even more if you are a completionist, like to explore, meditate your choices(I do that too much) and are learning the game, so this game is not for casuals. You will forget the different storylines, quests and npcs easily if you don't play for a while because there's so much going on. It also has the most deep combat and level up system that I've ever seen, and it will probably feel overwhelming for people who haven't played the tabletop game, it's ok, I'm one of those and I love the game. Owlcat knows this and that's why the normal level is actually easier, core is what would be normal for tabletop players, you can respeec your characters in game if you find a build you like or messed up your charecter and every time a concept or a variable you don't understand comes up just google it. Don't get discouraged by the amount of information that you don't understand that will undoubtedly come at you at first, this game has it's flaws and it's not for everyone but it's one of the best experiences I've had in gaming.",1671105886,1673758139,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a game with solid writing (especially when it comes to its companions) and great core gameplay on the CRPG side of things, but also suffers from an underbaked grand strategy system and some extremely unbalanced encounter design. The mid to late game can be extremely frustrating and require a lot of thought, planning, luck, and sometimes cheese to get through, and at times I seriously question Owlcat's decision to inflate the numbers for some of these NPCs when compared to either their original tabletop incarnations or other high level monsters from the tabletop system.

That said, if you can get the hang of it and/or find a mix of difficulty settings that gels with you, it's got a compelling story, a fun mythic ascension system, and the combat and exploration are very fun when the balance isn't off the rails. It's simultaneously the most and least fun I've had playing a CRPG but people who are more hardcore about these kinds of games might enjoy it more and have less issues with its balancing.",1673757585,1673757585,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I'm leaving a positive review because there are a lot of QoL improvements over Kingmaker that make the game much more approachable.

There've been a huge number of improvements since kingmaker, and there's only a couple of timed events (unlike kingmaker that's largely timed event based).  

I like the mythic paths, but the progression is a bit odd / could potentially be easily solved.

I will say the lack of a ""full"" respec option for companions is pretty disheartening.  This can be gotten around by using a mod though it is annoying to do since patches have a habit of breaking mods / needing updates.  I understand it's somewhat immersion breaking but after 10+ times starting the game with the same side-character builds, you'd lose your mind without being able to re-spec them into a new class.

The balance is pretty off, the shield maze (basically the tutorial dungeon after the caves) is rediculous even on just hardened difficulty, but for most of the rest of the game outside of some bosses normal is far too easy after getting the hang of it / getting a couple decently optimized builds.

I'm looking forward to the new dlc, and future games from Owlcat.  Despite the issues I mentioned, the game is overall enjoyable and a great experience.

On the one hand, there's a lot of good stuff: the main plot is pretty good, the characters and their individual stories are good, some even great or excellent. There's a lot of situations where you have to make pretty nasty choices, which I like. Gameplay is solid for the most part and combat is good. A lot of the conversations are very long, which can bore some, but I enjoy novel-length dialogue. There are very interesting locations and the dungeons are pretty well designed. Nothing especially awesome, though.

However, there are a few pretty bad blemishes here, for me at least. The strategic campaign is feels like HoMM3 lite, but it's not particularly well done. The strategic fights are mostly boring and so is the development of the crusade. Distances between locations are long and getting to places without teleportation can get a bit tiresome. Some dungeons have puzzles that are more annoying than intriguing. They can also get pretty repetitive. The worst problem for me were the few enemies here and there that were punishingly hard to defeat, and not in a fun way. Many monsters have insanely high AC or spell resistance, some are even outright immune to most spells that would stun or debilitate. I get it that demon lords and boss monsters should be stupidly hard to defeat, but there are also late-game mooks (looking at you Desolating Gallu Stormcaller) that are even harder to defeat than demon lords. Sometimes there is a way around these barriers, but it all makes it feel like there are [i]correct[/i] character builds that need to be followed to succeed (and when those are followed, even the toughest enemies become trivial). I find this boring and irritating, but if you like to optimize characters and study build options, this might not be a problem for you. I found it tedious to go through the convoluted system of feats, subclasses, metamagic, specializations and so on when I was leveling up.

All in all, it's a good game, great at times, but mostly just... good. Still, it gets a recommendation despite its problems.",1673698652,1673698652,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Whoever ran the balancing for this game should be not only fired but blacklisted from ever working in that department in any company on any project ever again.

Be prepared for your characters to stand in one spot and do basic attacks, because that will be most of their turns. Sometimes you'll cast a spell. Yay.

Besides the fundamental flaw in its concept, translating an opaque and janky tactical combat system to video game form, there are other nits to pick here as well:
Terrible enemy AI that does things like move and draw opportunity attacks for no reason. 
Insanely large battles that involve tons of enemies and allied NPCs that take FOREVER.
Annoying NPC companions with cartoon-ish personalities.

Clearly a lot of work went into this and the game looks and sounds good, but I had to tap out about 10 hours in after a bunch of enemies attacked my home base, and my party and about 20 NPC allies fought them for 15 minutes with no end in sight. I was level 4.

Somethings are better, pacing and the weight of the problem you face feels more real and at the door than in kingmaker.

I get that, the game has a lot of options in character building, which means that the powerlevel goes from RP heavy fluff build to absolute degenerated combo build, and I get the feeling the devs think it's your job to find the difficulty that fits your playstyle, but in 100+ hours I never managed to do that. 

I stopped playing around the end of the game, because I realized the only thing that kept me going was to see what's going to happen next, otherwise I was in no way having fun - and honestly, the story is not that exciting.
(Btw, a lot of the story seems to be locked behind multiple playthroughs. With 100+ hours on a playthrough, who toughts this would be a good idea?)

Quite a lot of patches/updates were released since I finished the game (shortly after its release) and wrote the review. Now the game seems more polished, although occasional bug or glitch still happen, but mainly I must say that game feels significantly easier than shortly after the game release.
They had to adjust it a lot, because it's like day and night. It doesn't feel so unbalanced, except for a few fights that now feel maybe way too easy, but you can always raise the difficulty if you don't feel challenged.
Especially in turn based the game is now easier..not casual (talking about medium difficulty), but finally you don't need to follow class and build guides to the point if you don't want to feel useless.
All in all, I would recommend this RPG for sure..it's a solid 9/10 for me.
********************
Original review:

Objectively great (and huuuuuuuuge) CRPG which left me completely exhausted when I finished the story (almost every quest available) after 170+ hours. I don't want to see this game again (at least not soon)..why? Because I don't have so much time anymore and it's so extremely looong :D and also because difficulty spikes in this game are as none I have ever seen. It's like easy-easy-hard-easy-impossible-easy-godlike-impossible-just die already-easy-hard-easy-easy-impossible..

I play RPGs for almost 30 years now and I have never needed to change difficulty as much as in this game. Some fights were literally impossible to win with my party composition at medium difficulty or higher (especially when this game has no problem throwing bunch of enemies at level 30+ against your party at level 12 for example and also make those enemies resistant or straight up immune to most kinds of damage) and last few hours I just gave up, wanted to get rid of this game as soon as I can and set enemy dmg to 0,3x .. and even then it wasn't easy :´D

And yeah, lot of bugs here and there, but I didn't have any major issues. 

Objectively speaking - very good (great even) game .. subjectively speaking I would take some points away because of how angry and exhausted I felt for a large part of this digital nightmare.
In total..I would give it about 8,5/10 and definitely recommend WotR to CRPG fans.

TLDR:
If you enjoy enemies with milions of HP, immunities to everything imaginable and scaled to level AT LEAST 2 times your party (even when you do every quest in the game and reach the max level well before the last part of the game) .. basically, if you enjoy BDSM and torture, then you will simply LOVE this game.",1638207604,1673454801,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Pros: looks great, plays great, especially recommend tactical/turn-based. Casters feel mostly good until late game enemies have enough spell resistance that blunt trauma works best. Story is good, even at time great by pulling on the right old-school strings... if you enjoyed Baldur's Gate 2, you'll love much of this. 

The downsides. I am a very experienced player in TTRPGs, Pathfinder, DnD, Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate 2, Icewind Dale 1, Icewind Dale 2, Neverwinter Nights, ect.... this game is brutal even compared to the old ones. Kingmaker hated casters by giving timed quests with severe penalties. WoTR creators believe that the best way to increase difficulty was in increase AC, savings throws, and resistances. By end game, most creatures are still routinely being missed by specialized characters and are immune to most spells. This became tedious instead of rewarding after reaching a point that if I could hit, the enemies just died immediately.

If you're a veteran of CRPGs who's used to doing a lot of research before going in, making over the top character builds and becoming absolutely untouchable, you'll have a great time with this game. If you can't do that, or just get frustrated with frequent and often long combat encounters, it mighr be good to look elsewhere.

Playing this game is the CRPG equivalent of moving across the country because a prospector found gold in them hills. It's a game that is not simply difficult - were that the case I would recommend it wholeheartedly - but that is often unfair or tedious in its encounters. You'll slog through fight after nonsense fight only to get CC'd down by an invisible spellcaster, run up against enemies that your fully built fighter can't surmount the AC of and have a lot of difficulty spellcasting because the majority of encounters in this game have spell resistance that requires specialized builds to surmount. Even when you're not facing cheap deaths, you'll have to suffer from just the sheer amount of enemy spam bogging down the gameplay.

But get your mining operation set up and once you strike the gold at this game's heart, it is rich. There's no other game that I can think of which lets you, not just fully create, but shape a character to the degree that you shape your main protagonist. There are so many decision points which allow you to change your relationship with the world and its characters. Want to be a loyal commander, fighting nobly with the blessings of heaven for the queen? You can do that. Want to assassinate the queen, raise her as your undead thrall and declare an independent necrocacy? You can do that too. Want to mock and laugh at your enemies as they fall before you, raising an island of joy and merriment out of the earth to please the goddess of dreams? You guessed it, you can do that. This game really embodies one of the most incredible and frankly epic journeys in the CRPG space - not all CRPGs let you go 1-20 in a single campaign, even rarer is the opportunity to go even further beyond, which this game offers in spades.

It certainly isn't perfect though. Owlcat has moved to work on a Warhammer themed game for their next title, and while I may pass on that one, I hope that when they come back to Pathfinder - if Pathfinder still exists at that point - that they hire someone who is a bit more knowledgeable about the tactical side of CRPG design and can make something with fewer, but more interesting, fights. I would like to see them do away with RTWP in the future and just use turn based combat, mostly because a game centered around turn based would encourage a design with less ""filler"" encounters.

I have pretty harsh criticisms of this game, and being objective, I have to say that it's mid. But when it gets good, jeeeeeeeez, does it get good",1673296813,1673296813,True,94,1,0.880683422088623047,0,True,False,False

The characters are fun, the story is neat, and the mechanics are interesting, but I keep having my game experienced RUINED by bugs. The Azata mythic path, the one I am using, is broken in several parts. My dragon companion, Aivu, has shrunk down to medium size after she was large enough for me to ride her. Summon havok dragon and summon phoenix both just summon an azata instead. The azata spell that prevents all fear effects for an entire encounter simply removes the fear, it doesn't prevent you from being feared again. The azata ability that causes my single target spells to affect more than one creature keeps me from applying death ward to the party member I want. Instead my character runs over to a completely different party member and casts it on them. I had a cutscene not end and had to find a solution online to just spam the end dialogue button over and over to make it work. The pause menu sometimes just doesn't show up, forcing me to quick save and hit alt+f4 to leave the game. Charging sometimes doesn't work, causing you to just lose a turn. One of my party members has a wisdom drain symbol on him, despite having his wisdom fully restored. The Life Bubble spell simply doesn't work at all and a strange error message appears on my character's conditions instead. Half the time, campfire dialogue doesn't play, only the text.
These are just SOME of the bugs I have encountered in this otherwise fantastic game. I had hoped that after Kingmaker's disastrous launch, Owlcat Games would not release RotR in an awful buggy state but I was wrong. Wait a year to buy this game. Hopefully by then, most of these bugs and many many more will be ironed out. Also WHY CAN'T I ROMANCE WENDUAG AND DAEREN AT THE SAME TIME? Something tells me that a hedonist and a back-stabbing kissass shouldn't be too bothered that their partner is in other relationships.

Update: after a lot of patches, the game is in a much better state. As far as I can tell, most bugs have been fixed, although sometimes characters still lose their turns and campfire dialogue sometimes has no voice acting.",1632178365,1673198962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[strike]However, i can't recommend it, in it's current state.[/strike]
After several updates the game runs far better now.

The game has a lot of bugs, badly optimized, and for some reason the writers seem to misunderstand that ""Evil"" Doesn't equal Madman that kills everything, (Nearly all Evil options i've had so far has been ""I'm bored, I'll kill you"")

[strike]Badly Optimized. I'm stuck at 24-40 FPS, with a 3080TI, I9-9900k and 32GB Ram. Yes the game is also installed on an M2. SSD. I shouldn't be stuck at 24-40 FPS.

If the game becomes optimized i'll more than gladly change the review to a positive, as the game play itself is amazing and I do enjoy the game.[/strike]

Edit: After having finally completed it (It only took me like what.. 200 hours? I can easily say the game is worth the money, however the bugs still exist which means you'll crash at times[strike] and the FPS is hurtfully low at some points.[/strike] Oh.. and the infamous party member stuck below the map/stuck in permanent knockdown. Meaning you just have to hope you'll have a save file close by. (Oh how many hours i've lost this..)

If you're playing an evil character, the early game feels horribly written. I picked Demon Mythic Path which, honestly, was outstanding in the late part of the game. Your choices start to align more to the ""Demon"" path instead of just straight out ""I don't like you, i'll kill you"" as i mentioned earlier.. And i must say, normally i don't pick the evil side, but i was impressed when i finally reached the part where your Mythic Path actually matters.

But that's still like 70 hours into the game, if you're not just rushing it. So the first 70 hours is basically Evil = ""Kill anyone if they as much as breathe"". (You don't have to pick the evil options all the time but, Not really many thought through evil options till, as said 70 hours into the game)",1630877443,1673184237,True,0,0,0.493963629007339478,0,True,False,False

I'm a big fan of the Pathfinder tabletop, and this is not that. Not by a wide margin. So many things have been altered for the sake of artificial difficulty, away from the PFSRD. Even on the supposed ""Core"" difficulty.

If I could describe playing this game in one word, it would be ""exhausting"". You will be faced with endless encounters, constant battles with inflated AC and attack bonuses on your opponents. Constant level drain and ability damage. Enemies that are immune to things or have permanent spell buffs on for absolutely no reason.

The strength of most tabletop systems is that the DM and players are all pulling from the same source. You don't just make bull$h1t monsters just to frustrate your players, there are rules to the madness for a reason. Owlcat is a TERRIBLE DM. The encounter choices they make are insanely tailored to be as tedious as possible.

It didn't need to be this way either, whomever designs their encounters needs to take a serious step back and look at how they are designing this stuff. On a fairly high optimized party, you're still going to need to be an F5/F9 warrior just to get by. The game was designed around the fact you can save and load at any point, so many encounters just boil down to waiting until the die rolls go in your favor.

I am aware that I can tailor the difficulty. I don't see it as a feature, I see it as a cop out. I am not the DM, Owlcat has asked money to perform that role and they don't just get to outsource it to me because they don't know how to make engaging encounter design that doesn't rely on constant attrition gimmicks. They even had a rule book to follow, that they decided to completely ignore when it was convenient to do so. Which is fine, but then you don't get to call it a Pathfinder game, because it isn't. It's Owlcat's interpretation of Pathfinder. Kingmaker also had this problem, though it was not quite as ridiculous.

Even the party members, which I really like from a writing perspective, don't match the optimization of the game. So very often you will be significantly better off making your own party of mercenaries. They made all the in game companions feel like dead weight, even with optimizing tweaks. Even in that case, because the story is quite rigid, you will be forced to bring along dead weight companions because the story tells you that you have to.

The story also seems interesting, but it's impossible to engage with after endless slogs of constant RNG fests. It's so immersion breaking to constantly reload because a monster popped in out of nowhere, immediately gets to have it's turn (which is a big no no), and then casts a massive AoE crowd control spell on your party with an inflated DC and then surprise! You just wiped. I cannot impress upon you how often dumb stuff like this occurs. Owlcat is the epitome of the mediocre DM that thinks they are competing with their players and is constantly trying to ""win"".

The job of a DM is to make a world, and then let the players play in it. DMs are only human, so sometimes things need supervising or fleshing out mid-game. What you don't do is completely throw away major rules or randomly increase stat values on monsters without increasing CR or reward or at least providing a realistic reason as to why this creature is so much more powerful than it should be.

Honestly, this design would work a hell of a lot better if the game wasn't effectively on rails and wasn't linear. If you were just a party and could wander about as you pleased, it would be my fault for straying into areas with more dangerous enemies. But like I said, it's a purely linear story experience. A linear experience with an endless series of GOTCHA moments that cannot be fixed on the fly. You are just expected to know certain things, which means you're forced to metagame.

Don't have Death Ward? You're screwed. Don't have Freedom of Movement? Dead. Don't have Protection From Energy? Completely ruined. Don't have Protection From Alignment? Dominated party members constantly.

They give absolutely crippling afflictions out like candy to your enemies. Which would be fine, if the game didn't have 20 TIMES THE ENCOUNTERS YOU WOULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO FACE. With of course extremely low XP rewards to match. Because why have interesting encounters when you can just have MORE of them right?

This is getting into rambling territory. Suffice to say, this game is frustration incarnate. With no satisfactory pay-offs at any point. It didn't have to be this way, but Owlcat seems to have their minds made up. They make excellent stories and excellent companions, and then they completely dump all over that effort with their encounter design.

It's a 40 hour game, stretched out to 200 hours with all the ridiculous encounter shenanigans. If that sounds like fun, have at it. But I think I'm done with Owlcat games.",1673151141,1673151398,False,579,27,0.798742890357971191,0,True,False,False

The actual TTRPG elements aren't bad, but the mythic path features lock you into such rigid story endings in a game that is supposed to be heavily centered on customization and rp. Additionally, the campaign management mode probably took up about 1/3rd of my near 100 hours.... it is long, clunky, time consuming, tedious, and feels like a fucking mobile game. 

I truly don't understand why this mechanic made it into the game, and would highly recommend that you watch some gameplay of it before purchasing, knowing that you will spend dozens of hours toiling away at it. 

Disclaimer: They do allow you to turn this mode off in the beginning of the game, but you lose the ability to recruit certain companions, finish some quests, and a good amount of story and loot... It's a really shitty choice to make.

I will avoid spoilers as best I can.

[b]First complaint.[b] Most of this game requires you to jump through at least one hoop to get anything meaningful done. I had to use guides for a large part of this game to figure out where the hell I was going at any time. Even if you have time(and patience) to set up buffs before every fight, you're still getting your crap pushed in. Every fight is a step-by-step process: set up your buffs, knock down enemy buffs/debuff enemies, then go ham on the enemy with whatever resources you have left.

[b]Aesthetics.[b] Phenomenal. It was unfortunate that not every conversation was voiced, but the level design, art style, portraits, and audio were excellent. The voice acting was one of my favorite parts of the game, with Deskari/Echo of Deskari being my favorites despite their lack of lines. Greybor's VA never misses. Normally I think Baphomet is pretty goofy, but this game made him downright intimidating in a good way. While there wasn't a huge variety to the soundtrack of this game, I did love listening to all of the music in the many scenes.

[b]Story(The Journey).[b] If you do play this game, play it on Story difficulty your first time to really appreciate this part and not sweat the combat much. Even when I'd spoiled myself on the secret ending, several plot twists in the game surprised me in a great way. The dialogue for the more important moments is very well-written, and I enjoyed the majority of the side quests.

[b]Story(The Protagonist).[b] The best part of the game, you. In a ""your choices matter"" game, this is one of the best silent protagonists I've ever seen. While many of the evil options are senseless and stupid, you can be a genuine roach when it comes to your decisions, and there is a lot of reaction to who you choose to be in the game. Having constant comments on the powers my character chose to develop made me very happy with my choice. I may play through the game many more times just to play through all of the Mythic paths on Story difficulty.

[b]Story(The Companions).[b] Good work, but could do better. The companions are here to tag along to your grand quest, and they all have their own sorts of agenda to complete. However, I did not enjoy how they drop like flies through each act. It is all too easy to lose some companions and even miss others(I entirely missed finding a certain dhampir in Act 4). Some quests are extremely bugged(looking at you, Greybor) and have still yet to be fixed by Owlcat. Points off for these. Most of these quests are rather minor, but in some quests you can lose the companion entirely.

[b]Story(Endings).[b] A load of horse crap, and the reason I put down my ""no"" vote. I put multiple hundreds of hours towards attempting the secret ending, and it turned out I missed a single part on a side room of a completed quest and I was locked out at the very final step of the game because of it. The endings are just as unsatisfying in Divinity 2, where they are left very ambiguous and mostly feeling like the MC has no place in the story after you finish the game. I looked at other experiences, and basically your ending is garbage unless you complete every single quest in the game.

[b]Items[b]. RPGs often rely a lot on their item systems, and I do think this game mostly knocked it out of the part. Mostly. To get past the tremendous amounts of late game damage reduction, you have to equip very specific types of weapons to put out effective numbers in a fight. Sadly, this is a problem that seems to be part of Pathfinder itself. However, WOTR has some very fun magic items and I liked the experience of creating Relics. I did install a mod that would let me see the outcome of Relic projects and I recommend it, but the wait and resources allow for very cool reward such as a shield bash that grants vulnerability to cold damage, or a necklace that brings you back from 0 and summons a bunch of(admittedly useless) skeletons.

[b]Combat Loop.[b] Yeah, this part was very punishing. I was spoiled with Larian Studios and Divinity 2 for my first CRPG, and this game has combat that is much more tedious than most RPGs I've played. As previously mentioned, fights are a step by step process. Where in Pathfinder you can sometimes get away with not debuffing enemies, in this case you're going to whiff 80-90% of your spells later on unless you take the time to slowly dismantle enemy defenses. Even touch AC gets up in the 30s and saving throws get in the 40s or 50s, making it literally impossible for enemies to succumb to even your 9th level spells. Even your Dispels aren't guaranteed, and you could waste your 5th level slot and your turn on getting zilch done. Also, playing with ""normal"" damage means at least one of your party members is going down with every single fight. In some fights, I got out with 4 out of 6 party members completely dead and only didn't have to reload my save because I had multiple party members who could revive. I was stupid enough to try playing on Core difficulty for my first playthrough, and only in Dark Souls have I beat my head against a wall in so many encounters in a game before.

Your options are going schizo mode with realtime combat, or turn-based like many other CRPGs. I went with turn-based. I will compliment Owlcat here: I liked the option to delay my turn until a later point in combat so that I don't waste my resources when the boss is still very well defended.

[b]Crusade.[b] I had a love-hate relationship with this part of the game. If you plan on interacting with this, you have to recruit Regill as he gives you access to the two best crusade units in the game. It was a struggle in this at first, but once I got the cavalry and the ranged units he can give many fights became clean sweeps. By Act 5, most enemy armies wouldn't even get to take a single turn because I'd wiped the floor with them so badly. Get your recruitment and your ranged units up, and [b]don't lose units[b]. Infirmary recovery is fine, but your experience will be pain if you lose units permanently. Eventually, you can clear off half the map in a single in-game week once your forces are strong enough.

Overall, 6/10 getting carried by the story and aesthetic but very, very held back with combat, some bugs that lost me two companions entirely, and the absurd effort it takes to get an ending of any consequence or worth.",1673078484,1673078484,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I do recommend this game now because the devs with updates had fixed most of my issues with the game. You can put the crusade mode on auto and the content you used to get locked out seems to work now. 

You spend about 40% of a playthrough on the map screen waiting for your party and crusade army to get to where they are going. your party suffers corruption for resting outside your main base (tiered major debuff).
enemy armies can block you from entering you main city if you dont have a teleporter built in you city. you cant build it if you are not playing the crusade part because you economy is tied to your moral and that is tied to homany army battles did you win how mant forts did you take over and how many encampents did you kill. if you ever let your moral get to broken you dont get any resources so you have yo buy them and they cost way to much. even if you have eneough money to buy them if you main army gets chewed up and spat out (which it will) they amount of units to recruit is pittiful at best. Once again owlcat has figured out how to kill any fun and momentum you have. The main part of this game is amazing i would say a solid 8/10 (yes the writing is not the best but it works) but with the crusdae/city bulder management systems it brings this game down to a 5 or 6/10.

If you like/loved kingmaker and didnt mind the kingdom systems then you will be fine here. If you hated that system and how it locked you out oif side quest buy putting it on auto then stay away from this game. They made it worse much worse.

It wasn't particularly clear as to what exactly you should be trying to use (even with the tutorial enabled).

Morale system in crusades is boring shit forcing you to swap between heroes and armies all the time even if you are in mood for one or the other (also there is bugged quest that was supposed to be fixed completely destroying your morale and needing you to overwrite game files) and is the main reason why i am taking away a point (change minimum morale in your save file so you dont have to be bothered by discount HoMaM simulator when not in mood and its bearable).

But besides that, amazing story, plenty of options and those soundtracks killed it",1673027554,1673027554,True,1,0,0.508384168148040771,0,True,False,False

Good game, kinda tedious at times. Blackwater is a dogshit dungeon, as is the Enigma. Secret ending definitely worth doing. I don't mind that it took me like 150 hours to complete 1 playthrough, and I normally hate long games. Probably install Toybox if you want to grind out Crusade mode so that your morale doesn't subsequently go to shit. I truly don't know who thought the morale system working the way it does was a good idea. It breaks up the flow of the game so much if you play how the morale system incentivizes you to. 

Despite my complaints, WotR is still a masterpiece. Arueshalae, Daeran, Ember, Seelah, and Woljif were my go-to party, and they were all so fun. Given that WotR operates off of PF1e's core system, the buildcrafting is pretty sick. The writing is superb in many places, especially a lot of the companion quests. WotR does a good job at changing according to your decisions. There are so many different ways of approaching so many different encounters and quests that have lasting consequences that you may not see for 100 hours. The writers thought of so much, it's truly impressive. I would love to do a couple more playthroughs with different classes and mythic paths and alignments, but the issue is I don't know if I have the time. There are certain areas I'll definitely skip in the future though, namely Blackwater and Enigma. Now that I got to experience the secret ending, I'll never need to collect 6 Nahyndrian crystals again, so Enigma can be safely ignored.

My PC was a kitsune monk named Bagel. I really enjoyed monk. It's not as cool as monks in PF2e, but it was still really strong and had a good variety of powers, especially when combined with Azata and certain mythic feats and abilities (this is also why I recommend Toybox, otherwise Azata Monk wouldn't really be feasible due to alignment restrictions). I had to respec most of my characters several times to re-optimize their builds as they got new gear or got to certain levels that let them unlock certain feats or abilities, but it wasn't that big of a deal once I started memorizing the core feats of each build. Early Monk is pretty rough though, seeing as how they want 4 different ability scores (Str, Dex, Con, Wis) to all be pretty high. Low level Bagel was very much carried by Seelah, Woljif, and Lann (rest in piss, bootlicker). 

Oh and definitely go for fire damage build with Ember. By the end of the game, she was pumping out like 500+ damage each Hellfire cast, significantly higher than the rest of the party. Most everyone else was a good consistent damage dealer, and she was my big burst DPR character. I wish I had put more effort into buffing her witch hexes, but they were still doing alright by the end. 

Daeran is an insane healer, I would say it isn't even worth trying to get him to do damage. There are a few good crossbows for him, especially one you'll find deep in the game in a building in Iz, but his real value is in healing, buffs, and other forms of support. 

With Seelah I did a mount and glaive crit build. I didn't really focus on her spellcasting at all except for preparing buffs for herself and her mount, Honse. By the end of it, Honse and Seelah were insanely strong. 

With Arueshalae, I went for a pretty standard ranged build. With the right gear, you can pump up her stats exceptionally high. I had her using shortbows, I'm not sure if longbows are considerably better, but she came with a shortbow so I just stuck with that weapon type. 

For Woljif I actually ignored his Eldritch Scoundril class and went full into Alchemist - Vivisectionist. He is another good party and self-buffer, and he gets a lot of spells (Displacement, Blur, Mirror Image) that make him a lot harder to hit. Instead of keeping with daggers, I had him switch to Kukri after finding a really cool Kukri in act 4, and I never looked back. If you also do Vivisectionist for most of his levels, make sure to grab the Medical Discoveries that buff up your Mutagens as much as possible. 

Little tip: crowd control abilities are insanely good. I never realized how good frighten is as a condition, despite playing D&D and Pathfinder for years, until I played Wrath of the Righteous. If you can get a good caster and invest in stuff like Phantasmagorical Putrefication or Grease, you'll be golden. I, however, didn't do that. 

Also, don't ignore your research and relic decrees in Crusade mode (once you get to chapter 3). They're where I got a lot of my best gear. 

What I'm getting at is that WotR is like a 9/10 game that has a few areas in it that have significant dips in quality, but not enough to keep it out of my top 10 of all time. It's also given me a lot of ideas for how to improve my own GMing, mostly due to the presentation of a lot of things, notably skill checks and the choose-your-own-adventure-style segments.",1673026138,1673026138,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Well made CRPG, good story, cool characters, it's all there.
- Good visuals, better than average for these sort of games.
- Interesting game mechanics thanks to it's implementation of the Pathfinder game system.
- Mythic path options are really cool and interesting.
- A ton of character classes, love it, you can get lost in character creation.
- Custom game difficulty settings (thank Jeebus for that).

Cons:
- Takes ages to complete, 200h in at the time of writing this review, and I'm still not done with a first playthrough.
- A truckload of micromanagement for your characters.
- You need to understand the Pathfinder (first edition) system in order to enjoy the game which takes a while to learn, sure you can play on easier difficulties but it's no fun when you steamroll enemies.
- Some enemies have way too much AC (Armor class)/SR (Spell resistance) and they're hard to deal with, even with 'proper' character builds, it's just dumb.
- Needless 'Crusade' turn based mode mini-game, not really fun. 
(tip: set the difficulty for the this on easiest, it can get frustrating managing the 'morale' resource in this game. I had to mess with .JSON files at one point to fix this because I screwed up and ended up with no viable way of restoring morale)

Tips if you plan on buying this game:
- Search nexus mods for the 'Potramatic mod'.
- Watch some videos explaining the game mechanics (I recommend Slandered Gaming on YouTube) and try playing on regular or core difficulties, for more enjoyment.
- Some of the classes are completely useless (side-effect of being a lot of them, was to be expected).
- A mercenary Sensei (custom Monk companion with the Sensei sublcass) can make your life a lot easier on higher difficulties.",1673009528,1673009528,True,1,0,0.508384168148040771,0,True,False,False

Wish I could get into it more since I like the party exploration bits and the companions are great, but this just isn't the formula I like.

Edit: To be fair, the game has an option to automatically take over the crusade for you so you don't have to worry about it. It's a permanent setting and it can lock you out of a couple outcomes but it saved me from a massive headache. That being said, I still don't recommend it for players who like RPGs like Baldur's Gate, Divinity, or Dragon Age because Pathfinder is comparatively weak in the role-playing department (its focus seems to be more on its combat and crusade mechanics).

The biggest area for improvement is having more of the dialogue fully voiced. the companions and main quest line seems to have a bunch of voice actors that are doing an amazing job. However Side quests tend to not be voiced so you have and feel a little hollow in comparison. having to read through text and imagine what emotions the side characters are going through makes the side-quest feel less immersive, Many of the side quest are well written and good voice acting is probably the big difference in the side quests and characters being as memorable as the main quest line.",1672625799,1672625799,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For an older crowd, I would call it a spiritual successor to Shadows of Amn. For a younger crowd, I would call it a deeper Divinity Original Sin 2. Works passably on steam deck in desktop mode.

Everything you would expect about combat and loot are present, and more. The systems here are extremely complex and while the developers have made a clear effort at explanation of details, you will probably still find yourself blindsided in the mechanics of some classes, spells, and abilities. If you aren't willing to do some independent research on these things, you may get frustrated. For those deep diving, I think you'll find a lot of satisfaction in the customization and optimization available to your party. 
You'll also be rewarded by the great attention to detail here in narrative world building, maps, and characterization. 
I am repeatedly impressed by the storytelling in the volume and originality of content. A nice early example to avoid heavy spoilers is the story of a dwarven crusader who betrayed his allies after being seduced by a demon, and since spent decades trying to regain trust, fruitlessly. The adult theme of whether a betrayer deserves a second chance at trust and how that chance is defined, is explored in a nuanced and original way that I've never seen before.
A word of warning as those who say there are issues with the difficulty are correct. The first two chapters seem properly paced and balanced, with the 3rd chapter (for me) having a sudden massive spike. Maybe there is an optimal path for progression through the third chapter that provides a soft landing with character levels, but the chapter is extremely open ended. *It is important to note that difficulty sliders are customizable throughout the game, so if you are getting frustrated, you can scale accordingly.

That's the people who designed Wrath of the Righteous. This isn't a skill issue, or even a roadblock to speedrunning. Optimally you're going to be fighting against enemies who are 8 CR (Challenge rating, AKA levels for lay-people)  tiers above you as common enemies.
The darnedest thing is the actual big bosses of the games, Balors and creatures with legendary levels that are hyped as these super competent generals leading Hells' armies? They are nothing compared to plague ridden wolves.

The previous title before this, Kingmaker, had some similar issues, but they at least kept it 3 levels above the player. It seems they are trying for a Dark Souls-esque mindset of difficult = good, but without the gameplay design of Darksouls providing the tools for the player to overcome challenges.

Unashamedly, I pulled out mods right from the start, knowing exactly the issues Owlcat has with gaming. I used Toybox to gestalt my character, so I'm getting the benefits of 2 classes every level, and despite having way more resources than the game intended me to have at any point and *still* I found severe issues with difficulty. As a player of the source material, who doesn't cheat at the source material,I know exactly what the problem is: Owlcat loves doing this thing where they break from the source material to give enemies insane benefits that come out of nowhere. The Bloody Bones Beasts from Kingmaker are the best example of this, but now every basic enemy is the Bloody Bones Beast. Eventually I just got fed up and turned on permanent roll20 and take the highest roll.

I want to put this in perspective: Every enemy past where casual players would reach level 10 will have a mandatory +10 to +18 bonus to natural armor. The Dragon Turtle, a creature designed to have a high AC for players around that level, has an natural armor bonus of +15, and are so rare that they're listed as solitary. You are fighting creatures that are far more powerful than this as common mooks. That mod option I used to roll with advantage did little to alleviate this.

I've then looked at people who are hyper focused on builds, and I almost want to say the game is built around this exact playstyle because I'm seeing people getting their ACs in the 40's, which to use another creature for perspective: An unaugmented Balor, has an AC of 36 and is at CR 20. Remarkably, and without any hint of sarcasm or joking, people with ACs in the 40's are treated as not optimizing right, and don't seem to be modding.

There may be redeeming qualities to the game, but the gameplay gets in the way of everything.

Edit: So i decided to get back into the game after the Enhanced Edition update released. It's like a night-and-day difference, but could also be something of a difference in balance.

So the issues of common mook enemies having +40 Attacks is no longer as prevalent. Enemies now have buffed, but no more than +10, TTRPG accurate stats. The only enemy with a +40 to hit, which is still more than enough to hit anything from any of the Bestiaries or Adventure Paths of the TTRPG this game is based on, was a boss monster with mythic levels. Sure, it was a CR 20+ encounter encountered at Level 12-15, but it was unique.

But now a new problem has arisen: Now that enemies are no longer hitting every single time for massive damage, a lot of encounters are ended by my new character who is a nuker Evoker. I've even had the Phatasmal Killer spell work plenty, making it a viable option. I specced out a character to deal with the non-EE enemies, and now I'm steamrolling over EE edition. I think this is what happened with Kingmaker, where the first edition of the game was borderline unplayable, as can be seen by the reviews complaining about low-level spider swarms (Which if TTRPG accurate shouldn't have been as bad) Whenever Owlcat releases an ""Enhanced Edition"" of their games, it seems that's really the ""Definitive"" closer to tabletop edition.

So my review just changed from this game to the entirety of Owlcat as a company: Do NOT buy their games until the Enhanced Edition comes out.",1654831920,1672547253,False,245,19,0.761020064353942871,18,True,False,False

However, it still has it's flaws, and several things from Kingmaker were never fixed. I'd rate this game a solid 5 out of 10. Is it fun? Sure. Does it follow the rules of Pathfinder? Partially. Replay-ability? Absolutely. Is the game balanced? Hell no.

Edit: Additionally, you can't claim that the game difficulty of ""Core Rules"" is core rules when you clearly have thrown the rulebook out the window and just made up whatever you pleased. This is not a game to purchase or support as it clearly isn't Pathfinder. At best this is a homebew. You would have been better off rebranding the system and just calling it a D20 game rather than specifically claiming this to be Pathfinder, as then the players would not have to nitpick every single change to the core rules made and compare it to the tabletop version.

Likes: Interesting new specific magical items, and upgraded versions of several wondrous items. Increased amount of races from previous title. Increased amount of classes from previous title. Increased amount of feats from previous title. Completely reworked Mythic system that does not follow the Mythic rules of Pathfinder, which imo, is a more useful and interesting system than Paizo made. Added in some crafting systems that were absent from previous title. Added in equipment screens and level-up screens for animal companions (possibly familiars too, haven't messed with those yet). Added Mounts. Reworked outdated feats to be more useful from Paizo. More and some new spells. Etc.

Dislikes: Well, there are a lot of those. First off, the most annoying thing I found with this game is the removal of most combat maneuvers or the changing of basic actions into feats such as the Trip or Sunder feats. This was a thing in Kingmaker and I am appalled that the developers did not address this issue when making this title. Every combat maneuver was a basic action that every creature can do. The removal and changing of some maneuvers to being feats is extremely annoying and goes against what several classes are essentially built for like the Monk and Fighter. We already have a limited amount of feats that we can obtain, there is no reason to make these actions into feats just because the developers are lazy. 

Secondly, the Cavalier and mounts in general are useless. Without the Charge Through and Wheeling Charge feats, and the Lance weapon, the Cavalier is essentially a less useful fighter and places it about on par with how the Kineticist is seen on the tabletop version, which I am appalled at since Cavalier is one of my most favorite classes to play as. The other half to this argument is how terribly implemented the mounts are in this game. Everytime you rest, your Cavalier starts off dismounted, which is reasonable if you were attacked while camping, but this remains to be an issue if you get a random encounter after travelling for X hours. You'd think that a class, which is solely based around Mounted Combat and is really only useful on a mount, and would make traveling easier for them, to remain mounted! 

Lastly, which is somehow still an issue despite adding in the mechanics to do so in a similar skill, is the ability to craft things! Yes, potions and scrolls were added, along with unique and interesting boosts to the maximum level of potions you can brew, but they forgot the most basic and widely popular things, crafting weapons and armor! Majority of the weapons and armor in this game imo are subpar, extremely circumstantial and mostly useless. Tons of time wasted running around slaying random schmucks for weapons or hoping that a vendor or a guaranteed drop of an item yields something useful. Which is pretty sad when you want to do a specific build and it takes several hours just to find an upgrade to something you want, or in some cases, they just don't exist. Heck, you don't even have to give the players to craft items themselves, just do something similar to the first game and allow us to requisition items from a smith, pay a cost, and wait some time for them to craft the item/s we want. Or, to help balance the game out better, give us the crafting system for weapons and armor from the tabletop and add in the requisite feats. One of the biggest issues I have with any game is when the developers essentially force you to build a character a certain way due to their own laziness and lack of creativity. 

There are tons of other things I'm pissed about, which aren't limited to, but include disregard for some of the rules, certain items not behaving properly, lack of usefulness in most spells and feats (which is annoying since they took liberties to adjust some useless things to make them better, but left others as is for some unknown reason), not implementing class features correctly in some cases or even completely removing certain class features, and lack of races once again. Also, lack of being able to romance some party members like Woljif. If you're gonna let us romance, let us romance all the major players, not just some.

Wizards are relatively weak, not interesting and very limited. Melee touch spell work differently from trpg version which make those spell completely useless.

Most of the d&d based pc games (like BG1 and BG2) are not exactly using d&d 3.5 rule set which pathfinder 1E base on. That makes me wonder if those rule set are needed to modify to fit pc game or just simply execute poorly?

Another question, why are so many pc games having dragon one-shotted by demonlord at the cinematic of their game? Sound unrealistic to me.

Overwhelmingly positive=90+/100
Mostly positive=80-89/100
Very positive=70-79/100
Positive=60-69/100

I think 67/100 would be appropriated, recommended buying on sale.
I like this game (more exactly after act 3), I have most fun at character building.
but this game has so many flaws and far from perfect so let me give a thumb down to neutralize the rating.

Let me elaborate.

It took me almost 120 hours just to finish the campaign. At the beginning of the campaign I was excited to ""quickly finish it up"" and ""replay with another class and make different choices"". Needless to say, that ain't happenin now. Not after 120 hours.

I lost count how many times i had to skip optional bosses because the fights were too hard. I got tired of reading and reading about the best character builds, and the right abilities to use, and the spells that do this and that to help in whatever situations.

However, i must commend the developers for trying to break down all the rules and really explain why certain things are happening. The log that you can expand to see all the rolls and modifiers listed, explained, and added up, - was probably one of the best things you could offer in this type of game. So, thank you.

I did not like most of the companions, i know not everyone can pull off writing (and properly voice over-ing) a Mordin or a Morrigan, but this was probably one of the weaker points in the game. Either the character was too annoying or too generic, or the voice actor was just not good for it.

But aside from that it is a very solid d&d campaign. There is a decent story with a thorough background and choices of being really bad or really good or anything in between. Although, I do wish the Swarm That Walks path was more developed though, if it was - that alone would probably justify replaying the 100-hour campaign.

I'm not a d&d connoisseur but i've dabbled enough to not be a stranger, but even with my level of knowledge the game was a little too heavy. I spent hours researching combat mechanics and class builds. If you're into that sort of thing or already know everything - then you're golden. If you're not - i wouldn't recommend this game. Playing it on story mode ""just for the story"" (where battles are easy and you don't have to worry about all the d&d rule crap) - is probably not going to be enjoyable for 100 hours straight. The story is not THAT good. But playing it for the challenge of figuring out 100 classes and abilitities and finding the most powerful combination that works for you - this is a great playground for that. So you decide.

At the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with it. It's just not for everyone.",1672438909,1672438909,True,134,3,0.857562601566314697,0,True,False,False

I do like the vast customization when it comes to skills and classes. But there are few things that just bring this game down.

It didn't helped that I was under leveled and limited in options to do so. I hate it when a RPG doesn't let me play at my pace than I have to catch up to the game's.

The corruption system makes things rather tedious, unnecessary and even so annoying because of how often I'm forced to rest constantly with unskippable scenes. 

Then, there is the crusade recruitment system that is introduced after the Kenebraes act that feels like a different game altogether to further complicate things as well as it is NOT optional and you have to do it to progress the story which is also annoying. It doesn't help matters that you can't recruit when you have low morale, and have to load a previous save or else it softlocks you.

1. CRUSADE MODE: It sucks. I just changed the option to auto-crusade, which let you complete the game with the bare minimum strategy/diplomacy outcome. I really wish they would have done something that really makes justice to the concept of a bloody battlefield between humans and demons. Maybe a good idea would have been copying the battle of Caed Nua of Pillars of Eternity while using your own NPCs/Minions. The mini-game they chose instead (while it may be appealing for some) it´s not fun at all.

2. RANDOM CRASHES ALL THE TIME. I have not been able to solve this, yet I believe this is happening because the iCUE app running in the background is causing some trouble. 

3. CORRUPTION MECHANIC. It´s not good and it´s not fun. I mean, why the fuck would you put a mechanic in the game that just makes you go back to your stronghold all the time. Yeah, there is some altars where you can cleanse it but it´s just in dungeons. You would not need altars if you did not have this shitty mechanic in the first place. 
Additionally: The roads of the world wound are obnoxious as hell. You have to circle back all the way around the holes to get anywhere while your party get´s exhausted and corrupted! Couldn´t there be some bridges or something?

Why I recommend the game then? Because it does so much right.
The mythic paths are awesome.
The choices are great (there´s a lot of possibilities)
The builds you can do feel rewarding (I played Angelfire Apostol which everyone says is not good but, with some thinking, I got to be really really strong in the end.)
The companions are really cool.
The world setting is very interesting.

Additionally of fixing what I mention...

I've been playing crpgs since mid 90s (aside from TTRPGs) and I've seen and played them all. So, keep that in mind when reading my ideas below.

I am recommending the game but it’s definitely not for everyone.

Gameplay:
Tried and tested isometric game with real-time pause/turn based combat shines again. Just as it's predecessor, WotR has few features like crusade management to spice things up. Heroes inspired army combat was also quite delightful for me, eventhough it wasn't as polished as it should be. Was the gameplay fun? Absolutely. However, should it take 200+ hours to complete the game? I don't believe so. I have limited time to play games in my daily life, not more than a few hours a day, if I can. Entire game took about 2 months of every available game time I had within that time frame. It started to become a burden or obligation after a while.

Combat Difficulty:
Most games have a normal difficulty with fun and a little challenging combat. WotR however forces you to build a power character even on a normal difficulty. I had a half-elf sorcerer/loremaster Azata, with a full tuned and minmaxed build, who could cast 4 bolstered chain lightnings in a single round, and it didn't even make a dent in most combats. I can't imagine a same power-level character in any other game. In turn, I think my main character was the best option for the campaign and I can't even think playing with anything less than a %100 optimally built character. Don't even imagine finishing the game on core or higher difficulty with a ""fun"" character build. This is why the entire game felt like a power trip of a TTRPG powerplayer.

Puzzles:
I like having puzzles in a game as much as anyone else, and some puzzles were solvable by just basic logic as well. However, rest of the other puzzles required either pure luck or literal hours of trial and error. Some of those puzzles were skippable while the most were not. More importantly, the puzzles were not fun at all, they were chores. If you are a completionist, you don’t want to use a walkthrough and you get sick of stucking on puzzles after 100 hours in the game, I have bad news for you.

Story:
Story is decent but nothing special. As I mentioned before, it feels like an epic power trip the entire time. I can’t even bring myself to mention it in the same sentence, but WotR is using a similar “divine path” story as Baldur’s Gate 2 Throne of Bhaal but in practice it fails to capture the same spirit. Areelu Vorhesh is a passable antagonist, but you can’t even compare it with Irenicus or Amelyssan. Still, it was better in that regard than Divinity:OS2. If you are playing such a game for the first time, it’s acceptable I guess. Also, mythic paths provide replayability but I don’t think I would go for another 200+ campaign for this game until I retire in 20-25 years.

Companions:
Pathfinder games (Kingmaker and WotR) both didn’t have very memorable companions when compared to Bioware games. I was quite disappointed in my first few hours into the campaign but after I recruited Woljin, Ember, Daeran and later Arue, I started to warm up to them. By the end though, I couldn’t care a lot about most, so don’t expect a Minsc, Morrigan or Garrus level characters. Still, I liked that while making some sensible “evil” characters like Regill and Daeran, they also made some irredeemable characters like Camilla (who I couldn’t tolerate anymore by the end of her questline in act 5). Most others, especially Lann and Sosiel were straight up boring characters, so you can barely get a single party of decent companions.

Bugs:
WotR released about a year before I started playing and it was still drowning in bugs after all that time. Some of those bugs luckily fixed by some of the recent patches but a few game breaking bugs stayed. I was going for the True Ending and I specifically done everything necessary, but still screwed over by a save bug, which failed to display a dialogue line at the end of the game. I had to find a save editor and fix the parameter of the objective that I already did in game. Or Treasure Isle DLC quests were still bugged by the end of the game, eventhough I’ve completed them all with its secret ending and got the ending slides for Nahyndri’s fate. You can probably finish the game if you just go directly on the main path without messing around with any side quests but, would it really count as completing the game?

In short, I know that I’ve bitched a lot about the game, but I think that’s mostly because of its long play time. If I was 15-20 years younger, I wouldn’t probably mentioned most of the things above.

The problem is that the content is TOO deep and the UI and UX suck. It's pretty obvious that the developers didn't even bother employing a UI/UX team during development here.

There need to be a lot more optional tutorials, tooltips, notes, and even just basic management buttons and information shared. For example, in the army menu, the speed of units is not displayed when examining them in some windows (it is in others). Also, a simple button to allow you to manage your forts, bastions, and fortresses from a single menu; confirm that each is updated fully, etc. would be extremely helpful.

The individual map icons are not easily clickable-either. When a unit is sitting on a map location, you have to really play with the mouse in order to select either the location or the unit.

This is all really super basic UI/UX stuff that any reputable UI/UX professional would have caught.

I want to love this game, but it honestly feels like a slog a lot of the time. I like it still, but it's definitely not in my top10 and *it could have been with just some really simple tweaks*.

It is one hell of a power trip CRPG and the soundtrack makes you feel like a god. The role play aspect of the game is made with love. You feel much a part of the world then most average RPGs. And with the story, you actually feel the consequences of your decisions. And most of the game you'll come across choices that'll lock you out of some important ""event altering"" decisions. Even if you get mad that you had no leeway to decide something, just know that most of these ""event altering"" decisions can be approached differently if you had ""this person alive,"" or ""had this item,"" etc. Because of this, there are many new scenes that you'll never come across in your first play through. The replayability is enormous. Maybe 150+ hours with multiple playthroughs. Let alone even more DLC's coming soon.

The antagonist of the game is absolutely one of my favorite villains of all time. There is not a lot of villains that can make you feel some sort of empathy, pity, or remorse for your actions.

The only downsides of the game is the initial push through the game mechanics. Like trying to learn the basic mechanics to advanced mechanics of the game. Heavily DnD style based on pathfinder 1e rules but with a lot of trying to understand mechanics that influence dice rolls. There are occasional minor bugs. Just reload the game and it should fix most issues. 

Another drawback i can see in the game is the less flavorful aspects of the game. Compared to like Divinity 2 or BG3, this game doesn't have a lot of cool spells or abilities. Only really a handful of nice stuff later on. But yeah not a lot of makeup or lipstick then Divinity 2 or BG3. That means this game is not triple A game friendly to a wide audience.

Almost 130 hrs in and I haven't beaten the game! That should say something. I'm not a crpg guy but owl cat has made the difficulty settings very granular and user friendly. I can say the exact same thing for the game itself! deep but approachable game mechanics allowing you to create a variety of builds, choice and consequence are core and outcomes can be unpredictable. Characters are well written and I have found a few characters that I initially wasn't warm to have a backstory that explain this but also have given a new view on character as things start to unravel and the story progresses. If you feel overwhelmed there are guides for combat, builds, and quest lines (but I only recommend looking if you're stuck). The Mythic path system will slowly unfold gradually bringing your character and party to almost godhood and the challenge increases to match that in way that never takes away that feeling of power but raises the stakes!

The Story is nice, the characters are really good, the combat is nice and offers some decent challenges, top graphic for an isometric game, really beautiful artworks (like Charakter Portraits).

Only things i don't like, is the management of your troops, the round based (might and magic like) fight against armies and the constant random attacks. They just extend the length of the game meaninglessly.
After just a few hours, i installed the Mod ""Combat Relief"" to circumvent these fights.

Is it cheating? yes! But those fights and the management get really boring really fast, and it's always very upsetting if you just barely managed to kill a boss only to die on the way back to [Spoiler] because of some random attack!

What usually makes these CRPG games so great to me is the story and the characters and your interactions with them. Well, this game has a lot to offer in this regard and I've got to say it scratched an itch that hasn't been scratched adequately since the original Baldurs Gate 2. 
So naturally going into this I decided to just play an evil character, mostly to see how well the developers handled the alignment system. Something that really fails in a lot of games is that Evil is just a kill everyone, be the most violent dialogue option that basically removes any meaning from the content of the game its self. But the developers really put a lot of thought into it here. You can earn your partys trust, you can really get underneath their skin and break them or cause them to revert to their worst most indulgent habits. And they go along with it, because it's for the greater good... right? The fact that this develops so slowly over the course of the game really speaks to the grand vision of this CRPG. It really feels like you can be intentional with your character choices and development. By the end of the game my character went from a commander making difficult, arguably immoral but combat effective choices and killing a companion or two along the way, and then almost randomly I had the choice to become a walking swarm of insects which I was not at all expecting. Needless to say I enjoyed every last minute of being evil >:)

And I truly loved the story and the characters, the Midnight Isles were an incredible experience where a sense of ethics and moral were truly brought into question, and the whole game had me thinking about these choices. If I had another two hundred hours to play this game over again then I would with great enjoyment. 

All this being said, there are some flaws, mostly minor but an annoyance is an annoyance. For one, the loading screens.... So many loading screens, so many hours of watching loading screens. You died? Reload your game. You want to manage your kingdom? Loading screens. You want to finish a quest, well then get ready to leave an area, travel across the world map - slowly - enter an area, travel across the local area map, enter whatever building you have to enter. They all have loading screens. You just waste so much time not enjoying content because of the loading screens. It's utterly exhausting at times, even with a fully modern computer. Not to mention global map travel is slow and painful. Random combat encounters aren't fun, and keeping your party fully rested over the entire thing is a rather dumb mechanic which, you guessed it, has loading screens. 

Overall I do highly recommend this game. Yes it's more boring fantasy with elves and dwarves and magic, but it's got a lot of imagination to it and a good story with really well thought out characters. Also the combat mechanics and class building will have you going from getting your butt kicked to becoming an formidable demigod.",1671787261,1671787261,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Good graphics. It's not as good as Baldur's Gate 3, but the graphic of this game is much better than Kingmaker.

- Choices and Freedom. The game is one of the most free CRPG games I have ever played. There are plenty of choices. As the player, you have many mythical paths to choose. And each path has its own mind-blowing content and story lines. Another interesting feature is, you can kill almost every NPC on sight if you don't like the side quests they are giving.

- Plenty of contents. I have played over 100 hours, and am still not even close to finishing my first playthrough.  I haven't even dive into the combat system yet! The game literally has hundreds of skills, spells and features. 

- Great soundtrack. BGMs are great and the voice actors are really professional. The voice acting is emotional and touching. And I think the voice acting of this game beats most of its competitors.

- Mod support. There is no workshop but the game has its own built-in mod support system. It's really a pleasant surprise that the game allows modding. 


Cons:
- Moving speed is too slow. Half of your time will be spent on waiting for the characters moving around.

- Combat is challenging. A complex combat system is great in the long term, but as a beginner, I think the combats are too difficult.

- Auto-saving system is awful. The game has auto-saving system. But auto-saving only happens when you are entering a new map. That means if your character die somewhere in a big map, you have to explore the whole map again. 


All in all, it's a great game, but it needs polishing.

There's enough variation in Mythic Paths and portraits (that you can download online) to make any ""cosplay"" build you want, even though the character model customization leaves a bit to be desired.

That's pretty much it... it took me 210 hours to beat the game once, using a mix of turn based (which I prefer) and real time with pause combat for easy trash mobs. I finished it and immediately started theorycrafting builds for the next playthough and the next and the next. I had to force myself to not start another run because I have some games from my backlog that I want to play.

All that said, be warned, this is a game for people that have played Pathfinder before (Kingmaker, the tabletop game or other D&D games I guess) OR for people that will dedicate hours of their free time watching videos, build guides and tips for the game. You absolutely can screw yourself by making an almost non-viable build. Do not try to just wing it and make your own build in your first run. Most of the negative reviews that I read are from people complaining about how hard it is and the game isn't that hard at all. The effort you put into learning this game will determine what you'll get from it.

PS: There's a DLC that is pretty much a roguelite dungeon crawler version of the game and it's awesome to test builds there.

Game is very repetitive, the encounter design is straight hot garbage where the only meaningful things the devs do for difficulty is stack a billion AC forcing you to go touch builds, or blitzing enemies on top of your party that then get a free turn and negate any opportunity for intelligent positioning, or even lazier just completely take away any opportunity to prebuff in a system designed around it (whereas enemies will frequently just have them intrinsically)

Which is a unique game that took a lot of elements from NWN2 and used them for inspiration, while maybe not as literally as I would have personally liked. It's a great game, and I'm going to replay it to death until I've done every mythic path at least once to see how all the little changes affect the gameplay and story! 

My only complaints about the game are that in the end, after alls said and done, it does seem like less inspired of a story than it appeared at first. To be fair though, I'd find it hard to fit the 8 different mythic paths into a single story too where you can play as a Lich, Dragon, Angel, Demon, Devil, Bug Monster, Fairy Demigod, or Loki. At the end of the day no story is truly going to feel fully organically impactful when there are so many potential variables. What NWN2 had over this is that the main character was just one person that the story could revolve around. Here we have a story that revolves around the world, and your character is there to offset it's balance however you'd like.

The Lich is broken btw. I did my first playthrough as a lich until Act 5, then started over as an Azata/Devil and got my red hot butt handed to me very easily when I wasn't careful. Turn Based Mode becomes essential to get past certain fights unless you want to tone down the difficulty temporarily to feel like the Lich (which I did once or twice). lol

I tried Crusader Mode but it was quickly tedious and I wanted to focus on the story and character more. I've yet to do a playthrough with it for more than a few crusader battles. Thankfully they added the option to auto lock the crusade so you can just role play as the typical adventurer-in-charge-of-something where your lackey's handle the minutia while you flop about exploring and being important.

Lastly I will say this: Act 4 was great. It may have become tedious after my first play through at times, but it was an original idea to make that act the way it was and I enjoyed the creativity and ideas it had! And really once you understand which direction to turn to get where you want to go it's pretty straightforward. But the initial ""WHAT THE... THE BUILDINGS DO WHAT?!!!"" of seeing something completely new to me in gaming was very enjoyable.

Addendum: I have played the Crusader Mode and I have to say it adds so much to the game! Without it it's like playing half a game!",1670885032,1671504619,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is like an amazing bakery filled with every kind of sweet but every sweet has a fly on it. And the more you eat, the more flies you get.

Plenty of reviews cover the good, and I won't disagree with any of that.

The bad: poor UX and poor design. 

There are two games in one. The tactical RPG combat is pretty good. The crusade B experience is, well, a clunky chore: too many screens, too many clicks, too many loading screens, and too much just staring at the map watching little figures slide around. 

Even the great tactical combat is constantly ruined by uneven encounter design. And every once in a while a sadistic designer will create an encounter or even a whole dungeon with some idiotic mechanic, like enemies needing to be killed with electricity or nothing. On top of the sluggish, zero fun crawl around the world map, trying out a different strategy or party make-up is a huge chore. 

And don't get me started on the rest and the corruption mechanic. It sucks all the fun out of the game. A bajillion clunky screens, multiple loading sequences with fade-to-black, and maddeningly pointless character barks in the middle of it all. 

Yes I played this game for 80+ hours, but the entire time I've been waiting for the good to finally outweigh the bad. It never did. The deeper I got, the worse it got. It's as if the lead designer maxed out their Trickster build, and made sure that for every 60 seconds of fun you have to sit through 30 seconds of boredom and 90 seconds of clicking through UI screens, and for every five battles you get one that you absolutely hate.",1671411516,1671411516,False,151,13,0.730903565883636475,0,True,False,False

If there's one word I'd use to describe WotR, it's ambitious. Owlcat swung for the fences here. This has two key results:
1) They delivered overwhelming value in several areas
2)  y i k e s this game is complex and sometimes buggy

Pros:
- Huge campaign. Tons to do!
- The narrative sets dramatic stakes right away
- Mysteries are revealed piecemeal; methodical investigation may be rewarded
- Varied cast, both with companions and with non-party NPCs
- One antagonist in particular is hella interesting
- Deep and complex combat systems
- Interesting character building, with parallel progression that generally makes sense
- Significant technical improvements from Kingmaker. Load times are broadly faster. Turn off Shadow Quality if your framerate drops
- Quality soundtrack. Areelu's theme is A+
- The high points are extremely high
- Moddable with an active community

Cons:
- A bit buggy, even a year plus from release. Quests sometimes short out for no reason that's discernible to the player. Progress stops with no clear method to jumpstart them. ""Go here and do this thing""  sometimes results in an inability to do the thing or a lack of results when doing the thing
- Inaccurate signal. Sometimes I completed a quest the way I wanted to do it, the game indicated I did it that way, but consequences that occurred much later didn't jive
- Inadequate signal. As an example, the final dungeon of Chapter 3 has a couple points where you need to do an optional thing. It's time-sensitive, and there are consequences for not doing it. I'd argue for more prominent alerts here, along with tighter guardrails
- Clunky at times. Switching between area management and the small management room takes longer than it should
- Steep learning curve. If you don't know Pathfinder, the combat and progression systems will take a long time to understand. Some things are ""you simply have to know it""
- While I dig the overall narrative, the dialogue itself is often contemporary. Whedon-esque. Sometimes they nail it (the aforementioned interesting antagonist, for instance). Other times there's a lack of polish or craftsmanship. Too many characters have same-y voices (not in the voice acting itself but in the writing). There's little dialect, texture, or distinction. This is especially impactful in a game with this much narration and dialogue

Overall:
Owlcat's commitment to post-launch patches is commendable. Seriously! The diligence and transparency are appreciated. I get most of the staff members are working hard within the given constraints. While the release version was extremely buggy, the current version is noticeably less so. It'll still bug out from time to time; it's worth noting the progress.

Right now, I think the game's in a pretty good state. It certainly delivers a power fantasy in a cRPG framework. I would kill for elegant dialogue, faster load times/menu navigation (especially in Level Up menus), and increased transparency to the player.

Bonus:
If you enjoyed Wrath of the Righteous (either partially or fully) and you'd like another cRPG experience, check out Pillars of Eternity. Both the first game and its sequel (Deadfire) are on Steam. It's a universe wholly owned by Obsidian (Pentiment, Fallout New Vegas, etc.). It's inspired by D&D/Pathfinder but is still its own thing. The world has a rich and sensible history, the characters/dialog are top notch, and the system design is more about making as many builds viable as possible (rather than a mix of overpowered builds and dead end builds). Also, the second game has gorgeous art and audio design, some of the best I've experienced in this genre. Moody and atmospheric. Related to audio, the game is fully voice acted, and the cast of Critical Role are in prominent parts.

Now Pillars does have flaws. Each game has its own pacing issues. Also, while not necessarily a flaw, it's worth noting the narrative is more about subversion and interactions with everyday folks, rather than the high fantasy tone of Pathfinder. Still, it's a terrific series on the whole, and I fully recommend it.",1632030135,1671311559,True,0,0,0.535926461219787598,0,True,False,False

When the dev team ""finished"" Kingmaker they had several arenas where they could have made marked improvement. Their software was riddled with bugs, the music was unmoving, the dialogue was eye-roll inducing, the characters deeply unlikeable. The only thing that kept you going was the idea that someone who made the game had a story they were trying to tell you, however awkwardly.

That feeling is gone now. The characters in this game are slightly less unlikeable, but only in the sense that instead of being constantly dialed up to 11 in intensity, they're all so muted as to feel like they're bored with you. The music is literally the same. If there's a new song on this soundtrack, it went completely unnoticed. The UI feels so jittery every time an action is decided; every move you take will make you feel like you just slammed a door that you were trying to gently close.

Pacing and tone is all over the place with this game. Oh, sure, there's definitely some kind of story or plot going on, but you're going to be distracted by the expository way that characters just seem to vomit the story all over you while they're walking by. For a game that has so many words to shout at you enthusiastically, it's all too easy to end up staring at the world map screaming ""where the heck do you want me to go?""

The camera is miserably close in a game that's supposed to be a tactical top-down affair, and a video game this plain ugly has no right to be so encumbersome on the computer. What lunatic uses 3D graphics for a game with only two dimensions? They could have simplified the graphics and had a much smoother experience on their hands, and we wouldn't have to look at ugly 3D character renderings that look like haunted blow-up dolls.

The story itself is interesting and fun, and stays well in-line with a more Story Rich game as compared to other D&D style RPG PC Games. The combat mechanics can be played in real-time with pause, or turn-based (my preference is TB), and is easy to figure out with well designed tutorial pop-ups. The graphics quality is decent, although the quantity of choices for your appearance are very limited. You can add in custom portraits, but unless there is a Mod created by the community of players, the avatar's appearance choices are still very limited. The pacing starts off very well done, but as you get into the Chapters beyond Act 1, the Crusade mechanics add a slog style feel to the game play. If you enjoy the Crusade (aka army management and map based war mechanics) system, I just didn't like having to waste so much non-story non-adventure non-rpg time wasting away with war mechanics just to open up the roads in order to get back to the story content. Unlike in Kingmaker (i.e. the game this is a sequel to) where you just dealt with an event management system, in WotR you deal with a more streamlined event management but have the added army battle mechanic that feels more like time filler just to prolong game play between the actual story/quest system. That is really my biggest issue with the game, otherwise I'm enjoying the game very much. The character class system has depth, and for those not wanting to mess around with the nuances of managing a rather complex character progress system, there is an auto-level system for companions and pre-made characters. Plus lots of suggestions and guides made by the community.

REVIEW UPDATE - 100% Completion - 12/15/2022

Finally finished the game and here is my opinion of the game after completing the game (Demon Mythic). The game is fun to play and for the most part the story was fun and interesting. The only aspect of the game I'm not a fan of is the Map Crusade. It feels more like busy work to fill in the gaps between questing. Initially it was alright, but after the first 3 Acts of the game it begins to feel more like a waste of time. They try to add some story type content when leveling up the 4 Crusade Rank types, but it isn't enough to keep it to not just feel like a grind of busy work. Beyond that aspect, I did enjoy most of the story aspects. Act 4 did feel a bit chaotic at times, as sometimes the clues are far too vague on where to go or how to properly complete some of the quests, which required me to look them up. Act 5 is a little more straight forward, but again, some quests are not as informative on cluing you in on how to correctly finish them so as not to miss out on content due to mistakes made when given choices. Acts 2 and 3 were far easier to figure out, most of the time. Act 1 was fine, as long as you realize you are time gated, and could miss out on some content if you rest too often, or waste too much time doing other activities that take up in-game time. As far as difficulty, the game isn't so bad (as long as you ensure you are buffing up your party much of the time) up until the last couple quests, where even on normal difficulty, the enemies become way harder then in most other quests. Saving game often can be a good way to get past mistakes you might make through out the entire game. Overall I still had a fun time, even though I did start to feel like the game was unnecessarily dragging on after I got into Act 5, but that might be due to me getting tired of the Crusade mechanics. Would I recommend this game to others, sure. I enjoy these sorts of games.",1659492281,1671173621,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    Really IGN, 8!?!?! 

   This game is at least 9. It has one of the best and most complex stories of all hundreds games i played so far, everything about creating characters is truly deep in. The only things i'm not very happy about, is the rating system, of what is considered a good/bad/chaotic/lawful dialogue action and the not so clever AI opponents. Don't imagine that encounters are dull and repetitive, no, most variate and challenging. But if you got the right stuff, after a while, it becomes not so challenging. Sure, there's mods, settings to make your life more or less miserable, but you get to learn and easily predict what they do. Just remember, combat in this game can be played RTS style, the fast way, also TBS . Also some related content is pretty expensive.

Even though the game is good since it gives a lot of freedom, I hate the randomness generated by d20. I personally like the randomness system since it gives you a taste of immersive, but the d20 keeps pissed me off in battle (maybe I didn't build my characters correctly), because of all the miss, the battle can actually take longer than you expect which is time consuming. For easy play through and reduce the battle time, I have to decrease the difficulty of the enemy which increases my game play experience. (probably going to try normal difficulty enemy when I have a certain understanding to the game).

Overall, it is a good crpg choice for people who like immersive fantasy rpg. Before getting the game, be sure to check out some dnd basic tutorial on youtube or elsewhere to get some basic understanding of the dnd rules if you are new, it will greatly increase your initial gaming experience.

Also if you find some of the secret paths that were kickstarter stretch goals, they have so little content that you'd think they were made by one intern in their free time. The depth of character customization is super in depth and buffing and debuffing enemies is so crucial. It's a good game now, but still could've been so much more.
Original Review:
finished pathfinder wrath of the righteous at 146 hours. The auto build pre-builts are absolute trash tier garbage. I had to cheat by looking up guides on the objective best way to build classes on normal rather than letting the auto-level take the wheel for my companions in the last section AGAIN just like the last game to beat the bullshit perma-ccing mobs with astronomical armor class in every aspect that one-shot any and all of my companions in the final act. The tools the game gave me were insufficient and paizo should be ashamed of themselves for making me learn the intricacies of mage users to beat the game rather than providing a base rooted in the principles that other community members eeked out to find the best way to build characters. I want the decision going in-depth in customization after beating the game on normal mode so it still feels fresh in subsequent playthroughs, but I couldn't with this game just as the game before. By level 20 half my characters were beyond useless and my character was insanely op in comparison because I decided to bite the bullet and go for a sneak attack scoundrel hybrid build to stay safe and still do huge damage. 

By all accounts this game is good, but the various bugs from mildly annoying like some companions charging then stopping mid-charge and skipping their entire attack to other stuff like companions moving while being permanently face down on the floor, unable to do anything resulting in 20-40 minutes of lost progress is absolutely unacceptable. It feels like deskari himself is imbued into this game with the quantity of bugs it has. As a great man once said, once game-creators start asking for your money to play their product, it should be judged as a finished product, not a late stage beta.

This game is potential incarnate and I hope it eventually becomes worth the opening asking price of 50 dollars, but I would say with how faulty this game is at the time of this review that it would be worth 20 dollars with how much of my playthrough was taken up with bugs. I would say a combined total of 20-30 hours was me being idle and doing other stuff and helping others out and another 20-25 hours was dealing with game-breaking bugs with google-foo or having to reset MANY HOURS OF PROGRESS to get back to a doable state. For the 60-80 hour polished version the game of the year version that usually marks an actual finished game it will be worth 50-70 dollars, but until then I cannot in good conscious recommend this game as it simply is in an incomplete state and we should not be paying to bug test your or anyone else's game.",1633527059,1670888548,True,0,0,0.538637280464172363,0,True,False,False

Emerging from that dream to a bleak reality of a dependency on 'armies' which, by their very mechanics, feel like a glorified rock/paper/scissors. More so, I struggle to understand the logic: 
1) The bigger the army unit, the worse they fight; 
2) A small swarm of bugs? Retreat! We cannot win (apparently);
3) Gain resources from battles, but lose much more by fighting... Bail our your army like a failing mortgage lender...

This game is difficult to rate because despite having very good moments, the story is often undermined by clunky gameplay and constant interruption of 'chore quests'. I would still recommend it because of the lasting impression it left on me but I cannot imagine replaying without significantly modding the game and skipping quite a bit of content.

PROS:
-The party system is the strongest feature of the game and it's very enjoyable. 
-The main story is extremely interesting: I was bamboozled by plottwists all the time and really felt for some NPCs and communities. They've done an excellent job relaying the feeling of being a weak mortal in a world infested by immortal demons. 
-Companions are all rich and interesting. Nobody feels like an after thought. They're all unique.
-The soundtrack is one of the best I heard in RPGs recently.
-Level design is very successful (especially chapter 4 imo) 
-High replayability! All paths have unique dialogues, forks and quests.
-Rich character customization. Good luck on making characters that are similar in feature. 

CONS:
-The crusade system is extremely boring and unbalanced, to the extent that it actively hinders the progression of the story.
-Encounters are very unbalanced. Random encounters are too numerous and damaging to the story.
-There is actually a lot to read. I normally enjoy this in RPGs but sometimes the dialogues felt endless and pointless.
-It's... too much? The game mechanics are too convoluted. You have a party of 6, all with way too many abilities and features. Even in the story mode, the overwhelming number of things to keep in mind feels a lot. I understand the Pathfinder community tends to enjoy that but as someone who enjoyed similar games, this one felt like too much information. It distracted me from the main story.
-The game is very buggy and glitchy! You will be constantly reloading, looking up solutions, and debugging. 
-I asked Sosiel if he was okay after he was hurt and he responded saying he doesn't want to date me. I'm still confused. 

Tldr: It's worth playing for sure but I would recommend mods to support the crusade system. It's also wise to go into the game knowing that the mechanics can be a lot at times.",1670787414,1670787414,True,15,1,0.669673681259155273,3,True,False,False

- Icewind Dale.
- Baldur's Gate.
- Pillars of Eternity.
- Divinity Original Sin.

Have you played any of those and love it? Are you looking for something similar as the four series above? Do you want to spend your first 186.5 hours of playing a game on creating your character?

If you answered YES to any of these then Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous (WoTR) IS FOR YOU.

It's simple, there isn't many game with the scope of WoTR. This cRPG genre doesn't have a lot of game in it and by that I mean ""top tier"" game, the one that gives you the real and full experience. They're few if you already played the games I mentioned in the list above. Very unlikely a review will ever truly give you a feel of such game, you know you're gonna be spending at least 20 - 50 hours simply to make your mind (if you haven't already fall in love). So, *just do it*. Grab the game and play it but I have one HUGE disclaimer!

-> HUGE disclaimer: Owlcat made Pathfinder: Kingmaker first then WoTR. Obviously WoTR is a level higher as a game compare to Kingmaker but Kingmaker is still an outstanding game on its own! Assuming you have never played either games, you HAVE to give Kingmaker a try first even though the two games are not really connected in terms of story (there's some mention and vague story connection but both does its own thing).

You're probably find WoTR discounted to $20 usually and the Kingmaker + WoTR bundle around $25. Just grab it, they're worth much more than that!

Both games shine in certain area but has downsides. Some people look at the Crusade system in WoTR as a downside while others enjoy it. Personally I didn't mind it. I set the game difficulty to core and then use mods to smooth through the aspects I didn't want to deal with; just play the game the way you want it.

I feel like WoTR feels more Baldur's Gate 3 than Baldur's Gate 3 is going to feel.

> PS: The below might read like spoiler but trust me, they're not. I'm keeping it vague and diluted enough that you're not getting spoiled anything but you will get a taste of my own internal fight while playing WoTR. <

The amount of choices and hard decisions that you will face truly molds your experience. I tend to be a do-gooder when I play these type of cRPG but WoTR really challenged me and I found myself ruminate over choices from time to time before I pick them; I might pick something 'evil' because I believe it's for the greater good...

or sometimes I get a rare occasion to finally do good to an adversary that have been stepping on my foot over several act but once I corner that person I just... couldn't help it, I'd murder them in cold blood to take my revenge but to also make sure their machination end right here instead of delivering them to justice...

or I'd be help a stranger for the greater good, becoming acquainted with them, realizing how much they are helping me, feeling really grateful just to realize that they're such on the righteous path that they eventually inconvenience at a great cost me late down the line. But they trusted me, we're out in the wild, alone and they expect me to assist them with their endeavor but... the cost they speak of, I just can't bear it, I don't want to bear it after being so invested with what I have to give up. Yes, I'd cut that person and bury them right there. Heart filled with regret because that person never wronged me, I wronged them.

If you're invested enough in the game, in the story and the world around you: No matter how good you are, you WILL do evil. If you're truly evil and you're out there, doing your things and just trying to be evil; there's moments that will make you step back for a few seconds and you'll end up finding a little bit of good in you, no matter how rotten your (character's) dark heart is.

This game, dispite it's bugs and issues that has not really affected my progress critically, is a wonder piece of work and the best cRPG game that rivals my previous favorite, Pillars of Eternity 2.

The story itself takes off slow but interesting and ramp up as you progress (from my perspective). The story itself has so much lore, with the introduction of mythic powers, You can tell that there is alot more going on then what your commander is doing at the moment, hence why this brings me back to why I enjoyed so much of Pillars of Eternity 2, there is alot more that meets the eyes outside of mortal affairs. I enjoy the intrigue and the build-up that's going on. Wonderful odd set of companions you can pick up, all have their viewpoints and characters. The choices you can make are wonderful and each has their pros and cons. The written story in this game is very good and enjoyable.

I have high exceptions for what comes next, even after going though the secret ending, I can see alot can build up from there, hence why I got pillars of eternity vibes after the end of it.

I noticed already a couple of 'lazy' bugs, like a spell description saying wrong numbers at one info screen, different than another and similar. Nothing that would hamper the fun.

What does, is that it merciless fries my laptop. Is it scanning for software and constantly using my CPU for russian stuff? Is is badly optimized? Why does completely overheat exactly when I'm in menus, where there should be almost no power needed?
I had my laptoip crash 3 times before I thought it must be the game. And it is. Now with some measures like toning down the graphics settings (which I shouldnt have to do, other way more greaphics intensive games run at 130fps+ np) and limiting the fps to 60 it still slowly overheats. So I have to think about it constantly and take a break every half an hour. It immediately cools down when I alt-tab (background fps limit 30).
Owlcat chose my favourite genre with my favourite PnP basis, but the basics arent their thing. 
Buy recommendation for 2025+


After I 'fixed' my problems by limiting the fps artificially by various means, I could play. Of my 200+ hours, I would say 100 go towards restarting the game because of various frustrations. Now I understand the mechanics and can enjoy the game. Wait. No I can't. I could write an essay about how this game works, or better, doesnt work. But I dont have the positive energy left since I just came out of another session. It ended after a typical fight which I will describe as replacement for the review.

I come into a room. I find a note that says something puzzly. I try to figure it out, to no avail. Trying the panels on the wall this is related to hurts my entire party no matter where they are or how protected they are, through some magical means (and I dont mean this in the fantasy way). After looking up the solution in the internet I loot a treasure. By no means was I warned that it spawns the most powerful boss in the dungeon so far. 2 of my companions die, the rest runs away in fear. My MC tanks. Theres a 'trap' that heals the boss. I lure him out of the room, so the healing stops. I still tank. My party comes back, shaken. I conjure various beasts to help, because I'm about to die. A conjured beast dies, everybody is afraid again. Some beasts run back into the original chamber which leads to healing up the boss again. Everybody dies. Theres nothing I could do. I conjure a manovic deva as last action. It was brilliant. The boss charges the deva, tramples me in the process, I'm still alive, nobody else is. Hopelessly demoralized I just skip turn. Since everybody is dead (I assume) my deva slaughters the boss after countless rounds with natural 20s, because he is frozen and doesnt do anything.

So after various horrible mechanics which one MIGHT see as flexible and exciting game mechanics, it ends with a bug. This happens a lot. 

Throughout the gameplay I have to 'fix' constant bugs by changing my behaviour. This and the ridiculous gameplay design, from jumping different kinds of gameplay to vastly changing event difficulties makes it impossible to play the game and enjoy it.

200 hours and I never made it past act 3. I will not be able to finish this slog, like Kingmaker. Boy do I wish for being able to play BG2 for the first time again.

What they care about is upselling you. Making a survey about ""a dream DLC"" is in really bad taste when your main game hasn´t been fixed yet. 

Update 2: Yesterday they managed to break the game even further. People reporting not beeing able to enter a mandatory area during the first act.

Furthermore, the Mythic Path progression in Act 3 is bugged for several mythic options, Angel and Azata. In both instances, a Quest NPC spawns as a corpse, therfore softlocking your progression.

I could have been one of the best cRPGs ever made. 

Unfurtunatly, the game is still riddled with bugs, bugs that have been reported almost a year ago and have not been fixed.

For instance, I ran into a bug tht got reported on their official boards on the 21 of September, two and a half week after the game got released. This bug softlocks your campaign, forcing a restart !

It has not been fixed yet !

Update: 

Its even worse then I thought at first.

Several abilities flat out don´t work. And when they patch one, they break another. 

Until the latest patch for instance, greater invisibility didn´t grant you the bonus you are supposed to get when you attack someone who doesn´t see you.

They patched that. Now True Seeing which lets you ignore concealment granted by invisibility doesn´t work anymore.

A patch before that, they claimed to have fixed animation behavior of animal companions. They sure didn´t, because they still ""moonwalk"". You have to close the game and reopen it again to get rid of it. 

You play turn based and want to heal someone with a touch spell ? Pray that it doens´t bug out for no reason. Better yet get the ring that makes heals range. Then at least you can ignore it.

So they cannot afford to waste 90 hours to figure out a game is good or bad.  Here is my summary.  I think the game is has MANY good aspects, but there are parts that SUCK hard and hence I stopped playing.  So here's my list of problems.  

1.  Just drop the bloody Heroes of Might and Magic bullshit.  It's boring, tedious, and gives you NOTHING!  I literally got bored enough of this game to stop playing it because of this aspect.  I don't CARE about he army.  Also the general stuff SUCKS.  Like don't even bother to try it without being a mage.  Magic is the ONLY way to play a general.  So why even give us choices?  The base building is tedious, obnoxious and BULLSHIT.  Like ok, let me sit here in the base for a month while I build resources.  Sorry was I playing a dungeons and dragons game.  Oh ya?  Well not anymore!  Now you're playing Base Management the GAME.  It sucks.  STOP IT!  This WHOLE aspect of the game is BORING, a WASTE OF MY TIME, and it blocks you from getting to the rest of the game which is FUN!  Like you're stopping me from enjoying your game.  And here's the thing.  It could have been good.  I played the first few rounds of this and thought the world of it.  After Drezen, this is just a SHIT mechanic.  There are TOO many fights.  Just give people the option to skip it and I will play the rest of this game.  Because I do not have the time to spend 9 hours on something that sucks this hard.  
2. The map needs help.  Like I am lost on where to go.  Which quest is going to be for a level 13 character vs a level 10.  I go to 1 and I am dead in seconds.  I go to another and I can actually do a quest.  But it takes SO much time to get anywhere!  I have to wait for resting, for healing, for traveling, and I may show up and get owned by the first creature.  Because NOTHING is said about what quest order to do things in.  Like give us a hint.  Because I go to one area, fight a level 24 creature and win FINE, but I find a level 15 creature in another area and it kills my team to a man.  So some help is needed here.    
3. Your party sort of sucks.  They're supposed to draw you into the game's world but honestly, if I hear one more thing from Ember, I will kill her on the spot.  Her voice is SO annoying.  Same with your ONLY MAGE.  Like you get one character and you need them as they fill an important roll, but they're SO annoying... and there are NO alternatives that are going to be severlly weakened.  Which pisses me off when they CAN write GREAT CHARACTERS!  Seelah, Darian, Arueshale are all good companions but the best characters are NPCs you can't recruit!  Like give me Anevia or Irabeth.  I liked them from the start!  Let them be in my party.  I'd fight through the gates of hell for those characters. They're 3 dimensional, well balanced characters that have an arc to them.  NOT LIKE YOUR BLOODY COMPANIONS!  
4. Character creation.  I'm going to say it.  The character creation in this game is fun and also horrible.  Caviat, if you're on a low enough difficulty nothing I say here matters, but I feel that Core is the best option.  As it is how the game is MEANT to be experienced.  And due to Core difficulty, I spent HOURS going over guides on how to build a character because the game goes between being deadbeat easy if you build as a dexterity dodge tank with you just stacking buffs on top of yourself to Impossibly hard if you are a support character.  Example being a bard.  I'd play a bard.  I play DnD.  I like to play bards and clerics, but you know what, you can't do it here.  It's an unplayable class because the ENTIRE power structure revolves around you.  So if you're buffing and healing allies then you're playing the game wrong.  The game even knows this.  There are NO legendary bonuses for bards.  NONE.  So every class I'm used to playing, chuck that out a window.  Play a Dexterity Dodge tank or nothing.  Now I know for experienced players, they're going to say, ""Core is simple just play bard.""  Shut up, this game is complicated and I only need to look at resting to know that.  That menu along has over 10 options and stats that affect you, but you won't understand how until much later in the game.  

This all said.  I think the game is largely fun until you siege Drezen and then... well you got me.  Probably it is still good, but I'm tired of waiting or my hellknights to slash for the 400th time the same unit because I need mana for another fight after this.  I tried to keep that fun going but got lost and I am moving on.",1670186706,1670186706,False,4,1,0.505362153053283691,0,True,False,False

Pros:
- Always liked the OP potential of the D&D 3.5 E ruleset (or the clone of this that Pathfinder is)
- Combat and spell animations are nicely done, and backgrounds are rich and vibrant (at least in the first act, which is all I got to see)
- The tutorial does a decent job of explaining the systems, but experience with the ruleset is a tremendous help

Cons:
- A persistant crash occurs after finishing Act 1, preventing further progress. I could try starting a new game, but since I don't know if this will fix the problem, I can't be bothered
- Writing is very long-winded, and characters are extreme stereotypes. In comparison, Pillars of Eternity 2 conveys more complex and believable emotions with A LOT fewer words.
- In conversations, there never seemed to be the reply I was looking for. I may be spoiled by the writing of PoE 2, but WotR is a game of equal ambition and should be held to the same standards
- There are SO MANY character subtypes to choose from, and some are clearly subpar; some players may find themselves unable to decide on a character type
- For me, it felt like some mythic paths were missing, esp. a lawful evil and a chaotic neutral warrior-type

In conclusion: I'd gladly have played on just to enjoy the character progression and the resultant ever more efficient smashing of enemies (probably skipping a lot of text along the way), but that persistant crash has put a stop to that.",1670186350,1670186449,False,8,0,0.530286729335784912,0,True,False,False

In many ways, this adaptation is less of a CRPG and more of a tabletop simulator. It will favor asinine design choices that closely match the source material over good gameplay design.

Die rolls feel bad in video games. There are no ways around it. Baldur's Gate 3 has found a better solution to this problem, and the Pillars of Eternity games did far better with this issue years ago. Pathfinder feels outdated and obnoxious in this regard. 

The writing is awful and is in desperate need of editing. The dialog is long-winded, sometimes juvenile, and often redundant.

The bloated maps often have far too much combat against similar opponents, making the experience monotonous.

Every part of the game moves at a snail's pace, and random encounters on the road and when rest draw things out even further. 

The UI is cumbersome. However, I did enjoy the number of options that allow you to customize a significant part of gameplay. An example is choosing when combat pauses or how fast the animation is in turn-base mode.

Also, having the option to switch from turn-based to active mode is fantastic. Owlcat did a great job on that front.

Lastly, I ran into far too many minor bugs. For example, doorways make it impossible to click on anything accurately, and some enemies entirely within an AOE zone won't be affected by a spell (the attack does not register, and no save was rolled).",1670182360,1670182360,False,6,0,0.495003342628479004,0,True,False,False

Pros
+Interesting lore
+Angel, Aeon and Demon mythic paths were a fun playthrough but Angel and Aeon needed more impact to interactions that they were becoming something not human.
+Spells and mythic powers were awesome
+Mod Friendly

Cons
-Several had either awkward lackluster or shit voice acting
-Even with the patch and no mods it had a few crashes and dozens of quest bugs on both a full release purchase and a review copy
-Most mythic paths are flavorful but are barely consequential or properly created an impact to the story
-Crusade armies were basic and dull 
- Some of the named items don't look too unique
-Named items no longer have lore bits
-Pathfinder sure has a lot of races that are basically like the others humanoid + with either weird, oddly paced social commentary or janky stereotypical patterns.
-Romance was either meh or badly written except for Camilla.... no need to filler romance if you don't have the time (It's cool)
-The Swarm and Lich need a lot of work

In general, I like the game and challenge (core difficulty). Still, something to keep a note of - sometimes it gets absolutely unfair. Enemies often have numerical advantage, they have higher HD (level) than your party and extremely magic-heavy roster of unique companions makes a lot of encounters incredibly frustrating. Roster can be fixed with custom mercenaries, but I am trying to avoid it for now.

Story is good... on the grand scale of things. Most of the minor quests are boring and poorly narrated. 

Continuing narration topic. Most of the dialogues have no voices and BIG walls of text. It quickly becomes annoying.

In various ""cut-ins"" when characters have speech bubble with no voice, you are given very ""forgiving"" delay to read it all. Something like 5 times more time than anyone would reasonably need. And there is no way to quicken it other than skipping entire scene altogether. This is SUPER annoying. And since it happens every 2nd rest, you will be getting pissed at this a lot.

Dialogues are written in such a way that characters are trying to be ""cool"". High school cool. For me it breaks immersion.

What I like the most is... the character creation. The sheer freedom of who you can be is mind-blowing. While your choices, other than in fights, are really inconsequential for the story, it is still nice to have so many things to choose from.

Over all, it seems to be a good game. Nothing incredible, but a good way to spend some time. 
I would LOVE to replay it at some point with a different kind of character and alignment, but, sadly, from what I have seen so far the replayability is almost non-existent. Your choices hardly matter, just as your alignment and class.",1670110209,1670110209,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I loved nearly every minute of that game, which I know puts me in the minority.  Having said that, I will say that WotR feels like more of the same, only better.  With mythic classes and a story with a truly apocalyptic plot line, it's really something.   

The NPCs in this game are not quite as memorable as Kingmaker, and their stories are a little flat, but a couple of them do stand out.  Please note that the NPCs are not well built so you should NOT choose the auto-leveling option.  

Much like Kingmaker, the combat in this game is super fun.  I believe they do a good job of portraying the pathfinder table-top game with a few minor exceptions (NPC pathing is terrible...be sure to fine-tune their movement).  I love fighting the giant demons and horrific monsters of the Abyss. (Veskavores, anyone?)   

Finally, the demon war system is OK.  I preferred building a kingdom to fighting a war, but the use of the Might-and-Magic style combat is fun.  There aren't as many options as M&M but it resembles the game enough that if you know how to play M&M you'll be fine here.

The first couple acts/chapters are absolutely fantastic- interesting characters, meaningful and difficult choices, engaging combat, etc.  The second chapter introduces the crusade mechanics which are fun but by the third chapter they just feel tedious.  The fourth chapter completely abandons them and introduces a very create, but quickly irritating, mechanic where adjusting your camera angle alters the world.  It's a very cool concept but very obnoxious in practice.

Combat can be played either turn-based or real time with pause.  I appreciate that it gives you the option, but it really messes with the difficulty.  Turn based makes the game much easier than RTWP but the encounter frequency makes that feel slogging and tedious.  The game also heavily requires that you use buffs frequently but it's tedious to have to apply them when the encounter frequency is as a high as it is.  When sitting around a tabletop, I don't mind getting creative in my utilization of buffs and magic, as I control one character and other humans control the rest.  When it's in a video game, it's tedious to do the micro for each and every character.  It's just annoying.

I'm frequently finding myself thinking ""I'd love to replay as X character"" or ""I wonder how it'd go if I'd made these other choices"" but the game is very long and gets very tedious, so I'm certain I'll never replay it.  Acts 1 and 2 were great, Act 3 was pretty good but the cracks started to show, and by Act 4 I am just so sick of this and trying to force myself to keep going.

All of the above being said, I do still recommend the game.  If you like CRPGs, this is a pretty good one.  If you like Pathfinder, then you'll likely enjoy the mechanics (I've personally grown really sick of the D&D and Pathfinder rulesets when it comes to tabletop, much preferring more modern systems).  Overall, the game is enjoyable for quite some time before it begins feeling stale.  Is it the best CRPG in the last decade?  Far from it.  Is it an adequate entry during this CRPG revival?

I haven't finished the campaign because after the third act I really needed a break. 

 But this game is incredibly deep and enjoyable. There's a very in-depth difficulty setting. The story and all of the characters are well written tho I didn't like all of them. The combat is so good and the mythic paths are really cool. Now with the roguelike mode (Midnight Isles dlc), I've really been able to explore character builds and combat scenarios.

Firstly, half of companion banter is just plain text (in comparison to Kingmaker that was all properly voice-acted), which is a huge step away from Kingmaker.   Secondly, it's super frustrating to have a dedicated companion that you equip to the teeth and get attached to only to see it disappear for well over a full act without any way of preventing this. Scripted events like these annoy the *** out of me. I don't want to spill any spoilers, but you're honestly better off just ditching all story companions and making your own custom-made party.

But Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous, so far, has exceeded my expectations. The story is just as intriguing as Kingmaker, but let's say the ""side responsibilities"" that you have (managing a kingdom vs. managing a crusade), at least at this point, are kept interesting and not super repetitive. I like the Heroes of Might and Magic inspired combat during the crusade. It's a really cool diversion from how the game normally works. Kinda like minigames in between. 
Furthermore, I adore most of the companies. I am just really sad about the lack of a bard (aka Linzi! She was awesome!!) in my companions, as I normally don't use mercs.

Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is one of my favorite games and I've put so many hours into it that I've definitely covered the price tag many times over.  The graphics are pretty good but short of great for a tabletop game, the audio is pretty good bordering on great, gameplay is both challenging and rewarding, and the story and characters are great bordering on excellent.

Scores -
Graphics: 7/10 In a vacuum, I would give this game a 10/10 for graphics because they are actually pretty good. The maps are all excellently designed, the character models are horrifying and beautiful, the skills and magic are fascinating, and there are rarely visual bugs. Unfortunately, there are other games out there, and, though good, Pathfinder: WotR falls short of, say, Baldur's Gate 3 levels of graphics.

Audio: 8/10 The audio in this game is pretty good but can be a bit much after putting in dozens of hours of gameplay. Even now I still love listening to the dialogues between characters, but I've long since taken to lowering the music and ambient sounds so I can watch a show in the background. That's not to say that the sounds are bad, but even though I feel a sense of happiness when the initial theme song plays every time I load the game, that happiness does not stretch over into the game itself when I'm listening to the clamor of battle for the bajillionth time.

Gameplay: 9/10 The gameplay has improved demonstrably from the early days of release. I am honestly happy to say that, though some of the missions can be a bit repetitive at times, I never have an instance where I think that the game is poorly designed or lacking in the maintenance department. Though there have been bugs-a-plenty through the life cycle of this game, many have already been fixed and the devs are still fixing the newer ones that pop up. If I have a complaint about WotR it is that the mythic paths don't each have the same level of love and capacity for affecting the game. Harder difficulties do tend to isolate you into playing more specific builds, but at Core difficulty and below you can mostly get away with playing the game your way.

Story: 9/10* (*But I want to punch the developers in the face sometimes because they deserve it) The story of this game has me so conflicted at times, but it is honestly fantastic. The only problem is that, after having beaten the game half a dozen times, it feels a bit rigid in its structure and lacking in possibilities because of how 'perfectly' the game's characters, themes, and plot mesh together (perfectly being a bad thing because we all know that perfect things cannot be improved upon). Take this with a bucket of salt because I've put in HUNDREDS of hours of gameplay, but I want to be able to do more with the game without feeling as though I've broken something. Several mythic paths are lacking when compared to the rest, some questlines feel more like chores than adventures, and most companions fit so perfectly into their little shoe boxes that modding them feels wrong. So, even though there is so much more that I WANT to do with the game because I like modding things (like running the game as an Isekai harem protagonist), I cannot bring myself to do it because I honestly feel as though the devs designed their story and characters so well that they deserve to be portrayed in the manner in which they were intended to be portrayed. So F for my harem and a punch for the devs, but f***, they really did a good job on this front.

Old review below -

TLDR: Look, the game is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to just anybody. If you REALLY like this kind of thing and already know a bit about it but are trying to see if the game is 'playable', then I'd say you should probably just get it now... but you're still going to get super pissed off if you go for Last Azlanti or Core+ difficulty.
If you DON'T know what you're getting into, then don't buy this game yet. It is broke AF and can't be played casually outside of Story mode. Wait for people to fix the game with mods or for the devs to kick themselves in the butt and get back to work to iron things out.

Graphics - 8/10
For what the game is, the graphics are a 10/10. Definitely not BG3, but for being a digital board game, pretty darned good.

Sound/Music - 6/10
The music is really good, but the sounds can get to be a bit much. Though they aren't anything great, they also aren't bad enough that I have ever thought about turning them down outside of when I was watching shows while playing.

Story - 7/10
I originally thought the story was a lot better, but after playing with the Aeon path until game completion, I realized there were many areas in which the game was simply lacking. Also, the game's difficulty scales too significantly for it to be rp-friendly with some of the higher difficulties. You will get wrecked at anything Core+ if you don't gear yourselves very, very well.

Characters - 8/10
The characters are interesting and, in typical Pathfinder fashion, make the game as great as it is. I originally thought they deserved an easy 10/10, but some of the character stories seem a bit lacking. I recognize that this game is a fairly massive undertaking, but the devs are bsing everyone when they put this out as a completed game.

Gameplay - 4/10
I wish I could say the gameplay didn't suck, but it is fairly broken right now. The earlier chapters are reasonable, but the bugs that are there from the first moment of gameplay slowly slither their way into your gameplay and poison it. I've had so many times where I've lost an hour of progress due to strings of statistically improbable dice rolls. I legitimately do not believe higher difficulties are possible if you want to continue role-playing after Act 3.
In addition, there are so many things that are simply broken or not there that should be. For example, a toggle-able Tab in order to highlight items. There's also the simple fact that the game's interface breaks at random moments-- If you want to play Last Azlanti, just wait. I've had so many times where I've had to reset because the game will randomly stop. It's to the level where careful planning will be ruined by my characters deciding that they don't need to cast that incredibly important control spell after I queue it up, they don't need to heal after drinking that healing potion... you get the picture.

Military Campaign - 3/10
It sucks. I feel like I was transported back to the early 2000's to play Final Fantasy Tactics again... actually, it isn't even that good. I'm only giving it a 3 instead of negative numbers because it just 'sort-of works' with the game itself.

City Management - 4/10
It is better than KM, but not by much. The only 'plus' is the lack of some of the harsher time frames that ruined a lot of the fun for Kingmaker. It could be a lot worse, but it is still pretty garbage. If you aren't heavy into the RP aspect, going for the secret ending, or trying to get the STW Mythic Path, just have the game manage it for you.",1633161379,1669738861,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

This is the second Pathfinder CRPG from Owlcat now, and while it's a good game, it's in many ways worse than the first game (Kingmaker).  Let's explore why.

The gameplay hook this time is that your main character gets ""Mythic Powers"" which is a separate leveling path layered on top your standard 20 levels of classes.  You get a separate set of feats, abilities, and spells added onto your character, and these abilities are truly game breaking.  You will absolutely feel like a god by the end of the game, and you'll need it against some of the things you'll fight.

The story is really the best part of the game.  It's interesting all the way through.  Companions are well written for the most part, and they have a lot of interaction both with each other and events as they happen.

Kingmaker was the first real adaptation of Pathfinder to a CRPG, so many of the issues in that game could be forgiven.  Not so the second time around.  The cracks are really starting to show in the engine and very very little has been changed since the first game.  What are some things that needed to be changed?

- The UI needs an expanded and customizable hotbar system in order to accommodate magic using classes.  You get a scant few hotbars, and this is not nearly enough for the amount of spells you get.  In Kingmaker you barely started exceeding the limits, but it's absolutely hopeless here.  Because of the amount of additional abilities granted by your Mythic Path, if you're a magic class you have no hope of fitting even HALF your abilities on all the bars, especially because metamagic versions of spells will take up additional slots!  They have to come up with a better system than what they have.

- The UI needs to start showing chance to hit and more useful combat information when using abilities.  The whole D&D dice system is really just increments of 5%, so it should be very easy to display.  Instead, you have to pore over combat log data for what happened, or inspect the enemy and try to decipher which defense you're going to be rolling against.  Let's take Phantasmal Killer as an example.  If casting when an enemy is next to you, first you have to roll a concentration check, then a spell resistance check against the target, then you need a Will save against the target for whether the first part of the spell hits, then a Fortitude save to see if it kills the target or simply deals 3d6 damage.  Now if you view your character's sheet and the enemy's, you can figure out exactly what all the base values are and calculate the chances of each roll being successful.  But you SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.  If I select the spell and hover over a target it should display the chances of each of those above components on the HUD.  And display the damage range of the spell too, accounting for the various bonuses and penalties like Damage Resist.  If the enemy is just plain immune tell me that too!

- There are tons of bugs revolving around animal companions, the inventories of animal companions, and adding/removing people from the party.  They're still here, from last game.  Fix your bugs.

- There are tons of bugs revolving around pathing to objects.  Tell someone to open a door and they run up to the door and then spasm half inside the door attempting to stand directly in front of it at the designated spot to open it.  Tell your party to exit an area and they'll all run close to the exit and then clip into each other trying to get to their formation position, and only after they all exactly slot into place can you leave the area.  This happens constantly, especially if it's an animal companion (or someone mounted on one) who decides to do the action.  These bugs are still here, from last game.  Fix your bugs.

- Pathfinder, like the D&D version it spawned from, is bloated beyond belief.  There are dozens of feats no one ever picks, dozens of spells no one ever uses, and dozens of weapon types you never touch because you're feat-locked into one specific weapon type the entire game.  Kingmaker was their first translation of Pathfinder ok.  But not now.  They need to trim the bloat.  Consolidate all individual weapon feats into a single feat that applies to an entire class of weapons (exotic, martial, etc) so you can actually use the equipment you are rewarded with throughout the game. Get rid of half the feats no one touches like skill check ones or consolidate them into buffed versions that people would actually pick.

-There are far too many buffs and debuffs in Pathfinder, and puzzling out which do and don't stack is exhausting.  Simplify these abilities, please.  Bless and Prayer and Heroism and Greater Heroism and Burst of Glory and on and on and on.  Just have fewer things that buff, and make them always stack.  And make them always party wide.  It'll be easier to balance too since you won't have to account for 12 different buffs and thus jack your enemy stats to compensate.

-Enough with the esoteric guide required endings.  The requirements for the true ending of the game are so convoluted no one would ever get it if not for extensive guides on the subject.

-You need to actually explain how your puzzles work.  Half the puzzles in the game are gibberish that have little or no explanation of their mechanics, needing you to randomly guess or as usual just look up the answer.

-The balance of the game is extremely uneven. Because the campaign focuses around fighting demons almost exclusively, you're fighting demons from the very start of the game.  But the devs didn't balance low level demons for low level parties, so they're loaded with massive spell resistance, high elemental damage resist, and tons of immunities.  Half the spells in the game are useless as a result of enemy immunities, and spellcasters are not even worth considering near the beginning of the game unless you're a munchkin who knows exactly what to pick because you know exactly what the enemies will and won't resist.  Spell resistance as a whole is a terrible mechanic that features far too prominently in the game.  You can only cast one spell per turn and spell resistance negates it entirely.  Weapon wielding classes don't lose every one of their attacks if the first one misses due to concealment.

-And then every once in a while you encounter enemies that have 20+ AC more than what you were just fighting.  Thought you could actually hit something?  Ha ha too bad.

-Better follow a guide for your companion builds too, because if you let the system autolevel your characters you get absolute garbage that can never compete above the most basic difficulty settings.

-Speaking of balance, the Mythic Paths themselves are grossly imbalanced.  All of them are strong by the end, but some are just insane (Angel, Lich) while others wallow in mediocrity much of the game.  Many abilities are just clumsily implemented as well, while the better paths get to merge spellbooks.

-The Kingmaker mode of building your kingdom has been replaced with ""Crusade mode"" a half baked Heroes of Might and Magic ripoff paired with a half baked return of the town building and decree researching systems from Kingmaker.  It's just plainly worse in every way.  The battles are too simplistic compared to HOMAM, and the stripped down towns and decrees don't feel as good as Kingmaker.

Is it good?  Yeah it's good.  Could it be better?  Yes.  And I'm not even sure where they go from here.  They have blown out all the stops with this game and the power level of your character.  I don't want to play yet another new Pathfinder adventure starting from level 1 to 20 with just the same systems again in the same engine again.

After so many hours into this game, I was so attracted to the story.
But I can't tolerate how incomplete this game is, it is a shame that the game is a mess.

In the finale chapter, the game is so bugged to a point that it is completely broken.
It is in constant error.

For some cases, in story you will kill someone you already killed previously, and those two situations are both very important in the story, or there will be some NPCs that is already dead that somehow appear in another chapter like it never happened.

The dialog can't match up, the system you been using can break in the finale chapter.
Like your traits can somehow disappear, your companion can disappear, your encounters in your castle can somehow just ended. What is this? How come these basic functions work in the previous 100 hrs and broken right now?

In the turn base mode skills are bugged constantly, ask anyone if they have a problem with ""charge"" ability and you will know what I mean. The UI often stuck in battle, ability can't used properly, the issues goes on.

I can not imagine how this game not in beta or early access. I am not here to complain the balance issue, those difficulty spikes happens, but the fact that even the basic functions are not stable really make me furious.

But I loved all (like 95%) of it.  tl;dr if you like CRPGs this is absolutely worth your time. Take my advice though, just play on normal. (I’m rewriting this after finishing the DLC, so I’ll include some stuff about the DLC throughout)
I guess I’ll start with my general impressions and try and drill down as I go. I played Kingmaker as well and this game really improves upon some things but also has a lot of the same issues and some brand new ones. First, I really loved this game. You get so, so, so deep into the Pathfinder system and lore. The setting is great, the game scenario is great, and the core combat mechanics are awesome. This time around they added a bit more information for noobs when choosing a class. Tons of options allowing you to take on any role.  Combat can be handled by using Real Time with Pause (“RTwP”) or turn-based. I legit don’t get how people play RTwP on any of the harder difficulties. Positioning is so important and turn order has such a huge impact on targeting spells. I also had a bug where instead of using the selected spell my magic characters would run in to melee until I unselected the cantrip and then reselected it. I basically played turn based the whole time. There were plenty of encounters I don’t think I could have beaten without it. The one major downside of turn-based is that it will make every battle take forever. Plenty of people have completed multiple playthroughs in the same amount of time it took me to complete 1. Adding in how damned hard Core is, the reloads involved in that, and the long time summons take to complete their turns and that’s major time added to every battle. Most extreme example of this is the fight with the Devil in your Azata garden. He summons like 20 things at a time and combined with your own summons the fight takes forever. 
Separate from all the time related slogging with turn-based, there are some weird bugs. During the main game when I would cast Animate Dead, about 50% - 75% (depended on the day) of the time Daeran would get a second turn after his skeletons went. This didn’t happen with anyone else who cast the spell. 
All in all the combat is fun, engaging, and ridiculously deep. You can find a character class you like from all the choices and you’ll get familiar with tons of others thanks to your companions. Before I segue into the companions, I would like to cram in a tiny bit about the skill challenges in the game proper and in the story book sections. I love them. I love that being awesome at Arcana allowed for little bits of XP and allowed us to totally crush some of the storybook encounters. I loved using mobility and athletics to get to hidden areas or ambush enemies. But, the one thing that bugged me was that in storybooks you can’t use your animal companions for any of the checks. They were my Mobility and Athletics characters. Having them cut off always annoyed me. And I don’t care if people have done testing of the dice roller. I saw too many sequences and clusters for me to believe it isn’t weighted. How does the entire party go and no one rolls higher than an 8? Lann rolled 3, 4, 5, 1, 1. That can’t be purely random. 

The companions in this game were great. I think a lot of it comes down to your personal tastes. But I genuinely loved (Not you Camellia) my companions and the character development they go through. I’ve read a lot of people complain about Seelah. But, like Lindsey in the last game I think it is a matter of personal taste. I thought she was fine. Anyways, plenty of companions. They all have good voice acting and some of the banter is hilarious. Funniest companion is Daeran hands down. Some of his banter had me cackling. Mechanically everyone is fine. Not many powerhouses, high end of average. Really, they are all spec’ed for Normal and you can get through Core with them. I think to get through Hard or Unfair you would need a custom party min/max’ed.. Ember built as a blaster caster was the surprise MVP damage dealer. Nenio can be spec’ed to use Phantasmal Killer and to delete anyone not immune. Camellia sucks. Just further proof that inherited mega wealth is a plague on society and just reinforces the lesson that if you ever meet a billionaire in real life it is your moral responsibility ***I don’t want this review reported*** Anyways, the companions are fun, mechanically sound, and entertaining. 
I’ll roll my talk about the story and mythic paths all into one since I’ve only played through one mythic path. The story of the game is absolutely great. The main antagonist is great and I would put them up there with Jon Irenicus from BG2. When you learn the full scope of their plan and their motivations, *chef’s kiss*. Not to mention the voice acting for the bad guy is absolutely top notch. I can’t remember if the bad guy’s identity is a secret so I’m trying to be vague. Basically, I loved the story and I loved the characters. The mythic paths, which figure heavily into the story and unlock or wall off whole chunks of content are pretty damn diverse. There are 10 total and some require multiple steps to unlock. I have only played Azata so I can only speak on that. Holy crap you get some powerful abilities. By the end game I had like triple the amount of spell slots, all saves against my spells had disadvantage, all my single target spells automatically targeted a second person, and I had a special second spell book that had some ridiculously powerful. And I got a really powerful dragon buddy. The only downside playing Azata is that the people who join you, the Free Crusaders, are embarrassing. They do randomly show up at certain places and kill things. At Molten Scar when I showed up the beserker halflings ran right by me and when I caught up they had merked a decent amount of demons by the entrance. I guess that balances out the quests involving choosing cookies. Also, you are an embodiment of freedom and renewal telling anyone who tries to control you to kick rocks with magic. I’ve read up a little on the other paths and most seem really well thought out. I know the devs added a bunch of stuff to flesh out the different paths and I think they are going to add even more. (I’m reading through some stuff now and I never got some of the crusade bonuses I was supposed to get for my path. I never unlocked Havoc Dragons or any Azata units above Yamah. I don’t know if I screwed something up or that was bug, lame). 
Oh, I almost forgot. Crusade mode. I’ll be quick. It is more fun than the kingdom builder from the last game. It is also an over-the-top money sink. Get ready to sell everything not actively equipped. Also, you just start to get access to really powerful units near the end of ch 5. But you will still be relying heavily on your staple infantry, range, and calvary units. Like I said above though I think you are supposed to get powerful units related to your path even if I didn’t unlock them for whatever reason.
Suffice it to say, I loved the game. Totally worth the time and money. My tips are play on normal, sell every single thing your characters aren’t using, and Bismuth is the unsung hero of trap “disabling”.

Enjoyed a bit of Baulders Gate and Neverwinter way back when (late 90s / early 00s?)  and then picked up the Divinity during lockdown which led me to the Pathfinder games. I can honestly say, that like the original Pathfinder title, this is not  a game that if forgiving to new players. There will be some trial, error and research about what does what.

I'm well over the recommended spec with a well cooled PC (and I know what I'm doing) but this game clearly has a few optimisation issues that  has never been ironed out.  

Eitherway, give it a go if you like this style of game. You could get hundreds of hours worth of game play out of it.

A roller-coaster of a game with improvement from Kingmaker, with great ideas but poor execution. The overall story and decision-making are excellent, with tangible outcomes in a playthrough, and this is the most enjoyable aspect of the game. Great character and class creation options, with mythic paths to allow for replay. Crusade mode was a great idea and enjoyable when first introduced, but it wears out its welcome later on. Spellcaster generals and marksmen make it easier. Decrees add a good feel of being in command of a crusade with decisions that affect your armies and story. Companions are well written, fully explored, and have good quests to expand their story and reactions to your leadership. Sad that one of the most fun companions is locked behind a mythic path. I would have liked more voice-acted dialogue from important characters. 

Cons:
The balance of the combat is questionable and increases rapidly as the chapters progress. Optional bosses are understandably hard and provide a good challenge. However, late-game enemies and some side quests, and random encounters have ridiculous fights with bloated AC and resistances. It feels as if the game expects you to min/max builds and have a meta MC to deal with certain fights. Not everyone is capable of this. The difficulty can always be adjusted, but it would be nice if the difficulty was consistent overall. You have to rely on cheesing certain encounters, which becomes stale after some time. Grease, CC, summons, and buffing carry some encounters; unless it’s a scripted fight, then you can do neither and have to get lucky with dice rolls. Lots of ability damage and level drain, which can be fixed by death ward, but can we get ‘death ward, mass’ because most encounters involve this? The constant buff, debuff gameplay, and spell use drain gets tedious but is necessary to win fights. Dispel magic is sometimes buggy, especially with spells like Rift of Ruin. The UI is terrible for puzzles, as you can barely make out the symbols for puzzle pieces; it needs to be clearer. It also goes off the screen in Crusade mode when your armies increase in number. The merge/split feature for crusade mode is annoying, as you have to travel with armies to merge them from HQ. Why not allow for rally points for units at other outposts? Late-game mythic paths should be expanded upon more or have less mythic paths with more content. Companion AI is dumb; they run right into traps after detection in combat or moving to disarm them. You have to manually move them around it. Passageways are your greatest enemy; if companions get stuck fighting in doorways and blocking the rest of the party, it is best to lure enemies towards open space if possible. Encountered a bug in the main quest that prevented progression as the items disappear from your inventory. Luckily the Toybox mod helped to add the item back and complete the quest. The Toybox mod is helpful for other broken quests and random bugs that occur. Mods should not be fixing major bugs, and it seems Enhanced Edition did not fix all bugs. Hopefully, they will be addressed in future patches. 

Despite the ups and downs, I recommend this game for the story and RPG elements, which can be enjoyed on lower difficulties without frustration or enjoyed by those knowledgeable about the Pathfinder system. It is a good modern CRPG, such as the likes of Tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, and Divinity, but it is not as accessible as these games. I hope the next Owlcat game gets the execution of their ideas right and builds on the previous titles.

Pros:
- Amazing story
- Intriguing companions
- Huge variety in combat
- Class variety
- Specialization variety
- CHOICES MATTER! (you will get different outcomes depending on how you act which functions extremely well in this game!)

Cons:
- Poorly optimized (can not get a stable fps over 80 with decent specs)
- The army campaign is boring af (but this is optional)
- Fights take way too long late game (early game maybe 1 minute fights, but endgame you can spend 15 minutes doing 1 fight)
- Balance issues (some bosses spike real hard in difficulty)
- Bugs (only like 5 visual bugs throughout my entire playthrough)

The best RPG I have ever played with an overall score of 9/10. Just finished my campaign of demon to legend playthrough (yes I did it for the demon gf) and I am already looking forward to my next one. If you are into these types of games then I implore you to give it a try. I mean it does not even cost 60 euros which I think is a steal!

The story expansion (or scenarios) are kinda lackluster compared to the basegame which in part is understandable. If you want to try them buy them on sale in my opinion.",1656947592,1669573519,True,1,0,0.501169145107269287,0,True,False,False

- Unplayable roster. Game pushes you into tank class and core member Sheelah. Your party members are mentally ill, so you should consider hiring generic mercs.
- Did I say you have a roster of mental cripples? I think it's a trend started by Fallout/Original Sin
- You can romance mental cripples

I decided to buy this one as I liked the theme of crusading against demons and the Kitsune race drew me in of course. I wish I had gotten into the game sooner as it's one of the best games I've played in years and I am having a ton of fun! It's honestly the first time in a long time I've actually had this much fun playing a new game. First of all, I really like the characters, even the dastardly ones are very entertaining and the voice acting is absolutely perfect for each of them, too. I've actually laughed aloud at some of their statements and interactions. The character/class creation is insane and has an extreme depth unlike any other game I've played before. From what I've seen so far you can be almost any class you can think of with a wide choice of gods to worship and all those sort of details and quirks - It actually feels like a real character you're making, more so than other similar games I've played. The combat gameplay is fun and very tactical, it can be difficult if you play even on normal mode. You can play either as turn based or the other mode which I haven't tried yet. Some classes really start slow but begin to shine when they get specific feats and become absolute beasts. I am playing as an evil kitsune wizard specialised in necromancy. To start with I couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with my spells but a few levels and feats later I can now make enemies skeletons literally explode within their body with my spells and summon hordes of skeleton warriors. It's really fun and all the spell animations are great and there's so many of them. I've yet to even touch a melee character other than companions, but archers especially seem scarily powerful. There's also different types of casters that get their powers in different ways. That's one thing I've enjoyed the most so far, you can basically be anything you want to be! If you want to be a goody two shoes half-elf cleric worshipping a good god you can be. Or you can be an evil Dhampir (half vampire) wizard that uses his own blood to empower his magic. Or a chaotic neutral sneaky Kitsune rogue, that also uses magic to become invisible. All of the choices you make seem to shape the world to be different, depending on if they're good, evil, lawful, chaotic or netural. Or some combination of those! I've not even finished the game yet, I think I am halfway through (look at that playtime, I've been exploring every part of each map to find all the vast amounts of hidden goodies and books etc.). Already I know it will definitely be worth doing multiple playthroughs to see how the story ends up differently based on my characters alignment and actions as well as to try different playstyles and classes. Then you've got all the different mythic paths which make your character more godlike as you go along...you can become an angel, a lich, a demon and a ton of other things I've not even unlocked yet that totally change your powers and your appearance too. It truly is such a deep an interesting game in my opinion and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. The crusade feature is decent, it's not too complicated but it can be fairly hard at times, even on easier difficulties. If you don't want to play it there is an option to make it all automated, however I believe that makes you miss out on quests and content, so I didn't choose that for my first playthrough. I know a lot of people seem to be experiencing bugs but so far I have been lucky and only encountered one (fairly amusing) visual glitch where I was permanently sat down drinking and sliding along the floor in front of the queen and my new army... A reload fixed it though. All in all, I would definitely 100% recommend playing this game. Especially if you like the thought of a fun and deep RPG game set in a vast lore filled world with tons of variety in choices, companions and classes!

EDIT:
     Having played the game for several hundred more hours since my first review I can say that it has quite a lot of subtlety, hints, and secrets in the main plot. There were so many things I missed on my first play through. On top of that, adding the various mythic paths really does change how the game reacts to your choices. Moreover, the choices you make have layered/compounding effects so that making certain decisions at different points in the game can create new events or opportunities. I would highly recommend this game for people who enjoy choices-matter RPGs. 
     The only thing I could say is lacking is the crusade system, it's rather simple and is missing some features, such as the ability to delete units outside of letting them die in battles, and just overall depth. It's fun at first but can certainly become stagnant and there are points where you can completely go through an entire series of enemy armies and encampments all in one go but then screw yourself over because your morale will now drop incredibly low since there are no more enemies or encampments to attack to get morale back up.

When the absurdly obscure ending of a 200 hour + game is determined by 1 (or more) random question being asked mid-battle, mid-game or worse by a single act in the opening sequence as the PC's 1st action of the game, it is a badly designed game.  There is a mask that is auto-looted - despite being explicitly rejected by the PC - but unless you actively trash it, it turns the PC into a mindless killer in the end credits? When known game breaking bugs are still not fixed years later and are also ported to console versions intact that is bad and lazy design twice over. When a PC in an RPG is forced to make choices completely out of character to 'win'  and potentially to even complete mandatory quests it is a badly designed RPG. Let's be honest. This game is not an RPG it is an inexplicably complicated crusade management SIM and tons of unsufferable puzzle games (unfun puzzles) with some well-developed, and often illogical NPCs. Adding insult to injury the puzzle solutions almost always need a guide. It's like the dev's said, ""let's pad more time and put in half a dozen puzzles in this dungeon. And that dungeon, too"".  IMHO any game that requires mods or extensive 3rd party guides to simply play is a badly designed game.  And most annoying and disappointing is that the best ending for an Angel and all their NPC companions has the PC Angel ascending to be a DEMON LORD - a demon lord of the abyss??  That is just stupid.  Think about that for a moment. Take two moments.  Other things that don't make sense: Why would an already divine being ascend to hell to rule demons?  Note that if the NPC companions also ascend they simply become immortal inter-dimensional travelers.  I sincerely regret all the tedious, frustrating hours wasted trying to make this game 'work' as intended.  So much promise badly executed.

The combat is very in-depth and enjoyable, with switch-up between real time and turn based combat, which is necessary given the nature and complexity of certain late fights. The variety in classes and playstyles is massive, and the mythic paths are excellent. Difficulty spikes do exist in the form of optional bosses and they do really need you to be aware of the mechanics in order to stand a chance of survival at higher end difficulties. 

It is worth noting that there are no game-breaking bugs and some of the worst I've had to put up with have been dealt with - only one almost prevented game progress. The game does suffer from a poor encyclopedia and the many terms that exist such as combat statuses are not easy to find and learn about. Best to look up a guide so you can quickly refer to a list of what each combat status actually does. So many abilities inflict so many different conditions and there's no pop-up explaining those like there is for most other things. Weird. You have to literally inflict the condition, then examine it in game. Why?

At least it also provides great customisable difficulty and a means to re-spec in game.

As far as epic level campaigns go, I would probably even say this is the greatest. The whole campaign truly does make you feel epic, and the Mythic Paths implementation is simply top-tier. Yes, certain paths have been shown more love than others (will become apparent only when you play), but there is just so much content in this game, that it is endlessly re-playable., and more over, each path is truly unique.

As for bugs,yes. At present, there are quite a few bugs, none are game-breaking, but as far as I am aware the dev. team
is on top of them and are regularly patching then up, to get the game ready for Season Pass 2.

Probably, the only downsides at the moment are, that DLC 1 & 2 are not great. DLC 3 , the latest 'Treasures of the midnight Isles' is pretty awesome.

If you love cRPGs; this game should be a no-brainer. If you want to get started on cRPGs, and experience how epic they can get, just go ahead and get this. The difficulty settings are so customizable, it makes you feel like a Dungeon Master, and just focus on having a good time.

Also, be prepared to spend days stuck in character creation, before starting your 1st playthrough! :D

The mythic paths certainly deserve special mention. At least for the Lich path, the moments where you got to actually use your mythic powers in the story are so grandiose and over the top that I can only hope the other paths live up to the same standard.

I haven't touched the DLC, and probably won't, but the main story is deep enough to keep you entertained for at least a little while. Special note is the heavily customizable difficulty settings, adjustable at any time.

The game is simply amazing. The story, the compelling mechanics and builds, the mythic paths... I can only hope that in the future Owlcat will pour more of games of this high quality!

(Unity Mod Manager)
https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/21/?tab=files

(Toy Box)
https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/8

(RespecMod)
https://github.com/BarleyFlour/RespecMod/releases

(VisualAdjustmentsMod)
https://github.com/semidude/WrathVisualAdjustmentsMod/releases

Toybox allows you to adjust various game mechanics to more to your liking, like taking 20 for skill checks out of combat, or re-adjusting stats etc. if/when something goes wrong, or if you need to swap out party members.

The re-spec mod allows you to re-spec your companions from level 0. The in-game respec option only allows you to re-spec from the level you met them (like at level 8).

The Visual Adjustment mod is for OCD people who get annoyed by little things, like me.

====================================
Here's some very useful guides as well:

(Classes' Primary Ability Score Guide)
https://www.yekbot.com/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous-primary-ability-scores-for-each-class-and-archetype/

(Restored Relics Guide)
https://www.yekbot.com/all-restored-crusader-relics-in-pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous/

(Status Effects / Conditions)
https://pathfinderkingmaker.fandom.com/wiki/Condition

(Ascension Ending Guide)
https://www.neoseeker.com/pathfinder-wrath-of-the-righteous/guides/Secret_Ending


The classes guide is very useful as the game does horrible job at telling you, which stat corresponds with which class, e.g. that Arcanist uses Int for casting but Charisma for Special Abilities, or that Slayer uses Intelligence for its special abilities etc.

Restored Relics is guide, that tells you what the results of different restoration choices are, as otherwise you are picking blindly.

The Status Effects / Conditions list all the status effects of the game, because again, the game does a horrible job at listing their actual mechanical aspects.

Ascension Ending Guide is for the Secret Ascension ending, but it requires specific actions to be taken throughout the whole game, not just the final portion.
====================================

Now about the game itself:

+++ Writing / Story / World Building:
It's amazingly good, just like Kingmaker, top notch. Could have used more voice acting, as reading several novels worth of text actually starts to hurt my eyes. Voice acting is also 10/10. With the secret ending, this is THE most Epic D&D adventure I've played to date.

++ Gameplay:
It's great with a ton of both RPG and mechanical customization options to play as you like, from a literal angel to a literal death swarm.

+/- Difficulty
Ok, first of all, every single D&D game that makes you start from level 1, instead of 3 - 6 suffers from this, and it's called ""The Dice are trying to kill me!"". Before you hit level 3+, your fate is purely in the hands of the RNG gods, and being able to exploit the AI, and not so much in your skill. It actually makes very little difference if you are playing on hard or easy at the start. The game gets a LOT easier when you just get some levels.

+/- 100% -ters
Just look up a guide if you care, because you will fail otherwise on your first time through.

+/- Crusade System
It's a city builder, resource manager and HoMM3 -lite all rolled into one, and it's... fine. It is also required to be turned ON if you want the best ending. 

Also, the systems has a VERY nasty feature, that if you clear out the map too quickly, and then just sit around doing research etc. you will actually loose the game, as the moral will plummet. You will need to ration your enemies and their forts so you will have something to kill every few weeks once you loose the ""what have you killed lately"" -status. Armies spawned to attack you do not count towards ""defeated enemies"" to increase moral.

This is a REAL issue in Act 5, if you are trying to hit the ""Secret Ending"" as the date needs to be 16th - 21st day of the 4th month before entering the ""Threshold Fortress"", and sitting around for 6 months doing nothing will put you in failed game state, if you don't anything to kill anymore.

- Status Hyperlinks
Even as one who has played D&D games for ever, I still don't always remember what a statuses like ""nauseated"" vs ""sickened"" or ""dazed"" or ""dazzled"" or ""staggered"" vs ""stunned"" or ""shaken"" vs ""frightened"" vs ""panicked"" or ""helpless"" etc. ACTUALLY mean in context of the game mechanics, so it would be REALLY nice, if these descriptions would have same hyper link explanations for them, as when the game mentions other mechanics.

--- Hidden timers upon hidden triggers.
Some quest will fail, become uncompleteable after an invisible timer has passed. Some quests are dependent on other unmentioned quests and mix both of these with that some quests need to done in a specific order or they will fail, and beyond looking up a quide, you have no way of knowing what, when or why.

You will be let down so bad by this title!

I tried for many hours to love this game being an old fan of RPG titles and having been a tabletop pathfinder game master and player for 10+ years but I'm really having an hard time understanding what's the point of it at this point.

THE GOOD STUFF: 
As good as it sounds devs have really delivered a superb character creation in this title and most of the time it is faithful to the original tabletop experience [b]rulewise[/b]. And that bold text rulewise has to stay there underlined and circled because  really that is all that there is in there, rules and mechanics and if you are looking for that then go on and buy. 
There is also the exceptional option of having a mounted character which i really appreciated by the time the game was still on kickstarter and still think is a good direction for games like this.

THE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE STUFF:

If I think at the games that have delivered solid experiences and unforgettable moments in my life i cannot think of something else other than feeling that I was part of the world I was moving in. 
In the worst case just physically, being able to interact with most of it, in the best case also emotionally, being able to relate to the setting itself and his inhabitants and personalities and becoming an inhabitant of that fictional world myself, at least for some hours.

This game goes so hard on the rules and how accurate it is on some of them, if we take into account the rulebooks, that it almost makes you believe you have been sold a real tabletop Roleplay experience but then the character creation finishes and you are hit in the face by the reality:

You have 253785 classes and even more feats but most of the game you will be just wondering who to bash in the head next or how to beat that difficult difficult fight because really...that's it. You keep running into fights and then fights and then fights without really having the possibility to interact with anything that surrounds you beside the occasional loot container.
Everything follows the script and is heavily cliched , there's no creativity in the way you can use the environment simply because the environment is just for you to stare 98% of time (yes at one point you can click on a column and it will roll over...really ...wow). For this reason every room is just another room with something sticked on it and there are some points where you cannot run trough BUT at somepoint you won't even bother about it anymore because where you are really doesn't matter more than how much damage or healing spells that you have. 
That's the environment interaction in this game, forget looking at what you pick from the ground, what is around, smashing trough a window, breaking a closed door, pickpocketing a merchant throwing a torch on an oil spill for spectacular flames, talking your way out of a fight or feeling somewhat involved in this demonic chaotic world that is presented to you. You are just really a pawn in this game and you better like it cause that will be your role for the whole run and it isn't a short one.
Also magic is just another bump of numbers and formulas for different damage dealt, there's nothing Magical in magic beside the damage that it can do or heal and there is no magic that has any other use then being used in combat. No ropetrick, no Magnificent Mansion, no teleport...really think about something heavily roleplayable and enjoyable out of combat and it won't be there...not even one time! (yes even if the demons keep teleporting!)

What has made other games great , the feeling of freedom and being part of a setting that is there for you to discover is just missing in this CRPG because you have been fooled by that C in thinking it stood for Classic but it really stands for Combat RulePawn Game .

Save you some of your precious lifetime hours and look for something better.

To the fan of an immersive experience look elsewhere , there is nothing to be had here and there are titles from 2001 just being better at making you believe you are there without even bothering about classes or mounted combat.

I love this game and strongly recommend every RPG-player to play this, I have to say that the game has lots of issues (most of them menioned in other reviews) with class balance, monster difficulty and complexity of combat mechanics & buffs. 

Combat (when you understand the basics is very enjoyable, characters are amazing, side quests are very good (most of them has consequenses later in the game) and interesting, storytelling is one of the best in the genre, ending is fulfilling. Game is super long for single player game (it took me more than 200 hours to complete it)

BTW, for ""secret ending"" it's sufficient just to explore the game, google is not required (although I'd recommend you to check, because secret ending is good) :)",1668803100,1668803100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Positives:
-Beautiful (environment, models, animations, spell effects, ..)
-Huge, a lot of things to do - even outside the core gameplay
-a mind boggling amount of choice (in both story and gamepay)
-very creative and layered companions
-Regill

Negatives
.poor pacing
-story doesnt really work for me (NPC reactivity to player choice is often jarring and immersion-breaking)
-sadly not a lot of voice acting in comparison to the size of the game, very inconsistent (e.g. some insignificant interactions are voiced while major plotpoints are not). Good quality tho.

I still had a blast with the game and can definately recommend it. Personally I think it is a little too big for its own good.",1668757888,1668757888,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Story wise, the game is fantastic and has a significant amount of player choice for how you wish to go about your crusade.

Some mythic paths can make the game more of a joke like the trickster path but the other main paths all have good dialogue and character additions that are nice to freshen up multiple playthroughs.

As for whats frustrating, the game's combat can become a slog even on the standard difficulty due to random AC spikes of enemies. The game requires you to build properly or you just get demolished by enemies that you physically can't hit and their pregenerated builds are not good enough to function past half way through Act 2.

Quick scores:

Graphics: 7.5 /10.   This game has above average graphics but nothing that will blow you away by any means.
Sound: 6/10.  Standard Pathfinder music... some okay, some really dull.
Story/Gameplay 5/10.  Very forgettable story.  Lord of locusts... demons, some weird succubus girl and a dwarf dude that hates her then is willing to give his life for her???... a lot of blah blah blah... weird mythic path something or another, a couple of side characters that won't shut up about their relationship... (which by the way was seriously forced... obviously the creators like pushing their own political narratives... but whatever)... a half-arsed crusade mode... etc.  There's not a lot here.
Mechanics 8/10. The game plays and runs quite smoothly.  (Note - I didn't play at launch, I'm talking about now).

Overall - This seemed like an ""on the rails"" RPG where player choice was limited.  I thought that Kingmaker allowed the player to explore more.  Also the companions are mostly terrible in my eyes.  Several of them are useless.  I loved Lann.. found him witty and a solid NPC, Regill was excellent and Woljif's an outstanding rogue type character.  Some of the others like Staunton, Sosiel, Greybor, etc. kind of sucked.  The mythic path had a few best choices (the two main good-aligned ones, Angel and Azata are arguably the best two whereas the main evil-aligned ones, Demon and Devil, are awful) and can make or break your game to be quite honest.  I hate evil characters so when I saw that the playthrough for those alignments was unimpressive it made it a real slog.

Anyway enough of my complaining you get the point.  This isn't a terrible game, it plays smoothly and is a faithful computer RPG adaptation of Pathfinder, but the story and gameplay elements let me down and I just didn't care for it overall.

+ Pretty large although also quite linear.
+ Good graphics although I didn't find any character to look aesthetically pleasing, even fully custom ones.
+ Lots of voiceovers.
+ Crusade system is a nice minigame.
+ One of the few large CRPGs out there.
+ Didn't crash in my 300 hours (4k ultra).
+ Many different weapons and spells.
+ Lots of loot.
+ Many classes and subclasses to choose from.
+ Large inventory with many sort options and a search function.

- Most spells are useless (short range (casters touching tanks ??), limited uses, friendly fire, too situational, too severe downside, unclear description, not easily comparable to others).
- Respeccing or even changing spells comes at high costs (either timewise or gold wise) so experimenting is not viable.
- Poor character interface (not all characters (and pets) visible at the same time, no distinction between buffs and debuffs).
- Many different type permanent debuffs after fights for which you have very limited options to dispell them and the interface to do so is also extremely poor (it should show which character with which spell could debuff it instead of forcing you to dig through the dozens of spells per character every time to see if there's one that might do it).
- Poor item, class and spell interface (everything is described in words instead of clear stat pluses or minuses). Stuff is impossible to compare to eachother.
- Some bugs (e.g. custom formation not saved/messing up, equipment not saved on Bismuth).
- Way too much violence and gore, dozens of characters are tortured/killed in the most disgusting ways (not sure why this game isn't Adult Only).
- Gloomy, depressing atmosphere.
- No beautiful women or erotica.
- Poor combat log that spams everything together (x heals for 1 spam) without clearly showing key moments (e.g. character death) and their precise damage sequence. Also a tiny unresizable window.
- Silly ""roll"" system where for even the most basic checks a dice is rolled so they can fail, so savescum is a must (also because every seemingly innocent check might have severe consequences lateron).",1668274313,1668274313,True,7,0,0.49108847975730896,3,True,False,False

Character customization is expansive , story choices are impactful, combat is smooth and the overall presentation is great. With that in mind, the game is almost too big. This isn't something you finish over a weekend. 

If you are itching for a good rpg, this might fit the bill, but know what you are getting in to before you dive in. The game has a tutorial system that will help you figure out combat basics but beyond that, you are on your own. The game will allow you to fail if you make poor choices. You can always re-load and try again, but there is the real possibility of losing hours of game-time if you aren't adequately prepared for certain encounters - some of which come up with no warning.

1) The game has a scene where the character (explicitly the player) can stumble in onto a gang of demons assaulting a clone slave of the PC. Survivors dont need to read on to know whats coming. 
[spoiler] When asked about their intentions (which are entirely clear and in fact acted out) they say it is to put a piece of demon meat in every orifice.  [/spoiler] 

This isn't even tonedeaf, this is outright dangerous. The game edges the line with its evil narrative already, this is so far beyond the line.

2) There is a demon made of feces who assumes the shape of a succubus and flirts with you. Not to kink-shame but usually it's polite to put the tags out first for ppl to see. This is neither violence nor alcohol use. And foul language only in the sense that you end up with a turd in your mouth.

By all means, the scenes are well written. As an author myself I commend the dev on their wordsmithing skill, but I cannot do so on their common sense. 


This game is a complete waste of time, and I don't even mean for its quality. Every aspect in minute detail is designed to waste time, constant, grinding, unnecessary, gruelling tediousness condensed into the sole purpose of wasting time. There is not a single mechanic to be found that does not feed this machination but unlike a useless engine, this one isn't even fun to watch. 

You have to be of a very selective, special mindset to enjoy this in any capacity. This game isn't just flawed in some detail, the flaws are elevated to paradigm. 

Drill a hole through your kneecap, that's going to be more useful and rewarding.

Part II:
Where to begin? Seriously. Here we go, in depth review. I'll look at Pro/Con/Mechanics/Economy/Combat and a summary of game Design.

First off the positive things:
- The atmosphere is well set. The emotions are accurate, the game is tender, brutal, good and evil in the right places which helps with immersion. The stage, the frame, all has been designed very well and you sometimes have to make choices which go against your gut feeling, if youre a do gooder like me. 
- some chuckles from dialogue. A few scenes are funny.

hey I'm really trying to dig up some positive things to say first ok?!

The rest of the game:
From looking at the playtimes people put into this, the game seems to be laid out for 200+ hours of play. Reviewers range from 150-800h play time.
- 95% of this is combat or purely wasted. The amount of combat is not just ridiculous in nature but also in amount, esp on higher difficulty ratings. You can barely walk 10 paces without stumbling into a fight. 
- then the wasteful parts. 
   Travel is done on an overland map where you move a token. Watching this is the equivalent of sitting behind grampa with a crochet looroll on the back shelf going 30 down a highway. 
    You need to rest every 20h, so getting to a destination may require you to waste 5-10 minutes  on resting and preparations before you get to any place (really any distance is just so you get there exhausted and in no condition to fight)
   You are forced to additionally do ""combat"" with armies who move the same way. The combat adds nothing to the game, is never interesting because you cannot  afford losses (or youll be stuck recruiting for weeks) and in general is so poorly copied from strategy games that  Heroes of  M&M I did it better.
    The game throws a shit ton, a crapload, a deluge of stat debuffs at you. -2 attribute here, 2-3 negative levels there. You are constantly busy farming resources to fix these debuffs, resting to fix these debuffs or overcharging the pcs to avoid these debuffs (particularly if you're a regular player). Even turning that mechanic down still requires you to waste time.

Economy:
The turnover rate is absurd. You will go through 15000 gold pieces in consumables before lvl 5 and still be starved for money to keep up with the later challenges of the exponential growth of the game. The items you get are funneling toward a certain playstyle, making a diversity in classes difficult, and the items are not customizable. The game has absolutely no understanding of proliferation and management, it goes full on nuclear from the get go.

Combat:
The game starts tough and overpowered but then goes one god-tier encounter after the other. It doesnt matter what you do with your characters, only one playstyle is survivable. EXTERMINATE every enemy within its first turns or perish. No in between. Turn 0 is prepping and abusing the surprise mechanics, Turn 1 is killing the baddie while they close the gap, and if you have not killed them then, your party will be eaten. Simple as that. No matter what their armour or defence. You can fiddle and fudge it a bit, but the general outcome is: baddie touch you, re-load. 
- The standard encounter in Act III is the equivalent of fighting a Great, Ancient Red Wyrm (most encounter bosses are factually stronger) 1-10 times per map, at lvl 9-11 of your party. The dynamic becomes really just being annoyed by two encounter  types, the ubermonster that  requires you to waste time re-re-re-redoing it, buffing and wasting all your resources on that 1 fight or the trash which will drain you and force you to waste time fixing the 100 nuisances from it. 

The game Design as a whole:
- The game is not easily accessible to players who have not studied Pathfinder and its sourcebooks
- The game has timed scenes and encounters, unexplained elements with unforseeable outcomes, alluding to and deluding itself into expecting players to re-play the game to experience a different ""path"" when the experience is ""This is not what I wanted  at all, this is botched now"". Thus the game is barely playable without a cluebook/walkthrough, or going through the same pain again. 
- The plot is really generic and the whole plotline can possibly be generously printed on 2 standard pages distributed throughout the game
- the game thickens the plot by a well crafted atmosphere and the constant urgency to stay busy in fights or scrounging for resources to generate a sense of relief when a plot element interrupts the grind for a moment
- Pcs randomly leave the party for extended periods with all their equipment and without an adequate replacement. Needed the rogue? Well fuck you. Haha. 
- The game is obnoxious in part (fixable) with especially combat sounding like rabid, snorting swine are waging war with one another screaming absurd battlecries.
- something is fishy with the numbers generator, there are streaks of critical misses for example which are just too frequent, often it feels like the pcs are rolling their attacks with a d4, not d20.
- the game is vindictive 
- you are forced to abuse the system by default to manage combat, not a single encounter feels like an honest  challenge that is exciting. It is always a matter of can you hammer the gaps hard enough quickly enough to overwhelm the opponent
- the ubermobs are demoralizing and tiring. Just checking the base stats generates this feeling which can only be expressed in a disgusted sigh. Having some creature which is literally immune to just about any approach, that can oneshot anything you can bring up against it...stand in a pissy dank cave for no good reason...just no.
- because of that, none of the game makes sense either. Any of these opponents could just eat an army or five for breakfast. The party at lvl 3 could just buy a small kingdom etc...
- the walk pathing is nauseatingly stupid (yes, they'll just take the direct route through all pitfalls and dangers)
- the game is prone to destroying progress by happenstance. Pcs walking to random spots on the map because they can not access a chokepoint in combat and pulling a new combat encounter or running into traps etc

In summary the game comes down to: Buff, cheat, rinse, repeat

[spoiler] I won the fight at the tavern but now the Gray Garrison quest won't trigger and the area I am in has all the quests completed, so I am flat stuck. I went back to an earlier save and tried to do things a bit differently to see if I got a different result---I did, now other areas that I had unlocked before won't trigger before the battle at the tavern. [/spoiler] This could be a fun game but they need to fix these quest and area  trigger bugs. Going several hours back and making a few different choices fixed my issue but it sucked to loose all that progress. 

The early game choices are rough and unless you cheat and look at guides you can easily lock yourself out of multiple choices, like Mythic paths, just by exploring (you know, that staple of D&D-like games) and trying to orient yourself to the game. These choices have a lasting impact on your play through. Putting these irreversible choices so early in the game with little warning dampens the fun of the game, IMO.

On the surface the many choices might seem to  seem  to enhance replayability but this illusion is a trap. Often you won't find out for hours of game play that you should have done something different hours of game play back to unlock the choice you wanted, and having to go back to a save that far back (again) isn't fun, it's deflating. 

Those who come from the D&D/Pathfinder macrocosm know that Challenge Ratings can be deceiving. A similar issue exists here with the numerical values given to army strength. The number doesn't  reveal  that  an army may lack the ability to bypass the resistances or defend against the special attacks of a demon army leading the unaware to thinking they have overwhelming force only to find themselves getting slaughtered. IMO, it's flat poor design not to take those abilities and resistances into account. It's akin in the tabletop to sending a party against an opponent with no way to over come it's resistances even though it is equal to their challenge rating (even worse in Pathfinder where resistances mean you may not be able to damage the creature at all).

I'll still play through for the story, but all over the above issues make things less enjoyable for me. For the keyboard warriors who love games that kill you before the opening credits roll, more power to you and carry on, for me as a casual player if it wasn't for the difficulty sliders this game would be unplayable.

The ability to turn off Crusade mode comes at the cost of loosing access to some side missions which sucks.
While I'll be the first to advocate that a RPGs don't need to be realistic they do need make some sense and the idea of running a war while while also adventuring is silly, yeah i can shut it off and loose access to content but I like to do all the side quests so the choice here isn't fun.

[spoiler] Next, you get to spend a lot of time building your army to be efficient then you get sent to Abyss and come back to find all our your units gone, so you have to start over. There are really only two words to describe this ""story element,"" IMO---Bull and shit!

I have a lot of good hours in this game but cannot recommend it in it's current state.

I've so far gotten 3 different characters to the end of act II.  While none of them ended up being exactly what 
i wanted, they each had distinct flavors and play styles, leading to several different party makeups, and they have all been enjoyable.  I don't play higher than Core right now, which means that while different things are challenging, they have all been viable builds (Though the build based on fear and mind effects did face quite a few challenges later in act II).  The game feels most comfortable to me in Real-Time with Pause.

I've played on Core and Normal.  I would only recommend Normal if you have no experience with Pathfinder.  Up through the end of act ii, most encounters (on Normal) require very little preparation or ability use.  It almost becomes and Idle game at that point.  But, if you have no experience with Pathfinder, or this is your first CRPG (or if you have time constraints and are looking for a way to get through the story in a shorter amount of time), Normal gives you plenty of room to learn how to use abilities, spells, buffs and fight strategy.

The character I've taken furthest is a Cavalier, which is starting to feel stale - the Cavalier relies on charges (either foot or mounted) and I'm just not getting many opportunities to open combat iwth a charge any more.

The shift in the game in act III feels good and helps add depth to the game, though without the kingom management, I'm guessing the game could be finished in under 60 hours.

The dungeons for the most part were all engaging and unique, nothing seemed repetitive.


Minor gripes:
I would have liked some more character dialogue. Seemed like alot of significant things went unnoticed by companions and expected them to have something to say in town after it but just didn't happen. Maybe even some more small side events would have been nice. They're all good characters that seemed to not be as expanded on as they could've been.

Also I think the the companion quest to find a certain persons relative and the consequences of answering their doubts about said person are too stringent. I had no intention of using mods on my first playthrough of the game but once I reached the deciding moment of that quest I felt robbed based on the answers I gave. 

And of course not being able to fully respec story characters from level 1 was frustrating.

Picked this game up having never played an owlcat game before and looking for a Crpg to tide me over while I wait for Larian studio's boulders gate full release. I heard good things in a review and decided to try it and WOW, i am glad I did. First off this is a LOT of game. It is partially voiced which allows key moments to hit hard while also allowing an extra level of flexibility from its VERY non-linear story. There are so many options and replay-ability that it is almost overwhelming for a players who ponder most every decision.

 I played on turn based Unfair having experience with D&D 5e. The level of complexity in character building far outpaces Dos 2 and even 5e D&D. The stratagey and in combat decision making is lacking compared to an action point system like DoS 2. early game felt immursive but by the time you reach act 2 the gameplay amounts to spend 10 minutes buffing and then hit stuff(every unfair viable comp follows the buff meta). So while there is a truely staggering amount of builds your potential variety at least on higher difficulties is essentially halved due to buffs required to pass high ac. 

These are literally my only complaints with the entire base game. period. 
(The DLCs are lackluster at best.)

They put some lipstick on that pig but it still has the same problems and shortcomings. While it starts strong it quickly becomes repetetive, feels bloated and the story just isnt intersting enough to carry you through 80+ hours of play time. It's like ordering your favourite dish and getting a huge serving of hospital food instead. The portion size doesn't make it any better and it becomes worse the longer you eat.

So what are my main issues? The fights just arent very fun and always follow the same logic: Buff your party, send in your tank and let the rest follow a second later. That is pretty much it and is enough to get you through most battles even on higher difficulties. Another issue here is that the game doesnt allow different approaches to combat: Once you attack someone all other enemies that are part of the encounter engage as well regardless of where you are on the map. So doing fun - or sometimes cheesy - stuff like taking out enemies one by one isnt in the cards. The most the game asks of you is to occasionally micro-manage a little, thats it. Another problem is that there are way too many encounters - both randomly on the world map and in certain areas. Behind every corner theres a random group of enemies without purpose or story. It sometimes felt like playing a hack and slay title and less like a real RPG.

Then there's the game within the game again. The crusade mechanic isnt as bad as the one in Kingmaker but still dull and annoying. The worst part is that I dont feel like I can explore the world freely because theres always a clock ticking in the background. I don't know anyone who likes that part about the game, even my friends who enjoyed the rest couldnt stand it. Feels like someone had a ""cool idea"" during the early stages of development and nobody was willing to admit that its not working.

Story and writing aren't great either. The game isn't horrific in that regard, just mediocre. I didnt care enough about the story, my party, other NPCs or the world as a whole enough to be really invested in the game. Everything is by the numbers and only a few characters really stand out.

Then there are the bugs and a lot of sloppiness. Dialogues don't start and some events play out twice. I only played for about 40 hours and had to watch people talking and fighting in empty rooms two times already. Pathfinding (ha!) is horrific, flying creatures just woosh across the screen in monopose and NPCs interact with stuff thats several feet away from them. It's also weird how some important mechanics arent explained and dialogue options are often confusing. Whats with the stupid ""Requires xxx Mythic Path"" option when it's actually ""unlocking"" a certain path? Could nobody be bothered to fix that?

Okay, unlike the game I'll do everyone a favor and cut things short: It's just not very good, messy, way too long and becomes boring after about a third of the playtime. Don't subject yourself to this mediocre mess.",1667381675,1667668810,False,137,13,0.65030360221862793,2,True,False,False

I played and enjoyed Pathfinder: Kingmaker, with all of its faults, and to see the next in the series take such a step back is a serious letdown. To see that on a so-called ""Enhanced Edition"" is borderline embarrassing. 

Cons:
-- I've played DnD and Pathfinder on tabletop for decades, and yet the interface manages to obfuscate the rules. Seemingly, I  can't use *all* of my move action before I take a standard, for example. There's enough of these that the tactical fun is drowned in navigating the UI.

-- The companions seem almost intended to suck. In Kingmaker, they weren't all optimal, but you could find purpose for most. Maybe this is a result of the choice to use obscure variants of obscure classes.

-- The ""campaign"" view is a disaster. I don't think I've ever seen such a simple set of game concepts executed quite so poorly in practice. I controlled my little army in the first battle, and suddenly I control nothing in the second. Why do I hire a ""general,"" ant not get a chance to do anything with them? They should have ditched it entirely and focused on the actual gameplay loop.

As others have mentioned, the difficulty curve is a roller coaster. For me, this meant combats were either boring, or suddenly and unexpectedly punishing.

Pros:

Well, the sweep of the narrative is at least compelling, I suppose.

For example, the AI can't tell the difference between different elevations, so you will get melee attackers walking back and forth uselessly for 90% of a fight because they don't realize the enemy soldier is up on a higher platform. Or a melee attacker will walk past several enemies (taking multiple opportunity attacks) to fight someone halfway across the map instead of someone immediately beside them... It makes no sense. The allies that aren't player-controlled feel useless and merely add to the duration of combat.

A few hours into the game (at or around level 3 for your party) you'll be roped into doing a ""tavern defense"" mission. And it will take hours. Hours of watching several hundred allied NPCs literally (literally!) do nothing, zip, nada, waste your time while the camera pans over every... single... one of them... every turn. Every single turn. I am on turn FIFTY of this miserable slog.

This exhausting, insane, hideously boring battle alone is the reason I'm giving the game a thumbs-down. Maybe that seems petty. Maybe, though, maybe I want to actually enjoy the little time I have these days to actually play computer games. Maybe I think that a developer who looks at forcing the player into a several-hour-long sequence of ""miss"" *pan camera* *pan camera* *pan camera* *pan camera* *pan camera* ""THE LIGHT TAKE YOU!"" ""miss"" *pan camera* *pan camera* *pan camera* *pan camera* has collective brain damage at best and, more likely, an unchecked sadist's streak. I'm past the point of caring what wonderful little game design quirks they cooked up for any other part of the game, because I can't find out what those are if I don't want to sit through this ludicrous collapse of basic design sense.

Play the game if you want your time inevitably wasted. Maybe there's fun stuff in there too.

** Updating review because I'm still getting comments on it:
I've poured a bunch more time into the game. I think I'll give up on it. What I've found is that it's inconsistent: some really, really nicely executed segments, very high production values, and a fun kind of 'heavy metal' setting... still persistently dragged down by obtuse design elements and an overall dull, self-defeating approach. There's another review somewhere in the sea of them here that suggests WotR will end up being a case study for game design simply because so many really nice decisions are sat beside so many endlessly irritating and pointless ones. I agree.

Some people are also taking time out of their day to suggest that Pathfinder is really designed around 'real time with pause' mode, and not 'turn based' mode as I obstinately insist on. This is a confusing statement. You probably mean that CRPGs based on Pathfinder (of which there are, I think, two...?) are designed for real time with pause -- because the tabletop game, which I've been playing and GMing for years, definitely both is not and cannot be.

The best battles I have seen my players engage in during tabletop play have been very thoughtful affairs. Positioning and turn economy are core to the Pathfinder experience *as it was designed.* But CRPGs like Kingmaker and WotR do indeed appear to place primary focus on 'real time with pause' mode instead, fearing that there would be no other way to stuff the game with dull, repetitive combat encounters every ten feet.

So, a few points:

1. ""The game is primarily designed around real time with pause"" may be true, but it's a lousy excuse given that the designers clearly advertise and support a 'turn-based mode.' I guarantee you this turn-based mode will appeal to veterans of the tabletop game. It not only slots badly into how this game's encounters are designed, it is *buggy* -- I can't tell you how many times I've seen a character cast a buff or heal spell with their standard action only for the spell to NOT ACTUALLY CAST, wasting their standard action and leaving no effect.

2. 'Real time with pause' has no grid, gives players at best a flimsy understanding of action economy, and is only necessary because the game is stuffed to the gills with combat. Actual Pathfinder games do not feature nearly this much combat because combat, as designed, is SLOW. I just GM'd an important combat for my players that went for 3.5 hours. There's a reason we don't do combat every session. CRPG designers may find this dynamic (and the idea of using grids! yikes!) to be a non-starter, and I understand why, broadly. But the fact that they opt to solve this problem by having endless waves of combat encounters with 'fast forward' button jammed down really just underscores that systems like Pathfinder and D&D simply aren't appropriate for CRPGs. Use the system as it's intended or find another one, I suppose, because these weird, vast compromises work badly.

3. Because combat is so frequent and thereby so dull (OK, equip your best items, apply buffs before battle, roll well, rinse, repeat), the truly good stuff (like the writing of that Hellknight PC? fantastic!) is too much of a chore to get to. And that's a real shame. I can't overstate there really are character and puzzle moments from a much better RPG buried in this mound.

So no, I'm not changing my review from a thumbs-down. Consider it a 'sad' thumbs down, maybe. A thumbs-down that dreams of the noble thumbs-up. I don't care. I'm not going to spend my time on a CRPG adaptation of this system anymore -- not when I've got the tabletop version to return to.

(By the way, if they really want to adapt Pathfinder to a CRPG format, they should really go with 2e -- but again, they should probably just use a different system entirely!)",1665699903,1667480678,False,38,4,0.641503810882568359,12,True,False,False

While many are quick to come to their aid now after reading the product description for the Season Pass, it is imperative that you understand that this was not always the case. As with any store listing, it is updated over time to reflect the DLC's as they are released. Some of you choose to ignorantly contest the content of the many negative reviews on their Season Pass, claiming that they're untrue or that you don't see what they are talking about. My hope is that you now better understand those reviews. In light of this, I cannot recommend this game.

either way this kind of game breaking crap shouldn't exist in any game.
I never finished kingmaker, the game is not as polished as larians divinity sin games, you can't take advantage of mechanics like height, oil, water, etc, combat is just, look this game I can't recommend this or any of this companies games to anyone. I got this game at 50% off and I look at my save files, it says 2days and 22hours on one file and i'm only on act 3. The game doesn't have 3days worth of content, its a few hours at best but they slow you down but creating mechanics that cause you to wait, like traveling a map, encountering enemies randomly, all the small talk that you try to click on in case you might unlock some secret or hidden quest because you have to answer specifically and to top it off, what really sucks all your time is how difficult you put in your settings.
I know nothing about the lore, I don't care to read every single ""book"" I come across, I never pay any attention to choices in dialogue and in most cases it doesn't effect any story or quests, in some rare cases it effects EVERYthing in such a massive way that you need to literally google ""azata path"" and follow instructions strictly just to unlock specific paths.

Respec option = brilliant for people who don't quite understand the scope of all the options.  It also allows to you keep NPCs you like as better support for your character.  Offering this for free might be better as an always option since explanations still are lacking in some aspects of the game.  At least for us guys who constantly play tones of games and don't recall buttons to press never mind if Cleave is the best feat for the build.
Planned explanations were a help but maybe a stat score adjustment might help actually see what the longer term effects might be to reduce investing in unnecessary feat trees.  I know it happens more in life but in games I prefer to be impressive not a normal guy.

- This is a buff heavy game. I cannot stress this enough. You need to dedicate spell slots to a lot of buffs and casting them before a fight starts will change the course of a fight drastically. you can go from pathetically losing a battle to clowning on the enemy. Late game you can end up with so many buffs that the process of buffing can take minutes so I highly recommend the bubble buffs mod which you can find [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/195/?tab=description] here[/url] and this turns that entire procedure into one click.
- early game casters are weak and martial classes carry your party while late game casters get to shine a lot. If you play a magic oriented character and feel like they're not pulling their weight, give them some time.

[h1] Looks and sound [/h1]

WOTR builds up on its last game with better lighting, much better environment textures, the ability to freely rotate the camera and better character textures. The character textures are still overall fairly weak but a step up. The game's visuals are carried by that lighting which is leverged for some amazing effects.

The sound effects are good though there wasn't much noticeable in that regard. The voice acting for the companions and notable characters is well done though I wish we had a bit more variety in what the companions would yell during combat.

The soundtrack is very good with a staggering variety that works well for such a long game. I do think that the first game has a better soundtrack but that was from the legend Inon Zur so its hard to measure up against that. I have found myself listening to some of the tracks outside of the game too


[h1] Combat [/h1] 

The gameplay is why I enjoyed this game a lot. It offering an insane level of variety and freedom in how you can build your character and your companions. There are 25 classes and each class has 3-5 subclasses. You are free to multiclass into as many classes as you'd like as long as you meet the requirements for it. On top of all that there is a mythic path which adds another layer of variety to builds. You can also multiclass your companions into as many classes as you'd like. If this sounds a bit too much don't worry. You are free to not multi-class at all. Contrary to what some players will tell you, single-class builds are perfectly viable on the standard difficulties which is what I recommend playing on anyways 

Of course not everything is equal. There are some classes and subclasses you want to avoid like Assassin which is next to useless in this campaign.

The game throws a variety of enemies with different types of strengths and weakness and different situations at you to keep you on your toes.

I do think the game veers somewhat into the unfair territory with some of the encounters even on the lower difficulties but most of them end up being learning experiences in some way. 

[h1]Story and Worldbuilding[/h1]

I don't have much to say here. There's lore. It exists. I don't particularly care for it. It does its job sometimes but this is a game I'm playing mostly for the combat. 

I did like some of the companion questlines and the party banter that occurs when resting. Its also fascinating to see how much freedom you're given not jsut in the gameplay but in the story as well with a very wide variety of choices which have can have effects much later down the line.




Overall this is one of the best CRPGs I've played with the gameplay and freedom in choices. I highly recommend this to people who like RPGs with variety and player choice. This is my GOTY for 2022.

The Companions arent boring af this time and there is a wide selection of interesting characters that add to the experience
Having said this, Nenio is one of the worst written characters iv even seen in a RPG, great for combat tho.

The biggest selling point for WotR compared to all other recent CRPGs are the Mythic classes. I don't know any other game that allows you to become a immortal Lich so I decided to play as a , and it was great. Its kinda sad tho that you get to use the power-lich spell only once in the game at the very end (i guess it goes the same for every other mythic path), but animating corpses, forcing enemies into servitude, all while slowly your flesh begins to dry off makes for a great experience.

Too bad that you cant become an undead dragon (you can choose to become a golden dragon, would be fun if you were still able to continue your Lich journey)
I wont talk about the story since I really cant judge it (afaik its based on a tabletop RPG, and overall the lore of Pathfinder is interesting so there is a bunch of reading ingame if you enjoy that), but I can say that it was entertaining and I really cant think of any cringe moments (compared to all the other CRPG revival games that came out in the last few years)
Kingmakers campaign took me 100 hours to complete, WoTR is shorter (70h) but much better organized and executed imo.
I like to complain so I'll just add that the Abbys is ass and rotating the camera shouldnt be binded to a gameplay mechanic in a isometric game
When it comes to the companions I really liked the schizophrenic Half-Elf noble bastardess and the sweet nature and unending optimism for good of Arueshalae reminded me of my gf. Greybor is my bro, he deserves better in life. Same for Regill and made me hate gnomes less after playing Arcanum. The Undead companions are a good touch to playing as a Lich, instead of just relying on summoned skeletons. I absolutely do not care about Seelah, Lann, Ember and especially Sosiel, I guess they were meant as companions for redditors
Woljif and Wenduag, even tho they were obviously meant to be archetypes for homosexual trickster and cave-dweller edgy goth, they ended up actually interesting characters.

This is a very long game, but for me it was pretty well paced and never felt like too much of a grind (I can see how some would think that the Crusade portions of the game could be a dud, but as a starved FFT and Fire Emblem fan it slightly scratched that itch while also helping support that epic scope that I mentioned earlier). I also cannot not mention how well done all of the companions are in this game.

There are so many horrible game design decisions. I don't understand how someone can could come up with this. I do understand they want to translate the pathfinder system to a videogame but they could at least try to smooth out the things that clearly don't work.

- you have to manually remove armor and shield for every single ability check
- 9 out of 10 spells are useless; why even try to use debuffs that barely do anything?
- every combat takes 10 seconds; then either you or the enemy is dead. 
- pacing is painful. sometimes you have to read through literal hours of dialog (with no voiceover)
- you often lock yourself out of story paths without having a chance of knowing they existed
- romancing system is bad. you need to go full on horny-mode the moment a romance-target says hello or you lock yourself out of ""true love""-endings
- the encounters are horribly imbalanced.
- there are bugs everywhere
- I never got to fully complete the game because the quest for the last act did never trigger, locking me out of the rest of the game no matter what I did. A known issue. Neither toybox mod nor workarounds could fix it. But they keep pushing out DLCs for a broken game.

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*] [u] Excellent story with a lot of memorable & breath taking & epic moments. [/u] - It is one of those stories that you will definitely remember & often think of, once you play this game. 
    [*] [u] Memorable, unique and well designed characters. [/u] - Each of them has story to tell, a lot of side quests and is well established. It all makes them believable and also a part of the world. So much so that if something happens to them - it may make you laugh or cry in rl.
    [*] [u] Your choice REALLY matters. [/u] - Seriously, your actions are ""remembered"" by the game and if you do something in act 1 or 2 - it will affect act 3 & later. And it is not just a couple of things, but rather almost every quest (even side quest) you do. I think it is safe to say that the number of possible endings of the game reflects that - and there are lots of them ! Same goes for your party members - your actions will affect their final fate.
    [*] [u] Freedom of making a character. [/u] - Possibilities are almost endless. You can chose from various races, classes, make interesting builds and closer to the end - chose a mythic path which is an equivalent of an end-game high level character specializtion in Pathfinder rule set. If you have an animal companion - then there is even  a mount system !
[/list]
[i] Just to demonstrate the possibilities, during my play through, I played as: [/i] [spoiler] a Fox Monk (there is a playable humanoid fox race in this game) that later on became an actual Dragon. And, I am not taking about a polymorph or shape shift or spell, no - a real one (lore & plot wise). Just for that alone i should give this game 10/10. This game does not fool around when it comes to power level. You can be an Angel, Devil, a Lich and possibly way more. I love when games do that. When player character can wield incredible power.[/spoiler]

[b]Cons[/b] [i] (I am REALLY nitpicking here as it was kinda hard to find any legitimate complaints): [/i]
[list]
    [*] [u] Not all languages are supported [/u] - Probably not a big deal for most people, but there is a lot of reading in this game, so if you don't speak English well, then you may not enjoy this game & you will miss a lot.
    [*] [u] Not all dialogues are fully voiced. [/u] - Speaking of reading - this is probably my biggest complain. A lot of dialogues are not recorded & voiced. I would say that overall it is more or less 30% - 20% of the text that has             voice actors. Usually most important ones, but there are some weird exceptions. Again, not a huge deal taking into account how much story is in this game - but it is what it is & I had to point that out.
    [*] [u] Lack of multiplayer [/u] - After playing this game, I know why it does not have it as it would make some aspects of the story almost impossible to design, so I don't consider it a huge drawback, but even a basic form of co-op would be nice addition.
    [*] [u] Crusade mode could be designed better [/u]- [spoiler] Without much spoilers, at some point you will have to play a mini-game in which you command units, just like in HoM&M. It is way too long and distracts you from real deal - adventuring with your party. [/spoiler]
[/list]

[i] This game is absolutely amazing, both story wise and gameplay wise. If you like games like Divinity Original Sin or other table-top crpg games like Baldur's Gate or Pilars of Eternity - then this is a must-play for you. No question about it. Imho in many aspects this game actually even beats Divinity Original Sin 2. If you are waiting for Baldur's Gate 3 - then it is a title definitely worth trying out. Besides - this game rises the bar so high that BG3 will have a very tough opponent to beat. [/i]

Kingmaker was a buggy mess on release but it ended up being a great game.  I should have done the same for Wrath because the bugs are everywhere and they're game-breaking. 

Within my first hour of play, one of my companions got stuck under the floor/environment and could no longer interact with anyone. 

After completing the first two acts of the game, my save bricked and the maps stopped loading for me (just froze at 100%).  

I've tried two different builds and both of them have key class features that are no working (druids have all sorts of stuff broken/missing).

Worst of all, however, is the Crusade system.  It's really hard to exaggerate how bad it is.  Like in Kingmaker, this game has a management system where you build up your realm, upgrade settlements, listen to advisors and make decisions for your people.  A key feature for Wrath was the addition of Heroes of Might and Magic style tactical turn-based battles.  It SOUNDED like a cool feature, but what Owlcat delivered was embarrassing.  It's like they THOUGHT they could add an interesting tactical battle system to a CRPG, built a proof of concept, and then forgot to flesh it out.  Just take Heroes of Might and Magic or King's Bounty, remove 95% of content from them, dumb it down by equal measure, and you have Owlcat's Crusade system.  

This game is nowhere near finished.  It needed another 6 months of polish and testing at least.

**I've come back to play the Enhanced Edition of the game.  Most of my review remains unchanged**

They've fixed a lot of the broken class features and quest bugs, so that's good.  You should be able to get through the campaign without worrying about bricking your save.  The Crusade is still an unforgivable mess and a complete waste of time - intrusive, uninteresting and half-baked.  

I more or less enjoyed the game through the first four acts.  Unfortunately they rushed Act 5 and it's not fun at all.  There's very little story in Act 5.  The quests and encounters are disjointed, poorly tested, poorly paced and the balance is all over the place.  By the end of the game I just wanted it to be over, and though the very final fight and the actual ending were decent, most of what came before was rushed and not particularly fun.",1630687508,1666817491,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They insist on being ""faithful"" to the tabletop version of Pathfinder even if that means entire prestige classes in the game, like Assassain, are useless because literally 99% of the enemy types you face are immune to their core mechanic (I'm not exaggerating here), something which should have been IMMEDIATELY obvious and is EASILY fixed in a lore-friendly way.

And yet, they have their own completely unique CR system (challenge rating, how you decide how hard encounters are) and don't bother to add a lot of core/basic things from the TT that players of the core classes are used to having, such as many from Magus.

Worse, while their writing is supreme, their role as the unseen game master is terrible. I imagine that if I was ever playing with one of the devs as my group's GM, it'd take less than an hour before we flipped the table, took turns slapping the GM, and then stomped out before deleting that person from our phones and never talking to them again. If these devs actually do play Pathfinder, then it's very likely they made this game exactly because no one wanted to play with them, lmao. They make a lot of really weird mechanic and gameplay choices, have zero concept of difficulty curves (even for people who DO understand Pathfinder, which is their favorite excuse), and really don't know that tedious is not the same as challenging, all of which is made worse by the hordes of bugs that cripple the game. In their previous game, some of those bugs were invisible until they hardlocked your 80+ hour game, forcing you to START OVER!!!

And who can forget the fact that they also love tossing in under-baked yet still major systems, then don't develop it further at all, thus leaving it feeling annoying and shallow? Most people absolutely hated the janky kingdom system in the first game, which, by the way, is literally the whole point of that module. Here, the crusade system is some jank, shallow tactical RPG thing that people also hate... in a game about leading the crusade, lmao.

It just makes you scratch your head.

But beneath all the jank, while ignoring all the terrible DLC, while pretending Owlcat actually cares about OG Pathfinder and that mods aren't the ones putting in the work their DLC should have done by filling in the very obvious and large blanks and fixing stuff, there is a really good story and game with a whole lot of roleplaying potential.

I almost, ALMOST wish this was a game like Disco Elysium or that someone else had worked on the gameplay elements, because we're talking oldschool Obsidian or Bioware levels of storytelling and choices. But the GAME itself? Faithful to Pathfinder it is not, whatever they want to believe, and a good Pathfinder interpretation it isn't either.

Many starving fanboys will tell you it's the BEST we've got, and this is true... because, you know, CRPGs are pretty rare these days as are DnD and Pathfinder games in general. ""The best we got"" doesn't mean good.

So, conflicted as I am, I can't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't have specific tastes. Owlcat has a rabid fanbase that consists of two utterly separate factions:

1) Mathematicians and excel sheet wizards that spend more time theorycrafting builds than actually playing the game, and literally only play to optimize them, so they will make all choices in game solely based on what is optimal.

2) Story-starved, hardcore roleplayers, who try not to let all the clunky gameplay jank water down the interesting storyline and roleplaying pathways offered to you. After all, this is a game where you can become a living insect swarm that devours everything or an angel. A demon or a freespirited renegeade. A heartless lich or simply the chosen hero, and they all involve consequences. Very entertaining ones in many cases.

Unless one of the above, you're far better off playing something else. Divinity Original 2 is overall a far better game even if its storytelling is worse, and I suspect Baldur's Gate 3 will just be a better game period.",1666783607,1666783844,False,84,3,0.737558066844940186,13,True,False,False

Long Version: Welcome to hell. 

Mechanically the game is complex. You can play any number of ways and have a lot of creative freedom to build your party as you see fit. The systems are well designed and you can have a good time. However, do not expect this to play like a tabletop game if you are following a more ""by the book"" variation. The game throws a lot of curve balls at you because - it is a video game. It is engaging, challenging, and does not warn you when one area will be easy, but the other tremendously hard.

The story is complicated and well detailed. The characters are rather well fleshed out. There are instances of callbacks to the previous Pathfinder: Kingmaker, scattered like easter eggs. There are varying branching paths for the player to explore or completely crush. It is a game that once you get into it, you can go through the same scenario multiple times and get different results. Instances of class and race do also take a point, as well as alignment, impacting story choices. 

Its a good game but if you do not pay attention to the choices or builds you are doing, your experience will suffer. However, you can retrain characters if you find that your build is not quite working out. There are things that experienced players are familiar with, and others will have a hard check when they first come to realize it. So, pay attention to the tool tips and you'll be on the fast track to a successful ending.

The first Pathfinder was a stellar game with some great ideas and in part equally great execution, but in the end it also had plenty of tedious, stupid stuff. I really, really hoped that with a second installment they would improve on what they screwed up in Kingmaker, but not only have they repeated certain mistakes, they managed to make some stuff worse (sadly it was mostly the stuff that was already the worst, so the non-RPG crusafe/country managment).
Pathfinder porting is great, dungeons are cool, tough and have a very classic DnD design and feel to them. Some adventures and segments are really, really cool.
However the game manages to be extremly tedious, and seems like for every good element and moment, there is one or two equally bad ones.
Some companions are really cool, some are annoying.
You can set the crusade management to auto, but then you miss out on some loot and extra rewards.
The world does not seem any close to real, with everything happening around you, being catered to be solved by The Commander. It is very artificial, does not capture the feeling of adventure from the most acclaimed cRPGs.
The story itself has some merit to it, but it is not interesting enough to get me through all the ******** that blocks the way to progress.
Mythic paths are a joke, but it ain't a funny one.

Biggest values are the great Pathfinder port, combat, amazing options customization and few fun companions. Dungeons seem to be designed by someone who really gets game dungeon design, or was/is experienced dungeon master in paper rpgs.

I do however have a lot of negative things to say about it as I feel like it fails in a lot of stuff as a second game after the first one.  They did make a lot of very good updates to this game from the previous game technically.  Such as your inventory remembering what filter you had applied all the time so you don't have to redo every time you go in your backpack.

So to start a fundamental issue I have is that they used the same system from the first game.  I still think this series needs to drop real time basically entirely and go to more of a Solsta route and made grids so things work how they do in the tabletop more closely and things aren't as weird as this game makes them.  Overall though they did improve on the previous system and it feels much more fluid and nice.

The new rotating camera is very nice and a welcome edition to see the game in new ways.  But the gimmic they use with in ch4 while interesting slows down' traversal of the area massively.  Good concept but when you spend and entire chapter dealing with a camera gimmic and waiting for land masses to move into position its really annoying.

Next is on normal this game felt way more difficult than the last game.  i felt like almost every combat most of my characters had to roll a 20 to hitbecause everything had absurd amounts of armor.  Then ontop of that armor they like to stack haste, mirror image, blur, displacement and other really annoying buff spells.  Meanwhile they also have resistance to most elementals and huge SR so your spells just fail most of the time anyways.  Their casting levels are super high meaning dispelling their buffs are extremely difficulty.  it honestly feels like they felt that the end of the last game wasnt annoying enough for most players so they just made that the whole game.  And don't even get me started how many enemies have 1d6 level drain at basically the start of the game.

The 'kingdom management' portion which is now crusade management was boring.  Running all these little armys around seems interesting but for the most part just power level a single mage general with a strong army and you roll the whole game.  The choices were boring and the removal of the advisor rolls is just lame.  The outposts don't have any unique layout.  Its just a downgrade in almost every way that actually matters.  

The companions are generally pretty interesting as basic concepts.  They all have unique stuff going on and their own unique perspectives.  They do lawful evil really well with one of them.  Playing a good or lawful character though I don't know how you avoid just killing off some of them for being just absolutely the worst kind of people that if you would kill evil cutlstist on sight I don't know how you could justify a character leaving them alive.  Also it feels like this game there werent that many companion quests at the end of it for some companions.  They just kinda hung around and had like 2 or 3 missions that took 2 seconds to complete where as others had relatively decent quest lines.

And finally the story.  I actually really like the book this AP came from but compared to Kingmaker the story is just...not interesting?  There were some times I was interested but it never felt actually personal.  It usually felt artificially personal by revealing 'ha this was planned to be you all along.'  It just feels really shallow and not that interesting.  Every good character is just vain and preachy it feels.  This game retroactively made me dislike Iomadie as a goddess just because how everything around her is portrayed and all the people that follow her.  The stuff about Desna in contrast is honestly fantastic.  The demon lords are amazing fun even though they are simplistic and the ending for one specific powerful demon makes me really wish it was cannon because it would be cool.  Which brings about the discussion of the endings and epilogues.  There is a lot of ways for the game to end with new things happening for each character which I enjoyed.  I did the aeon route and saw the ending for it and the normal ending and thought both were really interesting.

If I had to choose after everything I'd say the first game was just better at telling a story and feeling plausible.  I felt much more connected with that game.  This game felt impersonal and like people just hung around because why not.  Most NPCs just seem incompetent and helpless despite the praise the world throws on them.  The management side was a huge downgrade and the difficulty in combat has been turned wayyyyy up.  There were good technical changes and I appreciate the new classes being added but if I wanted to introduce someone into this series I'd still tell them to play kingmaker first as it was just better if you ask me.

Please in the next game ditch this game system and give us turn based grids for normal combat.  I just want my charge attacks to work and 5 foot steps to make sense.  And for my reach weapons to actually have the reach properties of pathfinder proper.",1666391034,1666391034,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay: A+
Graphics: B+
Sound: B+

Story: A+
Replayability: B+

Detractors:
Some Bugs - More than I like to see in a finished product (although I haven't seen any game breaking ones), but I'm willing to give it a bit of a pass due the broad scope of the game.  

A Game Of Parts:
This game has it's CRPG part, like Balder's Gate, and a strategical game reminiscent of Heroes Of Might & Magic all wrapped up into a delectable gaming burrito.  Both parts are well done and keep the action varied so you don't suffer from burnout of playing one thing, one way, for too long.  In a nutshell it's brilliant and a model I wish more games would follow.  A 3rd part of the game is your mythic paths within the CRPG.  This elevates your D&D character beyond the standard conventions into something... well... of epic mythical proportions. 

One word of caution.  There are A LOT of choices when making and progressing your character.  If you enjoy researching, experimentation or just watching videos on the best way to set up your character's there's so much to like here.  If you don't enjoy, or are willing to do the above, then it could be easy to become overwhelmed by all the choices.

Overall, I give this a Very High Recommendation.

But the takeaways are that it is too linear and predictable for a role playing game.  Not enough choice but strangely a massive amount of choice in terms of characterisation.  I'd rather have a more open, wide ranging game with less character customisation personally.  However that isn't the real deal breaker here.  It is the 'Crusader' section of the game. For some reason Pathfinder want you to believe that it is a hybrid of RPG and War Gaming Strategy Sim (a la Warhammer).  The trouble is that it is just dumb.  Want to use stealth to surprise enemies?  Forget it!  Want to use 2 armies in a pincer movement?  Forget it!  Want to cut supply lines to reduce your enemy's effectiveness?  Forget it!  Want to use terrain and vegetation tactically?  Forget it!  Essentially you just need overwhelming numbers of foot soldiers, archers, clerics and yes a General.  That's it basically!  So dumb I'm sure Putin must play it!  As a wargamer in the past myself I ask myself why Pathfinder bother to add this feature at all.  To be fair the turn based combat of the party is reasonably good (though not to the standard of Pillars of Eternity IMO) but the Crusader war gaming is just plain idiotic.

That being said, there's still times where they made choices in what they put in the game and some of it feels tedious and random at times. This is more a fundamental aspect the game must have for being based on Pathfinder 1e, so it's hard to accurately critic what they might have done wrong or right; thus I will simply say the story is hit or miss because it's open ended in a way, but probably not exactly in the way you hope. 
All in all though, it's flawed but gets enough right to be worth a chance if you know Pathfinder 1e and don't mind the sort of Mass Effect type of open world with Baulders Gate-ish game play. They probably do more to make it an accessible version of Pathfinder 1e than I realize but I gotta give credit to the continual improvement they put into the game. A good ambitious start, and a passing grade for effort in the follow up in enough if I have to choose between a ""yes"" or ""no""


TLDR: they added a BUNCH of really cool things and didn't balance or bug check any of them. Some don't work and some work too well, so well in fact that the game almost requires you to min/max.

I like this game, I don't recommend this game anymore. for a lot of reasons that I don't think I'll get too deep into rn I don't think this game is finished, even the parts people think are done in some cases. Masters of war free DLC? a feature paraded as a DLC is not a good look.

That being said real progress has been made and if it continues to improve at this rate it might be a game I would/could recommend in maybe 2 years? I will continue to give the game a chance and I suppose I will redact this when that happens.

Edit one: I suppose I'll get into what I mean when I say this game wasn't finished. It feels too scripted, ""Your choices* matter*"" (P.S. all things marked with an * don't matter). You will lead the crusade, you will destroy the stone, I get they're going for a heavier story driven game this time around but it's tired, too easy, feels like it doesn't translate well into video game. Kingmaker had elements of that too but at least it quickly gave you reins to explore, it took a different angle than what THIS is coming from and it was better.
As for characters, can't talk too much shit. The characters they present as they're not all bad but there's plenty to critic.

Edit 1: still a lot of bugs, sometimes doors load in arches where there is no door, sometimes your key class feature just doesn't work as the tool tip said, either way it breaks the tempo of the game. On that note the game seems to run a LOT slower and crash less. I don't remember Kingmaker running flawlessly but a sequel should be noticeably better, not worse. (*got something better than a 1070ti and it runs better, that's still too demanding for what it looks like it should take to me though, oh well.)

Edit 3: Feb 20, 2022. I started a new character and was having a blast! Then at the end of Kenabras I encounter a game breaking bug where I can no longer assault the Gray Garrison as Irebeth does not have the dialog option to do so even though everything is completed and I'm level 7. This was likely caused by an in game feature they have for re-specing that I love, but breaks the game. I'm nearly fed up with this ""experience"". It treats me like a toxic lover. People get so mad when they hear this game is unfinished, I'll let you divine the irony.

Edit (oh why bother): Feb 23, 2022. Absolutely amazing. I get a new computer, decide to try just one more time. I'm having a great time, i found the secret was just play the NEW cavalier class and things are fun, eh i guess that's fine right? BOOM game gets stuck on a loading screen, crashes, won't open without crashing now. I used steams file integrity and reinstalled the damn thing, no dice.

I got this on sale for $15 and really can't ding it like some of the other people that prob paid $60 (really can understand the gripes there as some of the stuff that I have encountered that I do NOT like are just not acceptable for a AAA title even if it was EA.)   Even though it has a lot of flaws I'm still recommending the game.   If you loved Neverwinter Nights D&D games in the early 2000s you'll love this.    They were qwirky and so is this.   

What I love:
1) I'm having a good time this is above all other things I state below, even the negatives.
2) So much replay value in all the classes/subclasses/mythic paths/crusade it feels EPIC.
3) TONS of config options in the settings aspect of the game.   
4) Feels like a good story that I'm part of.
5) Choices made earlier seem to come back at unexpected times in the story, pretty cool.
6) Love the Mythic part of the design to make my char far beyond just a  char but a major HERO figure.
7) Option to be as good as you want or as bad as you want.


What I hate: 
I mean these are bad enough I almost gave the game a thumbs down review but after 100 hours I just can't do that.
1) So many poor and shoddy decisions on QoL, especially when you get to ACT3 and have to watch your guy run for a minute to get to the front gates to leave Drezden etc...that stuff compounds and starts to eat at your free game time.   I am 54 and have responsibilities so these things drive me nuts.   Wish if they made a large area that you could have some fast travel there.

2) The Crusade morale system is a complete JOKE.   If you dominate you will be punished because there is not any enemy to fight regularly enough to keep morale high.   They could have made this FUN by placing more enemy activity on the map.   I could go on regarding the frustrations encountered.

3) The Quest system is very confusing to follow and I felt overwhelmed and many times very unsure where I'm supposed to go next etc.   I understand the DEVs want us to figure out some things on our own and I'm fine with that but at least show what Quest is tracked on the screen or something and what the next stage for it is.

4) No form of Quest difficulty displayed.   In ACT 3 where I am at now I was pursuing quests that were far beyond my Char levels and had no clue.... 

5) Talked to the Hand of the Inheritor at level 10 and accidentally said to take me to Pulura's Fall to literally get stuck in that area where you cannot rest anywhere, like NOWHERE even safe area.   Had to use a save file editor to fix.   I had an issue I could not go to a recent save so I was going to lose a ton of time.   Nothing said HEY you are way too wimpy for this quest.... no take me to a place where every mob drains your strength and is level 20+.   That one ticked me off.

6) Buffing up is a task.   Wish there was some better system for that without mods.

7) Everything above aside I hate this one more than anything.   Let me fully respec the characters it's single player dangit.   Let me decide the ability scores, classes if I want.   The only real full respec is my own guy.   Kinda takes some replay out of it when Nenio is always a 5 STR Char etc.   It's a huge D&D extravaganza but I can only make one character in it.

8) Graphics are just MEH, Camera SUCKS and many locations are so cramped that walls zoom your camera position and such that make it so hard to see what is going on.   Only a tiny little circle area becomes see through unlike how Diablo series would make what blocks your view transparent.... BOOM, mega idea there DEVs it works!  That would have been a wise choice.

9) Not enough big dungeons at least through ACT3.   The fight for Drezden felt epic however.

Second this game suffers from pathfinder scaling issue. Everything in the last 20% of the game has bonkers AC, HP, Spell resist, Saves, and damage so you end up in these loops of needing to roll 20s to get anything done while depending on your builds they may either just one shot your melee guys to death and you will have to resurrect them every fight or they do nothing and the fights take forever cause you can't hit them.

[hr][/hr]
Original Review:
""""Stay of Execution"" was the least fun I have had in any-turn based RPG ever. It needs a serious rework. Turning turn-based mode off made it okay (as in ""not take 1 billion turns""), but that wasn't how I was trying to play this game.""

[hr][/hr]

For the updated review...
I still stand by that opinion. In addition, the puzzles are incredibly unpleasant. Please do yourself a favor and don't do the ""More Than Nothing"" quest. If you need the item from that quest there are other means to get it.

This game is about 40-80 hours longer than it needs to be as a result of various gameplay decisions. For example: walking around the city. Why can't it just be a list of characters and locations that you click? Why do I have to waste time walking from one side of the city to another just to talk to someone after completing their quest? I blame Fire Emblem for some of this, because FE Three Houses was popular and had you walk from place to place, but... It is terrible, and it was bad in Fire Emblem, too. Take a point from the Darkest Dungeon: don't waste my time; let me talk to people just by clicking on their portrait or location. Pretty please. Yes, there is some flavor to it, but not enough to make it worthwhile.

There are also so many extra locations that are meaningless, the game could do with some slimming down of the map. Normally I am all for extra content, but this game is too long and has too much and feels a bit unfocused at times. The game is at its best when it is focusing on the player character and companions. What I would love is something more after beating the game-- that involves your companions.

Achievements are locked behind playing on core difficulty. That was too tedious for me and it is discouraging to not be able to get most achievements because I did not feel like min-maxing my characters. It reeks of elitism and left a bad taste in my mouth. Not that getting every achievement is feasible for the average person, anyway. The game is way too long and you would have to replay quite a bit to unlock all of them.

Game is buggy, pathfinding is bad (had to reload multiple times because a character got stuck on something), and it is not optimized.

[hr][/hr]
There are things that could use improvement:
Towards the end of the game, your companions stop talking as much. It was really disappointing when doing a lot of the final quests when nobody would comment on anything. More character responses for Chapters 5 and 6 would bring a lot more life to the story.

Romance options are weird. One male character gets way more attention than the other, and possibly more than all the other companions combined. He is my favorite character because I find him amusing and he is written very well, but... The romances could be balanced slightly better if Lann, Lady A, and Lady G were given more lines. I played a female character, and didn't pick spider-lady so I can't speak for other romance options.

Chapter 6 feels incredibly rushed in contrast to the slow plod of the rest of the game. More companion dialogue would help. There is no way that none of your companions have an opinion on what is about to happen. Some of that might be due to how many endings there are.

Don't play the golden dragon route, as cool as it sounds. That ending has yet to be fleshed out and is supposed to be unsatisfactory. Keep an eye out for updates, as it might possibly receive some polish later (?).

[hr][/hr]

After saying all of that, I recommend playing this game once. The story, characters, and gameplay are all quite good. Your choices really do matter; they determine who lives, who dies, and how epilogues play out. If you want to be diabolically evil, you can (honestly, too evil-- cannot imagine actually playing [i]that[/i] route after everything I have read). If you want to be super good, you can. Not sure if the game has enough changes between routes to make it worth playing multiple times and it is too long to make me want to play it again, but I did enjoy most of my playthrough.",1664658308,1665946476,True,0,0,0.560646593570709229,0,True,False,False

This game has severe memory leak issues that will only get worst the further in the game you get because these geniuses decided to make a long complex CRPG in an engine notorious for having issues with complex save files. You can expect crashes and in extreme cases your rig shutting itself off to prevent damage even if your system is well above recommended specs even if the game starts out running just fine. When i first started this game everything is fine now that i'm 90ish hours into it whenever i enter certain areas my power usage will spike for no discernible reason. For example when i'm in Drezen which is one of the busiest areas in the game my rig draws on average around 30W a second. But when i get in a fight with a specific dragon in the tower with the story teller my power consumption jumps too 90W a second and stays there consistently and makes my temperature steadily rise until it eventually reaches unsafe levels even though i havn't had a single issue running this game up until that point and my hardware is well above specs.

Also while this alone wasn't enough for me to leave a negative review of the game since the inexcusable technical issues came up i might as well also point out that even though this game is a year old it still has bugs even in the early game that will trivialize the whole game if not break it and can only be fixed with mods. I had a cutscene mark 2 of my characters as immortal objects and the game forgot to unflag them when it was over. If i hadn't fixed it i could have just used those 2 characters to face tank every encounter and that would have been all she wrote.

First of all, there's a lot of truth in the others about this being a fantastic story with great characters, good writing and incredible branching paths. If you're here for that, you'll be statisfied.

What makes this game so murky for me in the long run is the combat. The game's mechanics are that of a very outdated and overcomplicated table top RPG system. There's a fuckton of choice - you can create whatever character you want, given you're willing to sort through 100 subclasses and investigate their minute differences. There's an intense amount of spells, though you'll have to dig through which of them are actually worthwhile because some of them really, really are not.

The key problem I've found is, as you get stronger, all your buffs get more impactful and plentiful. A +5% boost turns to +15%, the cleric learns a new way to buff damage while being able to do everything he could before. What this means is that at higher levels, you're utterly dependant on buffs. The average enemy will do 2/3 of your health in one turn (if not more) when you're not buffed, and will be able to barely land a blow once your armor buffs are up. Your normal Paladin may be able to barely even hit anything, then when the buffs are up they have an 80% hit chance and flat out more attacks than normal under like doubled damage. You can be invincible by spending a minute with your UI launching every buff you have and then just bulldozing through enemy positions, or get wiped out by goons when they suprise you on the world map. 
It's just such a mixed bag of how effective your abilities will be that you can't predict. You'd have to analyze every enemy's stats mid-fight to even see what spells can work, or to see how armored they are (because you legitimately can't tell just based on their equipment because of whatever defensive buff skills or invisible armor layers they have). Of the stronger spells, many just flat out win you the fight if they land on key targets, so you better buff the caster and debuff the target and... bleh.
There's also a bunch of unpleasant bugs or design. If you move a little less than your maximum movement, you often lose your entire turn because the game decided that you're spending it dashing now. A character who's lying on the floor is completely out of the game until they stand up, taking an attack from everyone next to them and probably dying for it. A TON of offensive spells stored in scrolls as treasure, yet deal like less than a tenth of what you'd normally do. Launching an amazing, thematic all-out offense to capture territory back from the demons... then sleeping for a full night in the middle of the castle because your characters ran out of spells and skills halfway through, even though you did well at rationing them, completely shattering immersion. Having characters turn utterly useless against certain enemies, because of some damage resistance or a spell resistance so high your spellcasters literally cannot affect it and can do naught but buff more and more.
I really did have some fun going through this, mainly because it felt pretty sweet to bulldoze through with a buffed team. But then something unpredictable comes along and your healer is suddenly dead in one turn because you didn't think to also buff his defense. Part of me is curious just how insane the buffing game is gonna get, but... nah.

EDIT: I went back out of morbid curiosity and it just goes completely off the rails. The 20-sided die has stopped meaning anything. I have fought dragons that were more than 20 points away from being even possible to hit (that's right, basically a -100% chance to hit), then after a round of buffing I had an 110% hit chance and killed it in one round after it did 0 damage to my party (A random buff gave them immunity to its damage). I counted how many buffs I have running when entering serious fights. 67. Near level cap, I have 67 spells, abilities, and items to activate before being able to go in full force, not including any buffs short enough that they need to be applied mid-fight.
There is basically no strategy here. There is no challenge in this turn-based combat. It's all about the builds. Make a defense-focused character, and you're invulnerable to most foes. Make an offense-focused character, and you can oneshot any mook and take off half the health of bosses in one turn (not round), but also get oneshot by any foe worth their salt. And you better have buffs running, because otherwise you get oneshot regardless.
This game has done a fantastic job of convincing me not to ever play Pathfinder 1e. If only this game used 2e.

If you do decide to get and play this, *definetely* play with the death's door rule so characters that die get a second chance.

-the Developers seem to listen a lot to the community, respond to feedback well and have been very fast on fixing major bugs


Cons:
-Some games just aren't meant for puzzles, a spesific quest in particular almost made me give up on everything near the end.
-There were a couple of minor bugs, but nothing too gamebreaking.

Not like other games of its type. Higher difficulties require enemy examination, reduction of AC and saves to take down, a good understanding of what spells do what, you really do have to read and analyze to git gud once you go to core at many times, but especially if you go higher difficulties.

Edit: 
[h1]Update after finishing my first full campaign.[/h1] 

[i]First of all, make sure you grab the mod ""Bubbles Ultimate Buff Bot Lite Extra Simple (BUBBLES)"". It lets you assign buffs to three UI buttons so that you don't have to buff your party manually before every big fight. I honestly doubt I'd actually take the time to buff my people before fights if I didn't have this mod, because that can get very lengthy and tedious at the mid- and end-game.
Toybox is also a great mod, because it lets you fully respect yourself and companions (the in-game option is very restricted for many characters).[/i]


I just finished the main campaign after 295.5 hours total as a chaotic good gnome shadow mage with Azata mythic path that rides a baby havoc dragon. The game is definitely worth it, and it has a lot of replayability for both gameplay and story from different classes, alignments, and mythic paths. My next playthrough will be as [spoiler] an evil lich that will make everyone in my party & army undead, and there are several companions that are only available if playing lich. However, I'm sure nothing will beat having Mimic Knights that disguise themselves as cultist furniture, cavalry sculptors that carve fruit into boulders as they travel to/from battles, and Treants that waggle their branches at demons suggestively then get ambushed by Robin Hood and his Merry Men that were hiding in the branches. [/spoiler] And of course Aivu. Can't forget Aivu.

I've played a lot of CRPGs (Pillars of Eternity 1&2, Divinity, Wasteland, etc.), and this one definitely has the most impact from your choices. This isn't just the large-scale choices that affect some end game scenes like is normally the case, but also how things play out during the game itself. I didn't like the writing itself as much as Pillars, but the breadth of the world and impact from your choices is where this one shines.

Plenty of high impact choices were only possible because of my character's chaotic good Azata personality, and that is true for all of the paths. For example, [spoiler]I know from reading that being Aeon path means you can go back in time and fix some pretty messed up situations for unique resolutions, and The Swarm that Walks path means you can make yourself a walking locust swarm, then eat literally everyone and replace them with swarm companions & armies.[/spoiler]

My only real gripe is that some quest paths or side goals were bugged, hidden, or didn't tell me that I was locked out. 
In my case, [spoiler] I couldn't finish one end-game quest because Hilor was missing and never showed back up. 
I also couldn't romance Arushelae because my interaction in the prison in the early game locked me out, even though her later dialogues make it seem like romance is still an option. 
Also, Lann was my character's best friend and we were in good standing, but I missed the opportunity to resolve his issues with the Mongrel leader Sull because I didn't know it was even there, and my occasional passes through Drezen talking to everyone must have missed it.[/spoiler]

I got it on sale, but with how much I've been enjoying it, I would definitely say that it justifies its full price. 

As with its predecessor, this game is a fairly accurate representation of its source material, but I do want to point out one way that doesn't work in its favor.

The alignment system is something that's been heavily debated in the TTRPG space, and while I definitely think there are positive aspects to its inclusion, the way this game uses it tend to highlight some of its worst cases. The first way this manifests is that while there are a fair few actions you can take to change your alignment one way or the other, there are also a lot of alignment changes that happen purely through dialogue. For evil, this usually comes in the form of talking down, insulting, or threatening other characters, and while one way to play evil is to be overtly cruel, this is arguably the most one-dimensional portrayal of it. This is further compounded by the fact that some party members will leave if you stray too far from their ideals, which makes sense, but leaves pretty much no room for subterfuge. Given how much this game uses betrayal and misdirection as a storytelling device, not being able to take part in it feels oddly exclusionary. Lying is one of evil's most useful tools, but its not an option insofar as I've seen playing a chaotic neutral character. Maybe it is available to evil characters, but I wouldn't know because in order to be evil, I'd basically have to announce it to everyone in my party, which can be fun sometimes, but in this context just feels reckless.

I do still really strongly endorse this game, but more nuance in how you express your character's alignment would be greatly appreciated in the future.",1665324033,1665324033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The abilities, combat, and achievements have been balanced around using the turn-based mode and RTwP is mostly an after thought. Some abilities won't even work in turn based mode. E.g. the charge ability usually can't be used and even if it can the timer won't allow you to execute it properly. In addition, the RTwP AI is completely busted and there is no option to program. I would have a more positive view on this game if they just didn't include the RTwP option instead of offering it with only 25% of what's *necessary* to make it enjoyable. Even if you don't prefer it, stick to TB mode. More general review below:

Positives:
+ Interesting enough dungeons and levels
+ Solid UI
+ Mythic paths are very cool
+ Some interesting characters
+ Turn based Combat (when it works) is satisfying

Neutrals:
~ Performance is bad in some areas (5800X3D + RTX3080)
~ Random encounters get annoying, but some people like this

Negatives:
- Ironically, the pathfinding of the party characters is dogshit. They regularly get stuck on objects
- Characters move around too much and it's pain in the ass to find them when you need to advance a quest
- Some quests, even when they are not fetch quests, are boring and lackluster 
- Really bad dialogue writing for some characters.
- A lot of fluff lore text that doesn't really build an interesting world ...it's very encyclopedic at times
- Some area are filled to the brim with characters and quests that it can be hard to track down what is going on

Overall, this game shoots for quantity over quality. If you want to grind out 150-200 hours for single playthrough, you may enjoy this. I found it to be a complete slog.

Now I'm disappointed and grumpy I stayed away from the game. 

Its a true and full successor to Kingmaker in every sense, a lot of the interfaces are greatly improved, while still using a lot of the same elements from the previous game. They keep the world building aspect and improve upon that as well.  You control the 5th crusade against the demons of the world wound, getting thrown against more complex and dynamic problems than before. The mythic path progression system adds a truly epic level of flavor to your already very expansive character creation options. I'm playing a Beast Rider Cavalier that specializes in using Glaives and rides a Mastodon into battle.

As far as I can tell, unfortunately they do not add a full crafting system for making magic items and such, BUT on the bright side the game is utterly chock-filled with all kinds of unique magical items for you to discover and use. [spoiler] My character is using a glaive gained off of a main villain in the second act that summons demons upon killing an opponent, but cleansed it of its evil and it now gives my mount flat bonuses to saving throws and combat maneuver defense for example. [/spoiler]

Army battles can be a little awkward though, if your archers get targetted by another ranged unit or hit by a spell its usually a 1 hit ko regardless of how many you have.

All in all for me its easily a 9 MAYBE 10 out of 10. Looking forward to many playthroughs to see all of the different things I can do. [spoiler]The mythic path where you turn into a living swarm is absolutely bonkers.[/spoiler]

As a forewarning though: I have been playing DnD since I was in middle school, and eventually converted to Pathfinder. I'm used to this style of game, where you are expected to use almost every tool at your disposal to get through encounters. I have things set to ""normal"" difficulty, and there are times where I have to redo an encounter multiple times till I realize there is 1 thing I'm not doing, fix it, and then beat it. To me that is rewarding, but to others it can fast get tedious as I've been at the same save for 66 hours and am only in the third act. A fair bit of that time is me resetting to right before starting an encounter. Also though, I have a very heavy tendency to build physical damage dominate parties. [spoiler]My main character as mentioned above is a Beast Rider Cavalier with Aeon powers, Regis the Hellknight, Greybor the Slayer, Lann the Zen Archer, Daeren the Oracle, and Ember the Witch. With Seelah the Paladin replacing Greybor sometimes. [/spoiler] There are times where I need to have my divine casters spamming damaging spells, but for the most part most encounters I simply brute force through with heavy hitting physical damage with buffs/debuffs coming from said divine casters.

I tend to think that I have a pretty broad spectrum of games I find entertaining, and am pretty forgiving of issues if core mechanics and play are fun, so it takes quite a bit for me to not like a game.  Kingmaker, to me, is so frustrating, so unforgivingly and unrelentingly unfun, that it has not only made me not like the game, not only guaranteed that I will not buy future products from Owlcat, but it actually actively impacted my mental outlook and caused real relationship strain within my marriage.  Let me explain.

I had a blast with Kingmaker, and continue to go back to it again and again, with different permutations of play, all of them have been fun in their own unique ways, offering different challenges, and so I thought the same would apply to Wrath.  However, where Kingmaker accomodated variety in class creation and progression, this grindhouse cocksucker made it abundantly clear that my choices were stupid, and I was a bad player, possibly a bad human being, for making said choices.  This is weird, since the core mechanics and fundamental rules and abilities are literally identical to Kingmaker, so cause for that rests entirely upon the scenarios the game puts the players in.  After discussing the game with other trusted friends who have progressed farther, I have been told that this is simply the way this game is made, and that ostensibly it gets better after I get farther than I had.  To me, this is the equivalent of saying, ""Look, the game forces you to suck dirty hobo cock for a while, but then it takes its hand off your neck and you get to only deep throat when you want to.""  The balancing of encounters and fights are seemingly balanced around statistical min/maxing as the bare minimum, and any real deviation from it will be ruthlessly crushed, Mythic feats and abilities be damned. A +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws and AC means fuck all when I am regularly rolling 16 under their spell checks, and an elimination of spell resistance is worthless when every enemy I have cast on saves against every spell my party casts as well, typically for minimum damage.  Healing is, within the scope of my experience, actively counterproductive to winning combats, as single units are regularly outputting in one turn more damage than I can expect to heal back in 4 whole rounds of focused healing, which takes away from possible damage sources, furthering the involuntary train being run on my party.  

Not that focusing exclusively on martial classes is any help either.  My main character is level 8 and has 31 fucking AC.  THIRTY ONE.  It might as well have none, since they have managed to be crit 5 times from 6 attacks over two turns in one round of combat.  Who gives a shit WHAT my AC is if it's all bypassed anyway and I get exploded before my next character can do anything to mitigate it?  I've lost 2 characters, as in they are DEAD, not Death's Door, fucking dead, need to be resurrected, in the unfun slog through Dredzen or whatever the hell that city's name is, because I can't back out to remove it at an encampment, and the two sets of supplies available to rest from don't remove it, even though it's a long rest removal mechanic.  Again, not that mitigation means anything with the spells and abilities I have access to, in the face of an overwhelmingly stacked lineup, because +2 against evil outsiders means fuck all when the saves are apparently starting 10 over my own party's baseline.

I'm sure there's some sort of optimized build, combining the right characters, in the right order, that's been tested out on a spreadsheet to ensure the greatest set of statistical variance from mean regression to ensure some sort of minimum performance that will allow me to survive until the game gets fun, but guess what?  That's not fun to me.  At that point I'd rather have no choices at all, than be given a breadth of options, 99% of which I cannot take or be subjected to statistically non-trivial hinderances otherwise.  It's like whoever designed map encounters actively hates TTRPGs and wants to drive off as many prospective players as they can.

None of this begins to tackle the continual series of bugs I keep running into in game.  I had a character cast Dispel Magic on an enemy caster, only for it to fail due to concealment granted by Blur, A FUCKING SPELL.  What circularly meaningless shit is this?!  Portrait healing and buffing is so bad that Wrath actually gaslit me into questioning if it was ever a mechanic at all in other games within this genre.  I had to install BG2 and test click healing on portraits, just to make sure I wasn't losing my mind or going prematurely senile.  It turns out it's just badly implemented, with healers walking up to the intended target and then just standing there, spells pre-loaded for next round, when their target will be unconscious and, since they're inevitably melee characters, I run the risk of misclicking and healing an enemy AGAIN, since it's a regular occurrance  due to poor cursor hit detection.  Also, who the hell decided what feats are recommended for character progression?  If a new player trusted those decisions (which I tried out on my 3rd reset of the game, just to see if I was being overly stupid or something), they'd hamstring themselves so badly that I imagine they'd give up even sooner than I did.

This whole series of issues STILL doesn't touch on the Crusade system.  Where kingdom management in Kingmaker was a blast, with plenty of choices, different paths to take regarding crises, and a relatively expansive set of options to grow the larger campaign world from, the Crusade is the exact opposite in nearly every way.  There is no strategy involved at the outset.  You simply camp in the capital until you can purchase the maximum allowable of the 3 (4 if you're lucky) kinds of units that can be deployed, find an army or two, or a single fortification, pit your 3 units against their 6-8, barely win or get crushed, then head back to the capital to hit Skip Day 6 or 7 times, and repeat the whole process over, and it's unskippable since you need to win certain fights to even progress.  Why put it in at all?  There's nothing fun about it.

Online forums recommend setting things to the easiest setting, or going on the Nexus and getting 7 or 8 addons to balance things out.  When the best options are either to ramp down the difficulty so much that you might as well be playing a visual novel game, or throwing a Skyrim's worth of addons just to make things bearable, it's indicative you did a shit job.  Wrath has not just made me not want to play another Owlcat game, but I have apprehension about exploring any game of similar vein again.  It's turned me off of a whole genre of games beyond the ones I've already played and can trust to not be this bad, again, in my opinion.

The whole sequence of events made me so irritable that I started snapping off to people near and dear to me from misdirected frustration, and I'm used to frustration in games.  This is the first time a game has made me so angry and frustrated that I inadvertently took it out on others.  Let me re-iterate: I found Wrath of the Righteous to be SO BAD AN EXPERIENCE, I TOOK IT OUT ON OTHER PEOPLE.  I have NEVER done that before.  Ever.

However, your mileage and experiences may vary.  On the plus side, the little bit of voice acting I experienced was top notch, the musical score was appropriately thematic and compelling, and the character portrait and design was excellent.

Let me paint you a picture; I'm early in the game, only at level 3 and I have just spent the last two and a half hours trying to complete an early battle in the game that just never ever ends. With no option to quicksave in battle, and no checkpoints of any kind in the fight that had no business being in the early section of a game I have now lost two and a half hours of precious free time for absolutely nothing. That is something I cannot forgive, not when the fault rests with an unending combat encounter that feels more like an end-game showdown than an early defensive skirmish. The already dull plot was already working against the game, which coupled with this awful design reduces what could have been a fine game to a boring slog. 


I’ve seen similar complaints on reddit, and I have seen that this game has defenders. Let me be perfectly clear; This is not a ""challenging game"", this is straight up terrible level design Let me elaborate, the mission in question is a defensive mission where you are tasked with defending a stronghold while enemies keep on pouring in. It very quickly gets frightfully dull as wave after wave slowly grind your resources down. Whenever I thought ""surely, that was the boss and now it's over"" something else would come along. This is an epic encounter that has absolutely no business being at the early stages of a videogame, if anything this is an endgame level encounter. Hour upon hour of tedious fighting, desperately hoping for the horrid slog to come to an end. When my party finally was wiped by a huge enemy that arrived in the middle of a battle (that I was otherwise finally winning) this feels nothing if not cheap. This is absolutely unacceptable level design, and this is a straight up a badly designed game. By the time the reality of what a god-awful game this was finally dawned upon me it was too late to get my steam refund, please do not make the same mistake I did. Don’t give this developer even a cent of your money.


What makes it sad is that the game really had the opportunity to be something special. The characters are fun, and the action is visceral and engaging. moving from room to room really captures that magical DnD feel. While the central plotline is boring waffle about demons and angels and whatnot, the moment-to-moment gameplay has a certain magical charm all too familiar to people who enjoy the CRPG games of old. it's only such a shame that the horrendous level design tanks what might otherwise have been an enjoyable game. 


The game also features way too much combat, and I kept waiting for the opening slog to be over so that I could explore the world, but alas this never game to be. For my odd twelve hours in the game, I was stuck in a boring old city fighting battle after battle against an unending horde of demons. Compared to games like Pillars of Eternity where the story moves along briskly and with plenty of varied content and necessary checkpoints this game just comes across as incompetent and frighteningly dull.


The tedium of a very boring story, far too much fighting and awful level design makes Pathfinder Wrath of the Righteous without a doubt one of the worst CRPGs I have ever played, which is granted not an exhaustive list, but it remains the absolute bottom of that barrel. The game strives to capture the feel of DnD but only manages to capture the essence of that one horrid game you played where the DM was a sadist who cared more about killing the party than providing a good time the players. Nobody misses that guy, and likewise should nobody miss this game.

Positives:
* Faithful adaption of Pathfinder rules.
* Epic story, makes sense to play it both as a goody and a baddy.
* Lots and lots of hours of content.
* Some well-written and interesting companions.
* Spoiled for choice of classes, prestige classes & archetypes.
* Cool mount system.

Some of the negatives though:
* The evil choices in dialogue are somewhat comical most of the time. There is no nuance in being evil.
* Could use some more companions.
* A LOT of filler encounters. The game could use less encounters and the core ones need to be better designed. Also most of the encounters are not designed with turn-based in mind.
* Some balancing issues. There are main bosses that can be breezed through while random encounters have some enemies that you can hit once per round with the entire party due to being over-buffed / ridiculously high AC.
* Graphics a bit too cartoony for the gravity of the story. Pillars of Eternity does it better on this aspect.
