I've also enjoyed Liftoff: Micro Drones, but I wish there was a little more focus on the point where the scale of both of these meet. As a primarily cinematic pilot, I mostly fly cinewhoops in the 2-3.5in range and this tends to focus on freestyle quads that are a little bigger and L:MD tends to focus on tinywhoops that are a little smaller. By the same token, Liftoff is by and large outdoors and L:MD is mostly indoors. It would be nice having a middle ground (even if it was a third iteration) where you could practice flying a small to medium sized whoop around a map like Bardwell's House but also fly through the house as well like San Lipo in L:MD.

First off in the tutorials after you do a step it asks you to do, it pauses you and shows a message. You then have to TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF THE CONTROLLER to click ""next"" then get your hands back where they were. Also after you mess up and reset you have to go through the dialog again. I couldn't believe it. It has a feel like no person actually tested the tutorial and they just sent it straight to the public. You also can't skip the scenes where it's showing you what to do which are really long and boring. Every time I want to practice I have to watch it all over again. If I go change a setting and come back.. yup I have to watch it all over again and again.
Parts of the tutorial are supposed to be simplified by giving you a straight ahead course and all you have to do is control throttle up and down. But you don't start out lined up straight with it! It's unbelievable! So you have to try to fix your angle to line up straight with the obstacles as you go. Which is hard for a beginner and the whole point was to not have to.
Also keep seeing a bug where when selecting my drone the stats don't show up. All the little bar graph thingies stay the same as I change selection.
The constant clipping glitches are infuriating. I keep getting stuck in walls and objects and have to restart. I get stuck to the ground all the time. The collision physics are downright awful. 
The difficulty ratings of the races are meaningless. Some tracks on ""hard"" levels I can go full throttle and finish with ease. Some tracks on ""easy"" levels are outrageously hard and I can't even finish them. It takes a lot of time and effort to find tracks that are in my skill range because of this.
I think all the hype is from people who already know how to fly and don't have to deal with the tutorial and major lack of low skill content. I can see how experienced pilots will like this but it's really not beginner friendly.

I spent the summer learning to fly a DJI Minipro 3 over the summer and had become reasonably skilled at flying it and taking videos.  I had no idea how steep the learning curve is for the FPV drones in acrobatic or acro mode.
I was able to fly the Cetus X inside my home fairly rapidly in the self leveling angle mode. This is the default mode for the Minipro 3, but using the acro mode on the Cetus X for me was impossible.
I bought this software to learn acro mode.  Most fortunately, it allows me to use the controller for the Cetus X.  Perhaps unfortunately, I haven't found a satisfactory equivalent for the Cetus X drone in the software, but that is a very minor matter.  Liftoff does have an equivalent for the Cetus X drone in one of its other products, but that is almost entirely limited to flying in very small places.  I found that flying in such a confined, hazard filled environment in acro mode was similarly impossible for me to make much progress.
This software has a wide variety of maps with wide open spaces and various skill levels that allows me to gradually develop my skills flying in acro mode without constantly crashing.  One HUGE asset is that Joshua Bardwell has a series of YouTube tutorials for the novice FPV pilot that uses the maps in this software: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SpuXqNakP2A&list=PLwoDb7WF6c8lCKhQOTy-Vb9LfW0VAIrTP&index=1&ab_channel=JoshuaBardwell 
Using this software, along with Joshua's excellent tutorials I am SLOWLY gaining some proficiency in flying acro mode.  I have used several of the other FPV drone software offered on Steam, but have found them unsatisfactory on their own.  This combination of software and video tutorials seems to have allowed me enough progress to keep practicing without giving up in total frustration.
In closing, some important points:  Flying drones in FPV acro mode is a complex motor skill for most people to learn.  FPV drones are expensive and easy to crash.  You would be foolish to attempt to fly one without some practice using software, such as Liftoff.  Unfortunately, the tutorials offered in most FPV software are inadequate.  I have found that using a combination of FPV software and video tutorials to be the best way to learn this skill.  Finally, think of learning this skill as similar to learning to play a musical instrument; it is going to take an enormous amount of practice, time, and patience to gain some proficiency.

Addendum
After nearly 75 hours of playing this ""game"" and devoting much study, both video and written, I would say I am still at the semi-klutz level of flying FPV in acro mode.  Some of the key things I've found is that to enjoy the game, you have to go very slow, master basic skills before moving on to more advanced, and learn to enjoy the practice.  FPV drones are beautifully complicated machines.  One of the authors I have read writes that it can easily take 1,000 hours of practice to gain mastery.  Keep that in mind when you are using this software.",1701526948,1707660097,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend every new drone pilot to spend at least 20/25h in this game. It might seem boring because you want to pilot your drone, I get it, but trust me, if you crash your drone first try and break it it wont be any fun at all and actually the game is very cool to learn to control the drone and try to break lap records so you wont be bored.

I did take like a year off from flying all together as it wasn't quite clicking with me, and I was worried I just don't have what it takes to be any good at it. I randomly decided to give it another shot and I'm progressing faster than I was before, though still perhaps more slowly than others with the same amount of hours in. Everyone learns at their own pace though so remember that if you find yourself getting frustrated. Take a break and come back.

Anyway, as far as Lift Off specifically goes, of all the sims I've seen it is the best balance of graphics, realism, and having solid courses to fly. DRL might be better in more ways except graphics, I haven't purchased it yet though. Tryp has the best graphics, but needs a lot of work in most other areas. VelociDrone ""feels"" the best to me but the graphics are a tad lacking and it randomly disappeared from my computer and refuses to come back. Basically if I cant get it on steam, I'm not getting it at all after that happened.

TLDR Great for getting the initial stick time necessary to be competent once youre flying IRL. IDK if its the most nitty gritty in terms of PIDS, rates, customizing stuff like that, but it's def got some of that for the more advanced pilots out there. Also you 100% should be using a drone/RC controller and not a game console control, though it is possible. They are fundamentally different and it's just not worth using a game pad.

I can't just skip all that text, demonstrations and it takes a lot of time before the real exercise and if you want to repeat the exercises quickly just by flying 8-loop or the first ""race"" or other simple steps after some pause - you'd not want to do it, because it'll take a hour just to listen to all that slow animated text that can't be skipped fast (or I didn't find it in the menu, so it's not so intuitive). And yeah, you can see that I spend 1.3 hour in last 2 weeks, that in reality is just today's evening and I just finished all lessons with 2 tries for each exercise. Frankly, when I tried it first time a month ago I hadn't been able to finish the lessons in one try. Had to make it in two days.

Worst of all though is the tracks. They are so poorly designed.  Nothing like real drone tracks.  Lines don't make sense and it feels way more like an obstacle course than a racetrack.

I am new in FPV and drone flying...
Pros:
Drone building - its fun to build your own drone or download already prebuild
Physics - i would say that the physics feel good, maybe little slidy
Graphic - you can crank this up or down depend on you pc
Setting - a lot of setting to adjust control and drone

Cons: 
Maps - Some maps are boring and there si nothing to do
Racing - HORIBLE!!!!!!!! - worst part of the game. (Some races has no gates and only marked areas. You cant see next area ahead, and the areas are also poorly visible. Just white arrow pointing on it. No bordering of the area.
That mean you have no idea where to fly in race (So struggling always from start to find place i should fly next.) Registration of the areas are so poorly marked that really often you miss the area thinking you fly directly through.) Often happening that after crash (In god mode) you get stuck under texture and has to restart the race.
Tutorial has extremly wierd rates and also extremly sensitive throttle. From beginer experience it was painful to get through tutorial (Funny, because tutorial should be the place where you actually feel comfortable to get in touch with the control for first time)
Textures - really often you crash and you get stuck under texture and has to restart. In races is specially painful. Mainly in tight spots.",1698498959,1698498959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

What can I say after 53 minutes... that's a refund. This game costs ~x4 more than another FPV sim I played. 
And all these points below are really worse. Both games have realistic drone control, so I had no issues with that. But for all other stuff...
Well,
1. Still no way to reset drone. You can reset only the whole race. I've found that a lot of players asked about ""drone reset"" feature singe 2017. And that's not implemented yet. Why?
2. ""Try to guess where is the next checkpoint"". Path suggestion is the worst I have ever seen.
- Small white donut is really hard to see on white-text interface. 
- cursed arrows to next checkpoint, but again, you will see them only after you passed the current checkpoint. 
- ... combined with only ""race reset"", that's the most annoying thing in this game. 
- No traces or any highlights from which angle you have to enter the checkpoint. Except there is someone ahead of you, in that case, you will see the color trace behind him.
3. And yeah, annoying ""press-next"" tutorial. Another game has MUCH immersive tutorial. This one - read-next-read-next-read-next-move 5 meters - read - next - read - next - another 5 meters behind - read - next... Aaaaagh!
I've started that just for fun, but even these 10 minutes made me sleepy.
Only two things this game has really better than another (and much cheaper) simulator: FPV interface looks pretty realistic and yeah, graphics. That's all I've seen in these 53 minutes.

....but it's fallen way behind and now it is one of the WORST.... in 2023.

I recommend Uncrashed FPV simulator instead.  

The load times of Uncrashed are BLAZINGLY FAST compared to Liftoff.  The unser interface is miles ahead of Liftoff and a pleasure to use and FAST.  Each has about as many maps as the other and they are pretty much comparable.  Liftoff has a very good flight model, however, Uncrashed allows you to use Actual rates which gives you just a bit more fine tuning ability allowing you to tune your rates so much further and better.

Some Problems with Liftoff...

 --Devs are their user interface is very hostile to visually impaired people.  A dark theme with larger text or just inverted color bottons would go a long way to fixing this and would be simple to implement....
--No Dark theme.  Bright ""Light theme"" with thin small lettering is hard and tedious to navigate, esp. on lower monitors resolution screens and/or witi goggles.
--Interface Tree structure is incredibly slow to load.
--Devs are hostile to constructive critsism and advice of simple changes they could make to improve their sim user experience.
--Devs are hostile to the FPV community and sharing your FPV sim videos in their community.  This is a game and a hobby after all, something you do for fun.  
--Too much fixation on adding what they call ""festivites"" to the game which are nice, but really add nothing to the game...  when the time and effort could be better invested in creating one more new map.
--Nothing in the way of 3rd party modding support for the generation of user created content maps.   You can do this in Velocidrone and A.I. Drone Simulator.

I actually went way out of my way to type up some recommended ideas and improvments free of charge for the devs to consider incorporating into Liftoff to improve it, but only was met by outright hostility.  

Basically, if they didn't come up with the idea or it wasn't ""invented here"", they don't want to here it.  Their game to them is absolutely perfect as it is, and anyone that says anything to the contrary is branded and enemy.  

As a former game developer myself I can understand this.. I mean, your creation and product is your ""baby"", and you think it's perfect in every way just how you wanted and designed it to be...     but at some point you got to grow up and say yeah, there's a few things we could add that would indeed make it better without really changing our original vision or requiring more work.   Like a Dark theme or higher contrast menus and buttons option to assist visually impaired people in navigating our menus.  It's not a big ask.

It's not like I didn't promote them for years and cross post video footage of THEIR GAME in other game threads and forums

It does it's best to guide you through but the level of challenge and skill curve is highly uneven at times. For example, the first environment and track has low, small gates and tight turns immediately and a couple of tracks later are much, much easier for beginners. The environments do have a skill level, but the tracks themselves vary and are random in difficulty.

There's not much to progressively increase your skills, to allow you to learn a manoeuvre gradually. It just sort of appears and you have to figure it out, or not (know how to power loop, sucker???). Some of the tracks and levels are just evil.

Too many drone options and customisation for beginners. What are all these propellers and motors (about 40 of each to choose from)? How can I make a drone I can just fly slowly to learn? There are pre-built 'blueprint' options, but again so, so many and not much idea what difference they will make. There's no, try this one first, then this when you need more speed and this for freestyle.

All the elements are there, they just seem to be randomly distributed without any player roadmap.

I'm using a Macbook Pro M2 MAX and can easily run ""fantastic"" with antialiasing, ambient occlusion, bloom, blur, and depth of field at 110-120 FPS. When I'm racing I usually untick some of the extras for a locked 120FPS.

The maps are entertaining but short and all about who can take the shortest line to the gate and who can stay closet to gate, tones of custom maps to drive you mad play this sim for way to long if you ask me:) and now time to move on to bigger things for me 
Draw back you cannot turn that chat box of you will have fun with that can't be turned off.... just how it is...
and you will get that little bit of lag every time people use  it just when you don't want them to. also when people jump in and out the room....
The biggest draw back I found out today that has pretty much put me off this sim . Yes people this sim is way to easy to hack  tried same basic hack on veloci and other sims does not work made me think that maybe this not too good....and I can tell you right now  i'm am no pro at that stuff....I can't even find the instantiation folder of this game on my pc when a fellow player shared a playback... 
dev's just say they monitor you and so on witch they do I have seen them on numerous times but but I only seen them remove one time in 2 years that was not possible on on map called con off. but some of those map have time travel lap times it's funny really:)

I ended up buying it solely because of that and regretted it. The only positives were the option to customize drones and the realism of the physics – in reality, the physics are close to real only cause of normal gravity compared to jelly in other sims. Everything else is just as bad, if not worse, than in the same DCL, which, unlike Liftoff, is optimally designed for all supported platforms. Customization is just pitiful, ranging from a complete lack of popular frames to outright absurdity. For example, a fully assembled 3-inch toothpick frame in Liftoff weighs (attention!) 1050g - 1 kilogram, seriously? And it's not a number glitch, as the some other bugged drones in the workshop all weigh in the same range, whether it's 10-inch machines or 3-inch microdrones, all around 1-1.2 kg with all the resulting issues, like the drone only taking off at 80% throttle. Furthermore, without workshop mods, the default track selection is terribly dull and monotonous.

UPD: I can share a screenshot of the 1.1-kilogram weight of the 3"" drone in personal messages or send it via email – it's amusing that the developer denies this.
I also have a video showcasing the worse game's performance compared to DCL on a top-tier setup (i9, MB Pro 16 2019, 32 GB RAM, Radeon 5500m 8GB), which I can also send via PM/email.

The physics feel pretty spot on for 5"" quads. Close enough that it translates to getting the coordination down for real life maneuvers. 

Couple things I'd like to see in the future are more maps with detailed areas for proxy flying. Most maps are pretty big and a bit sparse. It's really tailored around the bigger, faster quads.

as a training thing: 

the flight model is fairly accurate although i think it's a far too well tuned when compared to actual quads. it's a fantastic way to get a grasp on how acro mode works but doesn't really give much of a look into the more niche flight characteristics. like for instance, the prop wash that's in the game is substantially lower than anything i've felt on even my best tuned quads even when you've got the setting cranked to the max. there's no kind of weather simulation so you don't have any kind of drafts/wind/turbulence. real quads often feel a lot sloppier when you push them harder but every single build i've done in this game except for like the 2s battery setups feel buttery smooth like a well tuned cinewhoop or hex with low rates. there's no simulation of faults that you can experience like motor desync, over exerting the battery, or video issues.

now as a practice/fun thing: 

it's so damn fun. i love being able to fling quads at speeds through gaps that i'd never consider trying to hit in real life because i don't want to have to rebuild and replace parts is really enjoyable. slipstream adding vehicles to chase is worth every penny, it's hard to set up things like that in my experience so just being able to boot a game and practice is so great. not to mention it allows for a lot of practice of tricks before ever putting your quad at risk, i did inverse yaw spins and juicy flicks hundreds of times in game before i ever tried with my quads.

Giving it 4/5 is because damage system is somewhat flawed (or at least it feels like it)
Here is why:

Sometimes when you tap an object (building or something else) with the bottom of the drone (frame or battery), the props get damaged in the process. It feels that damage is completely random on hit. I feel like I should be able to tap or slide on the floor that is completely smooth without damaging props. And other times, drone gets pushed to one side and flip just by increasing throttle from the rest position during race. Even though there is nothing near by to cause that.

It has a different feel (some call it floaty) to how the quads fly, but it seems not unreal. Without god mode, it quickly breaks the quad and reduces it's flying capability or disables it alltogehter, which encourages safer flying than in velocidrone which is quite forgiving. The tracks are all bigger more high speed tracks, which are unreal to fly on in real life for most. In comparison Velocidrone has al lot of tracks for example from MultiGP which are used in real races and can be build by local clubs on restricted spaces.

I like it for the nice graphics. Occaionally I fly on the race tracks, but I also like to just freestyle on the nice maps. For a ""real"" racing experience I use Velocidrone. To date I don't know which physics model ist better :)

Really though, this is a great way to practice before your maiden flight. Don't do what I did and go all out with an expensive pre-built and crash it instantly. Most definitely not toys, and it takes actual skill to fly.

Lugis have become international arms dealers profiteering from war.

Mass banning and censorship ensues,

In regards to the Ukraine translation post, it enthusiastically details they are actually providing software solutions that provide training at a bunch of new ""schools"" that have apparently sprung up following the popularity and effectiveness of quads as munition delivery systems. 

An effort that is assisting murder of many thousands of people a month and seeks to involve the Liftoff community by extension in their antics.

What a turn of events, I never saw that coming when I started following Lugis software team's product. After talking to these guys a fair bit in their forums over the years, they seem really naive, even practically retarded at times. Not sure they even comprehend what they're doing, let alone involving themselves in.

Their bank account should be pretty fat now, maybe that should have been a clue. In any case I don't think they need your money anymore, so take it elsewhere.

When I first started playing, I was not very interested in trying the multiplayer game mode. However, once I tried it, I was amazed at how much better it made the experience. The multiplayer community is great, and its exiting to log on and find someone you recognize to fly with. Its great for beginners because you will be able to use the spectating option to view other players techniques, and for other players to spectate you and help you or give you advice on your flying. The workshop feature is another great aspect of the game. It allows you to customize and tune your drone with a variety of parts. In the flight controller tuning section, you can tune your rates and PIDs, and you can even swap between FC firmware options such as Betaflight, KISS, and a bunch of others which I forget. The workshop features many different frames. most of the options are 5 inch frames, however theres are like maybe two 6"" options, and two or three 3"" frames as well. You can change between batteries, most of which are 4s and 6s, as well as one 2s battery, like three 3s batteries, and one 5s battery. theres are tons of different motor options as well- Im not gonna get into that because there are so many, but chances are, your gonna find exactly the motor you are looking for. it even has the exact motors that are on the baby ape 3"" from darwin fpv (if you were wondering that for some odd reason). next is props, which there are also a lot of. sizes range from 2.5"" up to 6"". the other drone options which you can customize include: action camera(gopro hero 4, gopro session 5, and this one weird flat camera thing thats really light but looks ugly): fpv camera(there are a lot of options, but the only thing this changes is cosmetic appearance of drone, and the weight- ie. it doesnt effect the way your flight view looks at all): antena (I spelled that wrong, but i dont care so fight me. Also this does not change the way the drone flies; only weight and drone apperance): the last thing you can change is color of all the parts, except for motors, batteries, camera and antena, and the color of the carbon. Alrighty, I think that is just about everything. nevermind I lied- there is also a track builder option which gets the job done. I personally do not like it very much, and there are not as many options as I would like. However, this is not a disadvantage in my opinion, because of the 20 or so default maps, and the great steam comunity- there are a lot of great maps that people have put together (my favorite is the map from Frvp which is (I think) called something along the lines of ""fpv bando-nice"". anyway, there are a few other things that I left out of this, because of time (Ive already spent like 40 minutes on this review lol). I really hope this helped you decide if you want this sim or not. If there are any questions you have about this, leave a comment and Ill try to respond. also, I may or may not post a video about this game on my YT channel: BigJ FPV. if not sorry. anyway, I really love this game, and I made this review because If I can even get one more person to make the commitment to join the liftoff FPV community, than that would make me very happy. cheers!",1680212698,1680212698,True,16,1,0.685714304447174072,5,True,False,False

Drone customizability:
If you fly 3"" props, you'll have a lot less options than the 5"" community. I've only found one setup that feels right, and it's still twice as heavy as the real thing. For the 5"" drones, the options are nice. My suggestion -or more of a plea- is for the developers to include some generic parts that can be used to build approx. any drone. Or at least the ability to fudge the numbers on the real parts a bit to get closer. If nothing else please add more (small) batteries. 
++All that said, liftoff still has some of the best diversity. 

Races: 
My camera is at 45 degrees (sometimes I up it even more) and my throttle rarely sees less than 70%. At least anecdotally. I love the races for the speed and how forgiving they are, but if I want to practice real precision flying, I have a hard time finding it here. Compared to some other sims, the technical practice from liftoff is severely lacking. To compare, skydive's largest feature is about the size of liftoff's smallest. Occasions where you need to fly tighter than your camera can see are very rare.

For hardcore skills practice, I don't think this will be my go-to, even though the drone feel is much better than the alternatives. For some fun and practice that will translate into a real drone, I can't recommend it enough.

If you fly drones IRL and/or have a good controller for this game then this may be very enjoyable for you, but as someone with neither that just wanted to try seeing if I could get into it, it really didn't work.

Apart from this, one of the tutuorial video's was privated and the inability to make changes to the controls without quitting out of the current tutorial/level also felt like it was missing.

I purchased the Radiomaster TX12 Mk II and Liftoff sim. I have 14.9 hrs in it so far and I am really enjoying it. The first couple hours I felt like I might have wasted my money but that feeling quickly subsided shortly afterwards when things just sort of ""clicked"" between my brain and thumbs. LOL. I do NOT know how realistic the sim is to flying real drones, nor do I know how Liftoff compares to other drone sims. I searched on YT and took the majority of everyone else's opinion, which highly favored Liftoff. 

Observations:

The skill level on some racing maps labeled as Low, is a lie. One map, for example, is rated as Low. However, there are 3 tracks to choose to race on that map. The first is definitely a Low skill level but the others on that map are NOT low skill level. Just be aware of that.

The maps themselves are big enough to learn to fly and enjoy but bigger maps would be a plus. Also, there are height limits.

No documentation. Figure it out as you go.

Last drop to leave this app is ""restrictions"" design. It's infuriating! Instead adding cameras interference and give enough time to return, it gives about 2-3 seconds and resets you forcibly to start point. I'm not a fun of ""Mario"" games, I'm there to learn to fly instead of being bullied.

Besides of that, I didn't found how to enter my personal drone that I've built (but afraid to fly yet) characteristics and I didn't found even appropriate drone in suggested list. Probably, it can be unlocked after professional registration, but my goal is to learn then fly on real drone, not virtual multiplayer competitions that besides, required personal data.

Besides of that, tutorial videos is not working. A workaround - google it in browser/youtube by yourself.

Besides of that, I don't understand, is this real situation, when you have to push the throttle so hard after each very little deviation (and even without deviations)?

Physics and drone control feel very real. A bit easier to hover a drone in one spot in a game, than IRL, but pretty close. Tried different props and settings to get it closer, but IRL it is just not as simple even on a low rates. 
What is not realistic at all is crashing and trees. I have crashed my drone many many times in real life, not a single thing has broken, not even a prop.. But you just touch something in the game and the drone brakes.. God mode in this game is more realistic to be honest.. 
Now trees. You just touch a freaking branch with your drone in real life and in stays hanging there.. Every freaking time! It just spins itself into those branches. And they are hard to see! In a game nothing happens, just makes you props ""broken"" while in real life you could probably use those props to trim the tree itself.. 
1. Throttle physics a bit off, too soft in the game.
2. Crashing in the game does not make sense. Drones don't brake that easy, not even close.
3. Tree branches brake your props in the game. In a real life those branches are like drone catching webs. But they don't do any damage to the props usually. 
Other than that, the game is wonderful, highly recommend it.

Let's get something out of the way, this is a sim, not real life. Don't expect it to be exactly like real flying. Many variables are in play that will not give you a 1:1 experience. Perfection, however, should not be your metric for a sim. This is not a perfect tool, but it's still a very valuable one. Stick time is stick time, it's a good thing. Practice races, try to go faster, even if you're not a racer. You will improve overall and it'll be valuable for any type of flying. I've heard many complaints that the physics feel ""floaty"". Honestly, at first I felt the same but frankly, the more I played the sim, the less I felt that. I think I just didn't fully understand the physics of an FPV drone.

Don't waste time looking for the absolute perfect replication of life. It is a fantastic sim that will be a great tool if used right.

- I can fly a drone with a friend with my Radiomaster Zorro
-Large selection of maps and drones, and workshop content

What I dislike / would like to see added:

General Gameplay:
--------------------
- Assigning triggers or buttons on my controller to for ARM/FLIP/ACRO barely works. The whole menu in the game bugs out, and even when I can finally select my button and successfully save it in game, it doesn't even work. 
-Unable to change your controls while in a game

Multiplayer: 
- Friend's drones makes no noise. No bonk when you crash, no zip when they fly by.
-Max of 6 players for multiplayer lobbies
-Cant change drone while in multiplayer (must go to main menu)

I will continue to practice in this game until I can find a more polished multiplayer freestyle game for me and my friends. 
I would not recommend it, but at it's core, it does technically allow you to use your controller to fly in a sim.

- After a crash, I find it helps to restart the computer, to prevent additional crashes.

--------- --------- --------- -------- -----

How to use the previous version of Liftoff:
- Right click on Liftoff in your Steam library list
- Select Properties
- Go to the BETAS tab
- Select the ‘liftoff_1.x.yy’ branch from the drop-down and close the window
- The previous version of Liftoff should start downloading
--------- --------- --------- -------- 

- The many tracks and races make this a very enjoyable flying experience. The 3 lap races let me compete against my personal best times, which make for great replay value, and shows me when I am improving.

- To make learning easier, I initially set the rates to 0.25 and reduce the camera angle to 6 degrees. As I improve, I increase the camera angle to 12, 18 and 24 degrees.

- When beginning, I liked to fly the rugged ""Vortex 150 mini"" drone, and use a small 2C battery, which has the drone fly slower, because the thrust is reduced to 0.37 kg, down from 1.34 kg.
For me, it is funner and easier to use full throttle on a slow drone than partial throttle on a too powerful drone.  

- After I am comfortable with a track, I use a ""Vortex 150 mini"" drone with a more powerful engine or propellers, with a thrust of  0.53 kg.  

- I use an 8 channel USB simulator, model 0908A, in G3-G7 mode.  I bought it on Lazada online shopping for about $25 US.

- I use 2560x1440 at 120 hertz, on a Samsung Q70 55"" TV.  120 hertz makes the screen much smoother than 60 hertz.

- I have an AMD Radeon 5700 XT graphics card and an AMD 3700 cpu.

- I turn off ""Show game triggers"" and ""Show race guides"", to be able to see tracks better.

- I turn on ""Show joystick overlay in OSD"".

- For Ghost Mode, I use ""Full race ghost"".

Best Beginner Tracks:

- Autumn Fields ,Track 01 - Fly in a rectangle around a field, so easier than the ""Straw Bale"" track.

- Liftoff Arena, Track 04 - A simple figure 8. This is a great beginner track, to practice turning left and right.

- Hanger 26, Track 04 - A lazy figure 8, with 9 gates. Great for beginners.

I'd say learn to use your flight sticks in here at most, and move to a more accurate flight sim like Velocidrone.
i think if they fixed the physics and the optimization issues, they'd be solid. menus also need an overhaul.

my review now: What ever was the problem with liftoff back when i wrote my first review seems to be fixed now. to elaborate, in the older versions every time drone approaches an object game frames drop by a lot, this made practicing impossible. there was also a problem with quickly turning that would also lag the snot out of the game. 

right now i am getting above 500 frames and they remain high the whole time (same specs, highest settings) so good job game.

I really want to recommend the game because the tracks are better than all the other sims put together but I always end up ending a session annoyed and frustrated.

The physics are ... weird. I'm not really sure how to explain it. The throttle doesn't behave like other sims nor real quads (that I've tried). It's like they've mangled the input to better suit controllers and messed it up for real radios. I find it very hard to maintain a consistent height in Liftoff whereas I can do this without even thinking in DRL, Velocidrone and all IRL quads I've tried. TBH I haven't tried with a controller because I'm only playing the sims to practice while it's raining or dark out.

Then there is the performance consistency. No matter how far I lower the settings I get these weird frame drops or something. It's very jarring and almost always throws me off.

Main complaints: this simulator wont teach you anything about video signal quality, battery sag, or dealing with wind. The parts are limited and while there are some very fun maps to freestyle in, most aren't worth flying on unless youre practicing racing or sticking to a very small area
With that said, nothing beats getting to fly for 10+ minutes without any concern for your battery or having to go pick up your quad if you crash. It's a great way to get familiar with the controls of flying a quad (even with an xbox controller) and lets you practice tricks that youre not confident in doing IRL.

I bought a copy of ‘Liftoff’ some time back and, I have to say, it is really very good! 
Due to time constraints, however, I am only now just beginning to explore the program more thoroughly. 
I am looking to develop my drone flying skills mostly and ‘Liftoff’ is about perfect for this considering that the winter weather is often unsuitable for real-life flying in my location.
Also, the summer months can be a little uncomfortable for me here and so again this means more simulator time for me.
So, the main point for me is to become a better pilot but this program is also seriously fun to play, I really like the seemingly endless options for courses, drones and levels, just great!  In addition to this there are many options for me to try which I would never attempt in real flight. It is critical for me to be a safe pilot so there are many risky maneuvers in this simulator that are out of the question for me in real flight, flying at high speed close to parked vehicles for example, or fast low-level flight over water.
So, I would like say congratulations to the builders of ‘Liftoff’ and I will see you in the air.
Thanks guys,
David Barter

I'm very surprised on how accurate the simulator is compared to real life. I'm able to do the moves as I do in liftoff which accurately translates to real life, my fingers just do the move without thinking.  I did read comments in regards to liftoff being too floaty but I though it was pretty accurate. I was surprised on how much the drone really does float in the air in real life. 

I did find my drone to be a little more drifty than the ones I used in the sim but my drone isn't in liftoff anyway and I was able to quickly adapt. I could always tune one of the liftoff drone to be closer to mine.

Without liftoff I would have definitely have broken my quad by now several times over. This investment is worth every penny!

However it was on sale for ""Sim Fest"" so i decided to give it a try for my self. I actually like it a lot more then i was expecting. I have already put 8 hours on in in the couple days i have had it. At first i was confused with how the damage system worked, i would bump a couple of times, or brush some bushes, and next thing i know my quad is all over the place and can barely fly.  I had gotten so used to being able to bounce all over the place in other sims, but this sim completely changes you mentality. It make you fly much more cautiously at firs because of how easy it is to not be able to finish a race due to quad damage from the slightest of bumps. I think the infinate race is a unique game more, letting you just race as long as you want, with no brakes in between. I do however dislike the recharge and repair gates... they are almost never worth even attempting, as you are more likely to kill yourself trying to repair yourself. better off to just force a crash and be good ans new in a few seconds, rather then pend 20 seconds trying to repair yourself if you are lucky not to die from bumping into the repair station. Freestyle mode is where i hear most people spend their time. this is unique to liftoff too as it actually detects different tricks an gives you adds up points for all the tricks you do.  All in all in mot disapointed with liftoff. Dispite what i had heard... I'm actually quite liking it.

I started off bouncing off walls, trees, buildings, etc and what felt like a horrible, clunky control scheme/physics to realizing I just sucked butt and needed to warm up. This game has several different styles to play alongside a magnificent selection of drone customization options to choose from. I'm still terribly inconsistent in my racing, but from my initial startup to where I am now is miles ahead of where I thought I would be. I play with a Xbox controller and it's a little too sensitive for my liking, but I know if I got some joystick extensions it'd be more like having an actual RC controller. 

Being able to hit B to restart the races is extremely useful, I enjoy how quickly I can get back to racing after I f/up. If you're new [u]go to the settings and toggle god mode. It'll allow you to actually go through some races bouncing off of stuff and not having restart and get frustrated. (Looking at you, underground parking lot)[/u]

My critique so far for things I wish they would improve on is as follows:
- menu UI control with a controller. It's really janky and hardly works and I just have to resort to using a mouse to select things.
- maybe a joystick axis sensitivity meter/arc (not just a dead-zone section). I would really like to just manually turn down the sticks sensitivity's towards the different axis. 
- an option to toggle brightness on the checkpoint lines (I could also be missing this somewhere as well)

One of my favorite things about the singleplayer as well is that the drone NPC's don't just swamp you outta the gate. If you get faster times, they also fly faster times. It's nice because it keeps it competitive always.

Also, you are able to practice tricks and maneuvers without being afraid of crashing and needing to repair a drone. So if you are new to drone flying I recommend to check this game out.


You are able to use a drone transmitter as well as the DJI FPV controller which is much smoother. It is best to practice with a realistic transmitter than console controllers since it does not have the same feel at all.

The game is realistic, you find yourself being more confident when you pick up a real drone or make your own. Oh, which reminds me! There is a game option to customize your own drone. The types of Motors. Propellers, Camera, Antenna, etc. You can also download community made drones and race with the community online.

DRL is too floaty, and other sims I've played feel just about the same. Slap a large enough battery and cameras on your frame in Liftoff, and turn on prop wash and battery simulation. You'll get proper V-drop feelings, you'll feel the weight of your quad in your sticks, and overall, you'll get good training. 

I'm a huge fan of the infinite races. I highly recommend any new FPV pilots take the time to run the basic infinite race options on the haybale/farm map. It's the best way to really get comfortable with YAW and THROTTLE CONTROL! The two biggest things that I think cause trouble (crashes) for all new pilots. 

Other small details that really make Liftoff a good simulator: Camera noise / VTX signal simulation, fisheye effects, very realistic specs on all available parts (motors, frames, cameras, etc), ability to properly and easily map things like turtle mode/arm/disarm on your radio in-game, and very realistic prop/arm damage when enabled.",1643591549,1643591549,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After early Jan 2022 update to v1.4, the performance issue are gone. The game runs smooth and flawlessly on every track with an average of 100+ FPS using a Gtx 1070 on high settings. Now that it runs good, the physics feel good and realistic too. I have other sims too and Liftoff feels equally good. It appears to me that once you pass beginners stage, all sims have far more similarities and small differences. I am using a cheap Flysky radio with USB dongle and Liftoff detects it automatically.

After learning how to fly a drone thanks to this game, and later spending hundreds of hours trying to get better a it, I think i'm finally ready to give a fair review of Liftoff. I started without a very good understanding about drones, so i tried all the alternatives available in the PC drone sim market and found Liftoff to be the most convincing in terms of physics, graphics, UI, ease of use, features, maps, etc. I was not dissapointed at all, and started practicing... A lot. And a lot...

Where it shines the most is the community's involvement, people can share drones, configs, custom maps through the Workshop and it works great! BUT it's still a little bit on the limited side (you can't import external map files of any format, you can only place some props, basic shapes with basic textures on top of the base maps"". Don't get me wrong, the map creators are awesome and some people have managed to create wonderful maps anyway, so we can only dream about what they could do with better tools. A suggestion could be let players apply textures to the shapes (wood, metal, cement, plastic, windows, etc), create materials (stuff like simple water, lava, swamp), COLLECTABLES (there are many explorable maps). If that was possible i think the community would blow up in creativity and the game in popularity.

Personally i love the adition of ""unusual"" parts like the UFO one for example, that kind of customization is always welcomed and works wonders to motivate new players to play the game and old ones to keep flying (although i think the leveling system should totally reward points for free flight sessions (as they're the ones most people use to actually practice).",1631092269,1640108690,True,0,0,0.523809552192687988,2,True,False,False

Really this is not a BAD game, it's OK, but for the price and with how poorly optimized the game is I can't say that it is awesome. I wish you could change drones/full FC settings without having to literally reload the level that takes 1-2 min each time to load. I am new to the hobby but some of my custom builds in this game can fly in reverse or shake violently with throttle. Not sure if that is supposed to happen or a glitch tbh.

The GOOD: 
Physics, Camera, overall FPV ""experience"" feels a lot more realistic than DRL in many ways. My favorite feature is the realistic damage which I feel taught me a lot about trees coming from DRL. I don't want to put this game down entirely it has a lot of value for less than $20. 

Really cool game for the money, but the poor optimization and competitors make it possibly worth looking elsewhere.

This wouldn't be a huge issue if the level of support and configuration in game was literally anything more helpful than a locked out, blank config screen if the game isn't autodetecting your controller and a message that comes off as ""Don't even ask for help from us. Call the manufacturer.""

Some level of forcible manual configuration would be nice. I know I'm working with substandard options (BetaFPV xbox-shaped controller), but let me actually see what the game is looking at so I can troubleshoot would be amazing.

If I can get my controller to work again or consistently, I'd LOVE to recommend this game. The times the controller works, I find the in-game behaviors to be great and super adjustable for beginners, allowing you to get the ropes without the penalty of crashing.

This game is perfect if you are unable to fly your drone if you live in a city where you are unable to or because the weather is unsuitable for flying. Overall the best part of this game is that you can freely practice and experiment with new tricks without the risk of crashing your expensive drone and being forced to buy a new one or replace parts. This game is also very good for newcomers to the sport and is personally how I started and got into FPV flying. You can easily set up an Xbox1 controller and play freely before buying the real thing. This is overall a great simulator and very fun. The only downside is that the mapping tools are less than suitable. The mapping tools only give you a preset number of basic objects that you can use to make a map, which isn't bad if you are wanting to revamp one of the many premade maps and make your courses, but are terrible if you want to make a map from complete scratch. I wanted to make a map of Dust 2 from CSGO but was met with the unfortunate realization that I would not be able to due to the mapping restraints. Other than that there is nothing bad about this game whatsoever. 10/10 I would (and I have) recommended this game to people before they decide to buy a drone, and to people who just want to fly without leaving their house.

Only niggle is i have to adjust the rates on my radio most times i start the game and during as when the drone is sat ready to launch it moves around on its own, this needs sorting before you set off or you'll be fighting the kwad in the air for sure

I tried several settings, several workshop drones but same results. There is no air friction or drag, when you turn up the throttle there is no kick, when you release the throttle the drone does not fall, it just descends. When you try turning yaw and roll at the same time the drone continues in the same direction it was travelling. The drone behaves like it is in space. It just goes infinitely in direction it was set to. There is no drag, no air resistance it is absurd. I don't want to learn how to fly in space, I want to learn how to fly with my drone when I am unable to use it outside. This does not work as a simulator at all for that purpose and it is very unfortunate that Rotor Riot supports this game. I am instead learning how to fly in real world and get much better flight results than in this game.

The other thing about the beginner map, is the map itself, the ground anyways, the flat repeated lines makes it hard to focus on how close you are to the ground, with no relateable object on the ground to give a sense of scale, my eyes tend to focus on the horizon to keep leveled then seeing how close I am to the ground, some grass, leaves, sticks, a river, keep it flat but make it easier to see how close you are to the ground, the squares make it harder,

One of the big challenges is that the closeness of the standard mode 2 controls to a first-person shooter game is kind of a tease: you think your FPS-with-a-controller experience will see you through, but you've got re-learn things.

The main downside I can see with heavily leaning on a simulator for practice is that activities like races in the game arguably encourage a bit more recklessness than you'd want when flying hardware in the real world.

for beginners although paying for a compatible 4axis controlller will cost a little bit. to start in the hobby this is great just flying around and getting the idea and feel for the controls so your not going in blind flying a drone straight in to the ground with the repair cost with it.
the tutorials are useless being in a graphically empty area with a tiny flag to fly around does not help at all. for the newbies i would say get the game and a half decent controller and fly in one of the open area maps with some obstacles and just trail and error is best, while trying the multiple different drones available as this will give a good idea on how different weights and power respond, it will take time but just spending half hour a day flying around you will see improvements in a week.

Probably the best FPV sim on steam. It's not perfect, but the physics are pretty good. The graphics are better than most.

Update on my previous n depth review: :-)

After 20 or so hours on this sim and finally hitting that acro switch on my brand new DJI FPV I can well and truly confirm that the practice and basic skills learned in the sim do infact translate to flying in real life.

As a total newbie i bought the DJI FPV combo after watching some youtube vids and thought wow! that looks awesome, how do I get into that.

I very quickly realised that I had stepped into a whole new world of fanatical FPV hobbyists.

Right or wrong or wether you hate or love the DJI FPV drone Im stuck with it and need to learn how to fly the XXXXXXXX thing. I love normal and sport mode but have quickly outgrown it.

Also, quickly to add. I bought the drone with the premise I could practice on their drone exclusive sim. I quickly learned that it was only available on apple. wtf? lol.

Long story short. I found Liftoff on a youtube vid. I have a steam account and have been a massive FPS gamer for 15 years plus (not no much this last few)

I bought it and loved it from the getgo. So Soooo hard to get to grips with FPV controls (for me anyway) I want to be great straight away but learned quickly it was going to take time, patience and many hours to build that muscle memory.

That's all it is btw.. Building that muscle memory. Every hour spent makes movements on the controller happen quicker and without thinking about it so much.

Graphics are great. 
controller works great
customisation is awesome
tutorials are great

If you are like me and wanting to practice before crashing your expensive bit of kit then this is it.
Translation of the controls in this sim to real life flying are not 100% but are damn sure certain to give you the skills to keep your drone in the air and make some pretty cool moves. You will know right away that the in sim practice has been worthy of your time.

For fun or for practising before real life first flight then you will not be disappointed.

Awesome.

Love it!!!

Happy flying.

If you machine has power to spare this game eats itself. My RTX2080 gives roughly the same frame rate regardless of the resolution or graphics quality. The physics sim seems to almost threadlock / forkbomb itself any time you get near anything that isn't a cube.

Hangar is the only playable level as long as you stay in the original area and don't go anywhere near the crane on the dock. Any more interesting obstacles or even any level with ""landscape"" plays at 2fps unless you fly above the tree line! The radar station was unflyable on the laptop but i think that was GPU limited.

First I would love a more progressive approach to the game. At the moment (after 11 hours!) I am really struggling in completing the easiest races of the lowest levels. I would like to have few initial levels where you practice how to use sticks (maybe using only few of them at the beginning), like moving in a direction, doing one large turn, ... in a slightly competitive way, and then gradually increasing the difficulty of the tracks. The game at the moment makes me very nervous trying to go through those small gates.
Secondly I do not understand why, when I touch the ground (at any speed and direction), I bounce high. This is not realistic at all.

It really feels like you are flying in fpv. They even added static (that's effected by range) to make it feel realistic. I usually set the games resolution to 800 x 600. because that is my goggles/camera resolution. This game beats Aerofly a 100$ program. Aerofly is still fun with its various ships to fly, but if you want to learn acro quadcopters then this is the program for you!

Pros
*Great Graphics
*Fun Levels
*Great customization options to match real quads
*Level editor
*Realistic FOV
*When ever you Complete a lap. You can race/watch your last flight.
*Multiplayer!
*Steam Workshop Share able content

Cons
*Only quad copters are flyable in the game

Again Amazing game. I can't wait to see what the devs do to improve the game over time. I only have a few hours in the game, and i already learned a lot. i feal a lot more confident in my acro skills. can't wait to take these skill out on the field with my quad!

I think that would go even further toward making this feel more like FPV once you leave the simulator.  With that said, it took me only a few hours to get comfortable and probably a dozen or more to get adequate.  Flying in acro mode is tough, but it's what you want to do.  I enjoy the tuning aspect, but wish it was a little bit more like Velocidrone's implementation with a reproduction of BetaFlight.  Would be even cooler if you could simulate the other interfaces too.  With that said, the simulator does its job, and does it very well.  The challenge is the hardest part, but if there's high enough engagement that helps make it tolerable and get more people over the hurdle.

I also like maps of the Liftoff more. Maps are closer to what you will experience in a real life, they are not so dark and obscure, and they simply just make more sense in general. There is even a Joshua Bardwell's yard in this game, a nice trifle :).

Liftoff has an OSD similar to what you get through Betaflight, I appreciate the artificial horizon. There is even a battery voltage indicator. The rewind feature is a better idea than just a distracting reset button in DRL. There is also some damage model in this game. Your props get damaged based on the type of impact and the object you collide with - hitting an inflatable gate, flag or a wall has different effects in terms of drone's reaction and props damage, same with going through the tree-tops - I really like the developers thought about this.

Multiplayer offers ""Infinite race"" mode where you can join whenever you want and don't have to catch the short moment before the race. I like hanging around sometimes, improving my own times in multiplayer, having some real people around and maybe learn from them a little. I don't really have to compete with others, given my current skill level there is not much chance anyway :)). 

There are still things that could be improved. The tutorial section is there, but it's really basic and quite boring. Most importantly I would like to see some kind of campaign mode that would make use of the game's content that's already there. It would be nice if the player could be led through the available races from easier to more demanding ones and feel some progress without having to decide what to do next. Or maybe even something more advanced like starting with some cheap basic drone, racing and earning points for buying better ones, tuning them etc, I believe this would bring yet another entertaining dimension to the game :). 

All in all, I think the Liftoff is a good choice if you want to practice the FPV piloting skills without damaging your drone and If I'd have to choose this or DRL, I would definitely pick the Liftoff.

P.S.: I experienced no game-crashes. For me the game runs fluently without hiccups. It also works fine with my Radiomaster TX12 radio (although it is detected as the Taranis :).",1617825187,1617826320,True,4,0,0.572815537452697754,0,True,False,False

The first time around, I found Liftoff more difficult than flying in real life...but real life took my drone away from me. (A nice gust of wind, video transmission loss and a large forest swallowed it up.) I still loved flying, though, so I decided to give it another go. I wanted to be serious about it and put in a lot of sim time this go around. I have Liftoff, Velocidrone, DRL, FPV Air 2 and FPV Freerider. Of all of these, Liftoff keeps me coming back. Each sim has different things that I like more than the other, but Liftoff is where I really built my confidence. I think it may be the perfect sim if they integrated the workshop items into the game somehow, similar to using user-created quads in DRL. (I don't care much for going into the Steam Workshop and subbing to a quad/track/etc.) Other than that, I love this game. For beginners I suggest just going into free flight and flying around. Get used to the sticks, hovering, moving in a straight line. Then start to mix in long sweeping turns, getting them tighter and tighter with stick coordination. Eventually, you'll find that Liftoff isn't in fact that difficult. It's fun as hell. I'm 18 hours in (in the past two weeks) and I've just now started racing and hitting gates successfully. (I previously did nothing but freestyle, learning stuff like the split s.) If you're serious about flying, this is a great place to start. Just have patience. It will all come with time!

I really like the way the drones ""feel"", the mechanics and physics. The rewind option (when you crash you can quickly rewind the last few seconds) is a great idea, The OSD is simple but great and there are some really nice environments.

However - the game is definitely sub-par on the tech side. Runs only okay on my desktops (RTX 2070 Super / 1080Ti), with frames jumping like crazy. Rendering distance is a joke, even on max settings (vents on roofs pop up 50 m before you, trees look horrible until you're pretty much right in front of them). My Thinkpad Extreme Gen2 laptop makes this game into a stuttering experience that looks straight out of 2005. 

I could live with all this, if I had to - but to be honest, not if I can just go and buy DRL Sim for less than half the price and, though it needs some tuning to feel as snappy as Liftoff and lacks the OSD (why?), it has more and better looking tracks and just runs beautifully on any system I've tried. It also looks and runs better on my laptop than Liftoff does on the desktop. 

If Liftoff was better optimized I'd be down, as there's a lot of potential here. But it isn't and I'm afraid it won't get there. Until then, I'll play the better, cheaper and overall more polished alternative and hope for Liftoff 2.

If you have a strong gaming rig give it a try and compare for yourself. If not I'd recommend you just save your time and buy DRL Simulator instead.",1616434227,1616434227,False,3,0,0.481481492519378662,1,True,False,False

I've spend around 200 hrs in Liftoff before bulding my first real quad. When I first launched it, it just felt absolutely natural to me, thanks to Liftoff.
Even if the physics dont feel 100% real, you'll learn the controls and you will be able to do flips and powerloops with your real drone just like you used to do in the simulator.

So just take my advice:
Better spend the 20€ on Liftoff, and have fun starting this hobby, than buying expensive stuff which you'll crash 
immediately.

Not only for controlling the drone but building drones with different components, tuning the flight controller software etc. And the big bonus to using LiftOff? It will save you hundreds or thousands in damaged drones while you learn how to fly. Also if you are new to FPV it will teach you how to set up and connect your transmitter to LiftOff and then use the same transmitter for your real drone.

If you have flown (real) airplanes before as I have the drone is NOT an airplane. There is no such thing as a trimmed up hands off flying mode. Straight and level is not a thing etc. The drone is truly 3 dimensional in a hurry and LiftOff manages the inertia well and the HIGE/HOGE  events too. 

As a game only the price is good but the RC Transmitters are expensive. But there is a free flight training field, match races and I believe multiplayer races too although I am not that far.",1614907867,1614907867,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I cannot speak to the realism of this game when compared to real life flying, but so far it seems extremely touchy. Maybe drones in real life feel like a rabid squirrel on cocaine. I'm playing with an xbox controller, and it really doesn't feel like this game has been designed to work with it. Half the time the menus don't respond to my controller and I have to use the mouse. There is no place to just view what all the buttons our bound to or what anything is. This is definitely a experience that expects you to know what the difference between all the different flight modes is because it sure as heck doesn't tell you. The tutorial is a joke, its just a bunch of youtube videos. I didn't buy a game to watch youtube, make an in game tutorial. It would also be nice to know what the difference is between all the quads in some way. Is there one that is good for beginners? Who knows, because it doesn't give you any information on the drone selection screen.

Overall, if you have zero experience with a drone and are wondering what its' like, this at least for me was a great way to know that it's 100% not a good idea to just go buy a drone and try to learn how to fly with that. This game does not hold your hand in any way, which is a shame because I think it's a really good tool for people who are thinking about getting a drone. It could have easily shown me what's going on, how do get some basic understanding of how to fly, etc but it doesn't.

All of that said, im not ready to give up on it. Once you manage to get the drone to fly around a bit and you make a few turns, it's pretty damn fun. I am going to keep at it, try to get more practice in this and eventually I'll buy a tiny whoop or something cheap and small to mess with.

I'd still recommend if you have a interest in drones. I just hope they improve the first time experience and help make the learning curve a little less steep.

Update 1:
Almost 7hrs of gameplay now and starting to get the hang of things. Have completed a few races around the very first track. Starting to get the feel for how to control my turns / speed / height. I think there needs to be some more structure put into a beginner experience, but if you just stick with it it clicks after a while. Definately a must have for people with zero flight experience. I'm looking forward to getting my first micro quad (Inductrix FPV Plus) in a few weeks. Hopefully the effort put into this will translate. Will update once I get some real-world flight time under my belt.

Update 2:
Well, I've come back to this game after having got a quad in real life and learned to fly it. Able to fly in arco mode now and even win some races. Overall, this is a decent training tool and it did convince me to get my first quad so that is great. You're able to learn how to fly, by crashing over and over, without ever damaging your real life quad. It doesn't feel like a real quad, but its close enough to just get time on the sticks in the off season. Funny enough, you still can't just use the controller to navigate the menus and need to use a mouse half the time. There is still VERY little explained in the game and overall really doesn't make it easier for new pilots to learn the ropes. Its sad to see many of my complaints from YEARS ago still not fixed / addressed even with semi regular updates. Nothing compares to real world FPV flight, but this is good enough and fun to run laps in during the winter. Gonna try some other drones sims and see what ones feel best now I think.",1511407396,1610427845,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

Pros:
- Feels quite realistic in terms of how it flies (not 100% spot on, but close enough)
- Great for developing muscle memory and practicing manovers
- Lots of tracks, and can be expanded by steam workshop (improvement: entire maps from workshop + a map editor or SDK to allow conversion of any maps (from other games for example))
- Controller setup was easy
- In-game HUD almost corresponds to what I see in my FPV headset
- The game looks great (improvement: could be more realistic (hay balls don't reflect nearly as much light, the entire environment is static etc))
- Decent training scenarios
- Can build your own tracks
- Decent looking graphics

Cons:
- Even at fantastic graphics setting, objects tend to pop in and out of view (disturbing specially on the Hannover map, where flying in the park, benches, poles etc just pop into view)
- Exclusive fullscreen option is now there, but it doesn't work on vulkan (didn't try the other, windows and outlook notifications are still quite disturbing)
- Ground still feels like you're on ice
- Camera noise feature is still very unrealistic
- Adjusting camera angle in-game is painful, I have a lot of analog inputs, it would be nice if the camera angle would adjust slower when I move the slider less
- Main menu is awkward to navigate with mouse/keyboard",1500893227,1610219167,True,8,0,0.622810959815979004,4,True,False,False

It's best to get the first few hundred crashes done in a simulator instead of breaking components that cost a lot of money. For $20 you're probably saving hundreds of dollars that would have been spent in drone parts. I flew in liftoff for probably around 15 hours before flying a real drone (which was a small whoop drone, a mobula 7), and I was actually able to have some real fun with it out of the box without a crazy number of crashes. I still come back to the sim to practice new tricks that I’m too scared to try on a real quad, or practice racing skills.

If you’re going to play this game you NEED a radio transmitter for a decent experience. If you try to fly with a video game controller you’re in for a bad time. You can get the betaFPV controller for $40 which I hear is a good budget choice.

People argue about which simulator is best, but it's important to keep in mind that no simulator will ever feel exactly like real life, most FPV simulators to me feel ""floaty"", it’s hard to explain but it almost feels like the quad doesn't have as much weight and momentum as in real life. If you’re just starting out, this doesn’t matter at all, and just learning how the sticks control the quad is by far the most important part. Get whichever one has the most features, and I think liftoff has plenty and nice selection of quads and maps.

Flying (in acro, which is what you should learn to fly) is extremely hard by the way, and you should really be using Youtube to help you understand how to fly. Don’t be discouraged at the start, because you will be continually crashing and it takes a while to learn, but don’t worry you will improve quickly.",1607025430,1607025430,True,13,1,0.693023264408111572,0,True,False,False

There are two specific reasons for this:

First, map selection. The available maps cover a wide range of different terrains and especially the large outdoor maps like ""Green"" and ""Hannover"" are great for learning new freestyle moves. This is helped by the fact that the graphics are quite good in general and especially the rendering of trees and foliage works well for me to match what I'm seeing in the goggles when out flying in real life.

Second, although none of the sims I've tried so far provides the ability to really customize every detail of a custom quad build, Liftoff definitely offers the widest range of options that actually have a noticeable effect on flying behavior. I had a lot of fun testing out different combinations of motors and props. This is only hampered by the fact that switching between the workbench and the test flight is rather clunky user experience wise and even though loading times have improved over the last year, it still takes too long to switch between screens.

At this point it should be clear enough that I am not really a racer - although Liftoff offers a handfull of race tracks on each map and supports online races, the overall selection is propably too small for hardcore racers. Also the track editor is incredibly finnicky and tedious to use in my (admittedly limited) experience with it. Someone looking to train for serious drone racing would probably be better served with Velocidrone's plethora of MultiGP tracks or DRL's tight, technical 3D tracks.

For me though the point of a sim is to practice general muscle memory, improve throttle control and have fun learning new tricks. It doesn't have to be perfectly accurate in simulating flight dynamics (IMO none of them is) but rather reveal mistakes in my flying and keep them from becoming too costly by having to learn from them in real life - basically good enough to get me 80% there. Having said that, the physics simulation in Liftoff actually feels pretty good to me. It does a decent job of matching what I experience out in the field, and I found that if I can pull off a move in Liftoff then I will 90% also be able to do it IRL - which, for me, is exactly the point of practicing in a sim.",1575136976,1606469627,True,10,0,0.659325540065765381,0,True,False,False

I've been toying around with Liftoff since the early days, and I recognized it for what it was: a decent simulator that can help can help familiarize and practice drone piloting skills. However, it wasn't without its faults, and never felt real - a general ""floatiness"" in the physics made hang time and other aerial maneuvers a little odd. 

Graphics were decent enough, and had been improved upon over the years. After several years, they've updated the graphics again. I'm not sure I could list everything that has been improved, but the game went from looking ""ok"" to ""outstanding"". Environments are detailed and immersive. What else could you ask for in a sim?

Haven't picked it up in several months, and decided to give the major update a try. I am floored - this changes everything. The physics feel real, the drones now have a weight that is similar to FPV IRL. I have raced and free-styled with a pretty powerful setup, and run something similar in Liftoff. I am flying on a Taranis X9D Plus with the FrSky USB receiver in both cases. The similarity in feel between Liftoff and real physics is astonishing.

I've left Liftoff alone for a while, and apparently 2 massive updates have been rolled out and, it seems WAY better now, I honestly think the developers did a great work here. I will leave the previous review down below, but I have to admit the following changes:
- Load time has dramatically decreased, now it is way more acceptable.
- Realism, YES, I don't know if they did some work here, but I find liftoff a lot more realistic now.. or I'm just getting worse.. who knows :D
- Maps: New maps! Also, well.. yeah I've just realised I can import new community maps.

So, all in all, I feel I can recommend this game now. Well done!

OLD REVIEW:
While this game has some potential, it offer way less then the only other FPV sim I've tried (DRL) for much more money. First and foremost, I was complaining about the loading time in DRL. Here we go, this takes the same time DRL was taking to load the menu every single time you load a map. I mean, in this game even the settings screen is taking ages to load. The simulation is way less real than the other, on liftoff I felt like a pro, I was able to do things I could never do that easily on DRL. What I've found most annoying is the complete lack of proper freestyle maps, or at least not some map not small or flat. Most maps are like that, either too small (paris is ridiculous) or flat (almost any other except Hannover and another full of building). Who cares about Bardwell's backyard (sorry Joshua, your videos are the most useful on YT but your backyard isn't exactly an ""interesting map"").. Maps here are clearly for racing ONLY, interesting only if you put some obstacles.. Sure, title says ""FPV drone racing"", but why adding freestyle into the game if almost no map is good for freestyle? No hidden locations as well, the emptiness. What else.. Controller settings are way less customizable than on DRL, AND most of the settings requires you to go back to the main menu. ohhh, and the night mod! 4 pounds to have the sky.. dark. I was thinking it would bring more stuff. Nope. Dark sky. And some light apparently. 

Now, let's list some positive point:
1) It has 3D flight mode
2) It has the arm switch, of which use is important to practice (but you cannot disarm.. most of the keys are like that, you can set the ""on"", not the ""off"", since we all have switches on our radios an ""off"" mode would be just logic).
3) There are many common drones available, I even found a mobula7.
I think that is all. I never asked for a refund on steam so I don't even know if that's even a thing, but I'm so close to check now. The only reason for me to keep it, is the 3D mode, which is not available on other sims.

Developers, if you're reading this, please:
- Add some more freestlye map, with buildings or any other construction allowing to practice some trick.
- Add the OFF state for at least some proper switch binding (on, neutral, off), the arm switch without a disarm is useless, I've set the turtle mode as off, but it is not the same thing.
- Add bindings to 3D mode directly. It would be useful to change style with a switch without having to cycle through all the modes.

And again..

Night mode sold at 4 bucks is ridiculous.

----

I read a lot before purchasing Liftoff as my first quad sim. Back then, Steele had just released a yt video saying he felt Velocidrone had the best flight characteristics. Still, I thought it looked rough in comparison, so I went with Liftoff. No regrets. As a very new quad pilot, it was a great tool for getting a feel for shooting gaps and taking risks.

As I became more experienced with real quads, I came to understand what people were saying about floatiness in sims. I eventually bought Velocidrone to compare and yeah, the physics feel more realistic out of the box, but it still looks rough. I prefer Liftoff's simulated video static that changes a little with range and obstacles and the prop damage effect adds a risk element that isn't too intrusive. I wanted to improve so I could keep flying uninterrupted and it worked for me. 

Liftoff has a somewhat clunky, but pretty interface. You get to 'build' quads by throwing parts at real world frames and heck, you want a little more weight? Use a 6S battery and throw an action cam on the front. They make a noticeable difference in game. 

My first ever build was an original Skyeliner. I followed JB on yt and I wasn't too knowledgeable about the fallout over RR. Liftoff pushed all the exciting buttons for me as a fresh fan of the hobby; brands I recognised and wanted, my own quad in digital format and JB's house announced as an upcoming track. 

As an aside, just this weekend past, I rebuilt my Skyeliner and managed to reach a new height with the tune using UAVTech's 2 pack method. Propwash eliminated and even in the gustiest conditions, it feels locked in. Suddenly, Liftoff's previously more unrealistic seeming flight characteristics feel a little more realistic.

Anyway, don't hesitate to grab Liftoff if you're a beginner. It's pretty to look at and you get to crash without risk to your own gear. If anything, it'll help you reach a level you mightn't otherwise get to without a lot of time (and cash) spent picking parts, building, tuning, wrecking and rebuilding.",1604881547,1604886282,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this fpv sim so much, that I went right back in and RE- purchased it, now that I know I fixed the sound issue.

I've flown cinema drones (namely DJI) for a while, but never ventured into FPV until recently. With the DJI solely using level mode, FPV seemed like it was unattainable. I thought acro (rate) mode was impossible and I couldn't fathom how racers or freestylers could get remotely that level of control. 

I played the first 4 hours of the sim with an xbox controller, waiting for my transmitter to get delivered. The sensitivity was insane, and since the joysticks center automatically, it involved a lot of fighting the throttle to stay lower. Ironically, I think this actually helped. I just did the last 2 hours using my new Taranis X Q7 and was immediately 10x better, I assume as a result of experiencing the sensitivity of the xbox controller for the first few hours. Took my quad IRL out, switched on acro mode for the first time, and had no issues at all.

When you build a fast drone it goes totally crazy for a minute after you touch the throttle, there was a trick in the flight controller settings to not have this throttle bug with high performance drones but i forgot what it was. i don't believe it works this way with real drones and even if, this shouldn't be in a game.

Liftoff was my first simulator, that I got a few years back when first getting into quads. It was a great start back then but I ended up favoring DRL for the bigger maps and competitive online aspects. Then I began favoring velocidrone because you could put vehicles in there to track. All three still had ""moon gravity"" meaning it felt floatier than an actual quad. Hang time would be literal seconds longer than in real life. All that has changed with liftoff's most recent physics update. They changed their whole engine and the driftiness, floatiness, drop, thrust... it's all amazing. It feels like flying a real quad.

Okay.... I'm incompetent...I can now recommend this sim after and only after you make some adjustments to it. Please see below.

I previously gave this game a down vote, not recommended. I'm changing that now.

My previous review of this sim was done without proper setup of the sim. Transmitter wasn't calibrated to remove jitters, the quad selected wasn't near what I fly 

and the FC was not at all adjusted from stock....if you don't do this you won't like it.

Special note: for the love of life please adjust your FC settings. 

Hit the escape key, head into FC settings and if you do nothing else increase the ""I"" gain on all three parameters by ten points and keep adding 10 till your quad feels too stiff, 

then, 

bring it down by 5 points each time until it feels just right for you.
 
Warning**** 

Lf you leave the FC on stock settings the quad will feel like it's drifting, especially in turns. 

It's gonna be a B!tc# to fly and yeah it's not a good time.

NOTE***** 

You really aught to take care of those issues I've mentioned otherwise your experience with this sim will be less than satisfactory.

(OLD Review Below.... I'm only leaving this here for posterity)

The main few problems:
- Once you reach level 10 or above the reward chest contents are just props with shitty patterns. We need frames, cameras, antennas.
- Still when you crash into a haystack it sucks you in to its side, same with walls. While maybe in real life this can happen, rarely ever, here it's constant and it's annoying to wait or reset manually.
- It's hard to disable arming, for some reason now I have to press a button every flight, previously it started with just the countdown.
- More mainstream products available would be awesome, sponsored or not we can pay for them. I'm willing to pay a dollar for a Reverb frame, or a dollar for Runcam Phoenix 2, etc

 This aint first sim i have tried, but its one of most reasonable sims i have played yet. It has many settings to toggle to your liking. You can choose between preset drones, that fly differently, or build your own (i would suggest building your own, as closely resembling your own as possible). Although it took some time to find a good drone for beginner, since most drones are set up for pros, with high speeds, and very sharp turns. You just want to get comfortable with controls on not very fast and agile drone, then build up your skill with faster ones.
 Potentially this sim has saved me some crash times, since i learned to fly on it. For the first time i did nothing but crash, untill i got used to controls. Gotta say, controls are not very comfortable on radio transmiters, but this sim helps you get used to it, therefore most likely you will be more comfortable when taking off with a drone for the very first time.
 I have yet to receive parts for my drone, and try my sim skills in real life, to deteremine whether this sim is good or not, but while im waiting, its good to be able to build up my skills with simple turns and tricks.",1594282958,1594282958,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DEVS: If you want to avoid reviews like this in the future, get someone who has never flown a drone, give them your software and an XBox controller, and tell them to fly (using the tutorials if they want - I did!). Don't say anything else to them, just watch the disaster of them trying to use your software.

While waiting for radio to ship, I tried practicing with XBox controller. The game is unplayable because the controls are so sensitive. I spent half an hour reading online posts and trying different solutions to make it work, but nothing worked. In modern times, how can they not have a preset for XBox controllers to make it playable so that a beginner can learn the basic controls before getting a real radio? Even worse, the menu you need in order to tweak the control sensitivity is REMOVED from the tutorials. So, you need to start the tutorial mission, then back out to free play to try to do the suggested exercises so that you have access to the flight control menu that lets you mess with rates. If you are a beginner, get some other software and start with your XBox controller. Once that makes sense, pick up a radio and use it with that other software that you're used to.

-Fly with your Radio to Practice.
-Amazing Graphics
-Excellent physics and tuning dynamics
-Great Multiplayer experience with a great player base
-Multiplayer custom maps from the workshop are Incredible! And its always growing.
-Good amount of custom parts to build your perfect Quad (Until you unlock them anyway).

The bad:
-No single player carreer or Championship mode.
-Horrible experience system that locks you out of the custom parts.
-No real music and Quad sounds could get an upgrade.

I really like Liftoff and now more than ever with the COVID-19 Pandemic it has become my number 1 sim to practice while in home. This is by far the best practice tool you will have to hone your skills and have a good time with fellow pilots.

DRL was my favourite  simulator until I purchased Liftoff. Whilst DRL is a terrific simulator, I feel Liftoff steps it up to the next level and has dramatically improved my piloting already. It has a sense of reality perhaps more so than DRL. The freedom & ability to download any number of community based drones has pushed my skills continually as these are faster & more nimble than any factory set drone. I really enjoy being able to add new tracks and fly new drones every day and there are drones & tracks for all skill levels. 

I would rate Liftoff as the Number 1 FPV Drone Simulator on the market and whether you're a skilled FPV pilot or just beginning, I recommend Liftoff and give it 10/10.

so did that and as the radioset took afew weeks to deliver, thought id just try it with a 360 controller.
and it worked perfectly, so much that when radioset did arrive it only took minutes to get used to it.
i dont know how realistic it is compared to the real thing? but its still a ton of fun and super rewarding to learn how to control a drone. 
it took me about 10hrs for controlling drone to be totally intuitive, switched from 360 controller to radioset after 8hrs flying.
got about 50hrs so far and still loads of fun, isnt perfect though...
the fps really jumps up and down and stutters, even if you try and lock it to a low fps like so its somewhat like youd see from a real drone doesnt fix issues. 
has loads of visual customised parts to unlock as you progress, but all drone parts are available use and make your own custom drones which is fun.
can also make custom tracks on all the maps and share them. 
also theres multiplayer lobbies with races, time trials and free play.

It seems that the developers did not intend Liftoff to be a simulator of all things RC.  For that you have Realflight and AccuRC2.  Instead it focuses with razer sharp clarity on drone racing, and uses some superb physics and good graphics on the area of drones only.  No helos, no internal combustion engines, just pure 'through-the-goggles' drone racing.

Its a niche within a niche, but it does it brilliantly.  It has physics that equal that of AccuRC2 (a superb all-round RC simulator), but with far better graphics and genuinely compelling gameplay.  Too many RC sims fail to offer a compelling experience, but Liftoff works on the level of a simulator and is a cracking game in its own right.  RC sim developers take note - this is how it should be done.

You will need a proper controller to get the best out of it.  I would recommend the Interlink controllers that come with Realflight as they are easy to setup and USB controlled.  I'm no expert on controllers and I'm sure there are many options, but don't use a standard game controller as their mechanisms  are not suited for this kind of sim.

I haven't raced drones, but I have flown them and I have spent a lot of time flying RC helicopters.  Its very difficult to get the feel of RC flying right.  The way RC machines slip through the air and squirm rather than settle down, even with onboard computer control, is the reason why they are so hard to master.  Liftoff nails the feeling of a squirming, agile, nimble high-speed flyer.  Best of all, its gets the 'heft' of it right.  I can't explain it - its a feeling.  

Physics for this sort of thing is very hard to do.  Liftoff gets it right.  By contrast, the awful DCL (a bigger budget drone racer) gets the feel so wrong its shocking.

You just know when a sim is right.  And this is right.

So what are you waiting for?  If you love RC flying, or want to experience what it really feels like, then buy it.  Buy it right now.  A sim this good deserves our support.  You won't regret it.",1587377492,1587377492,True,3,0,0.540740728378295898,0,True,False,False

1. Investigate the market for the drone you want (don't buy yet)
2. Buy the remote controller you want, which fits the drone
3. Buy LiftOff and practice with your controller
4. When comfortable with controlling the a drone in the SIM, go and buy one in the real world.

The transmitter connectivity is great as I was able to practice on my actual transmitter and get accustomed to the layout and feel of it before the real thing. Since flying my actual drone, I can say that the mechanics, movement and feel of the simulator are fairly accurate to real-world flying (without the massive fear of crashing of course).

Personally i'm using it as a way to get very proficent before I do the real thing. As a heads up, you CAN USE console controllers with this. You don't need a ""Transmitter"", and lord have mercy on your soul if you attempt to fly with a keyboard. You CAN ALSO PLAY IT with a computer with specs LESS THAN the minimum recommended.

Only a handful of courses and maps, honestly for the $15 or $25 price tag they should have a minimum of 10 courses to fly. I think there is like 6.... Two of which are terrible to fly, especially for new flyers who 90% of this game is made for... 

The sounds as in all quad training games is terrible. But the physics are pretty good at least. I do also like the support of the steam community quad builds. Not sure why changing motor and camera colors are blocked by a ""Premium"" mode. Also why some cameras and frames are grayed out and not accessible at all. 

Conclusion: Would I recommend this game? No, not for $25... $10 sure but still boarderline not worth it even for that price. Once they optimize the game to run better, add more curses and make this an overall game its worth the $10 or $15... Till then no not even close. I actually prefer Velocidrone as far as optimization, but this game has better controls, physics and quad avability. But the fact Velocidrone is only $5 and runs 100x better its much better to learn on.",1581971660,1581971660,False,1,0,0.464559942483901978,0,True,False,False

From a simulator perspective you can definitely achieve to build a quad which flys similar to your real quad, but if you want to compete with the laptimes of the faster players you will likely end up with the fastest possible quad and camera angles of up to 70 degrees, which doesn't feel that realistic.

First off, you'll need a [b]controller[/b]. I started with an XBox One controller and that's [i]just fine[/i].
Within less than a week, though, I connected a real transmitter/controller (by connecting my TinyHawk 2 drone, enabling HID mode for it and then using the real transmitter/controller as input for the game).

It's somewhat easier/different to play with a real controller than an XBox one, but as a beginner: that doesn't really matter. With the XBox One controller, you'll learn how to use both thumb sticks effectively. Once you know that, you'll probably map these skills to real life flying with little effort.

There are quite a few [b]levels[/b] in the game, which have various flying mode including free flight, various race tracks to practice, or running the same tracks in an actual race both single and multiplayer (I haven't played multiplayer so far). The only downside is that levels are mostly static: almost nothing in it moves.

The [b]workbench[/b] (drone editor) is very easy to use: you can chose some of the basic components that affect your flight. Components that wouldn't fit your build (e.g. propeller too big for the frame/motor)  are automatically disabled for you. The only thing I'm missing is more options for micro-sized drones (more frames, more props, more engines).

If I could [b]request features[/b], it would be:
- Even more levels; or making some of the existing ones bigger, like the city block.
- More dynamic levels (e.g. moving trees/grass)
- More options for creating custom micro-sized drones (or have some popular real-life micro-sized drones in the game!)

If you are into drones or want to buy one I would recommend buying this game first, It is a very realistic drone simulator. Flying a drone is damn hard and this will save you a ton on repairs. It can also help you understand advanced tricks without bringing you, your environment or your drone in danger. You can fine tune your build and your Flight controller to make it fly exactly as your own drone, It will help you build up confidence and some precious flight hours, day and night, weather or no weather and without changing the battery every 10 minutes.

The Customization is very good The game uses a mixture of real and fake brands, Aside from your ESCs, Flight Controller and Video TX you can exchange all parts. Not all parts have real brands on them, But all parts are based on real brand stuff, You can see the resemblance but the names are changed. The frames are mostly real frames, You can change the frames,, The motors, the battery, the antenna, the props, the fpv camera, you can even add a gopro if you like that, You can also add additional ghost weight to make it fall more.

[h1]Gamemodes [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
The game offers a bunch of gamemodes You can do Races on tracks in the maps, You can free flight and just fly around, You can do freestyle for doing tricks. Online Multiplayer is also pretty cool, You can race, free roam, or race against ghosts of the best pilots in the world. The game also has a built in level editor, You can place props in any map, add checkpoints and you have built yourself a track, You can then go on to race on it against your friends. The game offers leaderboards and a lot of options to tweak.

[h1]Gameplay [b]10/10[/b][/h1]
I have played a lot of drone simulators, But Liftoff is by far the best one, It is mostly flying around or customizing your drone. The game tracks your movement and displays tricks if you perform them, The recognition system for this is not perfect. The controls are spot on, It truly feels just like my real drone. In free flight you have to make your own objectives think I am going to do that and then try to perform it, It does not challenge you, you can always just reset your drone. Racing on the other hand is very tense, Some tracks have pretty insane corners, small gaps and high speeds. And all this while it is even hard to keep the drone in the air. It is a great experience if you are looking for a game to start or a game to get better.

[h1]Aesthetics [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
The game looks amazing, Especially the drones, You can get real close up and see many details like the screws, carbon fiber texture. The scenery is a bit less realistic but nothing to complain about. The character models are not great, But you rarely see them when roaming the levels. The Soundtrack is very Dubsteppy, But it is nice, Overall the game looks nice, and it has a great variety of levels and decors.

[h1]Performance [b]8/10[/b][/h1]
Liftoff works flawless with my transmitter, It is a Taranis X9D+ No drivers or any tweaking needed, it just works. The game runs very smooth, It could always run better, but I had no crashes. I had no stutters or anything that would impact my flight, But some levels might feel smoother when you lower the graphics a bit

[h1]Replayability [b]10/10[/b][/h1]
There is no Story, No Unlockables, This game stays fun as long as you like flying drones. The Multiplayer surely adds to the replay value, but even without, Flying a drone will always remain a challenge, It is more of a simulator than a game It is a tool to help you get better. The amount of hours you can get out of this game is virtually endless and you can always keep on getting better.

[h1]Improvements[/h1]
Cloud Save Support for your custom builds, I would love to see more brands making it to Liftoff, It is good for the game, It is a good representation of the sport. And it will only help companies with brand recognition. I would also love more maps, Maybe a Tinywhoop level, A small outdoor map with a house that has all doors and windows open, stuff like that.

Add more different parts Like Flightcontrollers, ESCs, PDBs, Then Choose what kind of Firmware you want to run, Imagine having to flash and configure BetaFlight, It would be a great learning experience and it will increase safety within the sports. Choosing the right ESCs with all those new technologies, And ofcourse the VTX, having Clearflight and stuff like that for better vision. It would make things more realistic and a lot more educational.

[h1]Workshop[/h1]
The game also has workshop support, Where you can upload your custom builds, But also custom tracks, consisting of props that you can place on existing tracks, Most of the tracks have big open areas where you can build anything really. There are over 10K workshop submissions which mostly are tracks, There is no developer curation but the community does a pretty good at rating the tracks.

[h1]Conclusion [b]9/10[/b][/h1]
Liftoff is a must have for any drone enthausiast, If are not into drones but you like stunting, racing, or insane challenges it might be right up your alley, It is incredibly hard. If you want to eventually get a drone I would advise getting a transmitter first, A controller feels very different and you might learn some wrong habits.

I had issues with getting a sense of scale in DRL and FPV Freerider so I wasn't sure if I should go for a gap or not and how far I'm off the ground, but that's totatlly fine in Liftoff, everything feels realistic about the flying and environment.
I also really like the simulated interference of the FPV camera and OSD, though it'd be great if you could configure the OSD to fit your betaflight OSD.
Note for Linux users:
It works flawless on Linux, it picked up my Taranis QX7 over USB and the betaflight HID without any problems unlike FPV Freerider or DRL run through proton.

It has more more rich environments, more and more importantly, more challenging race-tracks. So overall a superior product for almost the same price. I can't give Liftoff a thumbs down, because it really is not bad for its purpose. It's really okay. But as a star-rating I would give it just a 5/10.

Also, performance sucks, even with a GTX1080.

(I've been watching his videos and learned a lot!). And I haven't even gotten to the quad customization tuning options.

I can't speak for the realism since I've never flown a kwad, but i do fly RC helis and planes and this sim is comparable to the other RC sims i've tried like Realflight and Phoenix RC in terms of realism. But what sets Liftoff apart from those sims is that it's both a sim and a game making it fun, not just a training tooI. It's also very polished, quick to setup and fly with a good IU. I also like that it's on Steam with its regional pricing, features like the workshop and community.

Graphics are great. I really like the camera noise feature, which when set at low res (1080 or lower) with highest quality settings but AA turned off, makes it look like real analog footage. I'm getting 50fps on my i7, gtx1050ti which is acceptable considering analog FPV systems display at 30 or 25hz.

Honestly, the game is not terrible. I used it on rainy days and during the winter for a while to keep the rust off the fingers. The issues I have with the game are mostly just absolutely TERRIBLE optimization. I have a Ryzen 7 3700x/GTX 1080ti and the game will drop from 144 to 60 in the matter of a split second (regardless of graphics settings). This results in non-fluid gameplay, and honestly it made me feel nauseous at times. Now, don't get me started on the custom maps, those are even worse at 40-50fps. Mind you, while trying to figure out this issue, I had Afterburner, HWMonitor, etc. Running to monitor usage of CPU/GPU and see where my bottleneck may be sitting. To my surprise, the game could hardly utilise 30-40% of my GPU, while still under-delivering frames. Same with CPU, but it was near 10% when the game was running, which likely means the game doesn't use much more than 5% with my background processes running.

As for map selection, it's decent. Nothing crazy, although I did spend 3/4 of my play time in the Hannover map. It's gorgeous, and a blast to fly through. Frames seemed to hover around 80-120fps (which is still terrible compared to what an optimized game can run at). There are a few others that were good, but nothing quite compared to Hannover. 

Quad selection/parts I feel could be much better. Me and my buddies run similar setups and we were unable to find any parts to match in the game (2207.5 2750KV, closest thing in game was 2206 2600kv or 2306 2650kv, which feel drastically different from a 2207.5 high KV stator). We had to try to get around this by using lower kv/higher pitched prop or a 6s with higher pitched props and smaller battery, lowering/raising weight, playing with tune, rates, etc. Nothing seemed to really work as we wanted it to, kind of leaving us desiring more from the quad/flight characteristics. 

The physics are somewhat janky. Quad is very floaty/drifty, and doesn't seem to resemble any of my real life quads whatsoever-no matter what I change. Tried to get a heavier feel so I raised the weight, but lost all my thrust. Tried different motors, props, etc, but nothing worked as I wanted them to, or they were changing the entire flight characteristics/throttle curve too much, making me drop the weight back down and basically flying a paper quad. From racing, to freestyle- it just didn't feel right. Mentioning this to others seemed to show that most people agree with this, and that it's been an issue for years with Liftoff.

In conclusion, I ended up trying out Velocidrone and everything seemed to have fallen in place for me. Everything feels good, part selection is good, quad customization (flight characteristics, thrust, downforce, etc) all felt very natural and gave me the results that I expected. AND 200FPS CONSTANT!! I can see it drop to 195 ish every so often, but never noticed any frame drops or stutters in-game. I guess you can't go wrong with any game, as long as you're getting stick time in.. All in all, ""quad feel"" can be quite subjective. But if you're looking for the ""end game"" quad sim, I suggest you give them all a try for an hour or so before deciding which is right for you.",1575946884,1575947014,False,297,49,0.675608992576599121,23,True,False,False

Connection to my Taranis radio was very simple and works great. I cannot comment on how it actually compares to real flying as I am complete noob and haven't got to that stage yet. By far the best map I found for learning is the golf course as it has paths you can use to follow at the same time as avoiding trees and branches and there are passage ways through the bottom of the clubhouse to fly through.

The one bad thing I found with this game is what you'd expect to be simple training levels seemed very difficult due to the flight characteristics of the Quad.

I love the thrill and fun of navigating the really interesting courses or just free-flying in a pine forest or other really amazing sites.

I'm still learning the technical side of acro flying but with practice I seem to start getting really good at fitting the FPV racer in the 3D space with finesse.  Until I leave it for awhile then I'm pretty clumsy but thankfully the software lets me play in horizon or level modes which helps me rebuilt my muscle memory.

I get a mild satisfaction even getting kudos/points for coming back and playing every day.  Even if I only race a few times around the track it feels like I can make progress in my points total as well.

Truly an awesome game; loads of fun to race around and fly.  I use a Spektrum DX9 bound to the WS1000.

And there's a bonus--there are tracks available on Steam from the user community.  Some of these are really clever and make use of the environment in really ingenious ways.

If you are an owner of a Jumper T16 Pro and connect it to your PC to play liftoff, right out of the box, Liftoff:
- Inverts your yaw and roll sticks
- Lets you bind your ""arm drone"" button to the keyboard, but forgets this setting every time you have to go back and fix the yaw/roll stick inversion that I talked about.

It's disappointing because I really was looking forward to learning how to FPV with Liftoff, but if I have to go through this infinite loop of trying to fix both my controller settings AND somehow forcing Liftoff to remember my key bindings to arm my drone, I'm going to go insane.

Long version:
Liftoff offers both for beginners and for experienced pilots a lot of stuff to have a ton of fun, to relax, to practice and to learn / improve flying skills!
Transfer into the real world of fpv flying is very good!
I was able to run liftoff on an old 32 bit, windows 7 system from 2007 (3 gb ram, gtx 650) on lowest settings. System requirements are not too high. Of course newer systems let you enjoy the eye candy, and performance is better.

Pros:
-varied simulator with a lot of different environments, (a vast number of custom) tracks and races, copter setups
- helps to learn how to fly (also in real world)
- gives the opportunity to practice in a professional way and to expand given limits when racing or just to relax when crusing around or to practice new tricks in freestyle mode
- inexpensive 
- works with a lot of differnt hardware (pc systems, different controllers)
- very active developer team that listens to its clients and with good humor
- great features like the liftoff pro league with prices and badges
- very active and great community
- ...

Cons:
- imho there are no really cons. I always found a way to enjoy liftoff

There is still room for improvements though like more different multiplayer modes or different racing modes (probably developer team is already working on that)

Not worth $20 (not even talking about DLC thing), but there are no alternatives.

I want to like this sim, but has 2 [b]*MAJOR*[/b] issues.

1. [b]Horrible performance[/b] for what it does.
With  all graphics settings set to minimum and resolution 1440 x 900,
I can't f only play in the first level (yellow field).
It gets ~50FPS with occasional hiccups.

All other levels are simply unplayable <30 FPS, huge input lag. 

I tried it on 2 laptops:
- OS X 10.14.4
- MacBookPro11,3 (late 2013), Intel Core i7 2.4GHz
- NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M
- it's not a new laptop, but played waaaaay more complex looking games like League of Legends, Metro and GTA5 with medium settings without a hiccup.

- OS X 10.14.4
- MacBookPro12,1 (late 2016), Intel Core i7 3.1GHz
- Intel Iris Graphics 6100

2. Menu loading time is a joke. Several seconds (!) for transitions between menu screens.
[b]OMFG. Hello, developers![/b] This is just one screen with a bunch of buttons and a simple 3D scene. The response time in entire menu should be <100ms. For such a game there only 2 moments that can have excuse for loading time:
- initial start of the game
- loading a new level
Note: coming back from flying to menu system should be instant.

Another thing is that you can not change or even see(!) key/transmitter key bindings when flying - this menu is simply not available when flying. It feels like it was written by a bunch of low-paid interns.",1555404614,1569771420,False,5,18,0.327819913625717163,3,True,False,False

I had been learning to fly quads using RealFlight 8, which has a great simulation system and the ability to build your own from scratch. However, the environments there feel pretty sparse and spread out so it feels boring pretty quickly. I decided to jump on Liftoff since it looked to have more of an arcade feel.

Entertainment - This is what keeps me coming back. I pretty much learned to fly FPV exclusively from doing races, and by doing races I mean spending a few hours trying to get through my first lap. There are different styles of gates, from arches to inflatable tubular gates, and flags, scaffolds and plenty of bits worked in from the environment. It makes each race feel more unique instead of just the same arches with different scenery. The ghosts let you race without feeling lonely, but there's also multiplayer you can hop in and see just how bad you are. The Freestyle mode is ok, detecting tricks with multipliers and such, but I prefer the Free Fly with trick detection turned on so that mode isn't as fun as race is.

Simulation - The physics simulation is pretty good. The quad handles correctly and feels like it has the right weight, but it handles too well. It is like it is an idealized quad that flies super locked in. It seems impossible to generate any propwash and even though you can adjust the PIDs, it doesn't really seem to ever handle badly until you jack the numbers up so high that I think the simulation just breaks and the quad flips out. Being able to change rates in a Betaflight-like UI is great and very effective though.

Equipment - There's a small variety of quads available to which you can swap out parts to change the feel. Things are modern so you'll see parts you recognize people using today, which lets you pick parts that match your system or try out new things. The parts selection isn't very big, although there's not huge amount of variety in the real world either (how many 2207 2400KV motors do you need?). There's a bunch of ~5"" quads and some variety on either side of that, but no whoops.

Graphics - The graphics really shine and there's even modes for simulating video interference. The environments are very different and allow different styles instead of being all compact technical courses.

Controls - I play with my Taranis and it really helps to match the feel of flying. However, the UI is tough to navigate with the sticks even once it is all configured, but once you're in a race/freefly/freestyle, you can use the controller to restart so I guess it is ok. There is ~100ms of lag between moving the sticks and seeing them move on the screen though (tested with camera), no matter what my settings.",1566931109,1566931109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You also get a lage variety of different drones. The race couses are pretty difficult sometimes but there are easier tracks as well. You can build your own tracks as well via the track editor (havent tried it yet). Ive never flown a real race drone so I cant judge how realistically these drones fly.
You also have the possibility to ""build"" your own drones. I tested it and I figured out that I suck at it. It is really hard to do this properly because you need to PID-tune the quads (dont worry when you dont know what PID-tuning is). The features are nice. You can paint your drones and have skins for them but they dont affect your drone in any way.
I havent tried the multiplayer mode yet.
The different modes like race, free flight and freestyle are nice. I like free flight and race the most because the mechanic of the game doesnt alwasy detect your stunts in freestyle mode.
But after all these features I have a rather big complain: Liftoff crashes a LOT. Im running a farily well computer on Windows 10 x64 bit but Liftoff crashes almost always after approximately one hour of flying (I run the lowest graphics possible on 1440p). I even had crashes afer just half an hour. I dont know how it will be on other computers but for me this is an issue. (LuGus please fix that)
I also think that the price of 20 bucks is a bit high but looking back at it after about 30 hours of playing I thik I would buy it again because the game is just so nice.
All in all I think buying Liftoff is worth it for you if you want to learn to fly a race quad (you need a transmitter or a game contoller of some kind that works similar to a transmitter or so to really enjoy/learn it). But you need to think about the crashes being an issue for you (can be already fixed when you read this) and wether you want to spend 20 bucks on it.

With the addition of Bando City, the order of sims I would recommend is:

LiftOff
FPV Air 2
DCS World
Velocidrone
FPV Freerider

Great job team, best sim overall!

Lower End PC's: Turn your resolution down: any FPV goggles wont have a high resulution either, so it doesnt take away much except eye candy that would not be there with a real drone.
Higher end PC's,  I would advice the same .. get it as real as possible so you wont be thrown off by bad video when you go for real.

All soms (ALL!!!) will have to be tweaked to get the feeling of your specific drone. A LOT of the 'this simulator is floaty' stuff comes from PC's that are not up to the task of calculating the physics and providing the visuals, and thus take longer .. the game time slows down, and while everything is still simulated accurate, it feels off. Lower your settings if this happens for you.
As in: set it to ultra low, see how that flies, now you have a reference.

With the addition of Bando City, this is now my favourite freestyle playground. FPV Air 2 still wins for racing, mainly due to the good tracks and the 'no hassle fly now' approach.

Well, other than when your drone gets tangled up with an obstacle, which seems to confuse the game a bit. But you're not supposed to run into obstacles, anyway, right? So far, I still am a very long way from being a capable pilot. I never knew flying a drone was so amazingly difficult! I'm having fun learning, but I still can't stay on track with even the most simple levels. If I can make it though a couple gates in a row, I feel like I'm doing great. It's extremely hard.

I would have broken thousands of dollars of parts so far. I'll keep trying... :-)

Update: Ok, I've actually made it around the track! Enough to finish a couple races against the AI, and win! (They slow way down for you after the first race, always trying to do only slightly better than your first race's time. So all you have to do is slightly better than your own previous race's time to win the following races.) The drone I found easiest to control so far is the Gremlin. I tried several others and still can't control them.

the one thing that this game has over the two other sims that ive tried is realistic physics, and realistic handling. another thing that i feel that this game has that others doesn't, is a very live community, and a community that helps tweak things, and provides way more tracks for the game than what comes stock!

I have noticed a few limitations though.  You cannot actually use the drone editor to build your quad.  You can get close, but they need to provide you with many more options and variables in order to get yours to visually look correct, as well as settings to get it to fly more like your actual quad.  

Also, the flight areas are too small.  The golf course is a pretty good size, however, its still pretty easy to end up out of bounds.  I would prefer to have much larger areas to fly in.  I would also want more variety with bandos and buildings and such.

You get what you pay for with this sim, as you basically get a fully fledged PC game out of the experience. I haven't gone too in depth on what you can do to customize your own drone, but you get a bunch of pre-built selections based on real-life builds from the best pilots out there.

The realism of the sim is great. I'd never expect pristine accuracy from any sim, and this one is no exception with the gravity feeling a bit floaty at times, but nonetheless this sim does a phenomenal job of altering characteristics of the flight accurately based on what frame / setup you choose. Being in the market for a Chameleon, I now am extra confident it will be an ideal build for my preferred solo-freestyle flying. I now have a good idea of why some frames are chosen for their purposes as well, which i definitely never got from the cheaper sim. They really leave no stone unturned when it comes to simulating an actual fpv flight. the game even gives you an optional little animation of ""you"" putting on goggles, and some artificial noise to distract you just like with IRL FPV. I turned that off myself since it messed with my framerate, but that's just cuz i have an old PC.

One minor gripe is with the freestyle trick judging, it tends to ignore certain tricks if done too soon after a different one. I almost feel like it gets confused when i very obviously do a powerloop straight into an inverted spit-S without letting it clock the powerloop first, since it seems drifting seamlessly right into one trick from another sometimes results in getting no points.",1548866431,1548866431,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First I had to mod the startup script because the devs didn't add a solution that was posted like a year ago. Without that all textures were corrupted.
The performance on Linux is beyond bad. With a GTX 970 and an i7 4790k I have to set every single setting to minumum to get >50 FPS which is required for the sim because without that the controls are sluggish.

Now to the game itself:
The loading times are awful for what kind of graphics quality you get, even on maxed settings.
Especially 10 second+ load times within the menu where it just has to load a few quadcopter models is a little sad.
Model diversity is good and I really like the steam workshop integration.
The game doesn't have many maps and most only have a single race scenario.
Physics are okay but I wasn't able to get it to feel 100% right. Still good.
Ghosts that are supposed to be some kind of opponent seem to follow random paths and are pretty much useless.

    [*]Realism: this game is among the very best, if not the most accurate simulator available.
    [*]Steam game: It allows you to download it on any computer hassle free, 
        ability to return if you dont like it, workshop, cloud saves... etc.
    [*]It has modern graphics, the visuals are top notch while maintaing a very high framerate on most pc's.
    [*]It has a lot of 'videogame' features on top of the simulator. Freestyle mode, multiplayer, workshop, rewind, ...
    [*]Betaflight Rates setup: able to easily mimic your IRL quad is a big deal. 
    [*]The Joshua Bardwell map. Wow. The best map in the whole game, by a LOT
    [*]Binding switches on your transmitter to ingame functions.
    [*]They keep it updated and actually care. They have not stopped improving this game, and it looks like they plan on keeping

As any pilot will tell you, ACRO mode is the only way to fly. And the learning curve to switch from a history of SELF-LEVELLING flight like most toy-grade drones to ACRO is steep. When I first started learning, I could barely take off and start moving forward without flipping upside down. But, through perserverance, I've learned to fly decent in about twenty hours, and can get around many courses with no errors.

This game works with your RC transmitter (so far with a Spektrum DX5) so that you can learn to fly with the same tool you would in the real world. IF you don't have a tx yet, you can also use a PS3/4 or xbox controller with two joysticks. There's a great variety of drones and courses, both of which you can customize or create from scratch!

It's cool that you can use real controllers or a gamepad.

I've used this with a USB gaming RC controller that is close enough to the real thing (without the high quality sticks and knobs) to be able to take advantage of it as a proper sim.

It's probably the best option to learn and practice how to fly properly without destroying a pricey race drone (and you will crash, over and over).

Getting the hang of basic physics/dynamics in Liftoff really helps in dealing with the surprise of real world wind/airflow dynamics that are constantly changing with a real world drone.

There is one race drone in particular amongst the preset models that matches the real one I've tried flying, and it has done more to improve my abilities than when I was just going out to a sports field and trying to fly cold.

You can get more 'non-quality,' mindless practice time in with this since there are no battery limitations like in the real world (just reset when you're ingame battery runs out). And you're flying no-assist style drones that require a heavy level of skill.

The fact that you can build your own drones and maps is also a very nice touch. If this were a flight sim, all of the components within the drone and map building sections would be pricey, individual DLCs. All of this is built into the game... so kudos just on that for the respect the developers are giving to the serious gamer community.

If you are genuinely keen to start developing quad/copter drone flight skills, you will need to invest in, at least, a proper RC styled USB controller (not a console style gamepad), and don't hesitate about waiting for a seasonal promo discount. This game is worth the full price, and it receives steady, quality patches and tweaks from the developer.",1543104832,1543104832,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Flight controls are crisp and responsive, although the Steam Controller has a habit of lagging inputs or becoming too sensitive to flight stick control manipulations randomly.  Im not sure where the issue lies, I've tried it with two seperate Steam controllers and the lag occurs with both.  This is not an issue with linking a RC controller to your PC.

For a low cost and low risk entry into fpv drone racing, this simulation feels accurate and responsive.  Lack of real world maps for freefly (not based around race maps) is a negative for me, but it would appear that there is some sort of customizability on the horizon.  One nice little addition is the ability to import your own music playlists into a watched folder, although be aware that the last information I had, MP3 format was not supported, only .wav and .ogg.

TLDR:
This game is a bit of a ""niche"" thing, and I only can truly recommend this game to you -
the reader - if you genuinely are into drone racing and want to get better, or have a substitute if you can't go out flying RC in real life. it also isn't as much a game as it is a simulator. I want this review serve as a buyers beware on why you should or shouldn't buy it, 
rather than recommending you to buy this with a positive review.

Full:

The good:
For it's intended purpose, this game serves as probably THE BEST FPV drone simulator
you can find on steam, or even the internet for that matter. I fly FPV in real life, and Liftoff made me fly FPV exponentially better after only 10 effective hours. it made me transition from stabilized (Horizon) to full manual (Acro) flight. 
If you have an RC transmitter lying around capable of linking to your PC, and want to get better at FPV Flying, because it certainly will make you better over time.
this game is an absolute must! I met the Devs in person and they are absolutely great, very nice, passionate indie team whom are very open to suggestion and interact very frequently to community feedback. the game gets updated regularly,
and almost every two or three months, you get new FREE stuff and maps to fly on. For a simulator, this game is an absolute steal!

The buyers beware:
This game will for most part be full manual flying by YOU, preferably flown by a dedicated RC transmitter like the Frsky Taranis. I highly recommend you to NOT pick up this game if you're not planning to get into the hobby of drone flying/racing or if you're just not into FPV drone flight as a whole. 
Don't expect to jump into this without prior experience of RC flight, and think that you'll have the hang od it after an hour, because game will be annoying the first few hours if you haven't flown RC before. This game is a great gateway to get into FPV drone flying, but to get the closest true-to-life experience, you're gonna need an RC transmitter. prices can widely vary from a simple 20$ offbrand plug n play transmitter to a professional 400$ Frsky Horus RC transmitter. if you DO NOT have and/or wish to buy an RC transmitter, this game is probably not for you. You can also play this with a gamepad but I do not recommend this as the experience is vastly different.

I was impressed back in the Day and I still say this might be a good way for a rookie to learn the basics of flying, but after checking back once in a while I have grown more and more disappointed with the flight model in this sim. Being an experienced pilot with top notch tech on my hands I have to say this sim feels dull and unresponsive and worst of all is still waaaay too floaty.
Having reached a certain level in my flying I can no longer recommend this sim for seasoned pilots as you will most likely ruin your reallife skills using this sim.
Additionally the devs completely misunderstood the concept of throttle expo doing it completely wrong.
While it's kinda nice to have a betaflight-ish interface for your rates it is outdated and doesn't reflect the current state of betaflight at all.

Sorry guys, but adding content without fixing the underlying issues disqualifies this sim for me.


Older EDIT way back:

OK time to edit...

First off I wanna say it's just amazing that LuGus managed to fix almost all of the problems that stopped me from loving this Game in just one day!!! Great job you've done there guys!!!

At first I wasn't able to map controls to my DX6i, what turned out to be my own fault in the end. But I was really impressed how well you could actually fly this thing with such a piece of crap of a controller like my totally worn out 5 years old 360 gamepad. This was already so much fun that I flew quite a while without worrying about setting up my DX6i properly.

When I finally tried with a real rc transmitter I was blown away how great this sim handles and how much fun it is. Compared to yesterday it's a completely different experience!

I was happy to see that it's possible now to turn off the OSD but couldn't find an option for changing the camera angle. But I#m confident this will be implemented soon.

The flight model feels good and kind of natural, but still is too easy compared to the real thing. I was able to pull off some maneuvers that would have had me crashed in real life. The quad also is not as ""snappy"" as I like it and PID tuning feels still a bit weird but again... I'm confident this will be fixed in the future.

So all in all this is a must have for anyone interested or already involved in FPV Racing!!!




Old Review from yesterday:


At this point I cannot recommend this game for people who fly real fpv racequads...

Looks like a good start to me, but a few things annoy the hell out of me and will make me stick with hotprops for now:

- the hover point is way below stick center and cannot be adjusted. (Tested this on my old DX4e, my DX6i and my 360 Gamepad - Hover point is at around 25% throttle) I prefer a hover point at the stick center and afaik that's how most people fly

- feels like zero throttle in fact isn't zero throttle... quad falls way too slow compared to real life experience

- camera angle cannot be adjusted

- no way to turn off the OSD ... I prefer flying without OSD


These are all things I'm sure will be fixed soon and besides those the flight model feels promising but needs more fine tuning and more real life feeling (for example jittering when decending into own propwash). There are quite a few sims out there that come near the feeling of piloting a fpv racequad and I really hope this one will come close or even spot on.

and some basic acrobatics. This  Game/Sim concept works well

See TL;DR for the brief.

MY BACKGROUND:
I started looking into the drone freestyle and racing scene a few months ago watching pilot videos, tips, and builds to learn about the hobby and what is involved.
Recently I decided I needed to figure out if I want to get into the hobby and stop sitting on the fence.

Enter drone simulators(there is a few).. My first is Liftoff, and it has been a great tool without having to invest in a drone, plus, it saves on the costs to run, maintain, and repair said 'first' drone which can quickly add up in cost depending on how crap of a pilot you are!!!

For Liftoff,
I have been using a wireless XBox360 controller and have had a lot of fun but found it very touchy, but have adapted.
My first flight in FPV was the simulation of a poorly executed pancake flip, I quickly switched to Line of Sight(LOS) to begin training there.
Having progressed from flopping around like a pancake in LOS with ACRO(Manual/No auto leveling) mode to hovering and flying around reasonably successfully I stepped back into FPV and this progression very natural but I did find it a lot easier to control so have been trying to focus more on learning to fly in LOS but do jump into FPV also.. because it is more fun ;)

Anyway,
Having had a lot of fun thus far I wanted to take things to the next level so got a Taranis as Liftoff supports the use of controllers, this will help with the transition from simulator to the real world when that happens, plus I can use this same controller for my first real drone which will be a basic indoor fpv drone and then later I will do a full build.

TL;DR:
- Fly Line of Sight or FPV
- Good graphics
- Decent variety of drones/parts with basic customisation (would be great if they just opened up to the workshop here)
- Good variety of activities (Race, Freestyle, Free-Fly)
- Workshop 'courses' (no custom maps yet sadly, again the community could do so much for the developers here)
- Fun gameplay but touchy controls although I am sure you can adjust this, but I wanted to adapt not the other way.
- Good challenge, my first time flying ACRO.. RIP 50,000 virtual drones... ;)
- Great starting point for drone newbies like myself! XD

All in all, a great tool for someone like myself that was on the fence, grab a PS or XBox controller and have a crack!

I started flying a Blade vortex 150 in ACRO right off the bat, and felt comfortable in an hour. It was raining outside so I countinued to explore the game for the rest of the day.

The next day i flew my real Vortex 150 in ACRO and it was so close to the sim I forgot i was flying in ACRO and not Horizon mode. I have a park across the street and I was diving trees, doing flips, rolls, playing in the trees all from the musle memory I had gained the day before. My Torrent 110 on a 3 cell was also fun.

If you are trying to fly a drone, YOU MUST OWN THIS GAME! I am going to buy a 5 inch drone next spring after I put in lots of hours with what i got, and hundreds of hours in the winter on the sim. Ive owned this game for just over a week and its changed my flying! I owe the vast Drone commuinty for changing my life!

p.s. Ive seen Mr. Joshua Bardwells yard so many times on youtube im sure I could fly it in my sleep, but Im having trouble downloading it. Any suggestions?

When using an Xbox controller, it doesnt feel like the real thing at all, which slightly upset me.

I love this game! its absolutely fantastic practice for any level pilot, its a chance to escape to the virtual world where it doesnt matter if  you nose-dive the ground with your drone.

My reccomendation:

Only buy this game if you own an RC controller that can be used on a computer.
do not expect a controllable game if using a poopy xbox controller, it just doesnt work and is impossible to fly if you have already flown real drones before.

You can adjust, after assembling this “almost real” Drone you own in real life, the weight of the drone and make it have same performance. This with the simply RC Controller configurator makes an excelent choice of FPV Simulator.

I became a Liftoff Fan in January 2017 when I puchased my first RealACC x-210 drone kit from Banggood. Liftoff taught me to fly, tune, and adjust my Taranis settings and develope throttle and axis curves. I did so through Liftoff. I was able to obtain a complete and functional understanding of RC Rates, Super Rates, Throttle and Axis Expo as well as PID tuning  and I did so before I ever flew my first Quad, ( have since built five additional race quads) I was able to master the necessary control of my quad by using Liftoff. When I flew my first quad in March 2017.....which is, somewhat different from Liftoff (Liftoff was more foregiving) I was able to  fly with only minor crashes that occurred until I mastered a real Quad landing. 
     Following approximately ten pacs, I was flyng under and around trees and successfully maneuvering rolls, loops and very fast flying. During most of my Liftoff training / practice, I flew with Fat Shark HD3's. This presented a term to become familiar with an actual 130"" field of view and became accustom to goggle flight which was helpful and important. I allowed camera noise in Liftoff but reality privides a great deal more.
     I regularly utilize Liftoff for learning the feel of new rate settings (muscle memory). I presently race Quads regularly and have become extremely respectable and competitive. I just began flying 6s power on llower KV motors.....the straight line speed of most of  my builds exceed 120 mph and provides  longer flight times with apparent aforethought. I still use Liftoff every day!......It's a tool and its relaxing.....no broken parts to replace and this creates much bolder flying.... provides experience.... and defrays from  many broken parts that happen upon real Quad flight learning curves that  always exist.
     If you are interested in Quad flying or just obtaining a good working understanding of what makes a good tune and proper control rates and adjustments.......then Liftoff IS A MUST HAVE.........You can probable learn to fly without it......over a longer period of time.....but why do it the hard way? Liftoff is at your finger tips and will act as a terrific aid to determined if this hobby is for you.

JOANZS ......  a Liftoff fan.

It is fun and the flight characteristics are accurate enough (as of May 2018) to be considered a simulator and not an arcade flyer. Is it the overall best FPV mini quad racer simulator on the market today? No, not in my opinion, but if you are looking to get into the rather expensive hobby of FPV racing, I would not be stingy on the comparatively cheap price of a sim (at $20 we're talking the price of a motor or a battery here). My advice is to buy a few, since they do offer different advantages.

For positive aspects, the graphics are excellent and it has integration into the steam workshop for new track setups. Even in early access, Liftoff is more accurate and higher quality than earlier options like FPV Freerider. And, in my book, offering a Linux version is a huge plus! Thank you :) Binding a transmitter was also a piece of cake.

My main criticisms are a) it is unfinished and lacks content and features b) it does not run well on a machine above their minimum specs on large levels and c) for being a simulator it is extremely limited in its configuration options. Overall I think Velocidrone is a superior product, because it is highly playable *right now* with loads of maps, tracks, and quads, it runs large levels well (>60fps) on a card with 1 GB VRAM, and many aspects of the physics and quad are easily configurable. In terms of content for Liftoff, there are only a few large, interesting maps (like Hannover) whereas there are many for Velocidrone. For the the quad workbench, what is the point in fiddling with the appearance of the quad, since when do you see it if you're flying first-person-view? Further, the tutorial is barebones, and the track designer is painful to use and lacks instructions on how to use it. The menu system is also frustrating, it has long and unnecessary load-times between sub-menus, and you cannot change maps or tracks without going through the main menu system. Liftoff is an early access product (and has been since like 2016) and it's unfinished state shows. Although, this is important, it is not buggy, and I had no issues even on the less-well-tested Linux platform.

Thus, if you would like to get into the FPV hobby, I think you should add Liftoff to your library. It's fun and it works, but in my view it is not the best product on the market today.

I've got over 850 hours and still can't get enough.

If you're into flying drones - no matter if total beginner or pro - you should definitely check out Liftoff. You'll find everything you need, from interactive tutorials teaching basic controls, to a lot of built-in tracks and races of varying difficulty, a workbench to build your own drone from real parts, a pro league with regularly tournaments and a flourishing and growing community with friendly people.

The best part for me is the built-in track/race editor which made me build dozens of crazy skill training tracks that I could share with others in the workshop. It never gets boring, since there's so many pilots always creating new tracks to download and fly.

The physics are good, if anything a bit floaty.
Graphics, sound and interface are very good, too.
The game is constantly evolving and the devs do regular updates with new and cool features.
They often even come into the multiplayer rooms and have a chat with the users and/or fly some laps themselves.

I love the atmosphere of the community, where pros fight head to head about the best laptime while beginners learn and get help and hints from more experienced pilots. I improved my skills a lot with Liftoff and was able to learn new maneuvers without the risk of crashing my real drone and having to do expensive repairs.

My PC:
FX 9590 (Liquid Cooled)
16GB RAM
Win10 on SSD game on HDD @ 10,000 RPMs
RX 580 GPU

Pros:
Affordable
Graphics are OK not the best but very OK
Easy to find and install(PC) can’t vouch for Mac. Compared to other sims that you need to comb google to find.
Great variety of quads of different sizes TWRs and designs
BUILD YOUR OWN QUAD. I really LOVE this idea.
Workshop races and such. I'd like to see workshop maps like abandoned buildings.


Cons:
Feels more like an arcade game than a real sim.
Fly area too small. I understand why from a design perspective, but still annoying.
Physics not the same on each level (or so it seems)
Physics not real enough, it feels floaty and even different on each level for the same drone
Collision works doesn’t work as expected

I have personally gotten motion sickness from this game. It’s probably just me. I’ve never gotten motion sickness from VR or even flying my own drone IRL. Not sure why, but Hanover is the worst for me. The other levels are not as severe. Your mileage may vary. 

All-in-all I’m going to revise my original review and say I recommend this game. It being easily available and affordable compared to some, isn’t the worst thing you could do if your looking for a sim to start learning on. But remember there are other sims out there.

Ok, you have to like drones and quadcopters to enjoy at the top but nevertheless it is truly awesome even if you are not really into that hobby!
PLUS, if you are going to be a drone racer, this simulator can save you tons of bucks! You can test the basic things to do and NOT to do while you fly a racing/freestyle drone making some experiences! Just keep in mind that reality is always way more sneaky and tricky!!

I'd love to see just a couple of things here:

1) when it says that there are some incompatibilities, I (as a n00b) cannot understand where these are and I have to try and try before I can build up my favorite new drone (in the workbench)

I've flown RC planes for years, but flying these is different to say the least, especially wearing goggles.  I started off with a MJX Bug6  and a cheap pair of goggles. That was cool but got boring quick, I wanted to try acro and it didn't have it.  I bought a Tiny 7 and a Eachine Bat QX105. They're ok, but they lack power  which degrades their acro ability.  So, I finally sprung for an Eachine Wizard X220 and a HGLRC XJB - 145.  Before flying them, I got Liftoff and started practicing.  This simulator is an absolute must have, especially if you're new to this hobby.

My mac laptop crashes in any quality setting and resolution.  It normally can't even get past the ""goggles"" intro animation.  My big 12 core mac pro with dual ATIs can't run it smoothly at even 720p at the lowest quality setting.  Running this game on WIndows 10 in bootcamp works fairly well at 1080p in the 'good' quality setting or lower.  It still isn't perfectly smooth, but at least it's playable.  SO if you are windows based with a really good gaming computer then this might be the ticket for you.  If you are mac based save your money.  They need to do a ton of optimization before I'd call it truly playable in either OS.

As for game play-- it's pretty good!  The physics feel fairly realistic, although as is often the case for me, the simulators are easier to fly. I think some of this is psychological (no fear of crashes), but I think it's also the case where the game just feels 'slower' than the real thing.  It's more floaty.  Sometimes the quad seems to soar more like a plane than a real miniquad.  

The crash/damage system is nice in that brushing an object won't end your session.  But I'd say its pretty unrealistic.  In the game, you can dive right through the middle of a tree and continue flying.  Whereas in real life I'd probably be replacing every single prop.

It´s great for beginners who want to get into FPV flying and great for pro pilots to try and learn new tricks without trashing a 500$ Racing Quad.
I´m an FPV Pilot, started with a Hexacopter, I shall not mention that the beginning was pretty expensive, always pushed the limits and crashed a lot. 
The Simulators back then didn´t even have Multirotor support, wasn´t that popular that time. I´ve tried a couple of Simulators that would give me the feel of the real thing so I can practice without braking too many Propellers.
Liftoff is from ImmersionRC, the guys who started it all, the FPV scene. Without thransmitting the Video Data to the Pilot it would have stayed regular RC Piloting a Multirotor, Helicopter, Plane, Car, whatever...
The Community puts a lot of love, energy and time in to the Development of FPV Gear, also Simulators.
Up to this Day, Liftoff is still the best the Market has to offer!
LuGus and ImmersionRC also don´t release an Early Access, they perfectionalize the Product and than it´s released, from roughly 200 Games that I have on Steam (also some early access games), Liftoff has the most upgrades/updates that makes the Simulator each time better and better!

If you like to install it to replace flying in winter I suggest to watch some youtube quad realted channel or fix your quad.

It's a killer training tool for someone looking to get into quads and develop some skill and technique before burying their real gear into the dirt at 80mph.  It works perfectly with the Taranis QX7 - minimal transmitter programming and minimal calibration in Liftoff.  A regular USB cable is all I used, no proprietary dongles or the ilk.  You can also set up a standard controller to work, but be aware that controller joysticks are sprung to center, whereas normally an RC transmitter throttle axis will not be sprung, so you may want to set the throttle range to only use the positive Y axis, rather than having to hold the stick down, away from the center to achieve 0% throttle (it feels strange but it approximates a real transmitter if you don't have one or don't want to set one up.)  There're lots of in-game versions of real world quad setups and approximations for anything it doesn't have verbatim, 150 size, 250, etc., etc.  There's a good selection of courses, with what looks like more on the way from the developers and the community.  It also provides Betaflight style PID tuning.

I'm coming from a year-or-so of doing well learning to fly cheap foamboard fixed-wing planes, but yearning for that pick-up-and-fly-anywhere FPV experience that quads seem to deliver on, so I went through all the sims I could find - Liftoff is the one that does what I need.  It feels like learning to ride a bike, I've been logging a minimum of 30mins of progression every day, and I'm getting really confident surprisingly quick.  At first I was meandering high above an open field aimless and clumsy (incapable of recovery from the slightest missteps,) now I'm zooming right above the ground whipping around obstacles, making plenty of mistakes still, but able to correct for a lot of them and finish laps regardless.  I was really surprised by the tutorial, I expected something rote and boring, but the flight model feels so real and challenging that even though I was only navigating a flat grid-world with flags and gates, I was really able to focus and simply GET BETTER.  The reset after a crash is quick and doesn't feel like utter defeat, and the tutorial videos have decent advice.  Moving back to the other areas after going through the tutorial was a stark contrast - I've never had a tutorial in a game give me that much of a sense of improvement before.  It's a good feeling - I'd credit it to the work they've put into the flight model, structure, look, and feel of the game.  I'm excited to spend more time on a real quad, but for now Liftoff is a good way to train up from nothing while I spend the dark winter nights building a 270 rig in the basement.

if you are looking for a racing game to play on your PS4 or Xbox controller, your immediate experience will be unenjoyable. 

if you are looking for an entry point into RC quadcopters buying a RC transmitter and Liftoff should be your first step. 

""why liftoff instead of other simulators?""

-well aside from the community, Liftoff has an extensive track creator. Which allows you and the community to create endless opportunity for races.  the blue print map allows for people to go creatively wild. and make environments from the ground up. and FPV racing clubs even recreate their own tracks within the simulator for practice. 

-it has a diverse player base of many skill levels. A LOT of people play liftoff, its not hard to find a race or freestyle lobby. the game does not balance player skill, so you will find your self racing with people much faster than you. and even when you get to the point where you feel faster than most other people, someone is going to be twice as fast as that. its easy to caught up in lap times,  racing is competitve so we have to compare our selves to others, just keep in mind some people might have as much as 5 or more years of flight time than you.  its good to follow and watch the better pilots to see how they might approach a problem differently. commit it memory in practice and try to improve your times.

-freestyle stunt mode, as far as i know, its the only sim that has this kind of feature. i fly freestyle mostly so i think its pretty awesome. 

-custom quads.  liftoff does a good job at nailing the simulator part, but its  little things in the game make it stand out, Pieceing together a new build on the workbench. changing the betaflight settings. these things are enjoyable in their own ways... liftoff can teach you things about the hobby that would regularly require a newb to do a lot of googling and asking on forums. dont get me wrong, if you plan to get into drone racing, interet research is GOING to happen, but with liftoff, you might just have a lighter  homework load. 



in conclusion, i think you should buy this if your are interested in the hobby, you wont regret it. 


Cons :  i will add a list of cons once the game is finished, i think its unfair to point something out that might be removed in time.

FPV Drone Racing Game that (in my opinion) almost perfectly translates flying a drone in first-person view.

When I wanted to start flying drones I bought a pre-built drone (Eachine Falcon 250 Pro). Drone cheap enough for me to crash a bazillion times and be able to repair it. Ofcourse I first had to learn the basics of Line of sight flying but later when I wanted to transition to FPV flying things got quite different. I bought Liftoff to help me with the transition where I then got the feeling for FPV flying and some tricks too!

Anyways, to sum it up, I had a great experience with Liftoff as it had taught me how to fly FPV and I met great people in multiplayer lobbies who were willing to help in any way possible.

Liftoff has quite some features and not just freeflight on a prebuilt maps:
[list]
   [*]You can build your own drone in Liftoff and tune it to your preference!

   [*]The ability to build a track or a race on your own is also a great feature that Liftoff has. You can then publish those maps, tracks or races to Steam Workshop for other people to try them.

   [*]It has a leaderboard on every track and racing with other people is as great as in real life.

   [*]They even added freestyle mode!

So i connected my taranis x7 to my pc and started liftoff. Wow, its harder than expected, but after some hours of training i get the hang off it and barly can wait any longer for the arival of my real drone. Ive no idea if this simulator is emulating the real fpv thing but i feel much more  convinced in the desission to enter the fpv world. either because i lost fear to pilot my drone the first time. And because it is even fun to fly a drone in a virtual world like liftoff. Therefore i recomend this game for people who try the step into Fpv world.

The things that bother me:
-There is a sound bug when colliding in concrete or fabric of the gates.
(Constant hitdetection, therefore a crash sound loop, its anoying)
It seams that the collider model of this programm is not verry polished.
-Talking about the collider model, the hitbox of the drone, seams to be
a simple box. Colliding, in fpv is.... fundamental. Avoiding it even more.
Crashing the drone is to forgivable and doesent feel like a simulation at all.
I also could swear sometimes, that ive dodge around a gate just right
but my drone collides anyway.
Or i can fly throught bushes wihtout any consequence, or hit the
ceiling, but all four propellers dont take damage and so on...
So i wished a better damage model and more accurate hit detection.

A couple things I would suggest.

1. Have a menu option during a flight to look at or change keyboard controls. Sometimes I crash and get stuck and it will not reset automatically. Having that or an option to show certain key commands OSD. That or an option to set one of your controller toggle switches to reset.

Previously I had experienced a lot of trouble with setting up the inputs, but the developers did address that lack. After that change I gave the game another shot, and was pleased to discover I could actually play it now.

The game offers a ton of customization options for the various race quads, which is neat. The flight experience feels quite accurate, and once you get into the swing of things can be quite fun.

I do hope eventually more environments are added, as it's a bit bare bones. But considering the pace of development, that's just a matter of time.

It would also be neat to offer players a wider range of quad flight styles. Right now they have the twitchy race quad nailed down pretty solid, but a slower more easy to get into experience might be good for players who don't have experience flying race quads for real. Something akin to a Tiny Whoop style, or lower tuned beginner quad setup.

Old review below for posterity.

-----

It seems like the developers have gone for a minimalistic stylish gee-whiz interface when it comes to the controls. I ended up with 2 control axes inverted, and instead of a simple check-box like every other game ever to invert that axis you just have to auto-detect that axis and move it opposite of what the game prompts you.

Do you end up with multiple control axes with the center point way off? Well, tough cookies because the game doesn't let you adjust that. Spent a bunch of time farting around with windows controller options (Which shows my inputs as properly centered, contrary to what the game thinks), only to have nothing work at all.

The games auto-calibration is junk, at least for me. It ends up centering your sticks WAY off, then as I said you can't do anything to fix it.

Seriously, for a control-heavy game like flying a twitchy race quad, I would think giving the player a multitude of control options would be common sense.

Really want to like this, but until the control issues are fixed (Just giving options would do the trick!), refunded.",1487390294,1509594938,True,0,0,0.49773755669593811,2,True,False,True

There's also purist race mode (which i prefer the most) where the battery voltage and propdamage play quite a role on the race experience. User interface looks nice but not alway logic and music is fine but after a while a little boring.

As a positive, this looks WAY BETTER than DRL High Voltage, there is a lot of more work on this, buy at least I can play on DRL High Voltage, this, so far, I can't.



::UPDATE::

I manged to get it to ""work"" by creating my own control profile, YET, I have no idea WHY, but each time i rotate to left and right, it changes the POV, and I can't believe there is not any option to invert the axis, since the control setup is so mess up, it detected my input in the wrong direction, so I had to invert it using a 3th party plugin... CMON!

I mean, its clear I want to play this, it looks great, but how its posible to mess up the controls so bad? and im not using any weird control, its the standard xbox 360 controller.

And I know, its early release, but how are we suposed to test this if we can't even control it?

customise your own drone with a bunch of official parts. i've toyed with the fastest i can find, to scaling it back so its a little slower, much like my real world drone!

Lovely environments and then lots of community made content. upgraded environments are on their way too!

Maps are really good and the map editor is great, and when combined with the maps I can see a lot of potential for making your own really cool tracks. 
Being able to make your own drones is also an appreciated feature - I was able to make a simple, low-power drone that's not too twitchy to practice on before moving onto more powerful drones.
Graphics aren't amazing but that honestly doesn't bother me and I don't think it detracts from the game at all. 

Not so great is the UI which could do with some work, and music I find kinda meh and repetative (you get pretty sick of hearing the same tracks over and over very quickly).

If you're getting into FPV quads or just want to use this as a stand-alone game in its own right, this is awesome, and it's still early access!

Well, over the 4th of July weekend, I decided to give it another go and I'm so glad I did.

It's an excellent simulator, especially for those who are wanting to get into FPV racing and freestyling.

The only thing that I greatly dislike about it is the sad fact that the game CONSTANTLY forgets what my transmitter is when I shut it down and I have sit around for around 10 to 30 minutes fighting with the game to get it to properly detect my transmitter when I boot the simulator back up. It's AGGRAVATING! Come on, do I really have to fight with getting my transmitter controller to work with the game EVERY single time I boot it up? Really? Why can't it just save my transmitter and its settings? Seriously... this is just pathetic.

The devs really need to fix this issue, otherwise pilots are bound to run into the same issue and get just as frustrated, leaving this otherwise awesome sim for one that actually works with their transmitters.

Note: I'm using a FlySky FS-i5s transmitter.

----
Pros: 
* Realistic flight physics
* Good graphics
* Simulated FPV static
* Track editor for making custom tracks
* Has a few official race tracks already in the game
* Customizable drones and flight settings.
* Awesome downloadable content provided from the Steam Workshop community

Cons:
* BAD TRANSMITTER DETECTION. Having to re-do your transmitter settings every time you boot up the game is just asinine.
* VERY HIGH difficulty and learning curve (this game is not for everyone)
* Physics can sometimes go bonkers (the game is still in development, so I can't blame the creators)
* Not a lot of tracks/areas (yet)
* Has a small selection of drones (this most likely will grow larger as the game develops)
* An actual flight transmitter/controller is definitely required (video game pads don't quite cut it)
* Flight transmitters are pretty expensive (as well as the hobby itself). Good flight transmitters usually range between $60USD and $80USD, sometimes well up to $100USD and over. Just a fair warning.",1498435385,1499817947,True,5,0,0.528016328811645508,0,True,False,True

One word of advice - for the first 50 hours I played - i used an Xbox 360 controller.  This taught me some bad habits - as the accelerator  knob always comes back to the centerline.  

Recently I purchased a trainer cord for my Spektrum transmitter and the feel is MUCH more realistic and it's much easier to control.  Now I don't have to always lower the throttle like I had to on my Xbox controller.  I feel like I am getting a much more ""real"" experience and the drone actually acts like the real thing!!

No worries, fire up Liftoff, have a seat, and get ready to rip. Most pilots will tell you that you need to keep flying to keep your skills up, or you'll go rusty, and have to relearn everything all over again. It's about muscle memmory, timing, and familiarity. Liftoff helps out when you don't have any packs left to rip, or the weather isn't cooperating. Customize your quad as close as you can to the one yu fly with the workbench, tune it up in the ingame BetaFlight simulator, and set your FPV angle. Yhe FPV will also simulate the video noise you get from your headset from flying near large metal structures, behind trees, and distance (to a degree, you'll never lose Video like in real life).  Want to race it up with the community? Get out there and try the prebuilt tracks, or get on the Steam workshop and try out maps that others out there made.

I have FrSky Taranis and Turnigy Evolution, and I have to say, the Evolution just worked as soon as I plugged her in, whereas the Taranis required me to make a model. Either way, easy set up and get to ripping.  Only downfall is the music tracks get really repetative, so fire up your own music. God mode in races isn't infalible but it really gives an edge to the guys that play with it always on, and will make you wonder how they slam the shipping container and still keep flying.

Throttle control is better now, flying feels much much better now cause I dont have to worry about weird throttle curve. Still I feel like I have to use 40% of throttle to hover, will do some more testing with stick overlay. But its much more intuitive than before and considerably closer to my real life quad (I use @35% to hover).
At first (freelight) I thought quad was pretty slow (first map, desert) but when I tried race, it showed that the grass something is just really big and the quad is actually pretty damn fast.
Overall, it feels great, I think on par or even bit better than Velocidrone now (can be cause by my computer tho). Only thing that bugs me, can we have some settings for races where on crash/restart we go to last gate instead of starting whole race again? It's little bit frustrating, god-mode solve this partly, due the fact that quad sticks to everything like glue.

0.10.0:
After months trying to find simulator that is close to real life, I am still with no luck. DRL is floaty, Hotprops is laggy and has funky crash animations. Velocidrone is pretty close, but also feel bit floaty. Liftoff, well, feels ok. But something I can't get over is hover at 50% no matter what I try (500g weight with 5kg+ thrust shouldnt act like that). That feels horrible to what I am used to with real life quad which hovers at 25-30%. It's a shame. Hopefully devs will fix this.

I have logged 72 days on RealFlight G6.5, so I believe I'm able to say with certainty what I'm experiencing here.  This simulator has decent graphics and the models are pretty smooth when they work.  My only gripe with the simulator is that it intermittently stops communicating with my Taranis.  Hotprops never had this issue, but in this simulator you will be flying perfectly fine when it suddenly starts holding the last stick positions like a failsafe.  It starts about 3:30 into the game in my experience and can ony be fixed by restarting the game.  If you continue playing, the failsafes get even more frequent despite no apparent cause.  It gets really annoying when you have to restart the sim every 4 minutes because it starts glitching.  

This sim has great potential and will become my new favorite when the bugs are worked out.


Edit:
4/22/2017
After some recent updates, the issue with the controller stopping has decreased in frequency significantly, so I have no idea what changed.  I have tested it with 3 different cables now and the issues are still present, but they only happen once every two hours or so worth of use which I consider acceptable.  After experimenting with the voltages of the Taranis battery, I have found very little correlation between the batery and failure rate.  This could very well be an isolated incident that only happens on my setup so I don't think it's a big issue.

Flight physics are getting better and are already pretty close to reality depending on your setup.
In the experimental branch it feels better at the moment so i am sure there will be huge improvements in the future.
Multiplayer works great and i like the idea of having competitions in the future.

Liftoff is also great for beginners to learn flying acro and getting a feel for drone racing but make sure to have the right controller.

The best controller is probably still the taranis and it feels pretty natural even if the resolution is currently still reduced by the unity engine but sadly that is something the engine developers have to fix.
Another option are simple, old usb simulator controllers that are sadly pretty hard to find now. 
Or just grab any radio with ppm trainer port and use a simulator adapter or your soundcard with something like smartpropoplus. 
The turnigy evolution has a terribly slow update rate at this point and until that is fixed in a different firmware i probably won't recommend using that.
I hope there will be more and better usb controllers available in the future without the need of ppm adapters.

Without any experience I went online and bought Wizzard X200 and FlySky FS-i6 transmitter. Days later, drone sits in the corner waiting on a battery and I  have my FS-i6 connected via USB cable and fly this game like crazy. 

I will add my part of the review after I will fly the actual drone, but so far, this is the best simulator I had a chance to play. I tried FPV Freerider and DRL and both felt way to arcadish. This one is really fun and hard. Autolevel mode is easy and fun when you want to get use to flying. Acro is hard as ****. I have a huge respect for people who can pilot drones in fast speeds! 

One thing that I do not like is the lack of control layout. I often find myself quiting the game just to go into options or even googling how to do basic stuff like:

""A"" for acro mode
""V"" FPV or behind drone
""B"" line of sigh
arrow up and down BEFORE arming the drone to adjust the camera

or I miss that I CANNOT pick my own drone for tutorials. I understand I cannot use workbench, but at least to pick an easy and slow drone would be good.

Otherwise a very good game, but a bit confusing interface and part where I actually pick my transmitter/controller.

I served 6 years in the Air Force and while stationed in Italy in 1976, I joined a group of Italian hang glider pilots I found while driving in nearby mountains.  I bought a hang glider, flew 5 times from a 2500 foot peak, and then crashed and broke my arm. The military took care of me, and I'm okay.  Years later, I discovered flight simulators on an Apple II computer (SubLogic FS2). I've used simulators ever since then to an exhaustive degree.  In 2004 I had the means to start flight lessons, and obtained a Private Pilot license in 2006.  I put about 80 hours in command of rental planes (Cessna 150, 152, 170, 172M, 172P) and then got training in a Weight-Shift Control sport aircraft.(commonly called a trike) and then I bought one, N502PW.  I flew 100 hours in the trike over the next 5 years, then sold the aircraft in 2014. I have a Phantom 3 Standard quadcopter, a Spedix 275 FPV racing drone, a Vortex 250 FPV racing drone, a Blade NanoQX FPV mini, a Blade InductrixFPV, and an FPV Tiny Whoop I made from an Inductrix.  My FPV videos are on YouTube at patjoyce7323.

Liftoff is one of the most remarkable simulator products I have ever used.  It has the closest feel to the actual experience of controlling an FPV drone.  There are no ""anomolies"" or odd glitches when you use the controls aggressively.  The most remarkable thing about LIFTOFF is the support from Steam and the Steam Community.  I bought the software for only $20 (compare to MS flight simulator $60+ ) and was able to use my really old ""Real Flight"" USB controller from 20 years ago!  That controller is not always compatible with other simulators, but works great in Liftoff.  

But again, the greatest thing, is how LIFTOFF has been IMPROVED since I installed and started using it.  LIFTOFF has amazing graphics.  Other simulators cut back a bit on the realism and the details, so that they can build a more expansive landscape filled with all of the actual structures that are there in the real world.  Liftoff is so designed to get the best balance of landscape detail (3d objects) and computer performance.  You can customize the complexity of the graphics displayed so that you can increase the frame rate of the simulation.  The physics are completely accurate.  You can build a new quad completely from scratch and save it.  You can select parts such as frames, motors, props, batteries, antennas, etc.  You can adjust the FPV camera angle, add a Mobius or GoPro on top, then go fly your customized quadcopter.

Back to the landscapes.  There are many environments provided for you to fly.  Each one is very different from the others.  The first ""Straw Bale Field"" is wide open space with no trees (except for a few outside the fence).  The bales of hay provide a clear ground reference.  The next environment has tall pine trees so you can learn obstacle avoidance and more advanced maneuvers.  The next is flying inside one level of a parking garage to teach you to manage your altitude carefully.  There were several more beautiful environments (a pro football stadium, for example) but here is the beauty of all this... they keep giving you more environments as they are developed.  And the latest one, called Hannover, is like the bando heaven we all seek.  No people, just awesome open places to fly and hone your skills.  The windows have reflections, and the level of detail is as good as it gets. There are lots of areas filled with trees, different sizes, types and colors, with gaps both big and small, and not always predictable, to challenge your flying skills.

I have not ever used the Multiplayer feature, or competed in races, all of which I am sure are worlds in and of themselves, with a huge number of tracks available for download.  LIFTOFF has a builder feature which allows you to build your own track in any of the environments.  Tracks can be saved and shared.  I've build a few tracks, and honestly, it takes a while to learn how to move and place the flags, gates, and markers, but in the end, you have a really nice race track that is exactly what you need.  Then you go fly your own track, and since you can edit tracks, you can always come back later to make improvements and adjustments. 

In short, this simulator will make you a better pilot.  And it accurately portrays the experience of performing FPV quadcopter flying.  If you like the DRL product, you will enjoy LIFTOFF even more.

From the testing I've done there seems to be a large void between how each one feels and how close to the real thing they get, for example Liftoff seems to be more like an arcade game with the feeling I get from the controls, where it seems to have way to much punch the second you move the throttle stick. So just getting used to it isn't easy even when you fly in level/stability mode, it does get better in acro but the same issue with the punch power is still there. Like I've said I have several of these sims and the two I have found closest to real life are FPV Event and Velocidrone and it's because they both seem to be setup with real world physics. I fly a Robocat 270 racing drone and it has plenty of power and is capable of around 60/70 mph, and it feels nothing like the drones in Liftoff because they just shoot upwards like their on steroids.  And when it comes to the workbench screen I find the lack of contrast ridiculas because its hard to see whats on the screen unless im sat inches away from it, so I think the developers could take a look at changing the Font size and background colour to make it easier for people to be able to read the information either in the workbench parts description or the flight controller settings screen. Apaert from that I do think Liftoff has loads of scope to be improved and it will only take some tiny tweaks to get it close to a full on drone simulator, and at it's price point I do think it could be a whole lot better.  But if like me you are finding it hard to get your head around I would recommend trying some of the free ones like DRL simulator or the free trial of FPV Event, as like me you will notice just what I have, Liftoff is a great simulator but it's not quite real enough.",1488038302,1488038302,True,1,0,0.502487540245056152,1,True,False,True

I have tried other simulators such as DRL, Velocidrone and FPV Freerider recharged without much luck; either the physics engine felt wrong or was simply missing important aspects, the physics settings were awkward or the drones couldn't be tuned right. Liftoff excels in all of these areas. With a bit of knowledge in tuning and a little time spent selecting components you can get a quad in Liftoff to fly about as close to real life as any sim will provide at the moment. And I say this from experience with my real setup. I would thoroughly recommend that ANYONE who flies quads and has free time available in their day should get liftoff and spend some time getting it right and reap the benefits of this awesome sim. Props go to an awesome community of fliers and an amazing dev team that are dedicated to getting updates out regularly. See you on the race track :)

IT decides when you have flown too high or too far and warns you to turn back, yet even if you do so immediately it's fade to black, reset the game.

I initially started with this simulator, but it was too laggy to be any good, so I spent a solid 30 hours on Hotprops. Now that I have 6 months of real life FPV under my belt, I've found myself coming back to this sim. 

First of all, the physics are great. Being able to tweak so much in the flight controller settings has allowed me to set up my virtual quad pretty darn close to my Xhover Element. The only big problem I've noticed is that the sim can feel a bit too floaty, like any bit of throttle you give will keep you in the air much better than in the real world. Adjusting the throttle curve fixes this. 

The graphics aren't terrible, and I feel like the sim has gotten much smoother over time. I'm running it on my iMac and find that 720p graphics work the best. I also like the ability to play with FPV noise. It's not exactly like experiencing real breakup in your video feed, but it does the job pretty well. My biggest grip with the graphics is the way the trees appear. If you're flying fast at all, you'll find that they sort of just materialize right in front of you, making it hard to avoid wrecking on branches or shredding your props on leaves. 

With the more recent updates, you now have a whole bunch of frames to choose from. I'm really excited about this, although I can't say I feel a huge difference in the way the frames fly. As long as your motors, battery, and props are the same, the frames fly pretty much exactly alike, with the obvious exception of the much smaller frames that can only run 4"" or smaller props. 


So, what would I change? First of all, the crash physics are pretty bad. This isn't a huge deal, but there's something amusing about crashes with real life quads. One minute you're flying along fine, the next you're tumbling and bouncing across the ground. In the sim, you sort of hit the ground and slide, which isn't realistic at all. 

Next up, I would love to see some 5x4x3 props. The ""Propfan"" 5030x3 do a decent job of simulating the HQ 5x4x3's that I fly in real life, but they're definitely not the same. A proper 5"" tri blade with a little more bite in the air would be awesome. 

Next up, some larger areas to fly in would be fun. I'm not much of a racer, instead I do primarily freestyle flying. Levels like the Hangar are so much fun because of the vertical structures, so I would like to see more stuff like that. Maybe even a more urban environment like an abandoned factory or office park? 

The biggest thing I would change is the FPV camera lens option. First, I would move it to the workbench screen instead of in the settings screen. Next, I would add a 2.5mm option. I, like a lot of people, fly in real life with a GoPro lens on my HS1177 camera, which provides a superior field of view without the annoying fisheye effect that a 2.1mm lens has. 

All that being said, I highly recommend this simulator. It's a great way to knock the rust off if you haven't flown in a while, or to teach somebody new to fly.

EDIT: My original review was in March 2016, and after playing this game I did get into FPV, DEEEEEP... lol, and this sim really helped lock in important skills. I had another look today, and noticed a huge improvement in the tutorial, multiple pre-made quads and general polish across the board. I still can't dive the Hoover Dam, but give them time... Best FPV sim available!
======================================

This is coming from a hardcore gamer, looking to get into FPV drones because they look like fun,

I am enjoying the sim, it seems like a great way to learn how to fly before destroying an actual drone, and I could see it being a fantastic skill improving tool even when flying actual drones regularly. 

I just have a few things that need mentioning if this game is to be the ""gateway drug"" for gamers becoming FPV pilots, and surely that thought has crossed the devs minds.

Firstly, that tutorial is brutal. Maybe coming from a RC background it would be easier, but having never flown a quad-copter before, being put in a box with one window to exit from is the equivalent of learning to pick locks by handcuffing yourself underwater. A typical gamer will need at least half hour in a large open space, preferably with a guide and controller indications explaining how the drone works by performing simple maneuvers ie ""Take off, hover  at same altitude for 10 seconds"" ""Now fly forwards and backwards maintaining altitude"" etc until the basics are natural.

Next up, there really needs to be some sort of pre-made drones that handle differently for different levels of skill. Begin with a slow and sluggish drone that is forgiving and easy to fly, then work your way up as your skills improve. I know there is a workshop where I can edit my drone, and options to set motor speeds etc. but these should really be options I fiddle with after I have learned what is what, not while I am struggling to stay horizontal as I smash into another hay bale.

Speaking of hay bales. The maps. Seriously, I could be flying anywhere in the world, but here I am in some unbelievably dull locations. I am sure more maps are on the way, but even for RC enthusiasts this can't make much sense. Here are a few map ideas I would be excited to see in the final release:
Boat (sinking titanic?)
Music festival (maybe Woodstock?)
Theme Park
Hot Air balloon Show. (Take off from one balloon, and there are 30 others just floating about)
Construction tower.
Literally ANYWHERE! I understand that this is trying to be realistic, but a game like this also gives you the ability to do things you wouldn't usually be able to do, like fly in public areas full of people, or dangerous locations, and the lines required the fly for racing could be a lot more interesting than markers on the ground, like ducking behind a waterfall to emerge near a roller coaster track, which you must follow for while before shooting into a ghost train tunnel. Gimmicky? Yes, but if just a couple of unrealistic tracks were included, it would be a lot of fun.

TL;DR I am enjoying the game, and hope to see it become more approachable, without losing it's realistic simulation edge. I recommend for anyone interested in FPV drone racing.

The latest patch is great and I've not even had time to check out the multiplayer freeflight!  Definitely smoothed things up graphics wise.

It still takes a little tweaking to get the flight feel you want, but its very possible to get quite close to real life flight feel when using the same RC you normally use.

I highly recommend this to practice without risk of crashing your precious quads especially if you are like me and just starting out.  Even if the flight feel is not quite perfect you still pick up stick control skills that will pay dividends when you take your quads outdoors.

Oh and about the first one, while being long and detailed was wrong for the most parts soooo : 

Tl;dr : It is very good stuff. But. It's for racing / Freestyle drone, it's hard. In real life it can hurt, or cost money and time to crash so that's why we love a true simulator ;)

Liftoff is very good at what it tries to do, mimic the real world mechanics of immersion RC drones (it is sponsored guys, only immersion RC stuff here. They may add other options / Chassis in the future but right now there is only that)

Why you may want something else? You may ask. Well, I've build many quads since I started this hobby 18 months ago and they're all very, very, light now (250g at most without battery) and I don't know how much Immersion RC Drones weight when well equipped but they feel very heavy here (maybe 400g is my guess) But that's no real issue, it just flies a bit differently, it's less nimble, more inertia to fight against. (It might come from the game engine thought)

Something else : no 2.5mm lens it's a nice sweet spot between the Fishy mc fish eye 2.1 and the not that fishy 2.8mm lenses... just sayin'

The collision engine is a bit weird. I Hate it. But you millage may vary.

Noises are a tad off too but who cares?

It's pretty GPU intensive... Not that great looking (although still the best of its kind -.-') but don't try to play it at 4k above 60fps with a gtx 1080... I tried. Didn't work. Step down to 1440p

Not enough locations! I want Miami Beach, 'Bando Hotel, Roman Empire ruins, sick mountains, Chernobyl and what not... 

Oh and find a way to make your 4ch radio to work with the game. While it's playable -ish with an xbox 360 controller it can get very frustrating... not enough accuracy with these tiny sticks. :p

The quads auto throttle in this game.  I dont want it to auto throttle.. I want to control the throttle.   Once arming the drone for flight, your drone will automaticlly go up in the air and will continue to acend until you press down on your controller.  This is not how it should be.  The drone should not go up, unless i hit throttle up.. and when my sticks go to their center position, it should hover.  

I tried several presets, and both ATTI, and Level modes.  There is a built in preset for the Xbox One Controller for windows, but it auth throttles.

I made my own preset, and specifically set throttle up/down, and it still auto throttled.

So I figured I had better get my feet wet with some sim time before even attempting the real thing. Smart choice for me! lol
Didn't care to get some sim that was gonna try and cover ever form of flying - you know planes and all. Just some dedicated  sim for the quads kind. One where all efforts were single focused. Not one half-a__ed in all fields - but a killer in one.
I like Steam and after some surfing around and see all the other sims and the half-hearted reviews. One kept poking it's head out by some few as to how great liftoff is.
Went to Steam and bought. Been giggling ever since! Did some 360 controller hook-up and got my feet wet. I could see the tremendous effort hiding behind an inappropriate controller. A simulator just dying to be set free! The 360 controller is great for a lot of games. But one thing that become obvious really guick was the fact that it isn't configured right for real world flight. When you go thru the calibrating stage to run a controller that isn't a preloaded configuration, I found a major flaw with these controllers.
The little joy sticks don't travel in a ""square box"" perimeter pattern when you have to rotate them thru there full throw calibration. What I mean is that in a real flying situation and you have full left yaw and you want to keep that input and then throw full throttle at the same time (mode two throttle with yaw on the same left stick) when you push the little stick up for the full throttle it will end up moving to the right ( back to the middle) on the yaw axis to get to full throttle! That sucks! Not a ""real world"" condition. So the controller takes away a whole lot of these people's hard work when they created this really great simulator and the new pilot learns how to fly with some really crumby technique!
Now I want to get something like a Taranis grade transmitter. But i couldn't see spending a couple hundred on a transmitter that might get outdated by a new model by the time I learned to fly! Shopped around and took a gamble on a ""USB RC Flight Simulator RC Tech 6chn"" controller. UPS just delivered it today. So I plugged in and went caibrating with liftoff. Sure 'nuf the ""square"" pattern of sticks on the controller is what brought Liftoff to life! Let me tell you - talk about making you feel like what the real quad must feel like! If not it has to be so close that what ever difference there must be will be but an extremely small little hickup to learn in the actual flying.
Now I am pretty sure I don't have reverse throttle - but that can be fingered out at a latter date with maybe the help  of some serious tech guy. But this little cheap controller and this great Liftoff Simulator you can be come, I'm sure, a very competant pilot. Be able to strap on a real one and fly the first time out without digging a million postholes or chopping concrete up with an expensive quad. And probably at real close to racing speeds and manuveralbility.
So people go get the real controller and this Liftoff! Highly, highly recommended quad simulator - this thing rocks!!!!

I really think they should add some beginner race tracks, with big, forgiving gates.

Also, there's some bugginess with the prop damage, and the auto-reset doesn't always work (sitting there with no props left, and have to manually restart).  Not sure why they wanted to do prop damage the way they did.  You can accidentally just bounce a little on the ground when you go to lift off, and it'll damage your props.

For 20 bucks it isn't a bad place to get some core concepts of fpv drone flight down. I am currently enjoying using the almost stock vortex since the two blade props are a little easier for myself. I'm also using an Xbox 360 controller since I don't own a TX.

I can't speak on realism never having flown an fpv, but it feels close to what I would imagine how it would be minus any sort of wind.

Pros:
Customization of the drone itself
Good UI, but needs some tweaking for reliability with both controllers and kb/mouse
Prop damage (not realistic, but a good enough simulation of what might happen)
Feels generally good

Cons:
Very clear to still be in developement with a few bugs here and there
Immersion RC seems to own the game, but that also means you get to use a representation of real gear
No wind simulation

I'm currently sitting on 290 hours on Liftoff and continue to play it every day I can. There are a couple of ways you can approach Liftoff.. as a game, or a tool to use for practicing for real life flight. 

If you know you are serious about getting into this hobby, I strongly suggest taking the approach of treating it like a training tool. For example, like just about any other skill you can learn, its recommended that you get 1 hour of practice every day to improve your skills as much as possible. That's pretty much how I decided to approach Liftoff, which can even sometimes mean forcing myself to spend a bit flying around even if I don't want to... I know that sounds kind of silly when its simply a video game, but it's definitely payed off. 

I started playing Liftoff back at the start of the year, and flew in real life for the first time in July and was able to fly acro on my second flight. I'm not saying that to show off, but to show how amazing Liftoff has been for making it so someone can just go out IRL and be comfortable flying a drone at nearly 100km/h (60MPH) without even needing to leave the house.

If you are in the category of being interested in FPV but you're not too sure, I'd suggest just buying a cheap transmitter, or even use an xbox controller with a rubber band on the left stick holding it downwards like I first did and see how you are feeling at about the 20 hour mark. That may sound like a lot for just testing a game but you really need to give it a chance until you are able to get your finger coordination down and can start feeling a bit more smooth with your flight.

If at any point something ""clicks"" and you realize how much you love it, I'd say start saving as much as you can for a taranis transmitter, or just go out and buy one if you can afford it. This will probably be the best investment you'll make getting into this hobby as you'll be able to use it down the track when you start flying IRL.

I don't want to make this too long, so in summary, Liftoff is most likely one of the best investments I have ever made in my life just because of how much money it's saved me. If I had gone out and gotten to the level of flying I'm at now by just flying IRL, then I have no doubt I'd be about 5-10,000 dollars short by now. If I were to add up the costs of the crashes I've had in Liftoff, it would literally be hundreds of thousands of dollars worth.. so if you have seen some FPV videos on youtube, and you are interested I really doubt you'll regret making this purchase.

and finally, thanks LugasStudios for this great piece of software. <3

Liftoff has already surpassed the other sim for quadcopter physics. Even though it is in early access and is very short of it's eventual goal it is a strong tool for honing quad skills. I have 50 + hours in this sim and being winter where I am I feel my learning is progressing very rapidly. I feel like my second summer flying quads will be very fulfilling having a better sense of control thanks to this sim. The developers are very interested in user input and come through with regular updates. I am very excited for the future of this sim. Highly recommend for anyone interested in multirotor flight!

Update!
I just crossed the 300 hour mark with Liftoff. I started flying quads mid summer 2015 and only flew in level mode. Even though I used that mode I still had crashes. I spent some of the winter flying Liftoff in acro mode and improved to a great degree in that time. I have had quite a few flights this summer and only fly acro (Take off, flight, and Landing), and I now fly as if I have been flying for much longer than 1 and a half seasons. I have made many Liftoff videos to demonstrate it's power as a learning tool.
I can attest, after spending so much time in the sim, that anyone having a problem with this simulator is falling victim to either their own ignorance or outdated hardware. To speak to the later I feel that hardware non-upgraders are the bain of all gamers. If you are on an old laptop or a weak one for that matter you should naturally expect to have issues with games not working correctly. Upgrade or die! Seriously if you are one of these people realize you are holding us all beack. Please stop crying about games not working on your decrepit outdated machines. To the former; Why review a game poorly before you exhaust all efforts to learn the customizations? Sims always throw arcaders off. Just because you can't fly easily right off the bat doesn't mean it's broken. It means you currently lack the skill required to keep it in the air. This is remedied one of two ways. 1. Spend time learning to tune the aircraft by a. watching videos from people that have put in the work to help people such as yourself. b. experimenting a while reserving judgment until you figure things out. 2. Un-install the sim and go find something arcadish and easier made for people just like you. 
 Also why is it that some people forget the simple fact that this is an EARLY RELEASE title? Common sense dictates that it won't be perfect and that it is still under development. Updates for this and all other early access titles can sometimes have negitive affects. Be prepared for that. New resources for liftoff are added at a more than acceptable rate IMO. Further more the developers respond to questions in quick fasion. This sim/game is living up to it's potential in all areas, improving all the time.
 To any prospective buyer please note that you will need some sort of a game controller to fly Liftoff. A keyboard will not work. Seems obvious but... 
To get the best experience a interlink radio that comes with realflight or a game commander that comes with aerofly can be used and the buttons and switches can be used to switch modes or reset the aircraft. The gimbals aren't the best but this will provide the most in-game support of functions. The Sim supports field radios (remote controllers for real world aircraft) The easiest and best of these is the Taranis X9D/plus. This radio has a mini usb port on the back that makes it a perfect option for this and other sims like it. Liftoff has a preset for this controller as well. Even though it is perfect for the sim you will need to program the radio to work correctly. There is a guide for this and many other radios. That said not all radios play nice and there is nothing the developer can really do about that.
 I own all the other quad racing sims out there and this hands down is the best and the other sims are complete products not under development.

okay *game* but simulation it isn’t.

no aerodynamic model, hence no ground effect, very floaty gravity, some motors behave oddly in response to throttle.

damage system just hopeless, sometimes clip a leaf and seconds later a prop falls off, other times you can make leaf salad without damage… why bother with damage that effects flight dynamics if you damaged an actual quad that much you’d just stop flying even in a race.

vtx must be 1 kilowatt to punch video through that many trees over such distance, some really unrealistic levels.

Sliding on the ground (which has the same friction as ice) will slightly damage a prop instead of the prop digging in and flipping you chaotically.

The game might help you improve real life flying but equally could leave you with bad habits.

There are race tracks set up that you can blast through in Self level or Acro mode (toggled by pressing the A key).  There isnt much choice in the way of Quads to choose from, but in FPV mode it makes almost no difference what frame you use.  The motor, prop, battery selection in the workbench is very good. Lobster motors, quiet clever. 

I love God mode, changing props, batteries etc is for Actual reality, dispencing that chore triples your play time.

The physics are right on the money for my experience.  I have always used self level mode (comming from a Photography/Phantom background)  and I would almost never used full throttle but spending 10 hours on this in Acro mode and full throttle upto 60% of the time..... and I dont think I will go back to self level on mini quads, except maybe in the carpark level, thats pretty enclosed for me at the moment.

I have my graphics set to HD and on Good (on a laptop). It is smooth enough to weave around on the forest level at speed, the depth of field is sufficent to pick a good line through the trees.

Lift off is handly learning tool or something to help you get a flying fix on a rainy weekend.

I found it was alittle trick to set up my controller but there is a tonne of videos on how to get it going, so a bit of paitence goes along way.

You can use you own music where you kind of load it into Steam. It wasnt as easy as it could be but I did get a couple of tracks working so I could get in my ""Zone"".

Is it worth the money, well yes.  They have made a couple of updates which included an extra track, which is something you would have to pay extra for on a small mobile device. I have read they are activley working on multi player which would be pretty fun.  And it means you can fly with a bunch of friends with out all of you having to by expensive Base stations and those low wattage VTx's.

What I would like to see is Eagle mode.  Where you have to pitch your flying skills against Natures finest...

I bought this game first day it came out.  Played with it for 3mins and it was in such poor shape I gave it up. Before <LuGus Studios> cries, I will explain why I felt it was so bad.
1. my futaba didnt work with it and yes I have all the tools I needed. 
2. my t8j didnt work with it...ok, so I pulled out my xbox controller and played.... phyics sucked,  graphics was OK....but eh...the realisticity of a fpv game is all about the phyics...so if the phyics sucks, the game sucks, 
so...there I left it untouched and fly my real stuff. 
recently, I found that freerider recharged is out. I loved the 1st one so much I had to buy the 2nd one. ehh, guess what freerider recharged is awesome! it felt great. When I crash, the quad resets instantly where in liftoff you gotta wait or reset it manually. (hate it)
after hours and hours of the new freerider, I decided to update liffoff and give it 1 more try.
hahaha! hey! it supports my T8J now! 
so I got it all setup.....played for abit .... 
1. phyics is still bad...at least in freerider I can tune it so it feels real enough,....
2. picking your quad parts is the worst......they are not even real, except of IRC products. lol ok.....I get it...this game is powered by them...still...
3. I have a pc many people can only dream of and its still a slow loading game. 
4. I dont want to embarass you but Im in the I.T industry and I know what Im doing. I placed my files in the right folders and they just dont show up in the game. I dont wanna have to reinstall it to try coz its not worth the time. #123 explains it all. 

You want a better review? here you go. 
""There's no reason why you should not be able to load custom maps. This is a user error, not an issue with the software.""            well, I am telling you there is. 

I said ""not bad"" coz I love fpv and Im sure you guys love it as much as I do. There was my respect for you guys. 
 My true thoughts? 
it is a poorly developed game. you guys made fpv boring. that is hard to do. 

I gave it a thumbs down coz that is my opinion.

I PREFER PLAYING FREERIDER OVER THIS GAME.

The games starts with the controls screen and you have to input what you want to use for what straight away. Not the most intuitive menus either. It then throws you into the main menu. Not as bad as the controls menu, makes sense. I thought the game might be hard so I started with the tutorial.

Sweet lord christ. Stupid tutorial. One of the worst I’ve ever played. Doesn’t tell you how to do anything, just what it wants you to achieve. Completely pointless.

After that, I tried to fight for what felt like most of my life before I could get the drone to kinda go in the direction I wanted it to go. I thought this would probably be good enough for the first race as it would probably be really easy. I was very wrong. The first race is astonishingly hard. And you have to do 3 laps without crashing. When I finally finished the course three times in a row (After enabling god mode in the gameplay options.) I was met with my three times and a total time. That’s all. I have no idea how well I did in that race. Probably really badly but that’s not the point. I then attempted an underground parking lot level that was ridiculous, quite honestly.

Regardless of all this, I’m going to recommend it because me sucking at the game does not mean it’s a bad game. However, this could be 100000000x better if the respawn times were WAY faster. Super-meat-boy fast. Really really fast.

So, overall, the music got on my tits, the controls got on my tits, the insane difficulty got on my tits but it’s still a good game already.

FreeRider for comparision - feels like driving a bus - slow and heavy. There are already examples of people learning to fly in LiftOff and taking skills outside and flying real racing quadcopters succcesfuly! 



After some time spend adjusting values in Player.xml file I have achieved behaviour which is very close to TheX I have build. It may not be a Vortex but it's fast, agile and on rails! 
For some still will be floaty but that more less like my copter is with HQ6045 cos is light and powerful. Mass can be changed a bit more but it will affect speed, lift and drift - more mass more drift. Rates are more personal settings so go ahead and adjust them to your liking.

Nice application, but the current Version has some flaws

First the positive things:
- Works perfect with my Real Flight Elite Controler
- Flightfeeling is very realistic. The copter reacts like real copter. The simulation is very realistic.
- You can use it for learning and training 
- You can change the setup of the copters in many ways, PID, Props etc. and you can do an expo setup for you controler to make a setup which works like your real world setup.

Some things which a really bad (in the pre-alpha!)

 If you set you screen to a low resolution the fonts and the dialogs doesn't scale. So everything is unreadable. This is very bad, cause you can't make any changes. For realistic training, I use a small 8"" HDMI monitor with a resolution of 720p or lower. This gives a realistic flight situation. But then, it is impossible to do any changes. I always must switch back to my office monitor change the resolution to the changes and then change everything back. This need some fixing.

There is a beginners training mode, but the colors are so terrible. Light blue walls and white bottom. This is so crazy. There is no contrast in the colors. I never used this, cause it is nothing for beginners :-)

I think this a alpha problems which can be fixed.

Facit: If it goes to the final stage this app will be the the best training app you can get for race training. Please make a final version soon as possible (before the next winter :-)

Greetings 

BTW: I read some reviews of people who have no understanding who the acro mode works. This is a simulation game with real pyhsiks. Yes, it is hard to learn at the beginning, also in the real world.

 We've had pretty great communication with the DEVS and community members using the Discussions forums as well as the in-game error reporting features. Several users have expressed issues with Transmitters not calibrating correctly or at all with the software.  If you have an RC Transmitter, there are a few guides already posted and several discussions with topics discussing how we've worked through some of those matters - but there are ultimately a LOT of cables and variances in how they're produces, and even more Transmitters that users have. If you're  having errors connected, post it and let's get you flying!  I personally have a Spektrum DX6, DX6i, Taranis Plus, and Turnigy 9x and all work well using a USB cable. The Spektrum devices took several calibration attempts, and then additional Sub-Trim manipulation, but work well after.

* * * * * * * *
All around - I am really excited to see how they progress with this game. The 3 current levels are already beautiful and the multiplayer is going to be very exciting. Two thumbs up! (Then back to the joysticks!)

Note: While this game does work decently with 360 or similar gaming controller, I do not recommend spending time to get used to it. Gaming joysticks are meant to center themselves when you release pressure. This is ideal for most game situations, but not with throttle. While I did use the 360 controller for the tutorial and first test level, and it was decent enough, once got my Spektrum transmitter connected to the game and calibrated - it was a night and day difference. Much easier flight, it was much more fun and it was much smoother feedback from the camera also as you won't be bobbing up and down.

This will be a must have for pilots that want the FPV experience without ruining their setups or going through tons of props in the early learning stages. Would also be great for teaching purposes.

WARNING: To play this game, you MUST have a game controller with the analog stick that supports range detection (Like a PS2/XBox controller) or a quad copter transmitter that can be connected to your computer.

Liftoff early-access is a simulator for flying a drone, or quad copter in one of the most fun ways, FPV (first person view).  Imagine being a little bird able to fly and swoop in and out of trees, buildings, underneath bridges, etc.  That is what this simulator and what FPV flying is all about.

Liftoff is early-access and is already worlds above every other simulator out there, and it's just barely getting started.  I get the feeling that this game will build a huge passionate community around it, taking all of our passion for the sport, and allowing us a digital medium to share the art of flying and to practice our skills when we can't fly (when our copters are broken or it's night time).  When it is finally release, if this dream is fully imagined, it will allow us to challenge one another to unique challenges unable to be done in reality such as fly in areas that are generally off-limits for FPVers (like in a big city, or an airport, or around an ancient mosque).

If you're interested in getting into flying a drone in first-person-view (FPV), definitely get this.  When you can comfortably fly through the gates in the easy level, then go buy a copter and you won't be (immediately) breaking it so badly as most people do when first trying to get into the sport.  If you're ALREADY a FPV'er, and need to practice up on your skills, definitely get this.  Just flying it a couple hours already has significantly improved my IRL abilities, since IRL it's difficult to get that much consecutive time to fly (because of changing batteries/fixing parts/etc).",1448692586,1448692586,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The tutorial level is really confusing and hard to tell where stuff is because the whole of the map is the same colour with no definition or shadows. I was playing the tutorial for ages not getting anywhere with my skill. But then I played the actual maps. The forest is the best map because it’s fun and easy! After playing on the forest map for a short time I really got the hang of the controls and synched all the other maps including the carpark witch is apparently the hardest. The graphics are stunning when camera sound is off, terrific use of shadows.

Contra
- workbench is still very limited with the best lipo being a nanotech 45c and the best prop being a 5045 Gemfan carbon fibre. I fly HQ triblades or HQ 6045 paired with 70c Thunderpower lipos, so there's a huge difference in power

The current three maps it comes with are quite good. The first map has proper sized racing gates, which is exactly what this kind of sim should have. The racing module is not yet there, but I have very high hopes considering how much fun I had doing laps of the field through the gates.

The pine wood map is also great fun, and I especially enjoyed this as I prefer to take my real Vortex into a pine wood quite often.

I think the quad sound needs to be worked on a bit.

I have tried Freerider and Hotprops and Liftoff is by far a much easier game to configure and get straight into the action.
Love the options to adjust rates, PIDS etc. very nice touch.  

Perhaps in final release we can have some different frame sizes, especially the 180 class.

Overall, as an Alpha game I give it 4 out of 5",1447212718,1447212718,True,5,1,0.545956134796142578,2,True,False,True

-What does not fit in any case is the Gravity she is not realistic.

-Full throttle flying feeling is to drive a Train on rails, no shocks no vibrations... and just not feeling right for Racing. 

-The sound it is much too high as if it is a 3-4 x speedup from the original Vortex Sound.

-It would be nice also an original ImmersionRC Vortex OSD.

-The RC Setup loses its setting 

Look at videos and compares it.

Note for Taranis users: after you select the Taranis option on the main screen, go into your control and go to the INPUTS page, and set the weight and offset of Ail, Ele, Thr, and Rud to 50.

The graphics are good compared to FPVFreerider and the interference effect in the camera is nice but you can feel dizzy after a while, but at least it can be deactivated.

There are alot things to do.. but LuGus Studios are on a good way!

Maybe you could make some manuals about how to setup some transmitters? 
I tried to use my Turnigy 9x with SmartPropo Plus (PPM connection to PC) and it works.. but i think there is a better way to setup my transmitter... but well I´m interested what happen next! especially the multiplayer races (not implemented jet).",1447104833,1447104833,True,8,0,0.593775331974029541,4,True,False,True
