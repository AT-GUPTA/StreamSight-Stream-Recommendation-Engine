DREDGE’s scope is strongly defined, its aesthetic is consistent, and its gameplay is well-realised.

You awaken in Little Marrow after crashing your boat into the rocks that flank the town, indebted - both metaphorically and financially - to the townsfolk who rescued you. What follows is a dozen hours of fishing mini-games, inventory management, and exploration, guided by the game's story - an understated, mysterious, lovecraftian tale of tragedy, which is intriguing if a little conventional.

The gameplay is enjoyable enough - checking off the list of sea-dwellers in the encyclopaedia is satisfying, and the seafaring is pleasantly tactile - but it doesn't take long for the fishing mini-game to become a repetitive task. Creatures have one or more aberrational variants, each a manifestation of the eldritch forces that loom over the world, and further variety is added through the different biomes, requirements for catching specific fish, and how well you are able to maintain your sanity in the wake of witnessing otherworldly abominations.

Creaking pontoons, clacking winches, and swelling waves help deliver the atmosphere of the game effortlessly, along with the often serene and occasionally unsettling score. Depictions of strange fish reveal the unspeakable terrors from the deep: voids where eyes should be, blistered and bubbling scales, and grotesque many-mouthed beasts.

On a technical level the game performs wonderfully. It's evident that the resources required aren't anything remarkable but it's still nice to see such a smooth experience. I played on Steam Deck mostly, with a little time spent on PC, and never ran into any issues. Despite Steam telling me otherwise, the game worked perfectly with a DualSense controller and displayed the correct button prompts.

Though the majority of your time is spent engaging with 'cosy' gameplay mechanics, they coalesce effortlessly with the horror aspects to deliver a rewarding experience that makes DREDGE a game well worth playing.",1702311160,1708965557,True,17,2,0.690672695636749268,0,True,False,False

The game itself is well made, I encountered no technical issues during my play-through and it overall was a pleasant experience. The fishing mechanics all worked well and the boat itself was fun to pilot around the various environments.

I think there are 3 main areas that disappointed me about this game

1: The eldritch horror elements were much less intrusive than I expected based on the media + hype. Don't go into this thinking that Horror is a big part of this game, it isn't, the madness mechanic is extremely easy to avoid altogether. But the mechanic also doesn't seem to actually do much.

2: Upgrades overall were not particularly interesting. Most of the upgrades in the game consisted of very linear progressions that didn't present the player with many meaningful choices as to what they should invest in. There are certain fishing mechanics that overall felt like they could be avoided if all you are wanting to do is finish the main story.

3: Upgrades largely rely on you randomly finding certain resources. Mechanics like these frustrate me in general as I do not feel like they are entirely rewarding. While it may be thought that ""random drops"" can be a fun player experience, for me personally, they just present a source of frustration as I attempt to find whatever it is I need to obtain the next upgrade and progress through the game.

Additionally there were a few quests that asked you to find a particular fish. However there is no way to actually locate which fish you would like to target, contributing to this issue of randomness that I have with the game. It really feels like a lot of the random elements of the game were primarily put in place to somewhat artificially extend the length of the overall experience. The game could have just as easily been half the length with the random elements toned back. I believe this would have made the overall package tighter and more cohesive.

With these being said, I do not believe that a non-recommendation is warranted. I did in general enjoy my time with the game, although as I got closer to the end I found myself focusing more on just finishing the game to move onto other things. 

Overall, yes the game is worth a play, just make sure your expectations are tempered with the knowledge that most of the hype (as always) has somewhat warped what this game actually is. Dredge is a game where you fish in some weird places, meet some odd individuals, fish up some normal and not-so normal fish.

You play as a fisherman in an archipelago beset by Lovecraft-inspired horrors from the deep. Gameplay switches between relaxing fishing on the high seas, to intriguing exploration, to tense monster attacks, often without much warning.

The game is pleasantly short - it ended just as it started to outstay its welcome, and was generally well-paced throughout. If you're looking for something to sink a lot of time into, this probably isn't the game for you. I beat the main campaign + dlc in about 10 hours then stuck around to catch every fish and find collectibles I missed. 

I didn't encounter a single bug, graphical or gameplay, at any point so it's very well polished. The visual style, although not exactly original (for an indie game) is charming. The music never really stood out apart from the accordion stuff that plays on the traders shanties, but was pleasant throughout. 

The game can be surprisingly atmospheric - although it never quite achieves genuine 'horror', I genuinely got the shivers a few times out in the open ocean, wondering what might be lurking below. Sadly, the game kinda shoots itself in the foot on its horror by (very minor spoilers) putting a big red glow on every monster, so nothing ever sneaks up on you in the dark foggy nights. I'm not entirely sure why the devs made that descision, as I think the game would be legitimately frightening otherwise. I guess they didn't want to commit to making a true horror game, which is fine, as the fishing and exploration is very fun even without the Lovecraft stuff. 

Story was meh, very much what you'd expect for the genre, but piecing it together was nonetheless pretty fun. 

tl;dr

a relaxing fishing game that occasionally tries (and usually fails) at being spooky. I think a few tweaks and a couple new monsters would do it wonders, but nonetheless a strong recommend so long as you aren't explicitly looking for a horror experience.

1. Game is just too short even with the Pale Reach DLC, yet it has a great implicit lore which has great potential for expanding. A DLC expanding on the lore would be awesome.
2. After you beat the game there is simply nothing to do other than side quests and maybe catching trophy fishes, which gets old quickly. Things such as a skyrim-inspired radiant quest system, a challenge mode and/or a biome specific random event/encounter would neatly complement the open ocean exploration theme in the game.

If you're looking for a horror experience in the vein of HP Lovecraft, this is not it. This is an HP Lovecraft inspired story but captures none of the dread or malevolence of his horror works, it'd be on the same shelf as a Cthulhu plushie.

As for the game...it's okay. Not terribly exciting. There are a lot of seeds for interesting gameplay but ultimately it doesn't do much with it. You sail around, you fish with QTEs, you bypass a handful of simple puzzles, you win the game. It looks pretty, it's fun sailing the boat sometimes, the artwork is nice, the music's nice but everything is pedestrian.

I think my overall criticism of this game is that it's boring. It's good enough that you might finish it, but you may ask yourself afterward why you bothered.

I absolutely HATE fishing in every single game I have ever played.  But in this game it was fun.  As you fish and zoom around in your boat, you'll discover all sorts of fish and slowly discover the secret to the mysterious island where not all is as it seems.

Sometimes these games can feel grindy, but not once did I feel like I was needing to farm endless resources or trapped in a time sink doing some other meaningless activity.  As I progressed through the story, the boat gets upgraded, and at no point did anything feel significantly out of reach.

It's a great little game and at 12 hours for me from start to finish - it felt like the perfect amount of time.  

Sometimes you just need a game that you can switch off to and enjoy.  This game was that for me, and I truly recommend anyone who wants to enjoy a casual game with some fun don't starve-esque vibes.

The game is full of beautiful scenery and you can choose just to chill in the day in the safe zones watching orcas, dolphins, and turtles pass by while you fish (though to complete the story you'll need to venture into dangerous zones too).  

Day time fishing will also reflect real world weather (thunderbolts and lighting not very very frightening for me!)

At night it gets creepier with ghost boats, giant angler fish, and other potential hazards. Some areas will be annoying until you learn the tricks but there's lots of helpful guides.

I was really excited when I first saw this game and I decided to buy it. It starts of promising, with a bunch of slightly repetitive side quests, all with deeper mysteries intertwined with them-or so I thought. As I continued playing, I got all the upgrades, but basically none of the quests done. My ship was tier 4, max everything, and I was a little bit bored. I found myself only playing for a little bit before struggling to find something to do. Maybe I progressed wrong? Whenever I try to complete a side quest, I have to get a certain fish, or certain item, and sometimes it's really hard to get them. Why am I leaving a positive review even though I am not enjoying this game very much? Well, the game really redeems itself with its beautiful graphics, and intriguing main story. I like the idea of the game being peaceful during the day, but dangerous at night, and it does that part well. The monsters are... good. They can deliver a good jumpscare sometimes, and you really always feel like you need a new engine to run away from them. After finishing the upgrades, I don't dredge very often anymore, but I will still to complete a quest. I like the idea of the game, I just have a few problems here and there.
I will update my review once I finish this gem of a game. The fishing mechanics are lots of fun! There is a good variety of types, and I find myself striving to be better at them. Abilities are fun, unlocking new ways to play as you progress through the story. They are pretty cool, and I use them quite often.
Overall, I recommend this game. I love the idea behind it, but the upgrading and progression system seems lacking to me. It can be a good ""kick-back-and-relax"" game, if you only go out at day. It is a good horror game if you go out at night! I recommend this game to those who like fishing games with twist! Hey, and at least it gets frequent updates.

I watched a play through of it and my answer became a resounding YES!!  I have spent almost 24 hours on it and I am by no means done.

It is a cozy, curl up and enjoy on a rainy evening sort of game with great ""horror"" elements that I think are perfectly placed.  If you want some adventure, but not too much combat - this is for you.  Half the time I just had fun ""fishing"" and spent hours just doing that and searching for new types of fish.  Once I completed the game, if you can call it that, now I am going back to fill in some holes...complete some side quests and just have fun with it.

I played with a controller (highly recommended) and found the gameplay and UX was pretty darn good.  Intuitive, fun and never becoming boring or tedious.  I also think that some of the game has superb replay ability - I am still finding quests that I missed the first time.  Even if you complete them all, it's still a fun - and animal safe - fishing game that can be enjoyed for a long time.",1708541531,1708541531,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the artwork.
I love the music and sound effects.
I love that I can play in short sessions and not feel like I won't remember where I was when I get back. 
I love the slow burn, and build up of dread as the sun starts to go down, but I just have to try for one more fish or one more piece of scrap metal.

The economy is tight- but not unbalanced. If you are low on cash for upgrades or repairs you can go close to home to fish or throw out crab pots and make money at a decently fast pace.
I don't feel rushed into doing anything- the quests have no timers, I finish one whenever and the next one unlocks.
I can explore and get to know the map at my own pace.
End up smashing my boat to smithereens? The game lets me load up my last save or start over again- my choice.
You can turn off the scary stuff if you want to. I don't want to- the encounters add to the creepy Lovecraftian atmosphere. But if you don't like jump scares, or you have a younger child who wants to watch you play or wants to try it themselves- it's a nice option to be able to turn off the really freaky scary stuff.

The game has some good accessibility options, though the color palette the game uses *may* be an issue for people with certain forms of color-blindness.
The story and dialogue is all in text with no voice-overs, so it should be quite playable for Deaf and HoH gamers, though you will miss some subtle audio clues or prompts before monster attacks or wildlife encounters.
The story is delivered in small bits- no lengthy walls of text to deal with. It helps to click through every dialogue option, but they are all fairly short, easy to read and using language that doesn't require an advanced college degree.
The puzzles vary from easy to slightly challenging- trying to get things to fit neatly in your inventory or at shrines. But none have been brain-melters.

It runs really well on an older gaming laptop (with a discrete GPU), an older mid-range desktop, and a beefy newer desktop. I suspect it would run smoothly on a toaster, but I don't have one to test it on. As long as you have a dedicated discrete GPU, and you meet minimum specs (though I always recommend exceeding them, even just a little). No idea how it will run on a laptop with only a integrated chipset.

The only thing that bothers me is how quickly the day cycle runs- day to night a little too quickly. So you'll have to really think about how long fishing or dredging takes if you don't want the nighttime stress and madness to hit you. Remember to dock and sleep to stay sane.

Really enjoying the game, and I can and will whole-heartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a game that isn't high action, is a slow-burn kind of game, requires a little brain power, but isn't overly complex, and that has a really great immersive atmosphere that lets the dread settle in slowly and deeply.

(quick edit to fix some typos only- no changes to the text.)

I'm thinking of getting the DLC and replaying it again for the third time to see if it helps?? But I want so much more of this, feels like it falls to short and its so sad because this game is that good. I hope the developers do more with this game, or setting at least.
I can be very picky about games, I can get bored quickly, but this holds special place in my part. Everything its trying to achieve it does so well. If you looking for a good game to zone out and simply fish with a cool twist of the setting involving horror, this is your go to.

The music was subtle which fits the game well, but probably wouldn't stand on its own for most.  The collection mechanics are engaging for those that like multiple aspects to their collections.  The quests were fun but rather guided, being told exactly what to do and where to go most of the time which it seems like a missed opportunity in a game that has you exploring the open ocean for different objectives.  I was surprised the map was completely charted for you which would've added something a little extra for the exploration piece of the game so go into it knowing that geographic discovery is not the focus of this game.  All in all, Dredge was enjoyable, but the gameplay loop became a bit of a slog towards the end as the gameplay varies very little after a few short hours into the game.

Fishing in games is a difficult thing to get right, and I feel that Dredge does it pretty well. Progression and pacing is good, and nothing feels out of reach. The art style of the physical world and the portraits of the characters are all beautiful.
All of that being said, I have some problems with Dredge. Night fishing rarely feels worth it beyond what you need for quests early and mid game, and crab pots are somewhat annoying to work with for me. 
The story and world of Dredge starts strong, having the player ask many questions and giving few answers. But it's that ""few answers"" that doesn't change throughout the game, with only more questions popping up as the game goes on and fewer answers. The whole story just feels as though it is lacking something, not everything needs to be explained, but it would be nice to get more than we got. Why are the fish corrupted? What made the night so dangerous in the first place? What is the deal with the collector? Too much is left up to the imagination which leads to the ending being extremely confusing and underwhelming.
The DLC, The Pale Beach, shows all of this clearer than anything else. There are a total of 5 quests and each is rather underwhelming, isolated from the rest of the story, and grants exactly 1 answer to any of the questions asked during the DLC.

Whilst I do enjoy the simplicity of the game, I'm personally not much of a reader and much prefer voices. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not for me. 

The story line left me with a lot of questions that I felt were unanswered.

Now on to the good stuff. 

I loved the story! I was wondering what the townsfolk were talking about when speaking of what I believed was a familiarity to someone else. It was until later in the story line when a startling revelation came to light. 

The graphics are fun and almost cutesy, where they could've been grotesque or gothic. I find the graphics to be a stark contrast to the story and I really do have to remind myself that this is a 'horror' game. 

My main love for this game is the collect-a-thon, which I know isn't everyone's cup of tea, including me, but Dredge really made me want to complete my journal, finish all quests and everything else.

Jokes aside, this game has solid mechanics and dynamics that work together, giving the right amount of progression, customization, exploration and danger. I definitely recommend it.

However, If you go in expecting a high dose of Lovecraftian horror (like I did), you might be disappointed. If I had to criticize anything, it would be the weird - almost conflicting - relationship of this game's mechanics and its fiction/context. Sure, this can be said for a great deal of games, but it is extremely glaring here.

Suffice to say: you might get sucked into optimizing this game's systems and enjoying a great fishing boat game without really realizing it has a story with fictional horror elements. 

My point being: the devs did an amazing job, that I thoroughly recommend, but did they achieve the experience they intended?

I thought the open ocean fish were going to be the hardest... at the end I had 10 crab pots going to get the Volcano Snail aberration. I was getting a ton of money every day but it took close to 7-10 days in-game for the RNG to produce what I needed. So there are some RNG mechanics that come with collecting everything. 

You could probably finish much quickly than this but I ended with roughly $35.8k, all flags and paints unlocked, all achievements completed and a vessel with a Boat Speed of 121.5 kn, Fishing Speed of 569%, Lights 5k lm, Aberration Bonus 12%, Running only fishing rods to get 7 Fish Types but could swap to Trawl Nets and Crab Pots.

[h3]Game Review Score[/h3]
That being said here is my score for the Cthulu-lite fishing game and why:

- The music and audio were fantastic (10/10). The cues for danger were on point and the transitions between zones felt seemless even though the Open Ocean areas add a huge buffer which makes it easy. Still there is a reason I bought the soundtrack to the game!

- Animation was on point (8/10). Other nautical games can go overboard on how much a boat rocks but the fishing aspect to the game wasn't affected really at all because it was nautical in comparison to games like Sea of Thieves. The only reason I picked that was that the 3D nature of the game. Since everything happens from the boat or in narrative form, there is no time that you really need to animate a character. I did wish there were cutscenes for the vision portions (described more later).

- There was enough variety in the types of fish (7/10) that you were collecting or catching that the mini-games had variety. Still I didn't love it enough to pick up the DLC to get 100% on Steam for achievements. FYI - 83% Steam Achievement Completion is equivalent to 100% completion for the base game. The aberration forms were super fun and great additions. Reading the descriptions really was great. The RNG wasn't the best so you did have to farm the open ocean fish (Sunfish, Moonfish, Sailfish) and some of the crab pots (Volcano Snail).

- The story or plot throughout is really narrative driven (8/10). If you want everything like all the visions (again narrative, no cutscenes) then you have to lean into the Cthulhu nature of the game to empower the black basalt altars. I wasn't following a guide so I didn't know this until much later on. The clues you get for what actually happens/happened are connected in the NPCs you talk to, the notes and letters you recover. This isn't a fighting game so typically if it is bigger than you, run away... Conceptually it fits the genre but it does get boring after a while. Won't get into much detail to avoid spoilers and spoiler tags.

- Other mechanics were generally good (6/10). Using your spyglass to locate the right fish was huge. There was a treasure map (3 pieces) in-game that was underutilized. Conceptually great but it was used only once and reward was forgettable which was sad. After completing the game and looking at other guides and reviews, I realized that I am grateful that I waited until later to do the timed optional side quests with the 4 cloaked figures.  If you don't time them right, you can lose the perks you get from them and then lose the optional side quest achievement unlocked. The cloaked figures don't play an overly important role but their narrative descriptions were the most Lovecraftian in nature in game so I felt like there was a missed opportunity to lean the MC more towards or away from the various sides in this story but that wasn't a thing even though there are two possible endings.

Overall - (7.8/10) Fits the genre but wish there was more to it than just fishing and collecting. Due to that, this game feels like it fits more into the cozy game genre than other Cthulhu or Lovecraft horror games. Music, art, narrative were all good to great. RNG always sucks but as you upgrade your boat as quickly as possible the world becomes easier to transverse so it starts to feel like a time sink which is never good but it didn't ruin the game. If you don't want to take your time and you want to speed through, probably not the game for you. Does it require a ton of time? No but like I mentioned, this is more cozy game than traditional horror. Also, cut scenes would have been appreciated similar to the endings themselves but the writing made up for it.",1708124767,1708124767,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a bit shallow, no pun intended, though. And you'll run out of stuff to upgrade, find and buy many hours before the end if you're going for 100% completion like I did. With quite a few of those hours for me being just the RNG nature of... well, fishing up all varieties of fish. 

Still, that was mostly a mild nitpicks. This game is going to stick with me for quite a while, and I'd buy a sequel in a heartbeat.

I had seen the artstyle and some of the creatures, and I was sold. I bought the game, and it was an amazing experience. Like I said, the artstyle was very unique. It was really... grungy? That how it feels when I look at it. It looks ugly in some parts but I mean that in the best way possible. It looks ugly on PURPOSE, that's the point. I think what kept me around was the world. It felt so real. Conflicts between people, rescuing people, or just chatting with people on the docks. Not to mention the creative monster designs. one of my favorites being the angler fish that disguises itself as the boat. The atmospheric tracks as well really help set the mood of each area. That calming Greater Marrow dock theme, to the wonderfully mysterious ""The Path To The Door"" (my favorite track in the game), the game does leaps and bounds on world building. The game play loop is also addicting as hell.

The main issue is that the game feels so dead. I'm roughly 2/3rds through the game and I've never seen another boat at sea. Of the various biomed only the starting town felt like a real ""locale"". The others are all dead except for the same ubiquitous merchant that shows up everywhere. 

The biomes, including the pale reach DLC, are all the same formula. Complete a fetch quest to unlock navigation, which allows you to complete more fetch quests. 

Fishing is fun but you only ever sell to the same merchant unless you go back to the merchant. 

The ""lovecraftian horror"" is baby lotion soft. The night is daunting until you realize it's 90% harmless. The other 10% is easy to avoid. 

The sea itself is pretty bland too, it's pretty but generally very calm. I've encountered a few storms that were no challenge, but hinted at what the game *could* have been. As it is the only ""challenge"" in navigating is the dreadfully slow starting engines and dodging phantom rocks at night.

What starts as a ""find your way back home"" scenario immediately turns into a ""why is everyone so strange around here?"" scenario, and you have to discover the mystery about this place.

[b] The Good: [/b]

- [i] The gameplay loop. [/i] You must catch fish to sell them to earn money. You then use this money to purchase upgrades for your ship, such as new fishing rods, which then allows you to go catch more fish in different environments. Once you unlock the dredging ability, you can find materials to increase the capabilities of your ship, such as extra space, speed, etc. The gameplay loop is simple, straightforward, and just long enough to not be a major grind.

- [i] The story. [/i] The story is a fun mystery that matches the atmosphere well. It's short enough that players that are in just for the main story will complete it quickly, but it has some deep moments as you get to the end.

- [i] The atmosphere. [/i] The graphics, music, and overall artistic expression in this game is great. The graphics look beautiful, especially at Stellar Basin at night, while not being demanding for the PC. The music gives sea shanty vibes at some points while setting a dark tone at others. These all combine together to give this game its uniqueness.

[b] The Bad: [/b]

- [i] The 100% grind. [/i] My only real complaint with the game is the slight grind needed to 100% it. One of the achievements involves catching all unique fish in the game. By the time you complete the story, unless you play with this achievement in mind since the start of the game, you'll need to do plenty of double-backing to catch everything you missed. It only amounts to a few extra hours of gameplay, but it becomes a bit boring after a while.

[b] Final Verdict: [/b]

- 10/10. Buy DREDGE and The Pale Reach, its main DLC. Both are fun, casual, and something to remember. Buy the additional DLCs if you want to support the developers.",1707696331,1707698291,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]Here are the issues:[/b]

[list]
[*] The game was polished and QA-tested only for the first couple of hours at the beginning. For the rest, developers don't seem to bother testing/QA-ing the game properly.
[*] The game lacks game design polish, evident in a bug related to selecting objects. For instance, if you throw a crab pot near a pier, the game won't allow docking due to the presence of the crab pots.
[*] Various visual glitches are apparent with the trees.
[*] There is no explanation provided on how to unlock the ""Bottomless Lines"" rod; you simply can't unless you Google it.
[*] If you for some reason happen to crash or just simply touch by 1px with rocks or with sand, oh boy pray that your fast-going maxed boat won't turn into a snail, until your reach to the repairing shop.
[*] Bad UX, you can easily accidentally buy stuff from the merchant by accidentally clicking on items, and then you're either forced to reload the game, or just refund it with a half of the price.
[*] The XP system is also a mess:
[list]
[*] There is no point in upgrading lights when you can easily obtain an ""overpowered"" hidden treasure, which is 3,500 lumens, while maxed out light is very hard to obtain and it's only 3,000 lumens (even tho the light element is almost indistinguishable at some point). 
[*] You can literally deploy crab pots everywhere, and it always says ""plenty"", have you though t a little bit on that?
[*] I'm wonder what devs were thinking by adding ""Travelling Merchant"" in the game with her capabilities. You do realize that putting all the functionality together makes the game's experience gaining process useless. You literally can deploy crab pots, rest, wake up collect the goods, sell them, then buy research parts and repeat, are you that lazy?
[*] The game is designed to require hours of grinding. If you want players to enjoy your game, make it enjoyable. If you've included a grinding system, it either means you have high expectations for your game or it should be some form of online multiplayer. Your creation should not last forever or feel dragged out; it should promptly deliver the intended message.

While it is enjoyable and the fishing can be quite addicting, I think the mechanics feel somewhat unfinished. There's no control on pacing, meaning that if you're like me, you'll probably wind up barely halfway through the game by time you've fully upgraded your vessel. The gear progression is woefully short. Since equipment can only be swapped out at a handful of specific ports, you'll probably tend towards the most general layout which can catch any kind of fish, but leaves no space for things that increase aberration chance or fishing speed or do other fun stuff. This isn't such a big negative, due to another negative which is that these other aspects are so unimpactful as to be effectively meaningless.

Night quickly becomes completely non-threatening, and can be skipped by sleeping at a port. Fishing for aberrations is fun, but with certain fish, particularly the ones only available during the day (when aberrations are much rarer), it becomes incredibly tedious, until you unlock an ability that just gives you an aberration at a button press, which trivializes the quest entirely.

The story is interesting and compelling, though one of the game's endings is somewhat hampered by the appearance of a 'character' that I, at least, never even encountered during my playthrough. Nonetheless, there is much to enjoy in Dredge, and I would recommend giving it a try if you can get it for cheap.",1707592788,1707592788,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You have a collection of fun mechanics as the game's skeleton and a fishing boat as the aesthetics and theme of the game. It's kind of like Pokemon Yellow with a few grinding mechanics, as long as you aim at enjoying the full content. You have to capture all fishes via 'mini games', make money, upgrade your boat to make your life easier and also having a sense of accomplishment and reward and finish several cool side quests that end up being an invitation for you to get to know every little aspect of the game that will leave you with a sensation of surprise.

But it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. There's a dark side to it. At night, specially, you'll see things and they'll keep you own your toes. The game gives you enough cool ways to deal with them. So there's a little push-back to introduce some resistance and make the game fun instead of easy-going/boring.

Edit: I played the DLC after already having gotten 100% of the achievements. They added new ones for DLC. I played it, it wasn't great. I formatted my PC and I forgot about it. In my mind I got the 100% again. And now I just remembered: I didn't. And I have zero desire of playing this again. The main campaign had a purpose and all the spark of a new and excited relationship with all its milestones.

You play as an amnesia ridden fisherman that travels the seas of a series of islands where something always feels slightly off. 

At times, Dredge is a very cozy game that is easy to pick up and put down with simple but fun fishing mechanics. Yet at others, Dredge can be unsettling, disturbing, and terrifying. I've never before played a game that pulls off two incredibly different genres as well as Dredge does. You'll be fishing in an area of the map and all will be fine as you play fish-tetris with your catches to fit as many as possible onto your boat. Then suddenly, you lose track of time and the sun sets and now every unknown terror in the deep wants nothing more than to kill you. 

Another great surprise in this title was the story. Every interaction you have with the characters or message bottles of this game help to reveal shreds of a very murky and mysterious world. It's all fantastic. And without exaggeration, the big twist near the end had my jaw on the ground in the best way possible.

I was shocked by how intuitive everything is. Most games create puzzles which are out of this world, impossible to figure out without opening wiki. But this game? Throughout my entire gameplay I only opened wiki once which is a great statistic in my opinion. 

Let me expand my argument for the intuitive part of the game. For instance, I talk to an NPC, that NPC talks about another NPC, or about the hobby/occupation/looks of another NPC. The game never really tells you to go to that NPC. But who cares, open world game = I go wherever I want to. So I go to the NPC that was 'supposedly' talked about. Guess what, that NPC has a problem needed solving (there you have it, a beautifully planned side mission that is in pace with the gamer.). This part of the game is what impressed me the most.

Dredge is a single-player fishing game, where you explore an archipelago, while collecting artifacts and selling your fish to upgrade your boat. The game is surprisingly user-friendly, as while the fishing minigame is based around a skill-check system, making said checks only reduces the time spent fishing. This is a nice way to balance risk with reward during the main gameplay loop.

The setting is great. A collection of ports across the map contain a wide variety of different characters to interact with. The horror elements are also implemented very well; while there are no typical jumpscares per se, the game does an excellent job at making you feel uneasy when out fishing at night for too long.

My ONLY issue with this game was the rather large amount of going backwards and forwards I found myself doing for the sake of all the side content.

A: you can abuse crab trapping to no end drop all kinds of traps right in front of the dock sleep and just keep checking them especially when you get the upgraded traps.

B: If your engine gets damaged out at sea or even at any of the other islands where you cant repair you have to proceed at a snails pace and hope that you can somehow limp back to the center of the map for 10 minutes. Even if you have the haste skill it takes forever. Died 3 times trying to get back

C: You can fill up your hold, dock at the nearest town, transfer all fish to storage, repeat for the duration of the day/into the night until your storage, net, and hold are all full, and sell way more than you're meant to quickly. It is especially easiest in the starting town because you can just go back and forth across the bay cleaning up every single fishing spot.


EDIT: (I agree it is priced a bit high. Wait for a sale.)

EDIT 2: (They have since allowed you to have multiple saves which solves the original C and was the main reason for my negative review. However I still consider the game repetitive and a bit too easy to abuse, see B and C above. Also with how easy it is you would think it would be nice and relaxing except it's a horror game; so it doesn't really fit the relaxing genre.)

[strike](Formerly) C: you can only reload at the last place you docked not before so if you docked somewhere and got yourself stuck you have to start a new game entirely

I really want to leave a positive review but knowing that you can lose all your progress and can't reload kind of ruins it for me. If these things are fixed/adjusted I will absolutely purchase the game again and change my review.[strike]",1680210819,1707057311,False,14,0,0.438612431287765503,0,True,False,False

The game-play is basic, but fun. There is no combat, but there is just enough going on to keep it engaging for the entire duration. The whole experience is relatively short, which is a strength, since it knows not to over-stay its welcome.

The overall ""story"" isn't much of anything, but it doesn't matter too much. It's about the journey.

With inventive mechanics and gameplay it's one of the few games of 2023 that offers something ""new"".
Great pacing, and a lack of pressure, allow you to sail through the game at your own pace - enjoying the journey (fishing and dredging) as well as the destination (upgrades and advancement). 

The setting is fantastic.  The map is enjoyably different, offering multiple biomes each with their own unique hardships and rewards.  The soundtrack adds to the ambience, and shifts seamlessly between the scare free day, and the horrors of the night.  You will feel your pulse quicken as you rush to the safety of a dock for the first time, I can assure you.

Going from a peaceful day to the nights (with a subtle addition of a cosmic horror) shows how they really created something that will keep you on your toes, with a vested interest in moving forward, and when combined with the rest of the work the devs put in you'll get a great replay value.

Dredge: an apparatus usually in the form of an oblong iron frame with an attached bag net used especially for gathering fish and shellfish...

Dredge mixes Diablo style loot sorting with progression fishing and a Lovecraftian story in the most beautiful way. In short, make your way from dock to dock selling fish and finding horrific artifacts. Be immersed in the lulling music and ambiance while hunting down nightmare creatures.

The core gameplay loop has you maneuvering your boat through rocky waters to find fishing spots. These spots will engage you in one of three different quick time events to catch a fish. Make sure you have the right gear and collect various fish of all shapes and colors. Sort these fish in your inventory to maximize your haul, and then return back to a dock to make a profit. With your new money, buy new fishing equipment, better lights to fend off the fog, a faster motor to escape the horrors of the deep, or expand your ship with more space and slots for aforementioned equipment. Along with fishing you will be tracking down artifacts that grant you supernatural powers that add more QoL abilities than direct progression. You will also dredge for materials that will allow you to make upgrades to your vessel.

For those that enjoy fishing games Dredge is definitely one to check out. Personally, I am addicted to uncovering all the creatures a game has to offer and sit back as you fish codex completes. Progression feels well paced and the story keeps gameplay entertaining. 

My complaints with the game is that while hunting for all of the different fish, you are tasked with also finding Aberrations of these fish. These are often nightmarish versions of previous fish and are found by chance or guaranteed with the Atrophy ability. However certain species are only obtainable by trawling. This is a mechanic that has you drag a net behind your ship to catch fish passively while travelling. Atrophy does not work on trawl-only fish and so get ready to spin to catch the last few Aberrations you need to finish your codex. My other complaint comes in the form of the ""unlock all X research"" category of achievements. The game does not really give you enough research parts to do this without extra grinding. Thankfully there is a way around this by save/load scumming shops to get parts easily. These two things were what kept me from 100%'ing the game a couple hours earlier. All of the other achievements are very reasonable and take little time out of just playing the game.

I'd still recommend this game even if you want to 100% it. The fishing gameplay is something I am quite fond of, and the eldritch story is very intriguing. Not all games have to have 300 hours of content, although I would not be against some expansions for Dredge.

This game is like finding a treasure chest in your backyard – unexpected and ridiculously exciting!

First off, I've been glued to my screen, unable to stop myself from collecting everything in sight. It's like being in a candy store, but instead of sweets, you're grabbing side quests, new fish, and upgrading your boat. The sense of achievement you get is better than finding extra fries at the bottom of your takeout bag.

And let's talk about the night adventures. Imagine sipping an espresso shot while riding a roller coaster – that's the level of adrenaline rush you get floating through the dark, spooky waters. It's like a caffeine-fueled ghost ship experience, and I'm all for it.

I stumbled upon this gem because of the game awards, but what really reeled me in was the 'Dave the Diver' free addon – the Dredge DLC. It's like attending a party and discovering your favorite TV characters are there too. The collaboration is seamless and adds an extra layer of excitement to the game. Kudos to the devs for this genius move!

This applies to both the gameplay and the story. Even after seeing all the endings, I still feel like this is the case.

It's certainly much more of a chill experience than I was hoping for, as danger is barely a thing with safety always being within visual range and enemies providing next to no threat. This isn't helped by the fact that the game is insultingly easy, with little in the way of challenge hidden anywhere on the map. Because there is no time pressure to get things done quickly, any setbacks you might have can be mitigated by simply making some money and going back to even the riskiest play styles (which in this game means keeping your player character up for days at a time and going out to fish every night).

Everyone else will find much more satisfaction with games like Subnautica and Dave the Diver for sea exploration, and almost any other horror game for spooky thrills.

I really wanted to like this game and to some extent I really do, but it's lacking a lot in content. I feel like the main questline was incredibly short and while I do like fishing, just going fishing for no reason is not enough for me to wanna play a game. I also couldn't make use of all the available upgrades either....because the game ended.

I usually have a shit ton of things to say about things, but I'm feeling kind of empty? I was hoping for more RPG content. I have 8.5 hours played but I know a lot of it was just keeping the game open. I think I spent as much time in the ""last area"" than I did in all the previous areas combined and that was because I was lazying around. I really don't wanna poop on this game either, the concept is really neat, I love the artwork and my ADHD ass was obviously entertained because I actually managed to finish it. I just feel that it ended too fast. I wish more time had been put into the fishing, money making and ship-upgrading aspect of the game so that it naturally progresses with the main quest line. I wish there had been more of a red thread between the things.

But, Dredge really nailed it! The graphics, art style, soundtrack/sound effects, and gameplay are really relaxing but still made me spooked by the Lovecraftian aspect of it. This game took me 21 hours to 100% achievement, AND I DO NOT REGRET IT! In fact, it was ONE OF THE BEST 21 hours of gameplay. To make it even more perfect, I played this game when I smoked my pipes with some of my favorite tobacco blends I had at the moment, so, it was like I was fishing and digging the cosmic horror of the Dredge's verse. Long story short, I recommend this game if you want a good time, 10/10 for game play and 11/10 for story. Kudos to the devs for creating a really good Lovecraftian horror!

The atmosphere the game creates in the early hours was great, I had fun upgrading, learning and unlocking new powers, all whilst avoiding the perils of the night. After a certain point though, the game became a lot easier and really lost its spark.

One of the biggest failings is the lack of an engaging narrative, most quests are similar and meeting characters only served purpose to advance the completion of the story and unlock new equipment. There are also few cosmetic upgrades to your fishing vessel, something which feels like a bit of a missed opportunity.

One of the games saving graces (for fans of a grind) is the variety of fish you can collect and update in your journal. This however, isn't really my jam and after around 6-8 hours I'd grown tired of the core gameplay loop. I pushed through the remainder of the main quests (aside from the robed figure ones) and finished the story.

Net this on sale for a tasty catch, reel it in at full price and you'll feel a bit seasick.

PROS:
- Runs amazing on Steam Deck
- Beautiful art style
- Relaxed, simple gameplay

CONS:
- Uninspired story (aside from the Lovecraft influence)
- Lack of customisation
- Grows repetitive quickly

Dredge is a lovecraftian ""Horror"" game about finding mysterious artifacts and uncovering the origins of the misty fog that blankets the seas at night.

All in all, it was a pretty good experience. Fishing for new species and revoltingly delightful aberrations of said species provides a calming gameplay loop that is made a little scarier by the light horror aspects provided by the threats that the sea throws at you. 

The artstyle plays into the lovecraftian feel perfectly by making every character just a little bit ugly in some way. There isn't a single character in this game that has any features that could be considered ""Cute"".

Grid based inventory systems are always nice. And the fact that your equipment such as your fishing poles and your boat's engines are worked into the grid based inventory system is genius. This makes it so the slightest bit of damage to your boat could possibly render you unable to fish, see, or even move quickly, and by extension it keeps you on edge during the horror-y bits.

I do wish that the horror was dialed up a little bit, and that some of the monsters had some more interesting designs. Specifically the ones in the Gale Cliffs and the Devil's Spine.

[b]Authentic Upgrades[/b]
Your ship needs improvements - more spaces, better fishing gear and engines. It makes sense to collect wood, metal scraps and linens, which are either bubbling in the waters or retrieved from shipwrecks. 

Enhancements also apply to fishing rods, crab pots, nest. Moreover, all come in different variety - one gear works only in shallow waters, other will operate in deep. That's where fishing fun begins.

[b]Plenty of Fish[/b]
The Ocean. It's beautiful and dangerous. A sign of dolphins quickly changes for attacking underwater Colossus. Your precious cargo is picked by birds and a hurricane breaks remaining free slots. 

Capturing fish is a mini-game. So is lifting crafting materials and treasures. Anything you find then placed to the ship. 
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3148341536
The catch may be mutated and this type is much more rare. Hunting down all species is no joke - following specific conditions requires serious preparations. Baits, installation of unique rods, waiting for day or night, nets, particular depths for crabs... Did I say there are 5 biomes to explore? 

In the end, when you examine rare multiple eyed fish, deformed bodies and grinning fins, you know - it was worth it.

The general progression of the game is satisfying and as someone who enjoys collecting things and completing encyclopedias I felt right at home in Dredge. That said, I do see some room for improvement. 

There is minimal story going on here, but in a way that might be an intentional nod to the Lovecraftian style of 'show don't tell'. Still, the ending has a nice twist that I wasn't expecting and overall I was satisfied. Where it is lacking slightly is in side quests, which are few and mostly ""catch this and bring it here"" in nature. The fishing mechanic itself could use more diversification and added challenge considering how integral it is to the gameplay. It gets a bit repetitive after a while. 

I also think paranoia could have been utilized and incentivized more creatively. Generally it's presented as a liability, but some of the game's coolest visual effects and encounters happen when the meter is high. Adding quests and encounters that require high paranoia, aberrations that only appear while the meter is full, and perhaps the ability to hunt some of the terrors it attracts would be cool as well. The creep-factor definitely exists in Dredge, but I feel like they could have played to this strength even more.

Upgrading your boat is fun but still left me wishing there were more ways to customize. Also, being able to buy infinitely restocked upgrade items from the vendor makes upgrading too fast and easy. Money feels scarce at first, but will quickly cease being of any concern if you're fishing as much as they seem to expect you to be. Getting these upgrade items exclusively as quest rewards or from exploring would improve the pacing of progression. Given how small the map is, it would also be helpful if the DLC were better integrated with the main quest line. 

I strongly recommend giving Dredge a try if you're a horror-lite fan with a passion for collecting. An impressive first release!",1706259838,1706260252,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

To start with the good, the vibe and the aesthetic and the chill light-music set a really cool ambiance, the game does feel like sailing the stormy seas at night while the spookiness of the ocean is ready to take you under.

Unfortunately I think the game is mechanically super boring. The very first time you catch a fish is exactly the same as the last fish you catch. Every time they change the catching pattern up it doesnt do much to make it more interesting. The game feels perpetually like someone played outer wilds and thought ""What if we took a bunch of bespoke planets and instead made 5 unique zones of puzzles to solve"" but the puzzle is just get to the island, dont die to the thing that will kill you, and catch the unique fish in that zone. 

I thought about getting the DLC to see if it added anything more but by the time I finished the game I figured it was gonna be like 5 bucks to play more of exactly the same stuff. If this developer put out another game or a sequel and learned and added interesting mechanics that expand as you play I might be more interested. 

TL;DR; The game is a great aesthetic and vibe but it's not very interesting or fun to play",1706241832,1706241832,False,4,0,0.516504347324371338,0,True,False,False

-Very atmospheric and beautiful setting
-Well crafted progression system
-Gameplay consists of simplistic minigames for fishing and collecting other various equipment, doing various quests, and exploring which I found pretty enjoyable and relaxing (most of the time)
-The ""horror"" aspect is mostly in the ambience around you that the developers clearly put a lot of care and effort into. Plus some other silly little fellows you meet sooner or later :)
-Sound design pretty good
-I also fairly enjoyed the story and the ending(s).

Potential Cons :
-Gameplay loop could get boring as it gets quite repetitive but leads you to different locations to navigate in order to make up for it. It also throws new dangers your way to keep you on your toes. 
-Story outside of quests isn't really connected with the gameplay.
-Grinding is almost completely optional and tends to result in QOL changes compared to the main quests which give you essential abilities/upgrades 
-Storage Management was a real pain sometimes with some really large and odd shaped fish/supplies
-DLC locked achievements (Pale reach only to my knowledge)
-100 percenting the game was a real pain as some fish would spawn in very few and specific locations that I would never have been able to find without google
-On the shorter side if you rush through the entire thing.  

DLC:
 
Pale Reach:
ill update the review once i play through it but from what I've seen its more an early-mid game expansion as it adds another ""main location."" That wouldn't really change up anything for late game players or give them a super large advantage that's essential to beating the game. It being worth the 6 dollars is up to you. 

Blackstone Key:
Gives you 2 decent items. Good way to support the devs along with the artbook dlc but items aren't really worth it imo. 


TL;DR
9.5/10 amazing game but totally depends person to person on how much they enjoy it.

The complaint is the game needs more detail and explanation into the horror and mystery elements in the game.

Let's start with the good: The mood is set very well, the game is very stylish and the core gameplay is kept simple and rewarding. Fishing is a dexterity minigame, inventory management a la grid based is pleasant and an upgrade tree keeps you excited to bring back the next big haul. Setting wise the game shines, warning you of the dangers of the sea, and dangerous it is indeed. You're a tiny fisherman boat, and you will never be anything else. One hit to your boat may incapacitate your engine at every point in the game. 

The bad, however, is mostly that the game is very short. The main story can be finished in what appears to be just about 5-6 hours depending on whether or not you have a compulsive need to max out your gear. Map wise there are about 5 major regions in the game (which make the game feel very episodic), with each being able to be completed in about an hour. The game does feature hidden quests, secrets and bits and pieces of lore scattered around the map which can help with this. But for the vast majority of players who are not completionists it is questionable whether they will have the motivation to go for the side stuff.

Moving on to spoilers about the core gameplay and what does not work very well: [spoiler]The game successfully hints at eldritch horrors leaking beneath the surface, but they gradually lose their intimidating force. In the aforementioned episodic sections of the game one specific horror is introduced each time each with their specific weakness. These weaknesses are unfortunately easily recognized and exploited. Most can be straight up outrun given you have the gear, and even if you are caught you mostly get damaged a bit and trot home disgruntled. It's a bit perplexing that the game continuously introduces new gameplay ideas only to let you off the hook a minute later without requiring you to work around them, or awarding you massively powerful tools that neutralize every threat. Conceivably many of the issues of being able to breeze through the game would be solved by the possibility of a gruesome graphic death following a major slip-up.[/spoiler]

All in all, I like the game and what is there is quite polished and nice. But it just isn't enough for a price that can be compared to other games that may keep your attention for tens of hours. Half its price seems more reasonable for the nice and short experience that it currently is.",1706035184,1706035817,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Man, what a fantastic game. A wonderful bit of exploration, atmosphere, narrative, and audio all rolled into one. Good at keeping your attention and focus through the breadth of the game, with the openness to discover, travel, and complete at your own pace. A very complete experience that I won't soon forget, and that I enjoyed tremendously, especially the [spoiler]very haunting[/spoiler] ending (minor spoiler: [spoiler]Worth noting that I really mean the [b]bad[/b] ending[/spoiler]).

It has a few downers for certain. The game is (perhaps unsurprisingly) more horror [i] themed [/i] than truly horrifying, and the horror elements are really only surprising the first time you see them, after which they just become nuisances. Not the fault of the developers, it's clear the intent was that [i] the connotations of what is happening are the scary part [/i], not so much the gameplay, but something worth noting. Not all the achievements are particularly fun ([spoiler]Catching all the aberration fish can be a nightmare, even with your modifier built as high as it can go[/spoiler]), but achievements seldom are. 

As for the ending, [spoiler] ([b]endings[/b]), I found that the bad ending was far, far better than the good one. I appreciate that the reason the good ending fell with so much less impact was that the decision to what ending you make only happens in the final moments of the game, though you spend the entire game working towards the bad ending. A big win for the game is that the underlying forces for both of these endings is very well written and alluded to in the notes you discover throughout your journey, and you only really find the bad ending through decently thorough exploration of the game world, which realistically makes it less likely you will experience it. Also, the visuals, implications, and [i]especially[/i] the music are far more impactful in the bad end, making it feel both more like the ending I earned and the ending I would rather see from a production standpoint, especially a horror game. I actually feel like by trying the good end first, I really softened the impact of the ending, as when I immediately saw the bad ending after, I thought ""wow, this ending is so much better!""[/spoiler]",1705866758,1705866758,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h3] The story [/h3]
From my perspective the by far weakest part of the game. Starts out interesting, but round-about mid-game there's basically nothing to keep you [i]hooked[/i]. Most of the side-quests just end without any real revelation, even those that would have an interesting story.
After completing the third (out of five) biomes, I mostly rushed the remaining part of the game to see its conclusion.

I found this aspect particularly frustrating as the mystery setting starts out strong.

[h3] ""Quests"" [/h3]
There are only fetch-type quests, nothing else. Some side-quests have you guessing what you have to fetch.

[h3] The horror aspect [/h3]
As written, it did not work for me. You quickly find out how to manage the horror, and at that point, it just falls over board to never return.

[h3] Controls [/h3]
I played the game entirely with a controller. Initially on the steam deck, but since the default button mapping isn't optimal and cannot be changed on the deck, I switched to PC.

In the game, there are basically three relevant areas for the controls:
[list]
    [*] The tetris-inspired inventory. Could not have been done much worse. I understand that this is the main focus of the game - but couldn't they implement it a little less clunky? I'm not asking for hand-holding, but why is a new item not placed on a free area if there is one? Or could the cursor at least remember its position when I have to switch between left and right panes?
    [*] Navigating the ship. There is a lack of tangible feedback on hitting objects. Sometimes I hit an obstacle an nothing happens, sometimes I barely brush something and the ship gets damaged
    [*] The fishing / dredging mini-game. Control-wise, there's nothing to complain. But they get repetitive and boring very fast (there's only 4 or 5 different ones) since you have to grind them a lot
[/list]
As stated above the default button-mapping is rather bad, and cannot be changed on the steam-deck at the time of writing this review (as soon as you open the respective menu, the game starts to scroll down and won't stop; haven't seen this behavior on any other game on the steam deck, or my laptop with this game)

[h3] Sound [/h3]
I actually found the changing background tunes very good and fitting to the mood.

[h3] Graphics [/h3]
The simplistic graphics fit to the overall tone and theme, and get the job done. Framerate is decent on the steam deck.

[h3] Progression [/h3]
Another weak spot. Progression comes in the form of grindable unlocks (ship improvements, research) and abilities unlocked through completion of the main story.
The abilities are unremarkable and don't provide much to the gameplay.
The grindable unlocks are - grindy. And poorly balanced. Several of the research unlocks can actually be only used when you have unlocked most of the ship improvements, especially the engines. Others are easily accessible nearly from the start and make the lower-level ones basically useless (trawl-nets, baskets)
Maybe it would feel more natural if the unlocks were gated by the story progression?

[h3] The verdict [/h3]
A weakly told story that could have been much more. A heavily repetitive main gameplay loop and a poorly designed progression system that relies on grinding.
Why did I complete it with all endings? I don't really have an answer for that. Up until mid-game, the weaknesses are not that obvious. The game allows to be played in very short sessions which fits well to my private situation. If it weren't for the button remapping bug, it would be a good fit for commutes with the steam deck.

1.  Time changes way too fast.  It's like you just get started and the day is over with already.

2.  The ship takes damage way to easily.  I've done real fishing in 8-15 foot waves - We never got a scratch on the boat.

3.  There should only be one merchant that you can buy or sell everything with.  The separation of those things by fish, shipyard, etc is pointless.

4.  From a story stand point, the characters that you do tasks for are generally unpleasant.  Who would want to go on a fetch quest for someone that acts like an a_hole with a major superiority complex towards them?  In real life, I would have sailed away to somewhere else.

5.  I won't give it away, but there is one part of the game where you have to bait some traps.  There is zero feedback from the game that you did it correctly and I spent a lot of time driving around to the other traps guessing if it was right.  Spoiler alert:  I still don't know.

6.  The horror elements are stupid and take away from the main part of the game.  I would have enjoyed it more if just a straight forward fishing/upgrading/exploring/dredging adventure game in a chill format.  Even with turning off the monsters' ability to attack you, it's just not fun to me.  I would have liked exploring more and maybe solving a pirate mystery or something.

While I loved that game's story, atmosphere, and lore, it was the gameplay that held back the experience from being truly great. Dredge, however, manages to have all of that on top of actually being enjoyable to play. It features a solid, easy to understand gameplay structure with fun mechanics and a simple, but rewarding progression system that guides the player through uncovering and exploring the game's hidden secrets throughout an ancient archipelago region set during the early 1900's. At first glance, you may think this will be a fun, light-hearted fishing game with a colorful art style and relaxed atmosphere. That's not quite the whole experience on offer here.

The truth is that Dredge is often also a horror game. It is equal parts fishing adventure and cosmic horror story. It's a game that embraces its Lovecraftian roots, utilizing them in a setting that makes you feel isolated, afraid, and alone. You'll explore ancient ruins, lost frozen wastes, and vast expanses of open water, sifting through the sea for forgotten treasures and ancient secrets. Those elements are only heightened more as the Sun begins to set and an oppressive, eerie fog settles in and wraps its sinister grip around your intrepid tugboat.

In exploring Dredge's secret-filled waters, I found myself scared at times, something I didn't expect would happen to the degree that it does. It's surprising how unsettling the game can be during its nighttime moments. As night falls, the feelings of dread and tension intensify, as the game begins to unleash all of its horror-filled surprises on you. These moments require you to make quick decisions on what to do when faced with the sudden terrors of the deep lest your ship and you end up sinking beneath the waves. With each passing hour, you're going to find yourself experiencing a story that while not new, nevertheless feels fresh due to its hands-off approach to player exploration and discovery, two features that are essential to Dredge's gameplay.

Dredge is the kind of experience best played with little to no prior knowledge of it going in. I could honestly say I wish there were more in this game as by it's conclusion I didn't want to stop playing it as I found it so engaging and fun. It's an experience I won't soon forget and hopefully this world will be further explored in the future. The twisted and mysterious world of Dredge is an experience you won't regret having.

I'm a big fan of Sunless Sea. I think that's why I found this game attractive. I was very happy with the game at first while I was learning the various mechanics and meeting the first few characters. Unfortunately when I reached the third zone of the game (about 3-4 hours into it) I realized the game was getting very repetitive. You essentially get to each new zone, look for specific types of fish to complete a quest and then move on to the next zone. The quests remind me of WoW quests to go find 5 vulture livers and 3 boar tusks. The story doesn't seem to offer any meaningful decisions, and I wasn't satisfied with the ending.

I found fishing to be tedious, especially searching for specific types of fish needed for quests. Crabbing was cool though. I have a strange fondness for crabbing in this game :). Repairing nets and pots was annoying, especially since managing inventory is a lot of trouble in this game, and you have to carry all the crab pots back to be repaired.

I wish the game had provided more meaningful choices for the story, roguelike mechanics, combat mechanics, seasons or other reasons to optimize my time each day, etc. The game was so simple that it seemed too much like a cozy game, and I prefer more difficult survival games.",1705462142,1705462142,False,1,1,0.504504501819610596,0,True,False,False

It's simply a fun game. It has a lot of little systems that intertwine and keep you hooked if you enjoy games with strong inventory management and the different fishing minigames. The art style is definitely the strongest aspect of the game, the story is enough to keep you moving, and the puzzles are fun little challenges that go along with the previously mentioned systems. 

The primary downsides to the game are the pacing and overall duration.
For the pacing, the last 30% of the base game REALLY starts to snowball, in a bad way. The gameplay loop is still fun, but most of the challenge has been negated, and you eventually are just ticking off boxes. Which can be good because, like I said, the game is still fun. But it is a little less riveting compared to the early game because there's not as much suspense, not as much fear, and you've likely seen almost everything the game has to offer by that point.
For the overall duration, I 100%'d the game in under 17 hours, including the Pale Reach DLC. I don't think the game is bad value because I really enjoyed my time (and truly, this game is the epitome of many of my favorite things), but I did expect the base game and the first (real) DLC to be a bit larger. I'll still eagerly buy the 2nd DLC when it arrives, but, it would be nice if it had some new challenges/systems/ideas.

Now, lets go through this with a list of pros and cons and a number rating 

(The number rating will be subjective, the pros and cons will be as objective as possible)

Pros: 

1: The game is incredibly well made and very cleanly made, very little bugs, i haven't experienced any throughout my entire time playing, not a single one.

2: This game is very visually pleasing and has a lot of consistency (i am not an artist however)

3: This game has quite a bit of content and secrets for such a small map (you'll be quite busy)

Cons:

1: You'll be traveling from place to place a LOT, and your primary method of travel is only obtained after you get the second relic [spoiler] (The Key) [/spoiler]

(Overall Rating (8/10)

Dredge is the story of a fisherman who starts as the new angler of a small village. Soon you find out that something is wrong in the area. The art style looks very nice and the story is mysterious and interesting. The gameplay loop is fun and varied. If you want to support a small developer studio and if you want around 1,5 hour more gameplay time than I would recommend the dlc ""the pale reach"". The other dlc is just some ingame money to start easier of and two equipment parts. This parts are in the endgame pretty useless so actually you would not really need the ""blackstone key"" dlc to enjoy the game.  But both dlcs are not necessary because the maingame is good enough. It took me around 20 hours to 100% it and I took my time with it.

It's more of a cozy game with spooky elements than a horror game, but the sanity loss effects can be very freaky at night sometimes, especially if your ship doesn't have many upgrades to avoid the most dangerous threats.  

There are a number of different sanity effects, too, which reminds me a bit of an old GameCube game called Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem.  Sometimes you'll have to avoid illusory rocks that pop up in front of you, or a phantom ship that tries to ram into you at high speed.  There are other ones as well, but I don't want to give them all away.  

There are several different biomes that you visit to complete the main quest along with a bunch of smaller islands that can have treasure or side quests to complete, so this game really scratches that itch to explore like The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker did.  However it's a fairly short game unless you're trying to collect all of the fish so I feel like they could have added more areas.  

Collecting all the fish is the meat of this game since you need all kinds of different equipment to do this as well as some spells that you get from completing parts of the main quest to make this easier.  There are also puzzles that give you special equipment if you manage to solve them, which can help a lot if you're trying to get all of the aberrations.  

The artwork for the aberrations is quite well done and I remember saying ""eww"" every time I hauled one of them onto my boat.  While they are harmless (unless you're dumb enough to eat one) they add to this impending sense of doom that permeates the game's atmosphere.  

I do wish they would add a harder difficulty for this game because by the time I finished the third biome my ship was pretty fast and able to avoid most threats so it was easy to get through the last two areas.  I have the DLC and while I like the new ice biome it didn't take too long to complete.  Hopefully they will make a sequel with more stuff to do since the environment is excellent and the mechanics are addictive.  

Anyway, if you like exploring and collecting stuff you should enjoy this game even if it does feel a bit short.

PROS:

- Really relaxing and not particularly scary, but has a continuous air of mystery to keep you thinking what will happen next.
- A handful of fun puzzles, places to explore, and optional secrets to ""dredge"" up.
- Very pretty, but simple, graphics. I found it satisfying to pull up new fish, especially... messed up fish. The colorful cast of characters was also wonderful.
- Who doesn't love a little bit of existential horror these days?

CONS:

- The slow pace may not be every player's cup of tea, even with puzzles and story thrown in. There is occasionally some grinding for items and money, but once you start to make bank it gets almost too easy.
- There is no dread for something as dreadful as lovecraftian horror. The ocean having freaky monsters in it is sorta treated like a normal occurrence in the game, removing some of the fear and mystery.
- I found the twist cool and unexpected, but the endings to both be anticlimactic. For example, the game tells you there's no going back and you can't save once you agree to do the ending, but you just move your boat to a point and a cut scene plays, then it ends. Why give a warning in the first place? It isn't like there is any decision making once you start the ending.

Overall, I can see why this is a game a lot of people like, and I had fun! But I could also see why someone might prefer just to watch a lets play of it instead.",1705263232,1705263232,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want a game where you can go on a laid back fishing adventure, while simultaneously become terrified of the horrors of the deep sea, this game is for you!

 The music as well, oh man the music is so damn good. Captured the aesthetic of the game so well.

To start with its design is so simplistic yet beautiful, I love each characters art design and the overall design of the world. It gives me feelings of utter dread when I see what lurks below. The story is quite linear, but with the choices and outcomes of my actions I truly got attached to my lone angler out on the open sea. Finally, the game play for me is what makes me recommend this game to any casual or hardcore gamers. The quick-time mini games are addicting and have a skill to them. The progression is pretty gradual but the snowball is rewarding as my ship gets faster and easier to go on far out trips on. The sanity and day/night mechanics give you such a sense of fear early on as you dont know what it entails, but as your character grows darker you too feel less and less threatened by those late night casts. Finally and my personal favourite, the movement. I love movement shooters, and any game with solid movement makes me fall in love. The drifting and dodging obstacles feels fair and when I crash(So often) I dont feel cheated. The price on dredge is a little high for a base game I completed in less than 15 hours, but I think if you are playing more casually it is totally worth it, especially on sale. I have heard the DLC are lacking in content, but I have not played. Also My wife divorced me for playing this game instead of watching our infant daughter but babies are vigrin betas and im a dredgepilled giga chad so i dont care.

Full Review Video Below:

Dredge, first and foremost, is a fishing game. You play as an angler in his boat, you gather fish, and sell them. However, the story and the atmosphere go well beyond that. The Lovecraftian mystery beneath the waves draws the player into the depths below. Personally, this game blew away my expectations. I genuinely thought I'd find it boring after a while, but ended up loving it.

You kind of suffer if you don't spend a lot of time just out there fishing for random fish to sell for better equipment, and it's irksome when I have an hour to play a game and more than half of that is just skimming around fishing for anything so that I can have enough money to buy the next fishing line I need in order to fish in a new area.

I can imagine the developers on a late night meeting, trying to decide what to do with their fishing game, a relaxing cute cartoonish or a tense cosmic horror one. And then, after a few beers, ""why not both?""...

It's definetely not a sprawling open-world sandbox, but it works for what it proposes.  Gameplay-wise, it's an easy and user-friendly game. For one side, it makes for a swift and pleasant exploration/progression. For the other, it has little strategy involved, since upgrade trees are very linear and there are few compromises to make. Mostly what fishing gear to load between trips, but swapping them costs nothing and your storage is avaliable everywhere.

Nevertheless, the fishing/selling/improving/exploring loop is so pleasant that halfway through the story I already fully upgraded my ship. After that, all I had to do is to finish the story relatively fast, although still with some interesting stuff to do.

The cosmic horror element is mostly a background. There were few moments were it affected gameplay. The twist of the night being the ""scary time"" was seldomly relevant in my playthrough, because besides a few quests, there isn't really any reason to risk yourself at night.

So I definetely recommend the game for anyone who likes Lovecraftian vibes and simple but fun minigames, but don't expect a horror game. Also, players on a budget should think twice. since you'll get some 15-hour content from this, and replayability it's close to zero (there are two endings, but you can unlock both from the final save).",1705059816,1705059816,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game consists of several islands of content, each of which has its own gimmick (think the Outer Wilds). But the map is also quite small, it takes just minutes to completely traverse each island, and while there are secrets to find and obstacles to overcome, it still isn't much. In 11 hours I have completely all but 1 of the islands, and I was taking it very slowly with a lot of time spent just fishing.

On the horror aspects I found Dredge to be disappointing. (just discussing it would qualify as spoiler so the rest will be censored) [spoiler] While the atmosphere is pretty great and for a while I got spooked by just the visuals, from a gameplay perspective really all there is to the horror is ""a monster comes and damages your ship then leaves"". Once you realize how little threat they really are it stopped being scary at all.

The game also barely delves into the idea of people going crazy from Eldritch knowledge. There is one character which does, but you had like 1 interaction with him prior and 0 interaction after he goes crazy so it barely matters. Your own sanity just means you are more likely to be attacked, which as I mentioned prior is very inconsequential, and you can become sane again by just waiting.

For starters, there's a very palpable aura of mystery surrounding almost every element of the game; the characters, setting, and lore all convey a sense of uneasiness with the goings-on of the deep. You play as an unnamed fisherman, recently shipwrecked and given a new vessel with which to continue plundering the depths for fish, treasures, and the like. Your days are spent fishing, selling your catches, repairing and upgrading your boat, uncovering sunken trinkets, and doing it all over again the next day. However, very early on you're given a stern and ominous warning to never venture into the open waters after dusk... lest ye find yerself stuffed into Davy Jones' locker like a sardine packed into a can! This warning is obviously meant to entice you to explore the waters after dark, tempting fate and trying your luck. This is where Dredge truly shines.

Though there are plenty of fish in the sea for you to catch, there are none more horrifying or awe-inspiring (depending on what type of person you are) than the Aberrations. Aberrations are like the twisted hell-spawn versions of the regular fish you catch: an eel with two heads at each end, a three eyed cod, a squid with bulging bulbous masses protruding from its tentacles... the list goes on. The game even plays a discordant little melody whenever you snag one of these monstrosities, and it's enough to send a shiver down your spine. I loved catching these Aberrations, and the game will sometimes mark places in the water where you can find one, but it was always better to fish in an unmarked spot and pull up a deformed crab with a glowing, pulsating shell. But perhaps what's even more surprising is that you can sell these Aberrations to any fishmonger or merchant, and they'll hardly bat an eye. With that, I do wish that the Aberrations played a larger role in the game, instead of being relegated to what is essentially a lottery system that begins to lose its effectiveness with each collected creature.

Another unique element of Dredge is that, like SuperHot, time only moves forward when you do. So if you moor your boat at a dock the sun, too, will moor itself in its current position in the sky. It's an interesting enough element, though it only really applies to the early game when your boat lacks engines powerful enough to carry you long distances in a single day before the sun sets. By the late game when you've upgraded your vessel to be more of a drug-smuggling speedboat than a bulky trawler you can accomplish much more in a single day than you could before. It is true that much of the early-game challenges become trivialized due to your late-game upgrades, but you also can't just not upgrade your vessel. Or maybe you can, idk.

There are four ""biomes"" in Dredge, each with their own unique flora and fish-a, and without spoiling anything each of these builds on the last (if you discover and explore them in the way the game wants you to) and challenge your fishing and survival prowess. The game's art style and direction also do much to lend to the beauty of each biome, giving them a chance to shine both day and night.

The story in Dredge is not as deep as the fathomless depths you sail across, but it's certainly deeper than a puddle. Much of the story is inferred rather than told, and there are two satisfying endings you can earn when it's all said and done. There are lots of side quests for you to sink your hooks into, but most are admittedly a variation of ""catch fish, give fish."" Because it is an indie game, I do have to cut their lines some slack, but I truly wish there was just more of this game, its world, its characters, and so on...

Overall, Dredge is one of the better indie games I've played in recent memory. The fishing mechanics are simple, the lore is interesting and inspired, and the gameplay loop is as rewarding as you make it. As sad as I was to drop anchor on this game, I'd be more than happy to hoist the sails and batten down the hatches if more content (besides the existing DLC) were to be released.",1704843555,1704843555,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As things progressed though I found the game a bit wanting.  
I found the upgrades to be a choke point - I'd have heaps of materials I'd dredged up, hardly any place to store them, but was missing one thing (usually cloth).  Then the upgrades just stopped with no further progress possible.

Here I am now - with more than $20k saved up, all the relics and main quests completed and not much to do and little incentive to continue.

+ Fairly fun gameplay loop

[b]Long version:[/b]
First of all it's impossible to look past how spot on the game gets the atmosphere. It's great in every aspect. The character art, overall visual style, the effects. Whoever did the art direction on this deserves a medal. In addition there are little touches here and there that give each area it's own unique look and the way how the lighthouse shines from far away all across the map is brilliant. 
The gameplay is a mix of time management and minigames. There are some enemies, but at least for the main storyline it was super easy to just absolutely avoid them. So the challenge side seemed a bit lacking. Then again if it were harder, it might become annoying. So you go out and usually try to make it back before it gets dark, because then there are more spooky things out on the water. The interesting thing is that as you upgrade your engine, the boat doesn't move that much faster but the clock ticks away slower. So the whole world is shown to be just a representation of the actual world, not 1:1 of what's really there. Which works well with the whole style as well.
While I had a fun time fully upgrading the boat and going through the story, the rest of the gameplay really isn't interesting enough to 100% it, which I usually do. I can see what more there is and it's just fetching collectibles and grinding a few final achievements and the world is not full enough for that. It works perfectly fine as a self contained adventure in terms of the main storyline, but once you've seen that, you've seen most of the game. But don't get me wrong, what's there is pretty great and totally worth checking out.",1704707064,1704707064,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,False

As if someone said, ""I would like a Lovecraftian-tinged fishing game with some very mild horror elements"" and the developer delivered one. It passes the sniff test, but doesn't really have a lot of pizzazz.

The actual fishing and dredging are fine. Mildly satisfying at best, absolute drudgery at worst. The setting is relatively nondescript and never really stands out. The art style is neat, but pretty tame in its horror elements. The writing is functional, but extremely predictable and it didn't make me emotionally invested in any of the characters. Everything on display is thoroughly [b]alright[/b]. I stopped playing a few hours in before watching most of the rest, which did not seem appreciably different from what I experienced.

As a result, I'm pretty surprised that Dredge is such a smash indie hit. The only reason I'm giving it a negative review is because I feel like I've got better versions of it split across different games.  Sure, Sunless Sea can be even more of a slog, but it's got an extremely unique setting and a real finesse to its writing.

I kept spoilers to an absolute minimum. So if you want to go play this game *completely* blind, skip this review.

I have been enjoying the heck out of Dredge. I can't recommend it enough. It is such a wonderful game. I don't know how the devs managed to make this game both relaxing and somewhat unsettling simultaneously, but it's the perfect mix of both.

During the day when you're fishing it feels like real fishing: relaxing and kind of exciting to see what you might get. And you have to learn where the different types of fish hang out and which equipment works best for each scenario. You can catch all kinds of different fish and fill up your little encyclopedia with the information. And each fish has a few aberrations of itself that you can find which is cool. You can also dredge up materials and unique items, as well as things to decorate your boat.

Since there's a lovecraftian aspect to this game, at night it gets a bit spooky. But it also has a passive game mode where it can still get spooky but you won't be in actual danger if you're looking to just experience the story and the game world. There are a few places in the game that I'm absolutely terrified of but I think that's mostly because I am terrified of the idea of being in the middle of a large body of open water. And don't even get me started with basins and blue holes. I am completely and utterly terrified of those. Like there's no way I could *ever* play Subnautica. That's how scared I am of the ocean. Anywho. Needless to say, I had to put the game in passive mode for a little while in two different areas because I am a sea coward. Despite one of the areas being breathtakingly beautiful because everything has bioluminescence, there's an eldritch horror beyond comprehension nearby and I just couldn't handle it. Heh. But even for someone with a touch of thalassophobia, Dredge has a very welcoming environment.

Upgrading your boat is really great as well. It feels rewarding. Everything in the game feels rewarding to do. It's a perfect sit-back-and-relax sort of game. I'm super happy with it. You even get a little camera in the game at one point so that you can take pictures of cool things. Sometimes a whale will leap out of the water or something like that. Or dolphins will hop by. Fun little moments like that. Also, the game is pretty kid-friendly, so if you're looking for a unique game to get your kid for their birthday or something, this is a great choice. Sure, it has spookiness but there's nothing inappropriate in it, and the spookiness is arguably very mild. It's just that kind of that lovecraftian unsettling kinda spooky.

It runs flawlessly on Steam Deck and the PC system requirements are very reasonable, so not only is it a fantastic game, but it's extremely accessible for a lot of people to play. I think it's on Xbox as well. Everything about this game is fantastic. The art style is awesome. I can't find a single thing to complain about. Just praise all around.

* Steady progression. At the moment it awfully slow at the start (first 1-2h), it speeds up a goddamn lot in the mid game (when you upgrade your engines) and there is mostly nothing to do for the last quarter of the game. (aside from trying to catch them all)
* Lovecraftian horror. Ngl it's awesome in the beginning. But once again, by the midgame you've seen most of it aside from a few. I lose that feeling that something is lurking around too quickly and it becomes just a fishing game with ""quests"". The game doesn't really use the fear of the unknown.
* Exploration. It's good until you reach the second archipelago. Then you realise that the areas differ from each other in fish, maybe zone-specific monster and crustations. They feel the same
* Upgrades. They're alright. But there is too little of them and the part that upsets me the most: devs show you basically the whole progression tree. So the feeling of getting something new and existing doesn't exist. It's more like: hey, i can now catch 1.5 more fish per day, yay?
* Story. Exists and quite predictable

I will say though, the amount of content supplied, especially in The Pale Reach DLC, is limited. This is very much a fetch-quest game. Also, difficulty if you can call it that, can be straight-up avoided, however this does fit the laidback vibe the game presents.

Honestly, would really have liked more progression given the amount of supplies that are generally available, especially in the late-game. Also game world is somewhat small, though this may fit the theme and possibly the intent of the devs for this title to be like a ""short-story"" rather than a large novel.

Story itself has a strong lovecraftian theme, however I feel the ending leaves things unanswered and personally unfulfilling.
However, I speculate that this is an establishing title, laying foundation for future iterations to expand.

Overall, clean title with little-to-no bugs observed, gameplay very chill and themes and art intriguing to just sit back and jam. I recommend getting at a discount. I am also not aware of any mods, etc, that may make this game more enjoyable.
Mods and other 3rd-party content would seem to be great, as the foundation this game has is great.

I also bought the DLC, it is a very nice addon to the game, with more exciting mechanics and a very satisfying side story.

The cosmic horror elements are also very enjoyable and gripping, it is very distinctivly Lovecraftian without copying anything from existing literature.

Replayability does not seem very hard for me -- the game is very straightforward, once you finished the game, there is very little incentive from doing it again.

If anything I left the experience wishing there was more things to do, and I think that's a good feeling to have when putting a game down.

It straddles the line between horror and casual gaming masterfully and I don't think I've played a game before that has had me feeling both tense and relaxed at the same time. The gameplay loop is solid, and the progression system keeps everything feeling fresh up until the end. Exploring the world feels rewarding and there were several times where I just had to pause and take in the sights. The sound design is also in a league of its own and after 20 hours it never got old or felt grating for even a moment. It looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 

The world felt interesting and gave me just enough of a glimpse behind the curtains to leave me both intrigued and horrified at the implications of what's actually going on. And to cap everything off, the game has a great ending that really took me by surprise.

The problem is that it doesn't have much more than just bones. Bones are it. The whole environment they have created promises depth like the ocean but it's more like a puddle. I know that my playtime shows lots of hours, but I had it on pause for almost an entire day, the actual game was short and annoyingly shallow. There is frustratingly little to see, do, figure out, and achieve. The game feels about 1/6 complete: barely more than a demo. Too polished to be early access, too unfinished to be a complete game.

I'm concerned that these Lovecraft-inspired games are leaning too heavily on style and not enough on content, which is a tremendous pity since Lovecraftian horror should give the best, most unique content around. The imagery for this one is great, the look of the thing is beautiful, the dialogue (what little there is) is extremely well-written, it's just way, way, way not enough. You could argue that the hallmark of a good game is that it leaves you wanting more, but this one leaves you wanting more because it never delivered in the first place.

That said, I think I am going to break a long standing rule that I've had for this game. I've long said that I will not purchase a DLC to fix a broken game. If the creators couldn't release the game in a finished state then I'm not going to pay them extra to do so. I've held to this for a good twenty years, but I might... MIGHT consider downloading the DLCs to expand this world and see what happens. However, if you look at the reviews of the currently released DLCs, it's not promising.

Dredge is a unique and memorable experience that surprised me with how well its world pulled me in and kept me entertained over the 10 hours it took me to complete its campaign. However, its short playtime and lack of replayability make it worth the money if you pick it up on sale. 

The horror elements of this game are outstanding. I found myself going from being soothed by the many minigame fishing activities to unsettled by a sudden rumbling sound from the deep to screaming as that sound was actually a hellspawn fish chasing me through the ocean. The devs perfectly captured that feeling of being small and vulnerable in an ocean and there were many times I got chills from looking down and seeing something massive underneath me. 

The musical score is never overbearing with much of the game's audio being your boat, fishing, or listening to the oceanic wildlife. But when the music does come in it fits the tone of the situation perfectly.  

Exploration is satisfying and I enjoyed searching all of the nooks and crannies the game offered. Each ""biome"" has fun fish to find and new fish means weird new monster fish to discover as well.

This is a game filled with minigames to dredge up loot needed for boat upgrades or catch fish to buy said upgrades and equipment. It's surprisingly fun and I was never bored even though I don't care for minigames much. 

I don't really have anything negative to say about this game and I think it's wonderful, but for me, $25 is a touch high for a game I won't play again. For the completionists out there you will get more bang for your buck. Hope this helped!

That being said, its not what it really sets out to do. Some people say the game is dumb because its short, and to be fair, the main story can be pretty short, depending on how hard you focus on it. If you set out to catch all the different fish, however, it can definitely add to the experience and length and provide an adventure!

I only have a couple complaints that might be of interest to you as a prospective player:

1) I feel like the ending, no spoilers, could have had a bit more.... interaction. The end, after a certain point, just kind of feels abrupt. after all the time you might have expected a bit more pizzazz. Great story, jarring ending that leaves you saying..... well OK then. 

2) My money eventually becomes worthless. Once you invest in research you get better gear. Better gear leads to making better money. The best gear means you make a LOT of money. Eventually, selling fish for money becomes pointless since you have SO MUCH. Since you have the BEST gear making the MOST money you no longer have anything to really spend all that money on because you have the BEST gear. Doesn't make it a bad game. Just kinda ""what do i do with all this money...""

Overall the game was good. I played it with my wife in charge of the inventory management and it quickly turned into a Pokemon fish collector game with a cool story. Not a long game, but a fun one.

The game is fun, the mechanics are fun, the spawn rates of certain fish? are shit, you want an achievement for all aberrations? Have fun spinning in circles with a trawl net waiting, and waiting, and waiting. On top of that the story isn't anything interesting, the characters have no lore to them besides the only notable one being the Old Mayor. The only thing this game has going for it is that it is unique and it's an incremental, everyone loves incrementals... The DLC is well, feels like cut content from a bigger DLC, similar to Subnautica Below Zero but way worse. It is fun to smash through ice though.

If you are looking to get your money's worth, don't look here.

It's an excellent few evening's of entertainment if you're the kind of player who likes obsessively upgrading a vessel so that it is more resilient in a very dangerous world. The push-your-luck-and-get-punished-for-your-hubris fishing during the spooky nights mechanic is interesting and a great way of pushing you out of your comfort zone (weirdly, a mechanic the game shares with Dying Light).

The promotional-material teased aberrant fish don't matter in any great way (cool as it is to have a different, more valuable sprite to play inventory Tetris with). A couple of quests require them, but since they're a random drop most of the time, it's probably for the best that they don't do anything. 80% of the time you're finding fish to sell or progress a quest with. It's a fine time.

The elephant in the room is Sunless Sea: which has (bad) combat instead of Dredge's (basic rhythm action) fishing. Sunless has an exquisite novel's worth of branching, bizarre, Lovecraftian tales instead of Dredge's 2000ish words spread across about 10 characters with precisely one choice, right at the end of the game. Sunless has an eldritch reef (Sunless's has an alien intelligence that challenges you to a game of something like chess viewed from a non-euclidean angle, whilst Dredge's has a normal reef with a really, really big octopus), Sunless's ruins poking out of the ocean are cyclopean and terrifying (Kingeater's Castle: go mad, eat your crew), whilst Dredge's has generic Lovecraftian fish cult ruins with a cultist who you help do a thing that doesn't seem to matter much. For the 5 areas in Dredge, Sunless has 3 times as many interesting, more thought-provoking ideas. The music in the sunless games is far more varied and evocative, too.

So, what do you get if you remove the (bad) combat and (good) writing of sunless sea? Fetch-quests with an upgradable ship. What is Dredge? Rythmn-action fishing fetch-quests with an upgradable ship.

I don't hate it. It's a solid game. But where the hell were you all when Sunless Sea/Skies came out?",1704476320,1704476320,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Now games like this can often be described as grindy. But I don’t consider it grindy if you are having fun.  And DREDGE, like Slime Rancher before it kept me very entertained, and are both fun to play.  Now, DYSMANTLE, that felt like a grind.

I also enjoyed the graphics in DREDGE.  This can be a problem in some indie games.  DREDGE is in a bundle with a game called Dave the Diver that I had heard a lot of good things about.  However, when I saw the ugly pixel graphics of Dave, I could not imagine looking at those horrible images for hours while playing that game.  C’mon guys, make an effort.

This has its charm, particularly early on when the mystery is enticing and you feel the threat of madness from everything around you. I loved the first time I called over a ship only to be attacked by a spirit, or the unavoidable damage from certain projections. But eventually, you realize it’s all kind of the same, and the loop doesn’t evolve with enough of a challenge to do anything interesting. It’s fun, don’t get me wrong, but I would have loved for the gameplay to get increasingly complex — and for the madness mechanic to leave actual impact on my character. By the fourth island I literally stopped sleeping, because through books and boat speed I just wasn’t going mad anymore… with no repercussions. Odd.

I actually wishlisted Dredge BEFORE people started playing it on YouTube because it appeared in my discovery queue and I remember just seeing the screenshots and immediately falling in love with the art style of this game. It's simultaneously beautiful and unsettling in just the right kind of way! This game reminds me a little bit of a cartoon I used to watch back in the 2000's titled The Misadventures of Flapjack art direction wise, although that show was WAY more unsettling, and I gotta admit, I'm oddly into it!

In terms of gameplay and story, I'd pretty much call this an adventure RPG, and I've only scratched the surface! The fishing and dredging minigames are both quite fun and I like them a lot! Overall, this game is already very unique from the other adventure games I've played in terms of how it's structured. I like the way the ""inventory"" takes the form of your ship and the fishing equipment, lighting, and engines take up space the same way items do, and the way certain items take up more space than others or fill space in awkward shapes creates this sort of limited feeling to the inventory, and this contributes to another thing I really like about this game, there's this constant need to run back to a town not only to unload your inventory but also to avoid getting stranded out at sea in the fog at night, and I know this is only in my mind, but I can't help but compare that to the rush to get back to administration before the generator runs out in Amnesia: The Bunker, it's definitely the same type of tension, anyway, and I gotta admit, I'm really into it! This is also the first game I've ever played where time only passes when you're moving or doing something, which is also quite cool! I'm also getting pretty invested in the story now. The world this game is set in seems a lot more H.P Lovecraft inspired than I was expecting and I find that really cool because most of the time Lovecraft inspired games tend to be horror games and it's refreshing in a way to see a game that isn't a horror game, at least not in the traditional sense, utilize Lovecraftian storytelling and world-building tropes the way this game does. 

Overall, I'm enjoying this game a lot so far, and I can't wait to see what else is in store.

I AM playing this game on a controller, by the way. Steam says that Dredge is ""mostly playable"" on an X-box controller, but so far the controller support seems fully built in and functional, so if that's worrying you, then fear not!",1703892951,1704231285,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This was an awesome indie that surprised me. I picked it up after seeing the crossover trailer with Dave the Diver, and then heard good things from around the internet.

You're an angler working to help with an island's fishing needs. You fish, dredge up resources from ship wrecks (both to help residents and to improve your own boat), and help the locals. All seems normal for a little bit...

Resource management is cool, has a tetris kind of overlay to it. There's a day and night cycle, with different things happening at both times, including what's biting. Traversal is limited at first, but opens up in cool and interesting ways as you progress. The encyclopedia of fish is very helpful as you try to fulfill everyone's needs.

Story was simple but good, had a good twist I didn't see coming, which really fleshed out the whole of it. Won't go into spoilers of course.

I liked the Lovecraftian feel of it all, the story is very compelling (and short) and filling up the fishing journal was a lot of fun.

What I liked:
* The overall vibe is fantastically eerie.
* Some enemies are scary
* The story is good, and the endings are satisfying in a Lovecraftian way.
* Find all the fish, and completing the full boat isn't too much of a chore.

What I didn't like:
* The only thing that makes me rate it lower than a perfect 10 is the fact that this game is the same from the start until the finish. It doesn't change things around drastically which Dave the Diver (this year's fishing competitor) did.

The Pale Reach DLC is simply more of the good stuff. The only unfortunate part is that I had so much fun fishing (at the end of Dredge I was pretty OP due to me speed fishing to get all achievements) that I didn't really pay attention to the story.

IF YOU GET CONFUSED ABOUT THE LAST QUEST:
[spoiler] The final quest did have me confused though - I didn't want to hand over the last piece after my run in with the old mayor. I ran around for a good long while trying to find the rest of the ""Good ending"" options in the ""desecrated temple"" after the note ""pointed in the direction of the destroyed light house"" and had to look it up to realize that in both endings you have to hand over the last piece to the collector. -.-*  [/spoiler]

ALSO IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE LEGENDARY FISH
[spoiler] If your helm takes damage and you lose a legendary fish you can still turn in the information to the traveling merchant. You just wont have the ""sale amount"" listed in your journal. These fish do not re-spawn. [/spoiler]

I can't say that I didn't enjoy aspects of the game - I did 100% it. I will say that it doesn't feel like it stood up to its peers. The art is truly a highlight, with beautiful immersive visions of the land that blend intractable objects seamlessly into the scene. The game play however? Repeating Quick Time Event button mashes repeatedly or navigating a small boat between obstacles. It doesn't feel like fishing or dredging like a fishing simulator or intergalactic fishing. It doesn't feel like a base builder with satisfying growth like cult of the lamb. It doesn't feed the art style with synergistic game play that makes you feel out the locations through how you play like Dave the Diver. Between the lackluster game play and a very rote story, it can make a $25 ($31 with the sixth area tucked in a DLC) price tag. I'd say buy it on sale for sure.

But why finish it? Why not just write it off as a loss? There's enough heart just below the surface that it makes you dream of what could be around the next corner. It has stylistic flourishes of things that don't usually get attention - like a whale devouring one of the tentacles that attacks your boat. It makes it feel thought out, even if the story and game play don't quite match the melody that the world appears to be setting. It starts strong and then just... fades, with it not having enough power to reach the climax (though the ending scenes are enjoyable and well done). I'd look forward far more to what the studio does next rather than dwell on the missteps here. After all, with a studio of four people, this game being the result of their first product launch is a great story, warts and all.",1704132442,1704132442,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Long version: I'm a very casual gamer and the first ten minutes threw more at me than I wanted to deal with. 
I felt a bit overwhelmed, but, I'd heard so many positive comments that I forced myself to give it a fair shot. 
And I'm glad I did.
The first hour of the game wasn't great (learning-wise), but once I navigated the learning curve and got a feel for the very atmospheric world, I found myself losing track of the time. A lot of time.
There're few game play elements, but there's a surprising variety within those limited elements that keep them fresh. 
The game world's quite easy on the eyes and ear, making the whole journey all the more enjoyable. 

While I've enjoyed the game quite a bit, I do feel the price tag's just a hair on the upper end of what it should be. That said, I'm admittedly cheap and rarely buy games if they're not on sale. 
Had I 
1: not had a gift card 
AND 
2: not found the game on sale, 
I never would have bought it. 
Even though I technically got it for ""free"" With the gift card, I still feel the cost was a tad steep. Not that the developers don't deserve to be rewarded for all their time and effort and production of a quality product, but, I've been spoiled with getting much more for an equivalent or even lower price. 
Aside from that, my only other gripe is that the menu navigation with a controller is far clunkier than it has any need to be. It seemed bizarre to me that certain norms (like cycling your cursor back to the TOP of the menu if you push down at the BOTTOM of a menu) are non-existent here.

A caveat: I don't care for fishing mini games. I don't find them particularly interesting and I don't think every game needs one. Since this is a fishing game, I'll give it a pass. The fishing mini game in this one is fine. I appreciate that I don't lose my catch if I mess up. It's basically the same throughout the game, just with different visuals. Dredging is more interesting, though I'm pretty bad at it, which is fine because you can still pass even if you mess up a lot.

I find this game mind-numbingly tedious. It's a fetch quest game in a vehicle that's kind of a pain to navigate in where the points of contact aren't that close to each other. My real gripe is with the day-night cycle, which is awfully short given that travelling and fishing both take up time. You have to sleep every day or face the consequences of insanity, which takes the form of hostile monsters and birds that steal your fish aka possibly resetting your progress on a fishing fetch quest. I find that I usually can only get one thing done in a day, since I have to travel to the spot where whatever I'm fetching is at, get whatever I need to fetch, then return to one of the sparse ports so I can sleep for a few hours, then leave again.

To make matters worse, the quest screen has frustratingly little detail: you'll be asked to bring back several fish, but my memory is a bit shit and you're supposed to know the fish by the silhouette. The quest menu just says ""get the right fish"" but doesn't list them. If you want a reminder, you have to go all the way back to the person who gave you the quest, which would be bad enough without the inconvenience of the travel mechanics. I find that I have to keep a guide open while I'm playing, which for something as simple as remembering what's in the quest seems like an oversight.

I love Lovecraftian horror, so I do like the atmosphere and the spooky moments. My favorite thing is fishing for aberrations, which are interesting and fun to look at. Unfortunately, looking at them is the only thing you can do with them, other then sell them for more money than regular fish.

Before arriving, you crash your ship just below the lighthouse. Now, you must start anew with a dinky local boat in unfamiliar waters, with no idea what lies below the surface. This game is about fishing, almost exclusively. That concept initially wasn't enough for me, as I am not a huge fan of fishing in games or reality, and the survival-adjacent elements of building up your boat did not sound interesting. I have now 100% completed Dredge in the same weekend I began playing it, and I can truly say it is one of the best games to come out this year.

As mentioned, you start from basically nothing. A painfully slow moving boat takes you just outside the starting village to catch a variety of small, worthless fish. Catching fish requires completing a little timing-based minigame, which change depending on the type of fish and where they are located, which never got old throughout my playtime. Slowly, you'll gain enough money to afford an engine, more fishing rods, and gear to get you away from the first area and then the game opens up significantly. Essentially, Dredge is an open zone fishing simulator, where you fill out your encyclopedia of fish as you try to find bigger and scarier creatures. Developer Black Salt Games is not subtle with its Lovecraftian horror elements. Most types of fish have an ""aberration"" form, a genetically twisted or strange mutation that is a rare catch for each species. The smallest and the biggest fish have these alternate catches, and one of the joys of the games is just collecting them all and seeing what they have come up with.

The strongest pull of Dredge is in its core loop, which despite its slow start, the game wastes no time getting you invested in. At dawn, you set out to go find pools of fish. You have a limited amount of space in your cargo hold, so you must choose wisely and organize neatly to be able to bring in a sizable profit. Determining which fish to go for and what to let go is a careful balance, and the game does a great job of making every decision and upgrade count, from just a small increase in speed to a little more light at night. Speaking of night, you are able to fish under the moon (there are even species that only come out then), but this is at the cost of your sanity. Stuck in the darkness, you can experience hallucinations, sanity breaks, and even terrifying monsters that will not relent. The panic when night sets in before you've been able to stop at a dock is excellent, and the constant need to find a safe space shows a true understanding of horror game design. There are consequences; anything that attacks your ship can make parts malfunction or some of your catches can fall overboard. I had many instances where my engines failed, so I had to slowly crawl back to a shipyard. Some of these things may get annoying to some players, but it reinforces the harsh environment and even at your most powerful, you are never truly safe. I do wish there was an easier way to fix your boat away from the docks though.

The tone of Dredge is generally morose and oppressive. Whether you are traversing the volcanic shores of Devil's Spine or the narrow ridges of Gale Cliffs, the environment design and the supporting audiovisual elements sustain a feeling of dread and grim stagnation. Talking to people reveals side quests, which mainly request of strange characters asking you to fulfill a lifelong wish or a broken survivor trying to put their lives back together. All of the quests (obviously) require fishing, but I do wish there was some variety in quest objectives. Some form of racing with the boat, or other non-fishing minigame or objective would have gone a long way to make the game feel more dense. As is, the open sea feels like five distinct zones with nothing but ocean in the middle. Those gaps don't really feel shorter even at your max speed either, so I wish there were more fast-travel or in-universe options to hasten the pace towards the endgame.

A Collector approaches you to collect a cursed relic from each of the regions of the sea, guarded by an ancient threat. You can choose to seek them out, but who knows what fate lies on the other side if you do. I was compelled to see this story through, and was pleasantly surprised by the minimal, but interesting narrative elements. Enhanced by the pleasant soundtrack and excellent quality of life features, Dredge quickly throws you into the loop and sets you on an adventure in its dark oceans. It's a perfect length, and finding fish has never felt more fun. I can't wait to see if the devs return to this world on a second dive.",1703900872,1703900872,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I recommend adding more to the game including more side quests, more monsters and some way to shoot them or something.

Seems like I didn't have anything to work up too. Also upgrades are a bit meh, besides the motor upgrades which I felt were okay. 

As for adding more monsters and adding a weapon, I'd love to see a harpoon or something that you can get fish with or even spear (sometimes you see whales) I think it would be fun using the harpoon and steering the boat to kill the whale or monster and getting some special reward.

The writing and character design was also top notch. I was simply expecting a spooky fishing game, but Dredge also has well-developed characters and moving plotlines.

(TL:DR below) On a serious note, this game was so much fun. Gave me heavy Gravity Falls and LoZ: Phantom Hourglass vibes. Art style is very unique and pleasant (or not so much (in a good way)) to look at. Lots of unique mini-games for different types of resource gathering that consistently kept me 'hooked', as well as an engaging inventory/upgrade management system. Atmosphere is quite eerie and I would have liked a lot more of it. Characters are diverse and interesting. There were some great story beats that gave me goosebumps.

Gameplay-wise, you reach a certain point where some core mechanics no longer apply to you and as a result, you lose that sense of horror that you start the game with. Fortunately the game is long enough where this does not become a major issue. More quests that explored the lore of the world would have been nice. Random events/encounters would have done wonders to the overall experience. There are a handful at the start, but it significantly diminishes after.

Narrative-wise, I wish they went more into the lore and dived into why things are the way they are. Some events happened near the start of the game that was not touched upon later at all? Feels like they wanted to do something but dropped it, which is a major shame because it intrigued me immediately.
The ending was also a little bit lackluster and very sudden. No big finale mission, just a ""Go do this real quick and here's your ending.""

TL:DR it's a visually pretty and fun game to play with some classic Lovecraftian horror sprinkled in, but not too much is explored beyond that.",1703746848,1703747011,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

The biggest complaint I have is around its inventory management. You are forced to return to shore extremely frequently since the inventory fills up so quick, even after size upgrades. If you wait too long the fish will spoil, so you can't stay out very long anyway. In addition, you're forced to play inventory tetris all the time to try to maximize the small amount of cargo space you have, which gets old very quickly.

All in all, what I can say about the game is it had me somewhat scared to dredge at night in the beginning. The music and ambience and strangely the cartoon realism sucked me right in. Then the weird stuff began happening and I noped out of there.

However, it never evolves. For the first few hours it is great, and you become hungry for more, but the problem is... there never is more. The story goes nowhere, quests don't have consequences and everything gets resolved in the same, static way. The areas unfortunately only scratch the surface of what they could have been. They excite you and leave you wanting more, just for you to again not find anything more. I liked the gameplay for the most part, although it gets repetitive at times. It's relaxing and cozy, just how I expected it to be. There just wans't enough commitment to the eeriness.

I feel the base game is fairly priced and delivers a good amount of content, especially if you're hunting all the ""collectables"" (which I recommend). 

The DLC is obviously shorter and does have less content than 1/4 of the base game as the price tag might imply. Sure that may mean it is a slightly lower value for money proposition than the base game, but if you enjoyed it as much as I did I would still recommend picking up the DLC. It delivers exactly what I would hope for from an small expansion - some more of the same excellent game, with familiar yet unique systems to keep things interesting.

I suggest playing with gamepad for the added vibration cues to go with the lovely audio, but keep a mouse handy for inventory tetris!

You control a boat in an eldritch location where a mysterious fog descends on the seas every night and brings with it the bizarre and the horrific. So yes, very obvious Lovecraft influences. Nevertheless, the game can usually be pretty relaxing, helped by the fact that time only passes when you are moving or fishing/dredging.

Unfortunately, that rule does [b]not[/b] apply to the various abominations that want to attack your boat, which is the main source of frustration in the game. In fact, the second area you will likely visit (if you follow the storyline, which you are free not to) consists of extremely narrow passages between sheer cliffs, barely wide enough for your boat, even brushing against which takes away one of your initially just three hull points (and also potentially disables some of your equipment or tosses some of your catch away), there are falling rocks, sudden water tornadoes... and there's a monster that lives in these narrow passages which WILL try to attack you, be it day or night, forcing you to try to quickly navigate these very dangerous waters.

The actual fishing and dredging is very simple: they're just tiny minigames where you either have to press a single button whenever time comes, or, in the case of dredging, you have to jump your cursor between two lanes to avoid obstacles for some time.

After you fish something out, however, you have to store it on your tiny boat, which also has to house your fishing equipment, your engines, your light sources, and whatever else you have already fished/dredged out, all of which have their own shapes and sizes, so it becomes sort of an inventory management puzzle in a very much non-rectangular inventory.

Other than just fishing and selling your fish, or doing the main quest, you can also explore (though the map is really not as large as it initially appears to be) and find some side-quests to do.

Mechanical progression is a matter of collecting enough materials and money to upgrade your boat and its equipment, while progressing through the main story requires you visiting several different locations, each with its own gimmick, and doing something there.

While it's not really required for anything, the biggest problem with the game is trying to get a specific rare fish, or, worse yet, a specific aberration of a specific rare fish (to 100% the encyclopedia, for example). The fishing spots are hard to, well, spot even with the spyglass (because you have to be pointing precisely at it while it's somewhere in the distance hidden behind the waves, oh, and also you are being rocked by the waves), they aren't infinite (for a lot of fish you'll be lucky if you find a spot that allows you to fish more than one), and the rules on when they ""respawn"" aren't entirely clear. That's not even getting into net-only or crabpot-only catches, which are entirely random. And getting an aberration is purely chance-based as well (though you can increase your chances somewhat, it's never a guarantee).

Oh, and you can also make the abyssal-horror-lure-phantom-copies-of-your-boat echo back your foghorn precisely, which means you can make them echo back a simple one-note melody, such as ""a shave and a haircut"", which was my favorite useless feature of the game.",1703534497,1703534497,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Okay, mediocrity is a bit of a strong word. The game still manages to be very engaging, and the way it channels the spirit of Lovecraft's... uh... craft - a nice surprise, considering how often ""Lovecraftian"" is just a shorthand for tentacled cosmic horrors. But that only strengthens the burning question I'm left with after beating it: [i]what if?[/i]

[h1]Sunrise over [strike]Innsmouth[/strike] the Marrows[/h1]
See, DREDGE has a very strong start. Something's not right. You [i]know[/i] something is going to happen. Fishing? Sure, let's fish, sell the fish, get better gear. Don't pay attention to the black ooze coming from the package you're asked to deliver. And make sure to come back before sundown.

Point is: the mood is there. On top of it, you're given a nice gameplay loop with an extensive upgrade tree. Oh yeah. This is going to be a great ride. Eventually, you begin the main quest in the earnest, and things really get moving.

[h1]A leak in the hull[/h1]
But then you slowly start noticing the flaws. The pacing is not quite right, for example. When upgrading my boat, I often felt constrained in this... artificial way. Almost like I'm just [i]supposed[/i] to do things in a specific way. This one's a bit hard to explain, and maybe it's a me problem; who knows. 

Another artificial feeling comes when you realise how the game world is structured. It feels less like a living, breathing world, and more like, well, a set of video game levels. Everything is too deliberate; too functional. You might say that it's a good thing, keeps things lean. I say it's a tradeoff - one I personally didn't like too much.

[h1]Light up the night[/h1]
And the final complaint is that once you begin the main quest, the dread just stops. Yes, there is the general feeling of 'what the hell am I even working towards' which keeps going until the very end, but that's about it. The areas start feeling sterile. The threats - all manageable with ease. Even the night stops being an issue after a while.

Also, the general design of the areas other than the central one is just... not very eldritch, if that makes any sense? There's nothing ominous about them. Yes, there are major, location-specific threats, but they're rather obvious and have some pretty fool-proof ways of neutralising. Maybe it's my fault for comparing this game in my mind to [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/304650/SUNLESS_SEA/?curator_clanid=42922988]Sunless Sea[/url] (can you blame me?), where literally every place filled you with a dread of different flavour (even if the gameplay itself was nowhere near as fun as here).

[h1]Rise from the depths[/h1]
Yeah, the game is fun, in spite of all these flaws. Fishing might be a collection of minigames, but they're varied and short. The inventory management is a pleasure throughout the entire game. And even though I said that the threats are all trivial to manage, it still remains a thrill to do so - mainly because your boat is very susceptible to damage, and every hit can ruin your haul.

And the main mystery, hoo boy. You're being fed pieces of the truth as you go, and let me tell you: I've seen [i]a lot[/i] of mysteries. I hate the extent of my plot prediction abilities. And here? I managed to piece one thing together, but the final twist caught me off guard like a champ. And it's [i]excellently[/i] foreshadowed. 

[h1]Throw me back[/h1]
I guess I just wanted... more. More mystery. More exploring. More upgrades. It's a great game, all things considered; and the combination of fishing and Lovecraft seems like such a natural concept. And yes, in spite of everything I wrote, I recommend this game wholeheartedly - even if, or perhaps especially if you're not very good with horror.

And for those who don't generally play indie titles - thanks for reading. DREDGE is a good game, but trust me, if you decide to, uh, dredge the depths of the Ocean of Steam, there are so many amazing experiences out there to find. For sure, play this one; just perhaps consider throwing your fishing line into the unknown sometime. You'll be very surprised by what you'll find.

Some are worth doing and get you upgrades to your ship, but even then its mostly flavor. Like, you can get faster at fishing but you don't really need the money after a certain point, and the main narrative is pretty easy to do without fully upgrading.

The game is dripping atmosphere though; very engrossing story hooks (heh) and a modicum of tactical inventory management help to buffer the monotony of playing the same fishing mini-games (I think there're like 5 or 6 max) over and over. Ultimately I think the game would be better served by being more challenging, either more weather effects to fight against or a trickier mini-game here and there would have made upgrading feel more worthwhile.

The fish designs are fucking cool though, and definitely will unnerve you at times you least expect. The flavor is undoubtedly chomped from H.P. Lovecraft. A more fraught and hackneyed inspiration there has never been, but the Devs here really make it something special  by focusing on the fishing angle.

There is a story, and its okay, but I found the game play to be the most enjoyable part. There's many different fish varieties that you can catch. The fishing mini game vary slightly depending on the area or the type of fish that you are catching. You also have to manage storing the fish you catch on your boat until you reach a port where you can sell them (it's quite similar to resident evil's storage system). It's fun having to figure out the best way to place your different sized fish to fit in as many as possible.

It's a relatively short game; the different endings can be achieved in less than 10 hours, even if you're real casual about it. If you're a hardcore horror fan, this game might not be scary enough for you. I haven't played many horror games, so the horror level was perfect for me.

Each sub-area has its own unique feeling and challenges, the art style is visually distinct and adds to the setting and mood, the music and audio cues let you immerse yourself and add to the discomfort that the eldritch aspects of the game aim to inspire.

Graphics are simple and effective. Water effects are beautiful and the caracters' artwork is top notch. Reminded a little bit of Disco Elysium. Sound is superb and the music is atmospheric and tense. This would be a very different review if the sound wasn't as good as it is here.

Length: 1/2
It took me 12 hours to do both endings and to do all side quests. I could play it for longer, do more upgrades, chase after rare fish or treasue. The gameplay loop is that addicting.

Gameplay: 1/2
It takes some time to get used to the boat controls, but you can really feel a sense of progression as your boat gets progressively more equipped. The inventory mangement aspect is done in a very simple and engaging way. Never have I felt frustration while engaging with this system. The fishing / dredging minigames are simple and are a nice distraction. Also they do not overstay their welcome, so things remain fresh.
The save system is amazing. I wish more games like this would adapt to this old-school-esque saving system.
I'm taking one point off due to some early game frustration where something will hit your boat and randomly your only engine will stop and now you're playing sea slug simulator. We could also use more incentive on catching all the fish or pursue rarer loot or legendary fish.

Story: 2/2
I'm impressed. While Dredge's story (probably) won't be worth an HBO series, I was very surprised with the content here. The world is moody and mysterious. Characters are well presented and are fascinating to talk to. I was always excited to see what piece of lore would be dropped next. The game has two endings and it allows you to enjoy both in the same playthrough, which is a welcome quality of life that I wish was more common in today's games.
All in all, it's a nice mystery to be a part of and both the conclusions are satisfying in their own way.

Lasting Impression: 2/2
I'll be recommending Dredge to everyone. At the moment of this writing I beat dredge 1 hour ago, and it's probably one of my all-time favorite games. Let's see how this statement holds itself in the future.

Uniqueness: 1/2
I'm so glad they did not went the roguelike route with this game. It's a boat RPG where crafting is actually meaningful and fun. It's relaxing at times and dreadful at others. It's a game of extremes and they knew fully well how to craft an experience that would take full advantage of this.

Total Score: 9/10

At it's core it's got a nice idea, playing as a fisherman in a lovecraft story. However the characters are very thin and the story is somewhat minimal, so you aren't going to get any deep conversations or meaningful themes.
Perhaps gameplay? It's a good game to play in the background, but for a creeping dread horror game that's not a strong endorsement. I thought it was going to be scary in a ""Is that just a trick of the light, or did that shadow just move?"" kind of way. As your paranoia meter goes up, more spooky things start happening to you, but this already shows a fundamental misunderstanding, Now there's a clear line between I am in danger and I am not in danger. Spoiler: [spoiler]If your paranoia meter isn't flashing red, you're not in danger. Any potential danger outside of this is very easy to spot.[/spoiler]

""But it's an adventure game"" There's 5 locations in the base game each with a minor gimmick and a few fetch quests.
I don't understand why this game is overwhelmingly positive. It's alright, it's not a bad game. On a sale I'd even recommend it, but as it stands the game is just kind of mediocre. The game has a lot of potential but squanders it with a lack of character, intellectual meat, or quest variety.

Additional Note for the Devs: [spoiler]If you're going to add an enemy that resembles another boat, have there be other ships that we can mistake it for. As it stands, I can see it from distance and cleanly avoid it.[/spoiler]",1703285185,1703285185,False,16,1,0.651252627372741699,0,True,False,False

Level design was mostly innocent, but also felt goofy at times just from the nature of the way I explore games.

I'd say, if you want to play a fishing game with great lovecraft atmosphere, then this would be a huge recommend, but I was here for some lovecraftian horror and storytelling that I feel fell short.

I would have really liked some characters to have more dialogue after their pursuits/quests are complete. It really feels like someone asks something of you, you do it and then nothing happens. I don't think this is excused by the whole ""Horrors beyond comprehension"" trope either as EARLY QUEST SPOILERS: [spoiler] literally nothing happens when the fish market is given an aberration to eat. He just closes for a couple days and then pretends it didn't happen. Similar with the dock worker. Dude apparently just placed an order for a horror beyond his reading level and then stands there for the rest of the game as a pale zombie. [/spoiler]

Maybe the game just isn't exactly for me as I believe the appeal of being a fisherman is meant to be as present a selling point as the eldritch horror. It would hurt the fishing catalogers to suddenly and without waning have important NPCs lose their minds from staring at a rock too long,  but I still feel that a lot of the horror could be expanded on conceptually and fleshed out like the end of the main story pursuit is which was really cool!

The ice DLC is good except for the weird entrance to the iceberg. which felt... idk too artificial?
The key DLC is garbage though. I don't have a problem with supporting devs for making a sick game, but the workshop that the key unlocks is visible for 98% of the game and nothing tells the player that they need a DLC they don't have in order to open it.

This is finally a proper fishing game that captures the world, cool mysterious stories, setting out to sail, managing your ship and upgrades, finding secrets and loot.

It could have been a masterpiece if there was a bit more substance to it. I liked the fishing mechanics in the beginning despite them being simple. If only they went with more complexity I think it would have kept it interesting - especially for the rare fish.
There should have been something to balance time, as it stands you can just wait for no penalty, then why risk anything - just sleep away or wait till dawn.
And of course, the game doesn't overstay its welcome but also the pattern emerges quickly and it can really only sustain its current length - it needed to be changed up a bit and extended.

The soundscape is very good 9/10 but feel its often a few seconds lacking, one or two pieces too repetitive. 

Many quest threads and characters have one off interactions, I'm left wanting more interaction from the characters but the abruptness is also important to the narrative, the eel quest stands out as the weakest quest/character.

so what are the shortcomings then?

Beat main game with new DLC in under 10 hours even when i focused on getting a lot of boat and gear upgrades, could definitely have beaten the game without a majority of them. The first 3-4 hours were great, but the initial eldritch vibes really only stay for the starting area. Once the initial 'eldritch' vibe that is introduced wears off, it loses a lot of its creepy factor. It was disappointing that the initial town did not get expanded on much, I was hoping they would have stayed as recurring characters since i thought they did well with the creepy aspect on that starting region, but no, you treat every region as pretty much its own place and ignore the previous region you were in. The hungry hungry hippo cultists that eat fish felt like the only thing tying regions together since they were all freaking gourmands that wanted some deluxe fish delivery service. 
The DLC is an afterthought, I steamrolled it in maybe 30-45 minutes? It felt really disjointed with the rest of the islands for me since I went there after I beat the game with endgame setup. Probably need to go there when you are in between gale cliffs and stellar basin in terms of progression, but I didn't see anything hinting at that in game.

I like collecting things, I like puttering around and exploring, I like fishing games and minigames, and I also really like eldritch horrors beyond mortal comprehension. And Dredge hits all of those buttons for me!

First and foremost: the lack of time-gating. While of course a major aspect of the game is avoiding going out at night, or at least managing your time out there very carefully, I have never felt pressure or stress; this is a big failure of many farm sims and cozy games for me, because I inevitably get stressed out trying to do everything that needs doing before the day needs to roll over. The closest Dredge has to time management is making sure you get your catch back to port before the fish all rot into nothing, and that can take a day or two of ingame time; plenty of time to get to the fishmonger and even if the catch isn't fresh, you still get some coin for your troubles.

(My understanding is at one point a set of sidequests DID have a timegate element, but that has been patched out. To which I say, thank you, Black Salt!)

The mechanics of the game are very easy to pick up, too. I like crunchy mechanics, but I also like simplicity, and balancing cargo space and engines and rods gave me the opportunity to fiddle with fishing strategies without being overwhelming or frustrating. Features like the spyglass to help scout out pools of fish are incredibly helpful, too, and get a ton of use.

Also, this game is beautiful. I enjoy the oppressive atmosphere of the fog, the creeping awareness of the dangers unique to each region of the game, and the unsettling designs of the aberration fish--these are all stunningly well done. But the locations, the ocean itself? Incredible. I am from Lovecraft Country AKA New England and watching my little fishing dinghy rise and fall on the swells and catching sight of a loggerhead turtle in the water or humpback breaching the surface just makes something in me content and happy. There's a lot of love and care put into the visuals and it's very easy to immerse myself.

Also there was this one time in Devil's Spine that I woke up some sort of giant tentacle that was I frantically running away from and then a sperm whale showed up to make that tentacle lunch. That was pretty bitching.

So yeah, do you like fishing? Do you like gorgeous games? Do you like the growing dread of knowing something's in the water and it's not going to let you leave? Play Dredge!",1703032336,1703032336,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In general it just feels good to play this game. Lots to explore and find.

The quests in the game are however, fetch quests. The entire main story is kind of a mcguffin hunt where each mcguffin can be acquired by finishing up a fetch quest. Not very interesting in the grand scheme of things.

The story itself is serviceable but feels disappointingly short. Right when you get to an interesting twist, some sort of answers, the game is basically done. The ending of the story feels like it just kind of ends too soon, too quick. There is no post-game, you get booted back to just before you trigger the ending when you go back to your save file.

However, I do think there are some areas where the game could be improved to just get it from a tier to s tier, such as:

- Amping up the horror, i felt once you got used to certain hazards the effect wore off quickly, some more horror just in regular gameplay, variety and consideration into how the horror affects people would be great. The effects of having high panic were also very minimal, with pretty easy to avoid enemies as well as them not spawning half the time so your screen goes red and then pretty much nothing else happening.

- I feel like the story segments were just a little bland, they were pretty short and extremely easy to do, and i think the game should try to be more difficult in general. Adding more length and detail to the story I think would help it feel more like a plot than a series of loosely connected events. (not to mention making lore more easily accessible and digestible)

- Story Spoilers: [spoiler] I don't know, I felt like both endings weren't super great. I'm a bit tired of the trope where someone tries to revive a loved one and ends up ending the world, and the mc dying randomly in the other ending was just strange. I think a better route could be taken than cthulu being like an ultimate big bad, for example giving some nuance to the deep magic and maybe not painting it as totally evil all the time as well as making the deep not a kingdom ruled by cthulu but more just a collection of monsters and various magics that the player could harness either for personal gain or to help people. [/spoiler] 

-[spoiler] I somewhat enjoyed the dlc, but i feel that it was just a little poorly thought out. the story was incredibly short, the area felt just kind of bleak and not interesting, the monster wasn't scary, and through extremely easy means you can get both an item that renders the manifest ability pointless as well as an item that renders the previous best net in the game pointless.

I felt the pacing was very weird, the game very quickly becomes easy and there are very few side quests that are not just ""get me this fish"", and those that are there are done quickly. The world felt very small and arbitrary, and there is very little to do. 

All of this said however, I would still recommend it as a short game (much shorter than I expected), because it has great atmosphere and despite simplistic textures, they manage to convey the feel of Lovecraftian horror well, and though it quickly became pointless, the fishing was quite fun and there were varied methods of catching, so it didn't become monotonous. 

I know people don't like grinding, but I feel Dredge could have benefited from some higher hurdles to progress to extend the time spent in each area. I wanted to be in the areas longer and soak in the atmosphere but there was quickly nothing left to do so I just had to move on. 
While there is certainly merit to letting the players find things out on their own, I still feel you give them tools to do so, especially when you don't really have to revisit places. (I have too many points so I'll stop here)

The kind of joy I first felt when I got into flash video-games as a silly, young child. 
The kind of joy where you don't bother with mechanics or stress over anything, you just play something and the game fits like a glove, comfy and fun.

-The art is cute.

-The atmosphere is on-point.

-If you screw up it's not too punishing, you will at most lose a replaceable item or two overboard, it's the perfect amount of ''i don't wanna bash my boat against that rock, but if i do i won't feel frustrated''

-The game saves every time you rest the night at a dock which is very often (I think? i got to day 60~ and died only once)

-The mini-games are enjoyable, varied, responsive, etc.

-The different stuff you can catch is actually somewhat interesting, and it's quite nice to be invested into finding specific fish to better tetris your cargo hold.

-The fish that are horrors-beyond-imagination mutations are interesting to look at and read the descriptions.

-The game-play loop is satisfying, 

-The game doesn't hold your hand per se. you can always go off fishing and upgrading your boat and pursue the main missions later (which is what i did because i just enjoyed the fishing) but you always have them there, to pursue at your leisure.

-I just really enjoy playing tetris with fish, apparently.

The only, but very major complaint I have: It is so short! Yes, you can keep grinding all the fishes you desire, but that really wasn't the point of the game for me - the simple minigames become pointless at certain point and I am no slave to achievements, just for the sake of completing a checklist. And I also have to say that after initial first few hours, the game loses the main charm. It's still a good game, but first few hours were the peak.

I was expecting more narrative based gameplay, but that gradually goes away, as you keep going further - don't expect Sunless Sea. The storytelling is decent, but it holds up only for the first half of the game, then it's more about just going by the checklists and exploring rather mechanically the remaining places.

I would love to see this concept, but further expanded, with even more in-depth gameplay, rather than few repeated minigames, which are fine, but get inevitably boring, and mostly, with much more narrative focused sandbox gameplay.

Other than fish, the world felt a little empty, but what was there, I really enjoyed. The atmosphere is great, especially the way madness creeps up on you when staying awake for too long.
Mechanics and gameplay loop are pretty decent too, but it's still a fishing game of course - So gameplay is not particularly dense and the game feels a little short at 10-15 hours, considering the pricepoint. I just wish there was more exploration and story. 

DLC: If it's your first playthrough, it's a nice addition. If you're considering returning purely for the DLC, I'd say: Don't bother.

Pro: 
> Atmosphere and storytelling. This is not a jumpscare-feast, focussing more on creating an unsettling environment in which one is so, so relieved to spot another person. Main and Side quests lead one to explore the map, and forcing to navigate through the darkness and/or new challenges imposed by the different areas. The game knows how to inflict thalassophobia.
> Artstyle. It just looks amazing and rough, with the simplicity of the character designs emitting exactly what their dialogue and task would make one assume they'd look like. 
> Exploration. The areas and their respective fish just make sense, and one has to carefully consider what type of gear to take on bord as space is limited. I spend quite the time just driving around gawking at islands being a little sad I could not hop off the boat, and even more time chasing sunrises and sunsets on open sea.
> Immersion. I forgot everything around myself for a while, finding out the story's startoff and working on the first improvements to the boat. Time passing as one fishes keeps one on edge, seeing how there is more than just us on the seas - and they know where we are.
> The main story ending. After getting used to the horror a little not spooked by all anymore, the ending sequence was ... intense, to say the least. 
> Feeding doggo, petting doggo.

Cons:  
> Achievement hunting. One needs the DLCs to go for perfection, and chasing all fishies after finishing the main story is a little drag. 
> Money and Endgame. Even before finishing the story, at some point the passive income by nets and such, and just emptying one's cargo in between aberration hunting, leads to 20k+ of money one never needs anymore after finishing all additions to the boat and buying all gear. That may be something someone not actively achievement-hunting may not be affected by because the main storyline itself and the possible upgrades match quite well.
> Duration. The game was too short for how amazingly good it is. I was so happy about the Pale Reach DLC because it meant I could go explore and hunt again, after the story had been over. 

Altogether, all the things that I put as a con are self-inflicted and my fault alone. Dredge is a quiet masterpiece, pensive and haunting, and I still am sad I played through it already.

A lot of indie developers these days get lightning and then fail to capture it.
Sure, this game isn't especially large or long, but the fact that the developers kept some realistic bounds to the game really allowed them to put the detail and shine into everything that needed it. Better to start strong and small and win than try something too big and fail.

When I picked the game up I didn't really look into it, I just saw some clips and thought ""cool, fishing game"" and bought it. Imagine my surprise when I fished up the All Seeing Cod.
Even though it puts a spin on the fishing game genre with horror, it hits both notes high. It's a very relaxing fishing game sometimes, and then a tense horror game a few minutes later. This game knows what it wants to be and then does it.

The best description I can give is that it gives an intense feeling of nostalgia of the singleplayer gaming experience from growing up gaming. Truly entertaining story, and I found myself not skipping through dialogue and really immersing myself into it. It wasn't overwritten and it didn't feel like it was padding for time, as a lot of singleplayer games feel to me nowadays.

Also, I'm not really into horror or mystery type games, but this game does a really good job with the horror and mystery. It's not resident evil with 2 jumpscares a minute, and it's mysterious enough where you have to really evaluate the environment and figure it out for yourself.

It is not nearly good enough to deserve the 98% Overwhelmingly positive rating it has. It is a decent 7/10 game, it has pretty graphics, nice music, great art style. But it lacks a solid gameplay core. 

[h2] FISHING [/h2]
Yeah, there is fishing in it, as advertised, but it is very [spoiler] pun ahead [/spoiler] depthless. Sure, you can catch fish. Sure, there are a lot of different kinds of fish, all of them have different [spoiler] corrupted [/spoiler] versions that are VERY well made, interesting and diverse. But... A good fishing game is ought to have something more than fancy looking fish, don't you all think? So, when it comes to actual fishing GAMEPLAY, this game really shows it's flaws. All this game can offer in terms of fishing mechanics is some simple reaction minigame that changes very slightly with different types of fish. There are no baits or different fishing techniques (e.g spin fishing, casting, etc.), so you do the same thing over and over, no matter what kind of fish you are trying to catch (There are crab traps, but I don't think they are worth mentioning). You basically treat all fish spots like you would treat ore deposits in some MMORPG game. You just see one, come to it, gather it and pass on. I wish there was more things about fishing in this game, like fish reacting to different weather or time of day, but unfortunately, in this state the game is not that good when it comes to actual fishing. 

[h2] ENEMIES AND HAZARDS [/h2] 
I wish I could say that this game is better at being a horror game than it is at fishing, but sadly it is not. Nothing really stops you from going out to catch some fish even in the middle of the night, because all threats in this game are easily manageable, avoidable and hardly scary. Imagine a lone, puny fishing boat, traversing an endless sea of fog, its dim lantern casting feeble light, barely sufficient to see anything at all, while an eldritch horror lurks just beneath... Now forget it, because you will not feel any ""dread"" or thalassophobia, there are only 3 types of hazards in this game that you will constantly encounter, and none of them are even remotely scary. And to make things even worse, somewhere closer to the 40% of the game your ship will turn into a Formula 1 racing motorboat that is capable of moving at a stable speed of 150 KM/H (or 80 knots, if you are a maritime transport nerd), so even if you somehow find yourself surrounded by hazards and monsters, you can just easily run away. 

[h2] LORE AND CHARACTERS [/h2] 
Slight spoilers ahead.
The game welcomes you by a nice small questline that really hooks you and creates an amazing feeling of suspense, but like all other things in this game, it quickly loses it's charm, and after a few hours in game you realize that you barely get any new lore, and instead of a lovecraftian horror adventure you are doing simple chores given by random people. There is only 1 main questline, with a choice at the very end of the game that changes the ending. Most of the characters in the game have some dialogues available from the start of the game, but once you've read them all you can basically forget about those characters, they will not get any new dialogue options based on your progress in the game or the quests you've completed, For example, let's look at the mayor. At first he looks like a stereotypical fat greedy mayor, he gives you some basic instructions, and then gives you a *suspicious* box to deliver. For the first 30 minutes of the game he feels alive, he feels like a character that reacts to your actions and the world itself, but once you've completed the tutorial questline, he just becomes a cardboard cutout man that just stands there and does NOTHING. Even when you've almost completed the game and completed around 10 different sidequests, he will have the same dialogue options he had when you just finished his beginning quests. And it's the same with EVERY SINGLE character in this game except 2 characters that are basically main quest characters. And even those 2 don't have enough lore dialogues for my liking. My other complaint about this game's worldbuilding is that it does not react to your actions. Why do we need 200 different types of corrupted fish when traders don't even react to that? There is only 1 quest at the beginning of the game where you have to bring some corrupted fish to the trader at the home city, but after it, corrupted fish and regular fish become basically the same. Imagine how fantastically cool it could be if the city and NPCs actually changed if you sell too much corrupted fish to them? Like mayor becoming more and more suspicious and fish-like, city houses becoming visually more neglected and desolate, etc. Also, there are some creepy hooded creatures scattered across the map who demand you to sacrifice different fish to them, and as a reward you get.... Skill books that improve your stats by a few percents. Great.

[h2] CONCLUSION [/h2] 
In conclusion we have a game that is not a great fishing simulator, and also not a great lovecraftian adventure game. It lies somewhere in between, so neither of those two aspects of the game is good enough to outweight the flaws of the other. It is a nice game to get on a 50% discount, but as I said at the very beginning - lower your expectations.

All this while following the story of a lone fisherman that is haunted by his past. 

The game isn't complex and nor does it go into pretentious overthinking of its themes. It is what it is, a little loveletter to classic Lovecraft and his sleepy hamlets coated in nightmare fuel. This game is also a great grab if you like to get comfy with your Steam Deck and enjoy a bit of horror while snuggled up in bed. This came in so handy with me being sick for like ever it seems. 

Sometimes its nice to appreciate and enjoy the simpler side of indie games. Could it be more in depth with systems? Survival mechanics? A bit more balance to economy?

The game is full of cool mechanics and other things that dont go anywhere.
[u]This game is essentially euro truck simulator at sea.[/u]
I wouldnt mind the 9 hour length if it offered more, but for 25€, or 18€ in my case, its just not enough. Im not asking for more content, im asking for the content that's already there to have a gradient, a curve to it, im asking for things to escalate as the game goes on. 
It bums me because it could have been so much more! Its set up to be what it isnt! This is like grinding in an MMO, just with great atmosphere.
[u]This is essentially a game jam prototype polished to appear as a full game.
Take this as a hesitant recommendation, reasons why below[/u]

The mechanics work well together and they are fun, but they dont change over the course of the game. The fishing minigame for example never gets harder. Reeling in a shark, or a mutant shark even, is just as hard as reeling in an ordinary small fry.
Picking up a piece of wood from the surface is just as easy as dragging jewelry from a sunken wreck from way deep.
There are mimic crabs that disguise themselves as sunken boats and whatnot, but they dont move, they dont entice you to get closer, they just sit there, and when you come close they try to strike and you have a lot of time to just get away. Thats it. A great idea, that doesnt actually do anything. 


The scary monsters and other things are really easy to avoid and pose no threat. You cant maintain the great vibes if you dont back them up. For me to fear the dark, there actually has to be something to fear in it. The game has a very strong and foreboding atmosphere and when you try your luck, you arent put into a dangerous spot. Sure there are hostile creatures but just like the mimic crab they are not dangerous. At all. Its hard to take the excellent vibes seriously when there's nothing backing them up.

Same goes for the story.
There's a dockworker who receives a [spoiler]mysterious dripping package[/spoiler], you give it to them, and then [spoiler]they turn into a fishy zombie[/spoiler]. They dont talk, no other NPC mentions it ever, and since they werent an NPC with a purpose like a shopkeeper or something, they just sit there for the rest of the game, with no follow-up to an interesting plot setup. It ends abruptly. 

When the fishmonger asks for a mutant fish, [spoiler]to see what would happen if someone ate it, he closes up shop, disappears for two days so no shop, then comes back, looks the same, mutters something about you not being there yesterday (because he didnt open the shop)[/spoiler], and then everything goes back to normal. No consequence actually happens after this, no follow-up, nothing.

Very early on its emphasized that installing things on your boat takes time and you should schedule it properly, but why? There is absolutely no urgency in this game and when i dock the boat i can wait for days at my will. Why should i care that installing my new fishing rod is going to take 6 hours? I have all the time in the world. This is what i mean with this game. It has excellent ideas that it doesnt follow-up on!

The NPC's also talk about how the mayor of the other island went insane, and disappeared, [spoiler]and you can later find him, and he babbles about things, and then he disappears[/spoiler]. You cant talk to the other NPC's about this, you cant tell the other mayor that this mayor what happened, nothing. 

On one of the island clusters, there's a cultist, [spoiler]who literally burns himself alive[/spoiler], and nothing happens. He had the item with him you needed, you got it now, cool, thats it. No follow-up. No consequence, no lasting effect.

The NPC's also mention the photographer a bunch, and how she disappeared, and she might be in danger, and i should look for her, and when i find her, she's just there. Not scared, not in danger, just taking pictures of things, tells me to get a thing for her, i give it to her, get a reward, and the entire """"chain"""" ends there. I cant report back to the townsfolk that she's alright, she's not in danger, nothing actually happens in this game. 'Please get a thing for me. Oh, you got the thing? Cool, here's some reward, now go away.'

There is an island cluster with [spoiler]a giant kraken in its middle. [/spoiler]The entire story goes as follows:
You show up, [spoiler]the giant nightmare kraken is there already and destroyed the research lab[/spoiler], scientist lady tells you to get a thing, she gives you a gadget that [spoiler]temporarily scares away the kraken[/spoiler], you get the relic you came here for, you leave. [spoiler]The kraken is still there, its still a massive danger to everything[/spoiler], and apparently thats fine and we are not going to do anything about it, since we got what we came for.

The ending is doing the same mistake aswell. When you get the fifth relic, you get to make the only decision in this game, which is choose the ending. In the bad ending, [spoiler]you perform literal necromancy, AND raise an elder GOD, and aside from showing the main city of the game as a burning ruin[/spoiler], nothing actually happens, roll credits. [spoiler]The revived person has no dialogue with you[/spoiler], the entire cutscene is only like 15 seconds long, and its a great setup for things and it just doesnt go anywhere. Again, a great idea, they didnt do anything with. Really? [spoiler]You resurrect her and she doesnt say anything, be a mutant, get mad at you or anything. [/spoiler]Hell, the entire ending is: 'NPC tells you to go to a place, you go to a place, 15 second cutscene plays, roll credits, you're back to main menu, and loading the save puts you before you started the ending'. This applies to both good and bad endings. This is exactly how both cutscenes work. You go to the same place, same cutscene length, same letdown. 


I guess i just feel bummed because this feels like i was lied to. And because i overpaid. This is a 10€ game where you grind for 9 hours while listening to youtube. Thats the entire game.

Adored the Lovecraftian element and were genuine moments of terror when i was relatively new to the game and wasn't aware of the random events that occur during night time.

Art style was charming and the soundtrack was very soothing and fit right in with the immersion of the game.

My only issues were Inventory space and the progress to getting the better gear felt a bit sluggish. I completed the game with half of the equipment still locked and the ending felt a little bit anti-climactic but is totally understandable from a lovecraftian angle. 

also i wasn't big fan of the little fish at Devil's spine, they weren't scary or much of a threat as much as they were just super annoying. I know you can get rid of them by burning them with the hot water from the underwater volcano thingy's but they'd just make a b-line for wherever there spawn point was which was often where i needed to go. They were also really badly placed, it felt like no matter what direction you took you were going to encounter them at the same time trying narrowly avoid walls and the mother was just a really unpleasant experience.

Easily fixed by removing some of the more clustered spawn points and perhaps setting a cooldown for when the little piranha things appear back at their spawn.

I feel what could have made this game a lot better is having a sort of corruption system. For instance one of the early sidequests is the fish merchant you sell fish to asking you to get a corrupted fish and when you get him the fish he shuts himself away for a day, comes back and groans about a headache and its NEVER touched upon again. I feel like it was a missed opportunity to keep bringing him more screwed up fish and watch him get more and more horribly disfigured due to him consuming all the fish, just didn't seem to go anywhere which is a little disappointing.

The game plays well, I encountered no bugs, soundtrack is nice, its really aesthetically appealing and has a little interesting story. So... whats the catch?

Dredge is short (between 12 and 15 hours short), its easy and doesnt provide much of a challenge, most of the ""upgrades"" arent really needed or get any use and has no replayability value. But, again, a longer game might have felt repetitive whilst the relaxed gameplay doesnt really need a complex upgrade system. 

The game is just short enough to keep you busy and entertained until the end is nigh so, I dont know if any change in this balance would have payed up.

On the other hand: it's not the smoothest to play, sometimes being hit once is way too unforgiving, and you can't expect me to remember what the shadows of 9 fish look like without opening up a guide.

There's a main npc that has his objective whom you help. The why is only revealed at the last minute of the game at the end. While the ending idea is good, it is done so boringly and in an underwhelming way that it completely fails to deliver. The rest of npcs give you some simple fetch quests which are almost unrelated to main story. You find the same boring npc merchant in every single island who -what a surprise- has also one fetch quest for you.

You go fishing and upgrade your ship while encountering various eldritch horrors, especially if you get greedy and take risks.

This allows the player to sort of scale the difficulty to their preference in addition to the settings themselves.  I took a lot of risks, and still found it pretty easy.

I wouldn't describe it as especially scary, though it does have moments, particularly if something catches you by surprise.  The one time I remember dying, it was because I was being greedy and overconfident early on and crashed into a rock while being chased.

Once you start stacking on the upgrades though, most threats become an inconvenience.  All in all, it does add up to a bit of a mismatch of themes.  The player feels powerful, the NPCs are mostly friendly and helpful, and the horror element feels a little blunted rather than something overwhelming waiting for you to make a little mistake or just be unlucky, as would perhaps fit better with a game in this genre.   Despite the theme, in many ways it is closer to Stardew Valley than it is to Darkest Dungeon.

That aside though, it is an addictive, fun game which is absolutely worth the asking price.  I started a second run right after finishing my first just to re-experience the early game after I knew what I was doing.

Final Notes: 
Obviously Lovecraftian at heart, but it has more to offer than just being a love letter to the Cthulhu mythos. Charmingly simple, intriguingly mysterious atmosphere, and just a downright fresh experience. It's one of those rare games that made me feel like I'm finding video games again for the first time, and not just playing ""the newest installment of the same game I played the last however many years but slightly worse"" that so many franchises and genres suffer from these days.

Every area is barebones, generally with a single NPC to talk to (not including the same shopkeeper in every area), who needs a specific fish for some reason and then you get a small powerup like fast travel or fishing really fast for a bit. 

They should remove the lovecraftian tag because there's pretty much no horror in the game at all. The scariest thing that can happen is a large snake thing chasing you. None of the NPCs seem to care, and the spooky lovecrafting powers are just  random game tools like fast travel or a speed boost. It's very hard for anyone to take it as a mysterious otherworldly power when it's just the equivalent of stepping on the accelerator.

Most NPCs have no interaction after the first time you talk to them. There's a point in the game where you have to help an NPC called The builder make a house and then take them there. At which point you never say anything new. Most NPCs are in the first 2 areas after which you'll won't even find more than 1 per zone.

Every quest is a fetch quest and all of them are convuluted reasons for which someone wants a particular fish. 
Even then, it can be nonsensical. There's a quest to give a certain fish to a robed cult members and the reward is a boost to your engine.

Not DREDGE, however- the only time I felt like I was actually ""grinding"" was at the very end, for the last 10 aberrations. With the proper equipment, aberrations (special fish variants) became common enough (without actually being 'common,' per se) that it wasn't an interminable grind to complete the encyclopedia, and the sidequests added further intrigue while providing well-worthwhile rewards. 
The hazards in each area felt unique, and provided some genuine tension as I proceeded through the quests. I did a genuine double-take the first time I encountered [spoiler]the anglerfish[/spoiler], in particular- well done, you bastards. 
Honestly, the only reason I'd hesitate to give this game a 10/10 is because the outer areas of the circular region (i.e., the west and east ends) seem pretty empty, but I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that it's going to include content in a future DLC. Other than that, the game did what it intended to do, and that's a job well done. I was able to get the platinum in about 12 hours (not including 5 hours of idly enjoying the ambience), too.

The Good
- The art style was unique and very suitable for the tone of the game
- It promoted a sense of calm that evolved into an entirely different experience over time
- The pacing in the game is a work of art. It's rare to see pacing so well done.
- I loved the creativity in the various species of fish, the way the plot unfolds, etc
- You could pause the game at any time, so it plays well as a casual game
- I particularly enjoyed most of the fishing mini-games, they were cathartic in a way that I imagine mimics real fishing
- I liked that the mechanics were generally simple and learned by experimentation. 
- I liked the use of audio and visual effects on the whole

The Neutral
- The organisation of the various 'hubs' was a bit weird and trite, but you tended to know where you needed to go next
- Players who don't enjoy horror might not enjoy this one
- Jury's out on whether the subject of fishing makes for an interesting plot
- The tone of the game is calm to mysterious to intriguing to anxiety ridden. 
- The game had a discernible story that required the player to read between the lines. If you like indirect messages and figuring things out yourself, you will probably like this game. If you prefer someone to just come out and say what they mean, the story may frustrate. All in all, your mileage may vary on this one.

The Bad
- It was sometimes hard to find things you were looking for, so I had to resort to Google to find spawns
- At some point, you run out of things to buy and the game feels a bit 'over' just slightly before I actually finished it
- The writing was okay enough to get the job done. There were some great points of mysterious atmosphere, but the plot really didn't come across as particularly deep. Occasionally there'd be a great story setup then the follow-through was disappointing or non-existent. The devs leaned more for atmosphere than satisfying story fruition. 
- The ending could have been more involved and impactful.",1702142915,1702142915,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I am a bit surprised at some of the abilities though since they seem a bit overpowered. The banish ability that can be immediately refreshed by sleeping, the bait that can be easily received to farm rare fish. The teleportation anchor seemed a bit unsatisfying, personally it would be better to be able to choose the second location instead of it being at Blackstone again, would certainly save a lot of time venturing from one end of the world to the other. The various DLCs also seemed a bit... out of place, it probably would have made more sense for The Pale Reach to come with the original game. And the Key DLC was completely unnecessary and just seemed like a cash grab instead of a ""support the developers"" title.

But then again, I've had a fantastic time overall. Looking forward to your next (hopefully also fishing related) projects!

The relaxing waves and environment paralleled with the horrors the night bring works brilliantly, not curbing gameplay but incentivising different play styles in different regions at different times.

But asides from that it's a beautiful game to look at with an equally beautiful soundtrack and an annoyingly addictive gameplay loop!

The Pale Reach DLC (bear in mind I purchased this after completing the ending) felt like it was a missed oppurtunity to add a more expansive and interesting environment with more influencial lore more than a few tattered diaries.

[spoiler] The ending was a tad lackluster. Throughout the game you learn to maneuver your ship better, avoid enemies, and use some other techniques to your advantage. It was a miss to not have a final boss battle. It may be a cliche moment they were trying to avoid, but I can't help but feel that would have been really fun to implement.

With that say both ending are underwhelming even if they align with what you would expect of eldritch horror story.

The fishing is simple but fun and the ability to customise the ship by crafting and buying upgrade is satisfatory, the ship upgrades and items you find share the same inventory and managing it quite fun its simplistic puzzle like elements.

Sure, the ""Lovecraftian"" tag tipped me off a little, but I was sure that my innate fear of the ocean would keep me plenty entertained.

What I was NOT expecting was to walk away with DREDGE as one of my favourite games of the year in a year that has been jam-packed with amazing releases.

Seriously, this game does everything you'd want a game of this genre to do. It delivers on the fishing, it delivers on the world, the characters, the immersion and... well, that tag isn't there for no reason. In fact, it was so good that I was immediately compelled to go for 100% right after seeing the credits.

As for gameplay, it goes for a bizarre blend of a fishing minigame that you might find in a game like Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, but it manages to sprinkle in one of the most ingenious elements from a game like Don't Starve: the Sanity (panic) meter. Trust me, you'll get used to frantically glaring at the surface of the water while that chromatic aberration kicks in.

The upgrade system helps you feel like you're truly progressing, and something that I cannot commend the game enough for is the freedom of choice. Do you want to brave the waters on the first night, slowly dredging while something larger-than-life waits beneath? Go ahead. Want to take your time, upgrading your ship as much as you can before entering a single major area? You can do that, too.

I CANNOT recommend this game enough if you're into this sort of ""subtle horror"" experience. If you're like me and are helplessly scared of any body of water that's more than two-feet deep, then all the better.

Definitely one of the standouts of the year, and one that I'll look back on fondly.",1701733361,1701733361,True,21,1,0.740651965141296387,0,True,False,False

I feel like some of the upgrades even could be more purposeful or tied in with the story.

Honestly, as someone who [i]hates[/i] fishing minigames and goes rabid for tetris-like inventory management, I loved this game.

My biggest complaint is that the inventory slots for the boat items (lights, motors, rods, etc) are off-center and the most efficient equipment leaves gaps, but that's purely a cosmetic thing that bothers me. No, wait, also heck the big eel. I hate him. Die in a fire, sir.

9/10 so far

Overall quality of the game is great, very fun very easy to pick up and very easy to get lost in.
Lovecraft Fishing Simulator so for me that pretty much says ""Sold"" right on me.
The story continues to surprise- and although to some the gothic theme of the characters and plot may seem contrived- to fans of Gothic horror literature and nautical misadventure this should be a breath of fresh air. A good game to get lost in, the gameplay mechanics retain their freshness, unlike some of your slimy cargo and newfound acquaintances, and the progression keeps things interesting with new and exciting events and exposition. Nary a dull moment at sea as they say, keep a weathered eye on the horizon.

Great gameplay, story and art.

Can get mildly frustrating at times and if you're not a fan of ironman savemode.
Couldn't bring myself to backup saves but you might want to if you don't plan on multiple playthroughs, as you can easily forget a sidequest if you spend a lot of time between play sessions, and get autosaved out of potential rewards etc.

Sometimes I wish Steam had a 5 star rating system, there's no universe where I'd click thumbs down on this game, but I'm not quite sure it deserves ""Overwhelmingly positive 96%""

Good game, got almost 10 hours in and once I beat the game I felt fine just instantly uninstalling rather than doing side-stuff. The side missions leave a lot to be desired, and I couldn't help but wish there was some big boss fight at some point in the game rather than ""You've collected the artifacts, you're done now :)""

For the first hour or so the gloomy (borderline scary) feeling is super powerful, but as soon as you get a feel for how the paranoia mechanic works, it kinda washes away and isn't much of a concern gameplay-wise. I found myself intentionally not sleeping to add some difficulty, dodge and weave the tornado!

Goes to show my strategy of finding my new favorite game through most well reviewed steam games is not a good one. Again, very good game, but don't expect this to become your new all time favorite game. It lacks a lot when it comes to a story worth digging into, side mission content, and seemingly lots of careless blasting your boat across an empty threat-less ocean.

Maybe worth $25, but I'd say this is a ""wait for a sale"" product.",1701306934,1701307955,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

* OK side-stories

- Bad endings

This game was pretty good, better than I anticipated! The gameplay is novel and fun, the atmosphere ranges from cozy on the day to oppressive in the night, which I found great. The visuals are very beautiful as well, this gets enhanced by the nice music as well, which is always fitting.
The biggest negative point is regarding the main quest which feels lackluster and the bad, unsatisfying endings, which left me a bit sour as the credits rolled.

Had it been 5 hours long it would've been a much better game, but it obviously would've spawned backlash due to the price.

Should be played together with Subnautica for maximum maritime terror.

Although there are a few of minor things I could nitpick:
- Money, material and upgrade items become obsolete before halfpoint of the game. By the end of the Pale DLC I was sitting on 60k+ of useless cash.

- Nearly all of hostile sea monsters are more of a nuisance that a proper eldritch horror. The only exceptions being the Leviathan which you only see glipse of on an open sea and the slumbering god in one of the endings.

- The ""good and ""bad"" endings are switched in my opinion.

- The ESG score must be high with these devs. The backwater archipelago set in 1930(?) is full of overly diverse, ugly women working traditionally men jobs that constantly send you on errands and to top it off the smartass lighthouse lady that sets you on the ""good"" path.

- Placing of the ""panic mists"" and whirlpools in the DLC is infuriating.",1701217878,1701217878,True,1,0,0.508448541164398193,0,True,False,False

Gameplay, while consisting of puttering around in a boat doing QTEs, is stimulating enough to stop at least me from getting bored, For me, the meat of the game was the aesthetic.
Solid soundtrack, absolutely enthralling sound design, and a solid feeling of the freedom of piloting a seafaring vessel. Feel is where this game shines. The control of the ship has weight without being slippery, and any sluggishness I would consider appropriate to the genre or method of transport.
The story as well is quite interesting; nothing groundbreaking, but the general consistency was good. The story feels local, lacking much in the way of breathtaking highs or depressing lows, aside from the ending itself. Cozy, ironically given the subject matter, is the term I would use.

The Goods
-----------
-Absolutely beautiful art direction, the low poly art on each of the many characters and locations really helps capture the sharp seas and presence of the game.

-World and story are great, Given a Lovecraftian tag you are probably hoping the same way I was and you wont be disappointed , It covers about all bases that Lovecraftian horror stories have done and in its own unique and terrifying twists. The ending is great and like another review said, I do not want more... It is outstanding. 

-Game-play, For someone who wants to have a nice, albeit strange fishing experience with relaxation, going out in the morning is splendid for you...if you don't mind the aberrations. However if you have a bit of an irk for the unknown and can stop laughing at the ""the fog is coming"" joke you'll make every 9 seconds the night is for you. 

i can not stress enough how much fun i have had getting absolutely terrified by the Monsters and other entities in this game. Hallucinating is my new favorite hobby. 

The one small minuscule complaint I could ever come up with 
--------------------------------------------------------------
-Barely knocking your boat onto anything at the slowest speeds can absolutely RUIN your day. 

thats it, have a nice catch!

Its atmospheric and stylish visuals and soundscape evoke both the natural beauty of the open sea by day, and the jittering panic of facing horrors beyond human comprehension by night.
If you're a bit chicken (like me) you can control the amount you interact with the terrors by doing most of your adventuring in the daylight and spending the nights safe in port, but you can also choose to court danger and live on the edge! Of course, a certain amount of risk taking is necessary and encouraged to get the full experience, especially if you are going for 100% completion. And not all monsters are strictly nocturnal. (If you just want to tool around and explore and catch weird fish, the game also offers a pacifist mode where the terrors of the deep won't attack you, but I never found I needed it.)
The main storyline can probably be completed in a few hours if you focus only on that quest, but the game encourages exploration. I took the time to 100% the achievements in the base game, and later came back and enjoyed a second play-through with the additional DLC. (The Blackstone Key DLC offers a slight boost in the early game, but I mostly saw it as a way to tip the creators. The Pale Reach is an entire new map section and side quest that unlocks some useful abilities, and is thoroughly enjoyable if you want more Dredge.)

The beginning of the game certainly gives you the sort of under your skin type of anxiety that someone is lurking right around the corner or dwelling in the deep, but as you progress and upgrade to better equipment, it becomes less of a threat, and simply another obstacle in the way that you can either steer around or avoid entirely.

There are many people to meet, many biomes to explore, many fish to catch, and many ways to do all of it. I was drawn to this piece by its fishing theme, and I got what I was looking for and more. This game's art style and music are both worthy of praise as well - they do a great job of selling the gloomy atmosphere of living in a quaint fishing settlement like the ones we see in DREDGE.

For me there are no real flaws that stuck out in my playthrough. This game is well polished and I cannot get enough of it. I hope to get my hands on the DLC soon so that I can prolong my experience with DREDGE.

My only gripe with this game is minor, and the introduction of further content in DLC kind of abates it. The game unfortunately while being a fantastic experience loses out on it's replayability, that being said if you are a completionist and after achievements you can stretch the base game content to ~15 hours.

The occasional negative was that the first few hours were awesome but then after that it became too boring. I bought it on sale so no regrets, but I must agree with the minority of reviewers on this one. First few hours I loved it. But soon after it got boring. Mostly due to the fact that you cannot leave the dock for more than 3 or 4 minutes in real time then you have to return to the dock to rest because the time literally zooms by, or if you bump a rock you lose an engine so you need repairs, or the giant fish attack your boat making you take damage or lose what little bit of loot you scrounged up, or your cargo hold which is too small in the beginning stages cannot hold more than a handful of fish and it takes too much time out of the fun things the game has to offer like exploring and adventuring  when you are spending more time at the dock than you are out in the water.

Add in the deep spooky story elements, the actually frighting night time exploration, giant evil fishing chasing you out of nowhere and you have a very fun and unique experience.

The relaxing fishing portions are cool and fun, but the story, atmosphere, themes and music really reel you in. The gameplay is tight and fun, the graphics are beautiful and the music is great. The eldritch horror portions of the game was also very enjoyable. I guess my only negative with the game is not knowing which missions are timed and also how you receive less research parts in missions than what is needed to complete the research portion of the upgrades.

Other than that, I had a blast. I wouldn't call the game short, you just have to decide your own level of involvement. Do you just want a quick story with some gameplay?  It might run you for about 6 hours. Do you want to go through the whole thing?  Complete every mission, see every fish, explore all locations and riddles? Might take you anywhere around 10 to 20. Either way, it's worth it.

When I completed the game, all I could think of was that I wanted more. More abilities, more fish, more locations, more everything. I wanted more not because the game was lacking, but because I didn't want it to end. If the devs made a sequel (or DLC) and it was the same graphics, same music but adding more of everything, I would probably pre-order it. I hope they make more of these and just play around the endings. There's always more sea to explore.

Update:

Just finished the DLC and it was just more of what I wanted. I still would have liked more story, side missions and fish, however I am very happy with what we got. I hope there are more DLC's to come! A sequel would be great too.",1680678525,1701119620,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As a Lovecraftian mythos fan I got to say I loved the various story element adaptation and the shape of this universe. Great atmosphere and story. There were quite a few subtle Lovecraftian twists I really appreciated.
Gameplay is essentially fetching stuff, but all game mechanics and progression put into perspective - it got never dull or boring. You are never made to grind, but sometimes you got to try harder and overcome RNG. Journey was never tedious or feeling like wasting my time. Everything is placed with intent, if you are curious and explore a bit, you will find everything and you will experience everything the game has to offer without any help of guides. There is no unnecessary backtracking, multilayering zone locking behind progression or other 'smart' ways to recycle same content.
I loved how game progress, how your character and vessel progress - things become kind of harder, but the upgrades you pick up makes you less careful and more in control of various high-risk situations.
As I finished it 100% plus the DLC, my only complaint is that it could have had few more main pursuits and few more zones. Style is gorgeous, kudos to the people who worked on the art.

All in all, if you love Lovecraft mythos, this one is a no brander, creators definitely did not do dirty on this one.

The game itself isn't particularly long but feels fine for the amount of time you put into it. The fishing mechanic is simple so you won't be struggling to catch anything too badly, it also changes slightly depending on what fish you are going after for a bit of variety. The upgrading system is smooth and upgrading your ships hull changes the appearance of the ship which I really like and makes the upgrade system feel more impactful.

The 3D environment looks great, combined with the day night cycle does so much for the games atmosphere, the ocean is a whole different place at night. The characters and fish on the other hand are instead stylized 2D sprites that look even better, the fish in particular each have a rarer corrupted ""aberration"" form each with a unique sprite. Each of the zones in the game have a unique look, mechanics, and story to them, Stellar Basin in particular is amazing.

Overall Dredge is a great game with a great story and a fair price with an ambiance and atmosphere second to none. Don't forget just because you don't see anything on the open ocean doesn't mean something doesn't see you, try going out of bounds.",1701064165,1701064165,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A Lovecraft-themed fishing simulator where you play tetris with your catch, upgrade your ship, gain skills, and slowly uncover the truth of the sea you sail in. This game puts you in a world filled with a beautiful art style, solid sound design, and a generally upsetting atmosphere. It's somehow very cozy, and then quite spooky at the same time. It's that creeping dread of the world being not -quite- right.

I really enjoyed the lighthouse you can see from nearly everywhere on the map which is a lovely detail in the dead of night, when everything else is covered by near impenetrable fog. The fact that each cluster of islands has a very distinct theme and flavor in the art and sound is really enjoyable.

The Pale Reach adds a very fun area to the south of the map as well. The fear of what the ice may hide is oh so fun.

There is also a peaceful, anti-spooky mode if all you want is a fishing sim. Lots of cool fish.",1701038629,1701038629,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most games aren't able to pull off such a balancing act, at least not in an organic manner, but Black Salt Games nailed it with Dredge.

Mechanically, the ship movement and abilities feel good, both of which can be altered by upgrades, and the core game play loop is solid and enjoyable. Fish and dredge for useful materials, sell your catch and any found treasures, upgrade and expand your boat, repeat. It's a good positive feed back loop reinforced by regular discovery and simple fishing and dredge mechanics that are varied and quick to learn. Day and night cycle and stress regularly interrupts the process preventing the whole loop from becoming tedious. Eventually you'll have to risk more and more to get greater rewards, and make more progress in the story and world, which is what allows the aforementioned balancing act between peaceful and stressful to exist int the first place. Night is dangerous, and threats real or imagined will follow you into the day if you stubbornly refuse to rest at a dock to prevent insanity and paranoia from setting in.

Thematically, the game is perfect. You feel like you're really captaining your fishing vessel and will manage your time and resources intuitively. The ocean and the archipelago feels alive with ambient wildlife (both mundane and not), yet vast and lonely at the same time. Plenty of elements of mystery and horror work their way into the story and just exploring the world, with classic ghost story at sea tropes, a bit of sci-fi here and there, constant Lovecraftian undertones and threats that become more prominent as the story progresses, and even something of biblical origins and proportions if you're 'lucky' enough to witness it. All of this is tied together by the beautiful music, both those tracks dedicated to specific locations or events in the game, but also the ambient pieces that add so much to the exploration and sailing at sea.

Dredge is a wonderful, phenomenal game. I encourage everyone to check it out.",1701034462,1701034462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first 2 hours of this game is fine, but later it feels like a chore. Traversing the ocean and spending one full-ass in-game day moving two tiddlywinks of water, only to go to a dock to skip the night because the night will make you insane, is not fun. It doesn't make much sense that most of the actual horror of this game comes from the Panic feature (which you get mostly from night time), and then give incentive to the player to not play the game during the night. This means that most of the horror parts barely feel present, or are not present at all.

Islands feel empty and boring. The open waters are boring. The whole story is the most generic ""Go to this place and get an item"" quest. Even when there is some attempt to make quests interesting (Airman traps, Researcher generator, those flame things), they end up being the exact same ""Catch 2-3 Fish"" and ""Go here and get this"". When you've finished the first few quests, you've done all of them. It really does feel like they built the starter area (The Marrows) and then shoehorned a bunch of other areas on top of it, instead of making it one cohesive world. Half way through the game it didn't even feel like I was playing a fishing game at all, simply a fetch quest simulator with fish as the item.

Its fun and offer a refreshing gameplay concept as the captain of a fishing boat.
I would buy again.

CON
There are very few quests. The research components are being sold for cheap and you can buy a lot everyday so you end-up fully upgraded in no time. IMO, they should have tried to find another money sink than research stuff.
After 30+hr.. i just feel like i havent seen much things after all. It lack some variety of activities.

The game mechanics are simple, but very nice and well done.

Graphic wise, I love the aesthetic, from the environment in the design of the fishes it's really nice looking HO and the soundtrack, just a delight to listen to.

One of the part I like most out of the game is that, you feel rewarded from your ""grind"" of dredging parts to upgrade your ship. Investing in your ship is never a waste and each upgrade feels good. You also don't have to spend countless hours to get everything you need which is a plus in my book.

In terms of graphics, it's colorful, stylish and it runs well on a simple computer. It's very relaxing to wander about and take in everything at your own pace. The story is very simple, but it works. It cuts to the chase and the quests are straightforward. In the end, it's a gentle introduction to Lovecraft and you'll enjoy completing the quests that you're given.

However, the game's pacing has real issues. The first area that you're recommended to explore is the most difficult. After that, it's pretty much downhill. You can upgrade your ship and build it into a fortress, but there really isn't any point in doing so since there aren't any serious threats.

The only 2 things that I really disliked are the ugly flat-colored textures. It just looks so bad and feels lazy to me but this is probably very subjective. The other thing is that abilities cannot be bound to specific keys so we are stuck with the lame wheel for console peasants. Why is it such a taboo for developers to provide proper key binding support, I do not understand. Thanks for like 84 key bindings for photo mode though, I used that never.

Apart from that, the rest of the game is great. Music is great, 2D art is amazing, gameplay is fun. And the boat handling is extremely well done. The story, yeah, it was kind of meh with very anticlimactic ending, nothing was really explained. You can't have everything I suppose.

The game is easy to get into in the beginning, but around the 3 hour mark I started to wonder how this game has such an Overwhelmingly Positive response.  At that point in the game, by the time you got your boat to somewhere you needed to go, it was time to turn around because you didn't want to get caught in the night fog eyeballs.  It was a constant back/forth of slowly collecting fish and dredging resources with a one-button timing mini-game (but never more than one outing/day). Around the 6 hour mark, this turned around; not because of the better boat upgrades, faster speed, etc., but because I'd found all of the places to dock so that I wouldn't have to turn around so much.  Maybe it's my own fault for not looking at guides.

It's a well made game with interesting (albeit shallow) characters, but thinking back to the actual gameplay, there's very little strategy, the one-button minigames are meh, and navigating your boat are all very low-stimulation activities. That said, it's a great game for the Deck with its big UI, and add to that time in the game stops moving when your boat stops, it makes it easier to occasionally participate in conversations while playing...",1700922080,1700922488,True,1,0,0.525547444820404053,0,True,False,False

[u][b]What does that mean?[/b][/u]

It's a fantastic game. An intriguing lovecraftian story, a fitting yet unique art style, simple yet fun gameplay loop, and of course plenty of f̸̝͆i̶̮̒ș̵̔h̶̺͌ to catch. The gameplay is like the open ocean aspect of Wind Waker but refined and expanded upon, which is no small compliment. The soundtrack is also pretty dang good, so I'd recommend grabbing that as well if you're into OSTs. 

[i]However[/i], the game does feel lacking in a few areas, and I say that because of the potential it has due to the polish of what it gets right. The writing in the beginning is fantastic, the intrigue of what's going on and the allure that a good lovecraftian story can have is really strong. It gets it so right in the beginning of the game, but that's where it peaks. At least it did for me, that is. After maybe an hour in, you can figure out pretty much what's going on, which isn't bad if it was just in terms of the story, but it isn't. You've experienced most of the gameplay, too. 

There are some really cool elements added for each area you go to to progress that shakes things up, and they get that so right. But once you're through in that area, it doesn't stick around. It's a one and done gimmick to that area instead of something that adds to the gameplay after you get what you need, which is a real shame because it could add a bit more difficulty to an already easy game, especially after a few upgrades. It doesn't stay.

Speaking of upgrades, they're good. They add more to what you can catch/do and increases what you can carry, adding more gameplay and incentive to seek out materials, keeping interest. What you do to acquire what you need for upgrades is really fun, and ultimately they get it right. But the one thing you might not realize you get when upgrading your ship is wasted, being hull integrity. You can take more crashes/hits before you sink, which is good if you're a bit clumsy or have trouble with what ļ̴̊i̵̥͠ę̸̇s̸͔̎ ̶͖̏b̸̭͒e̷̮͌ǹ̵ͅe̷̤͘â̸̫t̵̞͘h... But those dangers don't really increase, just shift a bit. [spoiler](Looking at you, Devil's Spine.)[/spoiler] To go back to my previous point, it feels like the stakes aren't raised after getting what you need. And once you've upgraded your ship to max, a substantial and fun mechanic becomes practically useless. 

Lastly I want to touch on the story, or the writing specifically. Like I said before, during the beginning of the game the writing is great. But maybe halfway through it becomes a bit watered down, (no pun intended). Perhaps a bit less descriptive, or maybe just not as alluring, I'm not sure. What I am sure of is that it feels like the curiosity that [b]hooked[/b] me at the start of the game stopped [b]reeling me in[/b], (pun intended), and became a little generic. Not bad, but not as good. I will say that there was something that caught me off guard, and that was a great feeling. But then it became generic again almost right after. Again, not bad, it just left me a little underwhelmed.

With all the crap I just gave it, I need to emphasize; [b][u]I loved every minute of the game[/u][/b]. All of what I said was out of the love I felt for playing this. I want to convey these criticisms so that the next game, or even the possible DLC (hopefully) that these devs will make will be what I know it can be, [b]fantastic[/b]. They have talent, and it shows with this game here. I want to see the full extent of what they can do realized. [i]And I'll be there when it is.[/i] 


TLDR:
It's got plenty of potential for more, although it's great as it is and you should absolutely play it.

The game is good, but rather unremarkable in every aspect other than its visuals.

Some details:
-The artstyle is really gorgeous, and might be the only thing that keeps the game from being a waste of time for most people.
-The gameplay loop got old a bit too fast for me, and the gameplay doesn’t evolve much past “get to new area->do some chore for a local npc->get key item ->unlock slighly useful traversal skill->repeat”.
-Also, given the game’s setting and influence from lovecraft’s texts, it’s a surprise that the game is not scary at all, on very rare occasions it does make you feel slightly uneasy, but they are way too few and far in between as to contribute to the general feel of the game. 
-The nighttime is just a mild inconvenience rather than a creepy stage, which also lacks any tangible reward for braving it, so you’ll probably skip most of the nights if you have to go from one map zone to another.
-The narrative is good, a bit boring and too straightforward, but it’s enough to motivate you to at least keep playing till the end",1682438664,1700888595,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is really satisfying, calm and ""arcade"". At first i god DBD flashbacks but further it gets more various. Even moving across the sea on full throttle is satisfying. 

As an achievment hunter (kinda lol) I can recommend it for 100%. There is no boring achievments and if you liked this game you will enjoy this process.

Story is kinda OK. For me I did not get enough world's story and ending is wierd (yea yea Lovecraft, wierd things)

Very persuasive and captivating take of a single player adventure where the protagonist, you ""The Angler"" have decided to take on the mission of holding your own out at sea, settling in the town of Greater Marrow. You must fend for yourself by scavenging what you can out of the fear inducing open waters, and face multiple challenges, learn the cursed secrets of the islands, complete with interesting character development, satisfying side quests, beautiful exploration, and unique abilities taken to a level not seen in other titles in this genre. 

Not to mention - solid mechanics of movement, when for example, being met with the panic induced terrors and hazards in the night, the monsters chasing your vessel - its an engaging and fluid experience. While the story itself may be a quick one, the multiple ending dynamic of this story was short but sweet. Huge replay value as well, you can create many strategies of beating the game in different methods. No spoilers here, don't worry.

The Blackstone Key DLC is totally not PTW... or necessary to enjoy the game, although the Devs really deserve the tip, as the game is fairly priced. I found it useful for the endgame, to catch all the aberrations, simply for the achievement.

I am also happy to see that the Devs really listen to the community, and conduct updates and reported bug fixes surprisingly efficiently and swiftly. The new update is a great addition of content to the game and there is a steady roadmap for 2023 regarding its future development.

Worth the try if you have never played this kind of game before, honestly it reeled me in quick, check it out!

Update - The Pale Reach DLC is awesome. Good on Black Salt games for not giving in to public pressure and ironing out all the kinks before releasing it to the public, gotta respect devs for that in today's greedy world. It is fun and very innovative.

At first, the insanity meter, hallucinations and monsters make night a spooky affair but eventually you realise you can easily survive the entire night. The Lovecraft stuff just ends up being largely window dressing. 

Despite the elder-god stuff being weak, the fishing loop is a lot of fun. Each fish-catching and fish type have their own quick little mini game, and there's something very satisfying about tetris-ing your boat inventory to fit one more fish. Fish, upgrade your boat, travel further, see spooky stuff in new locals. 

I should mention, this is not a rogue-like. There's a clear through line main quest that carries you from biome to biome, and each archipelago has its own major and minor quests associated with them. 

Its honestly a pretty chill fishing game, with a neat painted aesthetic and aquatic-lovecraft trimmings.

Although short, this game is the perfect example of something being 'greater than the sum of its parts', with each of its individual components coming together to create a cohesive and polished experience that never gets boring. It feels like a nice balance between the classic Simulation style of games like Stardew Valley and Spiritfarer, and 'walking-sim' adventure games like Little Nightmares and A Short Hike that rely heavily on their distinct artstyle and aesthetic. The core gameplay loop of catching fish to upgrade your boat and fill out your collection is simple but addictive, but the main selling point is in the exploration. The game is deeply immersive, looking and sounding equal parts beautiful and eerie, and it's a ton of fun sailing through its open-world to find all the dramatic and terrifying points of interest, and to put together all the pieces of how this world came to be. Overall, a brilliantly engaging experience, and worth checking out for fans of simulation or exploration-driven adventure games, or for those who just like cosmic horror in any form.

DLC: The Pale Reach DLC was also brilliant, albeit slightly anticlimactic, but considering the overall quality and how seamlessly it fits into the base game, it's absolutely worth picking up if you want more.

My main issue of the game is the speed of time. You want to be most active during the day, where there are no lovecraftian horrors awaiting for you. But it goes so fast, that you entire day might be just fishing in two places and then run home. Even if you only want to explore, you almost intermediately have to go back.
Of course, this all sounds just like regular survival game stuff, and it is. But it feels too constricting.
The other mayor thing that annoyed me was the lack of cruise control. It's a boat, let me set the speed and let go of the keyboard.
One more thing about the lovecraft theme, it feels a bit pasted on. While there is spooky stuff that you can interact with, the main stuff seems to be happening to the npc's, not you.

There newest expansion gives you another area but that's really it and it finishes pretty quickly.
Buying the key for the shed next to the mansion I would say is not worth it it gives you one good item and then the other item is worthless considering the other items in the game are way better.

Fishing/Ship progression is pretty nicely tied to story progression.
I did find that for achievement completion there were some things that were a bit harder to find than others mostly due to it being a percent based chance of 'rolling' a specific rare fish.

First of all, the sound design of this game is truly amazing, and it's one of the few OSTs I actually listen to when not playing the game. Most of it is very relaxing, but in certain areas the soundtrack definitely amplifies the fear of the unknown and the lovecraftian vibes.

Although the gameplay loop is somewhat simple: catch fish and dredge for parts to bring both back and earn money to upgrade your ship and get better equipment, it's also so much more than that. Each NPC you meet along the way has a unique voice and narrative (except for maybe the ""figure(s) in [colour]"") that make them stand out and make the world feel genuine.  The quests you get can be a challenge to complete, but they also are rewarding, either giving you something to progress the story or just to make your life easier (ie books, upgrade parts). 

Speaking of which, the story. The story, although seemingly simple, is one of the best stories that I have seen in a video game. Without spoiling anything, I would say that although the story's straightforward, you can pick up both background information and clues to the ending(s) throughout your playthrough which help you to understand the ending(s). 

If you're concerned about the replayablity of the game, I will say that it is still just as fun a second or third time around, especially if you're trying to get either fish or notes or books that you missed. It doesn't have the same impact as the first time when you're wondering what the story is, but it is still very fun.

If you like exploration, mystery, adventure games, fishing games, and collecting you will like Dredge. Even if only a couple of those things click for you, you'll have a good time. Dredge is about the sum of its parts rather than any one thing individually.

Short answer: Yes.
Long answer: YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!

Holy CRAP I cannot believe how much I enjoyed this game! The gameplay loop may be short and simple but it is incredibly well done and satisfying. I normally stream 3hrs during stream days but this game ""made"" me do a 5hr stream two days in a row and another 4hr the third day because I just couldn't put it down; I literally had to force myself to stop playing 😂

The art and atmosphere are incredible and the sound design fits the setting well. I cannot sing this games praises enough; if you get it on sale it's a literal steal because this game is absolutely worth the full price. I plan on 100%'ing this game (side note: thank you devs for making the decisions to make 100%'ing possible with a single playthrough!) because I've enjoyed it so much and I greatly look forward to the DLC!

Dredge is one of the best indie games I've played in a good while. I played the demo back in the last Steam Next Fest and knew I wanted it straight away, so I stopped playing the demo almost immediately to get the most out of the full game. The art style is great, the gameplay loop is satisfying and the story progression hooked me in as quickly as I was hooking poor twisted bass up out of the waters of little marrow. 

I didn't know it had a darker, lovecraftian side until after I'd played the demo, which suited me down to the ground. 

This also has a big emphasis on inventory management, which I love. It's almost puzzle like. You have to do a bit of tetrising to make sure you're getting your cargo stored correctly, especially in the early game if you want to make money quick. 

The only improvements I could suggest for this game are very minor. I wish the boat's engine was a bit more audible. Not hearing the engine makes you feel like you're gliding around a bit too much. Plus it would open the door for your upgrades feeling better when you hear the unique sound of your high end engine instead of the rattle of your old one. 

Some of the UI interactions feel a little bit clunky on controller. Transferring things to and from menus can be a bit of a pain sometimes. 

Otherwise, this is a top tier game for me. It runs perfectly on the steam deck too. Smooth 60fps at all times. Same story for my ageing 1070 GPU. 4k60fps at all times. 

Great game, extremely well designed and optimised.

Edited 4 months later: I've played this game on and off for the last few months, and have come to absolutely love it. 12 hours of play since I reviewed it and it's whole atmosphere kept me coming back over and over. just 100%'d it today and I'm actually sad that I'm fully finished it. Really hope there's a plan for some good DLC or a sequel. Great game. Easily my Indie GOTY and up there as one of my favourite light horror, atmospheric and Lovecraftian games ever.

The consistent, yet nonrestrictive game play loop and the creative world/art keep you engaged throughout it's ~15-20 hour runtime. While the world gives you enough information to be intrigued, the plot and stories that are told through the game are not as prevalent. 

Dredge contains a solid game play loop of fishing for money and using the money for upgrades. Ship upgrades allow for more hull space, faster travel, and new categories of fish to capture. Developing strategies around upgrade paths was truly the hook of the game. Every upgrade feels immediately rewarding. The freedom in the upgrading and management of the game is also reflected in the world. While the game does provide you with set objectives, you are free to explore the world at your will. I had a lot of fun exploring ""late game"" areas early, and then returning later on, better equipped to manage it's unique challenges. 

Adopting horror elements into a fishing game seems out of place, but Dredge manages to pull it off. It invokes the fear of the unknown multiple times throughout the adventure, whether through it's mechanics or it's world. The art, in particular the creative design around the aberration fish designs was truly a treat. I find myself wanting to catch every species just to see the creative ideas the art team came up with. 

Dredge implements a day system where time passes as you are moving. Unfortunately, the mechanic of passing days did not come into play besides a day/night cycle and a few side-quests.

I mean, really, it's a fishing game at heart with a smattering of mystery surrounding both your origins and what's going on in the world around you. As you complete pursuits, fish up oddities in the sea, and meet some rather colorful and... well oddball characters along the way, shining a light in all the dark places, you start to understand that nothing is ever as it seems and maybe the root cause is closer to home than you think. 

It's not an incredibly long adventure but it never once over stays its welcome; even the repetitive bits (there's a lot of fishing, ok? A LOT.) are actually quite enjoyable. The music filters in alongside the ambient noises, the waves crashing against you hull and the rocks around the various sites on the map, even the unsettling echos from the fog and unseen entities floating through the ocean are just fantastic. 

I highly recommend this game to anyone that's looking for something to scratch both a fishing itch and to immerse yourself in a bite sized horror atmosphere. 

I had a blast and hope others do too.

The since of progress and upgrades kept me busy gathering materials while exploring, almost all the way to the ending.

I've 100% it within 24 hours, but I had finished most content within the first 15. The gameplay is very simple, but engaging. Between navigation, fishing and inventory management, it's a robust game that rewards your progress. When you visit a new region, your ship becomes beefier and your tools become more versatile. While the endgame might be very easy if you play it very safe, your panic meter will give you a run for your money if you stay out in the dark too long, with paranormal threats bombarding you if you aren't careful.

DREDGE also manages to have incredible atmosphere. From the music ambiance to the creeping echoes for when you visit the hooded figures around the archipelago, the sound design is incredible. 
The visual design is great as well, with beautifully illustrated characters and fish, as well as charming flat-coloured 3D graphics. The game is visually intuitive with QOL features like map markers having recently been added. 
The game definitely leaves you wanting for more but it's such a good game you should try it out anyway. The Pale Reach DLC adds a wee something, and Black Isle are still developing more DLC and updates, so there definitely will be more.

It got to the point where I would just grab something I needed fish wise and leave a place.  It is easy to just do the quests and not worry about the rest.  The game isn't that good at explaining a few things, and you can permanently miss things without knowing.   I was on the fence of recommending, but that last part tipped the scale.   There is NO reason to have quests that are not only timed, but doesn't tell you they are timed either literally or storywise.  You can easily do some world building and explain urgency for a quest, but nope you come back and it is gone.

Dredge is a game best described as ""just enough."" 
Just enough story, just enough fishing, just enough variety.
Just enough pelagic nightmares and horrors of the deep.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]SUMMARY[/h1]
[h3]Updated for the First DLC Release!![/h3]

Dredge is a unique and well-put-together game about fishing, with some horror elements thrown into the mix. The story serves it's purpose as a driving factor, both for the plot and your curiosity. When the story falls short, the atmosphere and artstyle pick up the slack. There's enough variety in the different mechanics of the game that they don't get tedious. To some people, the game might be a little short for the price tag but I think it was ""just enough"" to hook my interest and reel me in.

Playtime: 28.8 hours for two full 100% playthroughs.
Update 1.1-1.3 Playtime: 2.0 additional hours for 100%.
Pale Reach Playtime: 2.0 additional hours for 100% (with endgame ship and equipment).

[hr][/hr]

[h1]PROS[/h1]
[b]World[/b] - While the story might be pretty simple, I really enjoyed the worldbuilding itself. It has great atmosphere, both during the day and the night, has charismatic characters, and encourages you to be curious about things.

[b]Fishing[/b] - One of the better minigames that I've seen. There's a few different styles and sizes that help to break up doing the same thing repeatedly. It's quick to pick up, and not too difficult, but rewards being good at it. I didn't get tired of it at all during my playthrough. Satisfyingly simple.

[b]Variety[/b] - There's [strike]128[/strike] (now 151, or 174 with Pale Reach) different fish in the game including aberrant variants. They're spread fairly even across the different zones. [i]The following was fixed in [u]Update 1.1[/u]! They doubled the abberation chance for trawl-only species.[/i] [strike]Only two of these fish are annoying to track down, since they're trawling-net-only aberrants which essentially leaves them up to random chance.[/strike]

[b]Horror[/b] - The game is a fishing game first, and horror game second. A few parallels I could draw are Sunless Sea, Subnautica, and Darkest Dungeon. It's the type of horror that's a result of worldbuilding and suspense than anything else, and I love that.

[b]Accessibility[/b] - [u]Update 1.2[/u] added Passive Mode, for any faint-hearted players out there. It also added the ability to turn off the effects while using [spoiler]Haste[/spoiler] which was much appreciated.

[hr][/hr]

[h1]NEUTRAL[/h1]
[b]Story[/b] - It's pretty bare-bones and straightforward. I did enjoy [spoiler]the twist towards the end of the game[/spoiler] and I think they did a very good job leading up to it. However, I still think it does a good enough job getting you interested and wanting to learn more.

[b]Playtime[/b] - It took me 15 hours to 100% achievement the game. This might be too short for some people. For me it's ""just enough"" as I said before. I ended up playing through it again with all the tips and tricks I picked up the first time around. Total playtime for two 100% playthroughs was 28.8 hours. Second time wasn't much faster, but I completed the four (previously) missable quests without failing some of them the second time around.

[b]Upgrades[/b] - The way you upgrade your boat is pretty linear. I don't mind that so much, but I wish it was a little more customizable once you got an upgrade. I know the boat is set up the way it is so the TETRIS-style inventory isn't too easy, but it would be nice to have a little more choice over where things go.

[b]Achievements[/b] - Game doesn't require multiple playthroughs to get all achievements, even though [spoiler]there are two different possible endings. The game warns you that from a certain point your progress isn't saved, so you can go back and do the other one.[/spoiler]

[b]Camera Mode[/b] - [u]Update 1.2[/u] added the Photographer with a small quest to unlock photo mode. Personally not for me, but I know that a lot of other people would probably appreciate the feature. Likely best used with the Passive Mode previously mentioned.

[b]Cosmetics[/b] - [u]Update 1.3[/u] added the Painter with boat customization! There's now the option to change the color of your roof and your hull independently of each other, as well as add a flag or bunting. There's 8 possible paint colors, and 8 flags (including no flag).

[hr][/hr]

[h1]CONS[/h1]
[b]Map Markers[/b] - They added map markers in [u]Update 1.1[/u]. They're okay, and nice in a pinch, but they lack customization. Can't name them, so you still need to remember what they were for. Best used for a few things, instead of charting the whole map. In my opinion the icon on the map for them is also too huge to be usable. They're like, 10x the size of the crab pot marker. Bonus QoL is that you can see them using the telescope, I guess.

[b]Quests[/b] - [i]This was fixed in [u]Update 1.1[/u]! Timers for these quests were removed.[/i] [strike]There's four missable quests. Even though the rewards for them are minimal, it surprised me because of how well done the other quests and rewards were. They encouraged exploration, and didn't have time constraints.[/strike]

This game is a damn masterpiece. I'm a person who struggles to play single-player games and finds it hard getting lost in the story or game nowadays, but even with the little amount of time played this was easily the most invested into a game I've ever been, the physical only thing I can complain about is that the game is fairly short as a story, yet has a large amount of well earned achievements, and task book quests to 100% the game.

While I haven't personally tried them yet the devs are very wonderful and are continuing to update the game, adding more and more content! So this is very much so a game that will not go to waste in your library.

Different fish have different QTE minigames to speed up catching a fish. This is important because the Dredge is also a horror game. Not super scary or anything, just a lightly dreary atmosphere with the occasional monster showing up when you get too panicked (this usually only happens at night). The closest thing to a jumpscare is not paying attention at night and suddenly something is on top of you. There is some variations to this formula, but they all follow some pattern. Learn the pattern to avoid issue. Rest up at a dock (any dock, monsters are all playing a game of tag and every dock is base, apparently) and the panic goes away.

Different locales require different rods and nets, but offer different fish as well. Don't sleep on crab pots like I did, they're passive money and the painter takes rare crabs and makes new paint for customizing the boat.

There are a few secret spots in the game with varying sidequests. Nothing too hidden, but not in plain sight either. The rewards vary from good to... kind of okay? I mean every reward has an upside that makes the sidequest worth doing, but some rewards feel outclassed if you don't find them right away.

Overall, it's a pleasant experience for a horror game. If you ever wanted a fishing game with some Lovecraftian horror mixed in, then Dredge is a perfect fit for you.",1700643081,1700643081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Don't want to stay out for too long though as you are risking something happening to you that you'll lose your cargo, let alone usable space. Every little bit of your ship needs to be carefully organized and managed as you don't have infinite storage. However each part of your ship can be upgraded to better suit your needs. Need more space? Get rid of your lights. Not going for a certain fish too? Get rid of your extra rods. Just make sure you keep some sort of engine.

It has fairly simple gameplay with main and side quests and a plot twist at the end. Besides that, it's also a relaxing game: you can just chill out on the waves and fish while exploring the ocean. However, you will be safe almost nowhere in the game world: the ocean is limitless and very beautiful, but dangerous. Nightmares and whispers of the abyss that drive the fisherman crazy, frighten and fascinate. But at dawn there is always wonderful calm music. My favorite place is Star Bay: mysterious light, bright jellyfish, coral atolls and a not-mad scientist in the middle of it 🪼

Cons: 

1. After 10-15 hours of gameplay, fishing gets boring. When you've completely upgraded your boat, fishing stops making sense at all. Only those who want to get all the achievements (like me, haha) need to continue this.

2. No chapters. The game has two endings. To get both, you need to make a save, otherwise you will have to start over. I forgot about it and will start from scratch 😞

DREDGE is worthy 9/10. I'm surprised how much the developers packed into such a small game.

Dredge is one of those games that you don't want to end, i know i didn't, having 100% the game i can say with confidence dredge is worth your time and money, while it is admittedly short (around 12 hrs to complete the story on average, 6-8 hours if speeding through) the gameplay backs it up 100% as i often found myself just fishing random fish attempting to fill up my journal with new species or sailing around searching for islands with secret wrecks or hidden messages i was always having a good time. The story may be short but it is extremely high quality being captivating and intriguing as you discover the mysteries behind the eldritch creatures inhabiting the deep of this archipelago.

I was very excited to jump into this and reacquire my 100% achievement status (and complete my encyclopedia again just for fun)! If playing from a fresh file, I'd say the new location fits in nicely to the last couple of islands, so you could fit it into the 3rd-5th slot of where you visit tbh (3rd might even be best so you can really utilize the cool stuff you get from it at the last two islands). Overall, I still can't recommend this game enough and the dlc, which short and sweet, just makes it all the better.

I had been counting down the days to the release of this game ever since I played the demo here back in November 2022. After pre-purchasing the deluxe edition on every console I have (digital on pc and switch, and physical for xbox) as soon as it was available, and doing everything I possibly could in the switch demo—I am SO excited to finally have my hands on this game and play the full release!!

To say it has lived up to my excitement would be an understatement. In the same year that a new Legend of Zelda game releases, DREDGE was one of my most anticipated games right along side it. The atmosphere, gameplay, sound design—every single aspect of this game has been crafted with care and passion and it is so fun to partake in!

Also, with the new update you can activate passive mode so you simply can enjoy just fishing!

Dredge however does an amazing job with it. The story is so good and the pacing is not too slow nor too fast, perfect balance in my opinion.

It takes a little to get used to the gameplay loop(storing fish and performing upgrades), but it's enjoyable until the end - never wearing out its welcome. There is a good amount of fish variety in each region, and none are particularly difficult to catch or find. The narrative is pretty light and ends abruptly, things were just beginning to get interesting. The engine upgrades feel great, but it's pretty difficult to see the effects of the fishing speed upgrades, they all seems to go the same pace. 

At the end of the game, in the fourth region, they ask you to navigate tight spaces, and with the higher speed engines this becomes unwieldy and a bit annoying.

Amazingly strong gameplay loop, only complaint is the lack of warning on the time constraint of the hooded figure quests, would've appreciated a heads up. Took 12.5 hours to 100% easily worth the money, very few games have been as enjoyable as this one. Replayability is possibly there, as some equipment items I found toward the end (shrines) could've been attained earlier and possibly used for some kind of speed running. I hope eventually they release some kind of expansion i'd gladly pay $20-$30 for another map with its own fish and quests (although not sure how it would fit into the story). If modding support is added I could easily play this game for 100s of hours.

EDIT: End of the year and I still agree, nothing has come out that has felt quite like this game, I love it entirely. The devs are great and keep releasing content (that I end up completing hours after release but oh well) and that bodes well for this games future.

And naturally there are still threats present even during the day in most major areas which is part of the threat management; ""do I have time to fish/dredge here before the big monster comes to take a bite?"" and ""I gotta sort this shit quick or the big monster is definitely gonna take a bite out of me.""

A major part of the game is the atmosphere. If you aren't the type to be immersed and focus solely on the gameplay Dredge ironically might not be deep enough for you. Boiling it down to its base a lot of the game just ends up being fetch quests to improve your boat and fishing equipment to become better at fetch quests. While it is by no means a walking simulator, there are clear threats and failure states, most of the game is ""go to place to get something and bring it somewhere else."" You are at best able to temporarily drive away the monsters, you won't be defeating anything. So actually getting invested in the world, talking to and learning about its characters, reading descriptions of the grotesque mutations taking place, finding bottles and monoliths to find out what is happening and may potentially happen in the future, is fairly important to your enjoyment. If you engage with the setting you'll find it drags you in really well with its various little touches.",1700410207,1700600883,True,1,0,0.426611781120300293,0,True,False,False

The atmosphere is unique, the feeling of loneliness in the open sea is extremely original, the soundtrack is well-thought and is the kind of soundtrack that will give you that feeling of warmth when you're facing an atmosphere that truly needs a bit of it.

The scenario is not the most original you'll discover in your life, but it's still good enough with some tiny twists that deserve to be discovered. The few characters you'll meet in your adventure all have just enough charisma for you to remember them. Not much, but that's not what we ask of the game in the first place. Like in any good Lovecraftian story, the environment is as important as those who live in it.

The real essence of the game truly is its gameplay. You're playing a lovecraftian fishing game and you're enjoying it because it's, to me, exactly what you would love around a real fishing experience.

The story is great and the background lore is always very interesting to read.  Out of any game to capture the psychological dread and cosmic horror of Lovecraft's works, this fishing game somehow does it the best.  And the game itself doesn't draw out any of the mechanics to the point of being boring or frustrating.  They take the ""moving a boat around and fishing"" aspect to every level it needs to go, and never too far beyond what it should be.

The Blackstone Key DLC is unnecessary and is mostly just a way to give the studio some extra cash.

Pale Reach is a little disappointing with the amount of content it adds, and I feel the story of it is a little lackluster compared to the main game.",1700596282,1700596282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Luckily DREDGE, a game about fishing, has very little to do with actual fishing funnily enough. DREDGE plays more like an ocean adventure game with survival horror elements. You traverse an open sea in hunt of rare fish and other goods, but are very vulnerable to the many horrors that lie below the sea. The game is casual and easy to get into, yet oddly still frighteningly oppressive in tone.

You can reduce the danger a bit as the game always gives you goals and upgrades to work towards, but you're never truly safe. DREDGE really likes to mess with temptation. There's always an incentive to push yourself harder or play riskier, but the game's atmosphere and your vulnerabilities always remind you of how bad things can wind up.

This game is great as it has multiple fishing mechanics and a decent story. Upgrades to your boat feel impactful, and the boat controls very well while still definitely controlling like a boat. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
-Multiple fishing minigames based on types of fish.
-Multiple passive incomes by using crab buckets or trawling
-Good size map to explore with fun and often useful discoveries
-Upgrades to the ship make a huge difference to where I was excited to get them
-Player upgrades unlocked through story
-Music is atmospheric
-NPCs have a good feel with a variety of knowledge of the unknown
-Fishing

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
-It is a bit short
-I would have liked more upgrades, but really I wanted more game.
-Most achievments are hidden, and I had to look them up as I would not have gotten some of them organically

[h1]DLC Pros:[/h1]
The Blackstone Key 
-provides 2 early game boat pieces to make your start faster
The Pale Reach 
-Provides a whole new area to explore, basically a 6th level for the mid game
-Provides more fish
-Provides another mystery
-It has an excellent Item that will provide convenience all the way to late game
-Really enjoyed this story

[h1]DLC Cons:[/h1]
The Blackstone Key
-I bought this after completing the main game. It provided almost no utility. 
-People defend this DLC as providing a tip to the devs, While the devs deserve more money for this excellent game, this still feels like it is barely an update, and that defense is very indicative of its value.
The Pale Reach
-No complaints


[h1]My Level of Experience with the game[/h1]
I took about 15 hours to beat the main game and then another 2 hours to fill out my fishing logs. I didn't go for 100% till the DLC came out. Played both DLCs after completion of base game. Blackstone Key was a 1 minute interaction, Pale Reach took about 2 hours. I absolutely love this game and would buy more DLC like Pale reach or Dredge 2 in a heart beat. I had to look up hidden achievements to get all of them.",1700583951,1700583951,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me start by saying this, [b]this game is not for everyone[/b] but for my time playing it I could not put my mouse and keyboard down. From start to finish this game had me hooked, from the atmospheric world to the music. It presents itself as simple fishing game, where you the player character explores the sea and completing your journal of fish entries and helping out others in need. Bringing me a sense of calm and serenity as I navigate the ocean.

Where the game really got me was the horror elements that were involved, while not necessarily scary at all times it provides you with a subtle sense of dread and weariness. This game reignited a fear I have always had which is the fear of the unknown.

Imagine this, you are boating at night looking for some fish that only come out then and you enter a weird red mist and pass on through like nothing happened but then the music begins to become more creepy and eerie, heightening your senses. You see the lights of another ship in the distance and think to say hello to a fellow sailor, you approach the boat and see a huge [spoiler]ANGLER FISH DISGUISING ITSELF AS A BOAT forcing you to flee in terror[/spoiler]. Waking up in Greater Marrow to do it all again.

A slight criticism of mine would have to be the lack of engagements with the enemies of the game. I would have liked some harpoon system that allowed the player to fight some enemies on the sea itself instead of just banishing them. Collecting their carcasses as a side quest to have as trophies on the ship perhaps. This doesn't bring the game down for me but I think it would have been a welcome addition.

What Black Salt Games accomplished with this title is superb and I look forward to their next outing in the indie game world. I have 100% the achievements and will happily do another playthrough in the future.

It is a pretty basic fishing game with Eldritch Horror very slightly added in.
I kept waiting for something scary, weird, spooky. Really anything.
The biggest wow that was cool moment was [spoiler] encountering a giant crab disguised as a shipwreck [/spoiler], but other than that I did not come across many memorable moments.
Not enough variety and difficulty in catching fish.
Upgrading is way to easy. Also the designers know what the end ship and best part are but the ending layout is messy.
 [spoiler] Ending light slots are 1x3 and a 1x1 below the middle of the 1x3 which is fine if you are using a 1x3 and a 1x1 light but the best light you can unlock is a 1x2 which looks bad no matter how you place it. Same problem with the engines. A little more work and it could have more layout option and not look bad. [/spoiler]

All in all I think this game could use a hate setting.
 [spoiler] Messing up on fishing causes them to escape and lower the spawn count not just make you wait.
Make yellows mandatory to catch the fish and add a smaller red for trophy.
Powers should have more drawbacks. Right now they dont feel like eldritch powers.
Speed gives you a little threat and breaks a part if you hit max...oh no.
how about using speed does that and causes fish onboard to spoil faster (now the ice blocks have use).
Fish kill does taint and spoil some fish but the main reason is to cheat fish you cant catch with your current set up, and quests/bait/etc dont care about freshness (usually).
Maybe also spawn a horror where you killed the fish.  [/spoiler]

Still feels in beta, like the world is there but I am just wandering aimlessly around. I never felt compelled to do anything. Really only finish the game/all achievements/DLC to see if their was something here to write home about and it was a very easy game to 100%, but no.

For the price, especially on sale, I can recommend this game for the few unique things it does but don't expect anything revolutionary.

The art design is cool.

As a massive fan of lovecrafts stories I am allways looking for a game that truly captures what his horror style is all about.
Games like ""Call of Cthulhu"" or ""The Sinking City"" were promising, but fell flat in the end.

Enter ""Dredge"".
 I am amazed how this game pulled off everything lovecraftian horror is all about. A sense of wonder. Curiosity. Things we are unable to comprehend. It manages to capture everything masterfully. It is clear to me that the developers are not only fans of lovecrafts works, but understand it.

The story is told in a way that just keeps pushing me forward. It managed to keep me hooked from beginning to end. I was even more surprised when I learned, that there are multiple ending. And both of them are, again, incredibly lovecraftian.
I am currently on my 2nd playthrough and it is well worth your time, because you will pick up on clues that you did not catch during your first time playing.

The gameplay loop is incredibly simple. Go out fishing, sell the fish, upgrade your ship and get back out there. At first it seemed like nothing special, but it is very addicting. Pretty much every time I play the game, the feeling of ""just one more fishing trip"" is allways present. Often preventing me from turning off the game.

The music and sounddesign is superb. From cozy and relaxing tracks, to adventures tunes and scores that will make you feel uneasy, everything is there. 

I had/still have an absolute blast playing ""Dredge"". This is easily the 2nd best lovecraftian horror game I have ever played. It is second only to Bloodborne and that says a lot. 
Still, I have to mention, this is not a horror-game in the traditional sense. You will not find any jumpscares or classic horror elements like demons, murderers or something along those lines. All the tension and unease is created by atmosphere alone. If that is not your cup of tea, I do not recommend this game to you.
For everyone else, pick it up and give it a try. You might be surprised what you can find.
This game deserves all the praise it has gotten. 
I will follow Black Salt Games future releases with great interest. And ofcourse I am allways looking forward to more ""Dredge"" content.

(Gay fish, yo)
Mother fuckin gay fish (Im a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish (its alright, girl)
Makin love to other gay fish

All those lonely nights
At the grocery store
In the frozen fish aisle
Feeling like a whore
Cuz I wasnt being true

That I had to make a switch (gay fish)

Mother fuckin gay fish (Im a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish (Now where I belong, girl)

I used to be scared, denying who I was
Actin straight, but then goin out to the gay fish clubs
Dancin with the marlins, makin out with all the snappers
Id take a salmon home and work that caudal fin for hours
But now Im out and Im free to love what I want
Be it yellowfin or bass or that trout in Vermont
I slap that marlin ass, make that grouper butt shake
Ill come to your house and have an orgy in your mother fucking fish tank

Mother fuckin gay fish (Im a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish (Now where I belong, girl)
Making love to other gay fish

I really get around
Im a slut of the sea
When I say I got crabs
I mean it literally
I was eating dinner
And just had to go down
On that mackerel on the dish

Cus Im the gayest of the gay fish

Mother fuckin gay fish (Im a fish, yo)
Girl I am a gay fish (Now where I belong, girl)

But I got to settle down
I cant be a whore
I aint gonna just sleep
With any fish no more
Found me a lover
A brother whos a cross-dressing pike named Trish

And together we are gay fish

Longer reasons:

1) Price - I can't describe my review the best way I can unless I start with its price and comparing it to another phenomenal game. Based on the content of this game it was priced way too high for me. In my local currency PHP, this game is at 900 pesos and I believe it should be sold at around 500 at best. I guess I'm just too salty on buying this game at this price and had high expectations that it failed to deliver. For me pricing it at that high I would have loved to see more depth in the game. More on point 2

2) Content - Its a repetitive game with a gimmick. I loved the first few hours of this game with the hidden dangers, the whole buy and sell, upgrades etc. Again I don't mind it, because I thought there was something deeper to it. Honestly I would've love that I would have become mayor in some of the towns, try to improve the cities, build ships, try to create trade routes, MAYBE even battle the horrors. But it all ended there. Its the same thing one after the other. Each town having its own gimmick and that's it. No deeper evolution to the fishing mechanic etc. Side quests are all pathetic, essentially fetch quests that aren't even far from each other, like it was just tacked on to check a box. 

Also the thrill of the chase part will wear off when you've upgraded and this is a sign of a bad mechanic.

3) Comparison to another fishing game - Dave the diver. I bought Dave the diver roughly for the price and the content of that game quadruples what Dredge has. Sure it had the buy and sell thing. No problem but it had a compelling story to tell. Sure it had different sections which are all gimmicky, but each section had its own unique charm. It had better side quests with some of them unlocking another piece of the game. It had a lot of other game mechanics to fill up the time. 

In the end that's what i felt about the game. I felt that it was overpriced and there's a better alternative. I would recommend it if it was sold for 50% or even 75% of its original price. 

Improvements (?):
1) add more to the gameplay - Maybe add like an option for First person, imagine having to walk around your deck and exploring underwater parts in this universe. I know it'd be like subnautica but at least its added gameplay. Imagine diving and opening treasure boxes, or imagine brinigng up a plank to fit a broken part of the ship, and you have to find the exact shape or you have the option to cut the shape into what's needed. Something like that. something to give more depth into the despair and the dread of the game. 

Imagine like your sailing your boat for hours then when you look at your map, you BARELY moved or you DIDNT move at all from your original position.then you find out a monster is doing this and in order for you to finally get away from it is to swim down and blind its eye or something. or since this is a lovecraftian inspired game. Maybe do a ritual or drink some drug to free you from its influence.

Something more than just sail away.",1700257432,1700257432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The monster that chases you in this region isn't really that scary, it lacks the eldritch creepiness that, say, the gale cliffs one has and seems oddly out of place to me in this world's idea of creepy monsters. I feel like it should've been a mutated giant squid, or an Orca with a massive set of creepy eyes or something. The area and the monster there feel very vanilla and kinda empty to me. The only exception being the 'middle' of the icy peninsula where something lurks but there's no real danger with that thing.

While this DLC is fun and the price tag is mostly fair, I can't help but feel the devs were... uninspired? Not massively motivated? It's hard to explain. The island fits in perfectly with the other ones in terms of the amount of fish you can find there (about 11 excluding aberrations which is more than some of the original island's fish counts)  but it really does just feel like that, another island. It has 3 NPCs, two being re-used from previous content and the one new one is the same art for 4 different guys. It does add 'Ice blocks' which can help your fish last but once you've already finished the game there's little use for it.

The only exception to that feeling of 'vanilla / emptiness' I mentioned is the lurking thing stuck in the middle of the island, it looks great and is just as eldritch and creepy as I would want, but it doesn't really do anything and quickly loses that creepiness once you've met it once since you realise it is simply trapped and not much of it is visible. I also enjoyed the story of this creature found in the humming stones dotted around the island but it really is only a few sentences of backstory though it is meant to be a mystery I suppose.

Anyway, rambling aside, here's my summary:

The DLC is pretty good. The new region is somewhat interesting and the eldritch thing in the middle is cool but it really does just feel like more of the same. There's no real world changing story here, the monster doesn't do anything particularly new or change how you play. The region is more like a side quest / side content meant purely to supplement the original game. 
I would recommend this DLC if you plan to play the game for the first time which feels wrong to say for a DLC (This isn't a paradox interactive game, after all) or plan to play through again to 100% the game. If you've already played and finished the game before and don't want to play through the game again; I would say decide whether you actually want to get this DLC as it doesn't really have that sense of dread and unease that some of the main content has, gale cliffs is still my favourite part of the game and this icy isle simply doesn't compare too well against it for a first visit.",1680393850,1700235825,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

DLC REVIEW:
Cheap but at the same time doesn't add much. A 1-2 hour long main mission that is somewhat boring and doesn't add to the lore much. Few new fish types and 2 side missions and that's it. Not sure if worth the money or not but I wouldn't recommend getting it. It really doesn't add anything new or interesting.

[h1]Prologue[/h1]
Deep sea fishing, such a relaxing activity with the warmth of the sun, the smells and sounds of the sea, while waiting for a fish to bite the line. Unless you like the protagonist of our story, an old fisherman who, reading the newspaper, found an advertisement, from an archipelago formed by five isolated islands in the world, in search of a fisherman. Soon, he took his equipment and boat and left for the islands, only to receive the ""Welcome"", in the form of an ominous and thick fog that appears from nowhere, which makes him not notice a group of stones near the only lighthouse of the islands, ending up sinking his boat. ^^

Fortunately our protagonist survives, but now he has to start over from scratch, with a small and old boat that was available in the port, with old equipment that still works. All he need to start fishing and get money and materials to improve the boat to be able to go further, visit the other islands of the archipelago, to catch the various species of fish unique to each island, as well as doing jobs in exchange for money. But always have to be careful, because something that is not of this world lives and swims through the dark waters of the ocean, and this thing loves not only to modify the fish in sinister ways, but also to go out, especially at night, in search of the next meal. ^^

[b]Pros:[/b]
+ A game that made a combination that I found very interesting and fun, mixing fishing with supernatural mystery.
+ The fishing part I found very relaxing and pleasant, navigating in search of places where to catch each of the seventy-eight species of fish and crabs, with all of them with at least one anomalous version, totally ""natural"".
+ Each of the archipelago's islands is quite unique, not only in appearance, climate and terrain, but also in the species that can be fished, as well as in the surprises.
+ Each of the islands has its own ""nice"" surprise, which won't miss any chance to try to dine the player, with boat and all.
+ A curious time system that I liked, where time only passes when the boat moves or fishing, but beware that those who want to dinner the protagonist are not affected by this.
+ I liked the art of the game, it matched the mood that there is something, unnatural swimming in the waters.
+ Good soundtrack, relaxing in moments of tranquility, and tense, when the fisherman becomes the fishing.

[b]Cons:[/b]
- It is always unpleasant, when of all the places that can be reached when the boat takes damage, the damage is exactly in one of the parts of the engine or fishing equipment.

This is how a new life begins in this small, sinister and isolated from the rest of the world archipelago, going out to fish for the various species of fish, including some specimens with totally ""natural"" anomalies without ""anything"" sinister, each of them living on an specific island and depth, requiring the appropriate equipment. Once caught, the fish can be sold, to get money, buy improvements and go to the farthest islands, and find new people who will not only tell you more about the sinister history of this archipelago, but also provide missions, in exchange for money, equipment and other interesting things. ^^

The problem is that all this is best done during the day, because even though it is possible to sail at night and some of the fish can only be found at night, it's not just the protagonist's boat and some nocturnal fish sailing over the darkness of the night, but also sinister beings, some big enough to catch the protagonist like a fish, because they are big enough to make the boat look like a toy boat. It will be up to the player to decide what is worth more, the risk of sailing under the light of the moon or the riches that can only be found at night, after all, not all threats hunt only at night. ^^

[h1] Art and sound[/h1]
Produced by the New Zealand studio Black Salt Games, I liked the artistic part, combining in a way to show the beauty of each of the islands, and their various and diverse types of fish, as well as showing, mainly in the people and the ""natural"" anomalies of the fish, that there is something wrong and unnatural swimming in the waters between these islands. As for the soundtrack, I was also very satisfied, I liked the music used as well as the sound effects, and I also liked that in several moments they only use silence, while we listen to the relaxing sounds of the sea, while we explore the ocean and fishing for fish. ^^

[h1] Conclusion[/h1]
Dredge was a game I'd had my eye on for some time, having played it since the first demo, when we could only explore one of the islands, being interested ever since. So I was pleased when the game was released and I saw that the wait was worth it, with much more to explore, discover and fishing, while enjoying the beauty of the islands and the creatures that swim through their waters, and running away from others. Anyway this is a game that I recommend so much for those who like fishing games, for those who like supernatural mysteries and who knows, for those who like both like me, while trying to discover the mysteries of the islands, at the same time trying to catch that fish that's still missing, or running away so as not to become something's dinner. ^^",1681703235,1700186391,True,6,0,0.57617497444152832,0,True,False,False

Tenía expectativas mucho más altas con este juego, aunque no lo platiné aún, pude terminar su historia con mis 15hs de juego, las cuales fueron bastante rápidas... El inicio del juego junto a su historia es atrapante, pero llega un punto en el que pierde ese hilo y te podes llegar a perder en otras misiones o desviar con lo principal, lo cual no es malo tampoco... Pero lo más entretenido desde un principio es ir conociendo nueva gente, conociendo nuevas especies para pescar y conseguir nuevas mecánicas para esto, ahí creo que fue decayendo, ya que tiene varias especies de animales pero no hay una verdadera dificultad para conseguirlos y ni siquiera una animación para la recolección de estos. Siempre que conseguía una nueva caña de pescar esperaba tener una nueva animación y/o mecánica, pero no fue así, solo podía llegar a variar la forma de la skill check que tenías que realizar si el pez era de una profundidad distinta, lo cual deja MUCHÍSIMO que desear.

En conclusión, está bueno el juego, es hermoso gráficamente, tiene unas lindas mecánicas y es divertido hasta sus inicios cuando estás conociendo su pequeño mapa... pero carece de innovación a lo largo del juego, como también de dificultad, en el sentido de que en todas mis 15hs solamente me morí una vez... y la verdad que no me asusté nunca.

I've cleared the game and done both endings - found myself just from exploring. I didn't do absolutely everything, but simply fishing and selling at the fish market is a satisfying loop with with sounds and slippery feel of the sea creatures.

Days are shockingly short - it seems like maybe 2-5 minutes long and then you'll go back to a dock to sell fish and upgrade as well as sleeping. Sometimes it was laughable how I would go an extremely short distance from the dock, fish 2 things and it would be night again! And in the early game, you almost have to go back constantly, because you're slow and have no defense.

Time only increases when you move, turn or fish, but jumps up a lot after a fishing action I think and will go forwards 2-6 hours roughly when installing a new piece of equipment.
Music is great especially when exploring, art style is nice and it's mostly peaceful, though the danger grows for night adventuring and is mostly an expensive annoyance, though you later unlock abilities to speed away or launch a kind of distraction flare.

The unlocks are fun, but there's not much to do after ~10-15 hours when you unlock everything - though the research points are hard to find, so it seems like you basically just 1 path of the upgrade tree to pursue. 

Only a few boss-like / patrol monsters of each area can kill you, but you respawn typically 5 minutes before. And venturing to map edge has a massive leviathan entity that will cause damage.",1680276991,1700092445,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

Some comments: 
- in order to complete the game you need to know where certain fish can be found, and i saved some time to google for the position + details. However, you can get 90%+ of the fish without help and during natural gameplay you stumble upon many fish naturally
- the story is good, but don´t expect something epic
- there are multiple very distinct areas - Stellar Basin was my personal favorite and Devils Spine my least enjoyable area. But in any case, it is genius how different the areas feel and i give the developers 11/10 for pulling this off
- i am looking forward to the DLC and would most likely buy a DLC pass just to ensure that this great game will continue to grow",1700003896,1700003896,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

During the day you set out on a normal fishing adventure while also uncovering clues to what has brought about the mysterious fog. The player travels across 5 different island areas separated by ocean with each having their own unique types of fish, equipment requirements and a number of not too overwhelming sidequests.

But when the sun sets, swirling clouds of red fog grip a hold of the player's ship causing panic and hallucinations. Shadows from the deep come alive and players are left scrambling for the safety of docks as evil chases them through the fog. Normal everyday fish you catch during the day turn into diseased and corrupted monstrosities, complete with errant fangs and protruding bones at night known as ""aberrations"" which catch a higher price at the fish markets dotted across the islands. All of this is to raise money to purchase upgraded equipment which is researched from the components of wrecked ships which the player dredges in a rush to get back to port before sunset.

Exploration
Fishing
Adventure (in the narrative-driven, puzzle-solving sense)
RPG (in the upgrade trees and equipment sense)
Inventory Management
Horror (more atmospheric than anything else)
Pokemon (in the gotta fish them all sense)

... genres, and yet somehow just works.  None of these genres are implemented deeply, but as a design decision, I think it was wise because you wrap up the game before anything gets stale (ha-ha).  Only potential drawback (for some, I think) is that it does not last very long.

Exploration-wise, you get access to 5 groups of islands, each with its own personality and perils.  Scattered about the ocean between them, you will find even more islands and secrets strewn all over.  The map seems pretty big at first, but becomes noticeably smaller once you upgrade your ship engines and can zip around.

Fishing and dredging are basically just rhythm mini games.  The fun part is trying to quickly get all the new fish to fit in your boat, before a peril smashes into it.  I wish I learned about RMB = Rotate even earlier.

Adventure-wise, this game has a fairly short story that becomes really obvious if you are talking to everyone, pay attention, and put the puzzle pieces together.  Still enjoyable though.

There are several RPG elements: An upgrade tree to your equipment, upgrade tree to your boat, and collectible books that grant permanent bonuses.  None are too deep, but enjoyable as-is.

The horrors are mostly just random atmospheric things that mainly come out at night.  Spooky the first time around, but you quickly get over it.

Finally, I very quickly gave up trying to catch all fish, as it doesn't appear to do anything except for a few achievements.

In total, you will spend around 15 hours exploring the islands while dredging, fishing, upgrading your stuff, and checking off quest objectives.  All the while taking in the atmosphere and pondering  just what the heck is going on.  To be honest, I think the length is just right -- in our current world of GaaS products that just want us to grind grind and grind some more until we all become numb, it's nice to see a much more focused experience.  By not going too deep into any one genre, everything still tastes fairly fresh by the time you finish.

tldr; Great game if you want a fun, focused experience brimming with personality.  Don't buy if you ""value"" a game by hours playable divided by asking price.",1699805166,1699805166,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Like there are a few items you get that should have buffs but be untainted, making you want to play ""Clean"" vs using the maw crab trap for example.

Now the biggest negative about this game is the grind. When you first start off there is a tech tree to get through as well as a bunch of upgrades to purchase. Doing side missions helps alleviate this quite a lot and as you progress the main story you unlock abilities to help.

Now onto the positives we have the Tetris style inventory system. I personally love these while other people like a simple inventory with just weight management. 

Exploration is fantastic. The more I uncovered the more I wanted to see and know. Even while finishing the last sidequest I saw events like a whale fighting a giant tentacle that I didn’t even know was in the game. 

The game is rather short, about 12-13 hours to get both endings and do the side missions. This felt like a very lite version of Subnautica / Sunless Sea / Sunless Skies.

The story is pretty straightforward (if you get both endings) although some of the special fish the player catches do have lore attached to them. I also enjoy the use of a lot of real life fish in the game.

Music is ok. Atmospheric but nothing too catchy.

Great indie, looking forward to the DLC.

I had a good time fishing and sailing; however, the game promises much more. I anticipated more unease and exploration of the unknown as an addition to the fishing experience but it's not here. There were a few characters that initially appeared to have intriguing stories; unfortunately, it turned out that after one or two quests, there was nothing more—no development, no further story at all, and we can simply forget about those characters.

Your player character is a Fisherman and captain of a ship that winds up crashed in a mysterious archipelago. Your immediate goal is to pay off your debt incurred by your ship's repairs which you do by fishing around the archipelago. Fishing in this game is rhythm minigames with forgiving windows of opportunity. While your character fishes, you cash in the fish to buy boat upgrades to explore, go further and catch more fish and find more upgrades. It's a pleasant gameplay loop. 

But where's the horror? The horror starts sneaking its way in when you catch fish that look...not exactly you expect. Or when your sanity meter at the top of the screen starts to waver if you have gone long without sleeping and you start to see rocks suddenly appear to dash your ship upon in the midnight hours. Or when a Leviathan of the depths charges you, damaging your ship's hull. Here there be a few jumpscares.

Ok, fine. Horror elements, but how is this cozy? It may be difficult to truly explain but the minigames are strangely soothing and piloting your vessel along a vast ocean has this sense of calm, even if there are deep sea fangly beasts below. The cadence of the daily work routine of going out to fish, catching fish, selling them, improving your ship and resting when needed is strangely relaxing in a way I have not experienced outside another nautical game I adore, Spiritfarer. Granted, the sea monsters in those game genuinely wished to be your friend and not eat you as they do in Dredge, but my point stands. There is also a cozy mode to turn off the sea monsters of the depth if that is your pleasure. I did not, but can appreciate the option being available.

The artwork and atmosphere in this game is unparalleled and the uniqueness of the gameplay loop is a breath of fresh air. I can admit that one could power through the main path of this game in roughly 6 hours, but the calm experienced by just voyaging the ocean makes me believe few people will do that. I have spent double that time in my current file and I am still discovering new fish and quests.

I loved the artwork, from how the oceans looked to the sky, and the characters were pleasing to look at. The gameplay was pretty fun; I'm happy they spiced up the fishing mechanics with some of the fish, but I wish there were more mini-games. The music was great; it made me really feel like I was chugging along in the middle of the ocean. I caught myself not using a second monitor at all because I felt sucked into the game. Sadly, the biggest problem I have is the story. It felt right on pace when you're in the Marrow, but once the story has you leave, it gets into a very obvious loop of going to a new island, completing 2 or 3 missions for one person, and then getting the relic. On the next island, it felt very empty in a way, not the kino of lonely fisherman, but more like someone who shows up in town, and there's old Joe sitting on a rocking chair, and he is the whole town. You meet the same merchant lady at all places, so you only meet 1 or 2 new people on an island and have little dialogue with them. I wish there were more side quests that would open the world and expand the lore. Instead, you get to the end of a side quest, and it's like, 'Oh, that's it.' I liked the good ending. That being said, I did enjoy the game, especially at the discount I got it at. I will be picking up the Pale Reach to see how that goes.""",1699316126,1699316126,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[b]If you want an easy, cosy fishing and exploration game, with a thin paint of Lovecraft, then [i]Dredge[/i] is perfect. If not, well...[/b]

[i]Dredge[/i] [b]is[/b] a good game. And it has all the right ingredients to be more than good. The gameplay mechanics are simple and fun, there's a satisfying amount of content, the art and UI are well polished. But it lacks [i]ambition[/i]. There's a decent variety of gameplay systems and mechanics, but eventually you realise they barely interact with each other, or change in any meaningful way as you progress through the game.

For example, the upgrade tree. It's reasonably extensive, and feels satisfying to unlock new content at first. But as you progress, you notice how little the new content actually changes anything. Almost no upgrades are required to reach new areas or content. By the time you're halfway through the tree, you barely have any motivation to unlock the rest.

Similarly, there's a kind of sanity / fear meter. It seems important and intimidating at first... and then you realise it barely has an impact on anything, and barely interacts with any other systems. The real threats in the game have nothing to do with sanity - they'll wreck you whether you're sane or not. No significant new mechanics are ever introduced. It's just there, and you quickly learn to ignore it.

There are plenty of other examples where the game sets up a promising looking system or quest, and you enjoy it for a while. But eventually there's that disappointment when it doesn't really go anywhere or try anything new. Fishing 15 minutes in is the same as fishing 15 hours in. There's an interesting setup for the plot, but almost no development after the setup. It's disappointing, mostly because it feels like [i]Dredge[/i] already has everything it needs to succeed. Just a few tweaks the systems, a few minor changes as you progress...

So, yeah. A good, fun game, that nevertheless left me feeling underwhelmed. By way of fishing analogy, [i]Dredge[/i] is like catching a reasonable haul, but letting the prize-winning fish slip through your fingers.",1699179308,1699179426,False,10,0,0.604814887046813965,0,True,False,False

---
Looks like spots do respawn after some time.  Also, later in the game you get a way to make spots spawn where you want with an expendable item you can get more of if you go to a certain NPC in the map with fish.
Late game you might not care about being out at night given that you can get your boat going pretty fast and have further transport / speed special abilities.

I was rather disappointed by the Lovecraftian horror element. Early on when you don't know what's out there it's really fun, but you soon realize there's not much to be afraid of. There's usually a single enemy chasing you, and a bunch of obstacles. I wish there was more diverse hazards: Areas of the water that become infested with skeletal piranhas at night. Fog clouds that teleport you to another part of the map. The town's people becoming corrupted as you sell them mutated fish. Don't get me wrong, the existing hazards are fun, but I wanted more. I wanted the night to be SCARY, and for a REASON.
Maybe it would've been fun if you didn't see your ship on the map, adding some challenge with sea-navigation, especially at night. Would've also made the central lighthouse a lot more significant.
The NPCs are another area that could've been fleshed out a lot more. The starting area has a ton of characters, both quest givers and shop owners. But all the other areas usually only have 2-3 NPCs. The wandering trader is nice, but it rather feels like the devs didn't have the time/money to flesh out vendors for each area.
My final gripe with the game is that the progression system felt rather unintuitive to me. By the time I realized the fish I was looking for could only be caught by nets, I had explored the entire map and fully upgraded my ship. I didn't even realize that a single NPC quest was preventing me from progressing, since most NPC missions are optional.

The wonderful artwork made the amount of fishing required to finish this story easier.  Must like the mini-games in fishing!  Surprisingly, I did not find this scary at all but a story of intrigue and persistence.  Like with each crazy-looking fish, I was just impressed with the imagination. Every strange thing the inhabitants did, I was like, well!  Ok.  Maybe I've read too much Lovecraft.  It's all a metaphor of our own internal horrors.  

'O the mind, mind has mountains; cliffs of fall
Frightful, sheer, no-man-fathomed ...' 

from the poem, 'No worst, there is none. Pitched past pitch of grief', by Gerard Manley Hopkins when he was succumbing to his depression.  I believe Lovecraft and Hopkins were from the same era. 

If you look up that brilliant poem and it gets you down, too, then read Hopkins 'Windhover' poem.  It's the happier side of his life.  Hopkins felt sadness and happiness deeply.  

On that note, in the game, wouldn't it have been great if in a DLC you have the option to fix the other lighthouse and fix that most messed up area?

The gameplay, overall, is pretty relaxed, only attacking you with creepy monstrosities when you get careless or take risks.  The 'time only passes when you move or fish' behavior is the right balance of mechanic that keeps that steady pressure of 'need to watch the clock or get caught in the dark' and 'I can walk away for any reason and it'll still be where I left it when I get back.'  

The fishing/dredging minigame is simple, but can be more difficult than you expect, and the variations of the minigame 'puzzle' as you catch different fish keep it from stagnating five minutes in.

The horror elements are enough to make you go 'uh oh' when things start to happen, but don't even remotely approach 'Alien Isolation' levels of terror.  

Graphics are a nice style of pseudo cell-shaded 3D rendering that's pleasant to look at, and feels okay for this game.  And there are some rather pretty sections that will make you smile even as an abyssal horror tries to eat you (or not, if you're paying enough attention to avoid it).

The audio works nicely.  As the anecdote might suggest, if you don't notice it, it's at least NOT bad.  The music is fitting, a slow, melancholy mix with an undertone of creepy that makes you wonder (at least the first few times) if you're triggering an event flag, or if it just kicks on at random.  The sound effects are crisp, fit what they're assigned too, and little 'I caught a new thing!' jingles come with twisted versions for those times when...  Well, you'll see.

Story progression is all up to you.  Take as much time as you need/want.  And the twist near the end will leave you guessing all the way up until that moment.  

Overall, a little arcade-ey, a little puzzle game-ey, a little resource management...  ... -ey.

It's also one of the best UX I've seen in a game, ever! The game smoothly guides you through the different mechanics and zones, there's a ton of small tips and guidance cleverly nestled in the narration (for instance, the Painter's dialogue has an extra line when you have collected all the flags), enemies approach is signaled with sound, FX, a change in hue...really a masterclass in the matter, big kudos to the devs.

This game is pretty chill and I appreciate that trying to organize your caught fish involves some inventory Tetris like in Resident Evil 4.

It eases you into the gameplay and setting well enough, seemingly mundane. Its artstyle, looks, and music are all punching way above their weight class for an indie game though, which establish a high quality threshold and immerse setting from second one. Then it quickly starts building, first dipping its toes into an ocean of subtle eldritch horror with the first grotesque aberrations and eerie bumps in the night, then wholeheartedly taking the plunge.

Dredge really makes the most of everything at its disposal as it shifts from the chill fishing and engaging exploration of daytime to the nerve-wracking risks and encounters of dark, foggy nights on the sea. The fish to catch, the locales to delve into, the puzzles and inventory management, the story to piece together, all conspire to make time pass in the blink of an eye while you're playing it. I found my eyes so glued to the screen at times that they'd sting when I finally got the chance to close them after narrowly making it in to port. And when all was said and done, I wanted to play more to finish off the leftover fish, even though I'm not typically a completionist.

If I had any criticisms, I guess I'd like there to be more upgrades. At a certain point I'm just drowning in money with nothing to spend it on, and progress you've built up (literally building your boat up) over the game just stops dead. And naturally I'd like more of it, since the game's about ten hours long, but I'm also glad the game never felt like it was overstaying its welcome. In a year of great games, Dredge is an incredibly good one.

I remember seeing the demo on YT a very long time ago, and ever since it came out I've wanted to play it. The core gameplay loop, the story, and the style are all fantastic. That being said I couldn't help but feel kinda bored as I got closer to the end of the game, it just felt like to much of the same thing I had been doing for the whole rest of the game. 
I would've liked to see some kind of ramp up in difficulty, or more game changing mechanics (outside of the ability wheel). Getting the dredging equipment t the start of the game, and then MAYBE unlocking the trawling net a little bit later feel like the only big mechanics introduced. I would've liked something to change in the core gameplay for each of the 4 island cities, not just ""don't let x creature catch you"". I would've liked to FEEL more progression as I got each relic, like the ocean gets angrier with you each time you remove one from the water, which makes your life harder in some way. Make the fishing/dredging faster or more difficult somehow, have some kind of ""boss fight"" with the Lovecraftian horror at each island, trying to prevent you from returning the relic to the collector utilizing the fishing minigame or something.
I also thought the ending was super lackluster. [spoiler]The game warns you TWICE that you cant save after this point before going into a whopping single 20-second cutscene into credits. Why am I worried about saving if there's nothing I would even WANT to save? What am I gonna drive halfway to the cutscene point and call it a night? And then also care about not having to do that again? Are there multiple endings and I just got the really short one?[/spoiler] More on the boss fight idea, I think that would've been a great way to make the ending feel less sudden and anticlimactic. Make you use ALL the minigames. Throw all of the abominations at you. Make you have to steer through rocks at night with the light constantly going out and something following you. Have the ocean throw hell itself at you to avoid you doing what needs to be done.
Complaining aside, I really do want to repeat that I genuinely did love this game. It was so much fun and for 10 hours I couldn't get enough of it. Which is why I'm so sad that it didn't really live up to its potential. Regardless, I would highly recommend this game to anyone, and I can't wait to play the DLC when it comes out.
