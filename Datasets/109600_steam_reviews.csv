[h1]Played hundreds if not thousands of hours before it was available on Steam. Quit a few years ago, but feel my review still holds today.[/h1]


Pro's:
Great combat mechanics: Most classes are fun to learn and have a real role in group situations.
Controls feel fluid and tight: Dodging feels good and is rewarding.
PVE content is exceptional: Many zones, many dungeons, many bosses, many gear sets.
Graphics are above average.


Con's:
[b]Pay to Win aspect [u]RUINS[/u] PVP. [/b]
Content gated heavily by daily quests.  
Not open world.
No real end game ""raid"" content you might expect from a MMO of this caliber.

When you've reached like level 3 you're gonna start to nerd this game A LOT

The game is constantly updated to either fix bugs or add in new content

If you're into MMO RPGs you're gonna love this game to bits

CONS:
'astral diamonds' wich you use to buy stuff in the AH (Auction House) (buying items off others) are kinda tricky to get if you don't have 2 friends with you or if you're under level 20.

Time is money. You will invest one or the other to achieve top tier gear. 
Not the DnD experience with a D-20 but 'new' mechanics to level the playing field between a lvl 1 wiz and a lvl 1 warrior- Cant say I agree with it, but a necessary evil if you want a MMORPG/F2P game to succeed.

Now what should I say about this game...
Neverwinter is a MMORPG, and a really good one. I was somewhat off for the first few hours, but the game gets better and better with every hour you spend in it. 

A disclaimer #2 - if you don't like timegate mechanic and grinding dailies don't read further.

Let's start with some pros:
+ Setting - I'm definitely a FR lover. You should know that Salvatore helped with writing some of the quests in the game. You will also meet some amazing characters like Bruenor Battlehamer, Drizzt Do'Urden or Minsc&Boo. 
+ Music - wether you're in the heart of Neverwinter, traverse the Underdark or purge the Dread Ring of the undead you'll always be accompanied by really nice tunes. It's an MMO so obviously music does not play THAT BIG of a role, but the tracks playing at the background do not disturb you.
+ Character development(bright part) - it's really well made. While power upgrading does not matter much, traits and boons can passively make your character stronger in different ways(for example make your trap also deal damage over time, and even stronger against immune targets)
+ Combat - you're basically on the move all the time, combat is dynamic, there is a lot of dodging, blocking and watching out for enemy attacks
+ Endgame - that is just my opinion but endgame is great. Dungeons are challenging(unless you get boosted by that 3k+ player), long, bossfights are fun. There is always something to do due to campaigns which not only give great rewards but boost your character stats via boons. Also progress is slow paced but significant enough to see the difference between those two items, 30-40 item levels or that one tier of your artifact. 

Cons
- Hard to earn currency - getting AD as a fresh player is a pain in the arse. Enough said. 
- AD to Zen converting ratio - Zen is that ""real money"" currency of NW. And while gathering AD to exchange for Vip(1k Zen - 500k AD) is not that big of an issue, trying to get AD to buy Zen while also managing your characters equipment is. Artifact here, refinement stones there, goodbye 120k AD here. 
- Outdated graphics - we're in 2017, yet graphics sometimes feel like a 2012 game. It doesn't look bad, it had actually aged quite well, but I think devs should consider making some upgrades here and there. 
- Character development (sad part) - boons from campaigns are a double edged sword. They greatly increase character capabilities, but good luck getting most of them. Some of them are after huge timegates(ToD, Dread Ring, Underdark) and others are just annoying to start with(Icewind Dale, fuck you).

My final mark would be somewhere around 7 or 8 out of 10. It's definitely a game worth at least trying out.",1486750131,1486750131,True,15,0,0.682559669017791748,0,True,False,False

No real reason for it aside from piss poor optimization. Believe me, I tried everything. From driver changes, to forum posts, extensive google searching, and ritual sacrifice. So I stopped trying. Jump forward nearly a year later, and I figure I'll give it another shot. Somewhere along the line they updated the game to the point of being playable again! Very exciting for me, since I truly enjoy this game and was bummed out I couldn't play it.

If you are like me and the game ran poorly for no reason, give it another go. It just may be fixed for you too.",1485394238,1485394238,True,3,0,0.539167106151580811,0,True,False,False

RNG boxes will rape your bank before you get anything worth a fuck. Campaigns that force you to log in for ten days to repeat a garbage ass daily before you get enough of what you need to advance to the next portion, rinse repeat until you can move along. The gap between end game people and people that are just coming back or just starting is rediculously huge. To the tune of someone doing 80 million damage while you do 6 million... I know how to get to that damage level i just dont see myself playing this game as a second job to get there. This game was not like this in the beginning when i started to play and would be great if it went back but someone on the management team at this studio is a greedy fuck and needs to calm down.
