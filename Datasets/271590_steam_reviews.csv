In every lobby there is now at least 1 modder carpetbombing the city or in godmode griefing people or generally messing up your grind and if you're like me and you call these people out you risk getting cyberstalked by them. 
This personally happened to me after they took offense to my lighthearted jabs at them. Nothing more. 

They then stalked me in every lobby, teleported me all over the map, blew my car up, my bulletproof tires, made me trip when running and steered my car into oncoming traffic.  Basically had full control of my character whenever they wanted to.
Hell they even closed the game several times and twice my internet connection stopped working while playing.

They then proceeded to stalk me and had access to whenever I would pop up online.
I figured it out after one of them told me that they had me on some sort of a list.
 I recall saying things like ""look modders your hax are really cool ok?"" or ""they need the mods to make up for their mental deficits"". I'm certain those coments were enough for them to chose to take it upon themselves to mentally torture me whenever they could.

Last time I played the game, yesterday, I talked to them and they said they wanted ""respect"".
So I uninstalled the game.

Later did some research and found that these modders not only can take all your ingame money from you and alter your lvl, they also have access to your IP and can possibly also find ways to remote control or directly implant malware on your computer. Read people saying some modder deleted applications on their desktop and stuff like this. It's not worth it having your computer hacked or destroyed because of vindictive nerds in desperate need of social validation. 

It's unacceptable Rockstar. You're among the most profitable game companies to date and you chose to reward these people and punish the fans who bought your product. If GTA 6 online is anything like this don't buy it.",1708726381,1708857738,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My experiences consist of getting locked out of my online account, locked out of gta v for 3 days couldnt even play story mode, spawn trapped in passive mode, prevented from leaving the game and closing the window because of spawn camping, lagged out of the game, my internet taken offline, falsely reported because modders and hackers got mad at me, locked out of all of my cars even the cars in my garage and businesses, being constantly targeted for some reason even while hopping lobbies to get away, i get ddos'd and booted offline for killing a modder with a 1000$ bounty, crashed for going after their bounty, locked in a cage while in passive and set on fire and cant escape even in death, prevented from switching lobbies to escape them while they keep spawn camping me, i could drive around do nothing and still get kicked off the game, even playing in story mode ill get kicked out of the game and another thing making money in friends only lobbies only for it not to save due to ""connection issues"" and when i try to in a public session i just get targeted and lose all my money anyway so whats the point.

• This game is among my favorite games of all time. They've fixed the issues that GTA 4 had with driving and such and made very interesting story lines. GTA 5 is among the great games of our generation.
• I should note I play the story mode exclusively. I logged into online once, got brutally killed a couple of times, didn't understand what was going on and remembered why I liked to play alone.
• I am a little worried about GTA 6. Americans tend to think they're the only country on planet earth and they force their political nonsense down the throats of the international community. I really don't want to see any woke or right wing garbage. There are still moderates out there in less polarized societies.
GTA is sufficiently big that they should consider that. They did exceptionally well with this for GTA 5 though, so perhaps my worries are unwarranted. It's fine to portray a reality, but a lot of entertainment has become progaganda instead.

Over and over again modders spam the entire server with xp drop and crash my game, every server contains at least 30% of modders and rockstar doesn't give a f about it. Rocktar takes second place right after epic games being the second most shitty gaming company there is.

MODDERS, modders, modders, crashing my game goog ogoagag i'm fuming. Rockstar games more like shit games.

HAHAHAHA FUNNY NOW A GOD DAMN MODDER KEEPS CRASHING MY GAME EVERY TIME I LOAD IN TO ONLINE JUST BECAUSE I REPORTED HIM AND HE GOT MAD. I Honestly hate you rockstar games you have to be the worst game developer there is.

Oh great, you can basically not stealth cayo perico anymore since guards spawn in and detect bodies now. The juggernaut is also unkillable without detection now. This game is pure shit. Oh and why not add a 144 minute cool down to just start the heist again after completion.

Nothing works in this pile of trash game, want to go in to any type of facility that requires a loading screen? Well, you will never get past that loading screen, it will literally keep on loading until you shut down the game.

Every server you join (and i mean EVERY) there are several chinese bost spamming advertisement for some crappy mod menus through the chinese crap app QQ. Why is there no god damn chat cool down, is that too hard for rockstar games to make?

Haven't played for a while so I just logged in and began playing casually with my friend. During our ~2 hours of gameplay modders crashed both of our games twice with their shitty mod menus they probably bought with their mother's credit cards. Wonderful, I love this game wowowowoowowow.

If you report a modder that is griefing for everyone on the server, your game instantly crashes.

A modder destroys my friend's cargo during a sale mission, we tell him that he is a dick for griefing and we start a stupid argument in the chat about destroying cargo. Me and my friend find a new server and I start my night club sale mission. Guess what the same modder joins our server and kicks me from my own mc during the sale mission for destroying cargo belonging to my organization. This resulted with my cargo being long gone into the void thanks to ROCKSTAR GAMES.  We join a new server AGAIN to start grinding heist preps and guess what. HE JOINS AGAIN KICKS US FROM OUR MC FOR THE SAME REASON AND TELEPORTS US TO HIS APARMENT TO KILL US. That's enough gta for this month. ROCKSTAR GAMES DOES NOTHING ABOUT THE MODDERS THE ONLY THING THEY CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. I HATE YOU ROCKSTAR NORTH.

I love when modders teleport to you in god mode with a minigun and kill you everytime you spawn. Fuck you rockstar games. The modders also see when you report them (the report does nothing btw).

Was good, now full of griefers, MODDERS and a shit tone of bugs. THE GOD DAMN MODDERS KICK YOU FROM THE BLOODY SESSION OR CRASH YOUR FUCKING GAME. THEY ALSO LIKE TO SPAWN KILL EVERYONE ON THE SERVER IN GOD MODE  TO INCREASE THEIR KD, TURN THE WHOLE MAP INTO SOME EPILEPSY BLINKING SHIT AND CONSTANTLY SPAM YOU OFF YOUR VEHICLE.
ROCKSTAR GAMES ALSO MADE THE GAME FREE ON EPIC GAMES WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR MODDERS TO CREATE AN INFINITE AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS BUT THATS NOT EVEN FUCKING NEEDED FOR THEM, SINCE ROCKSTAR SHIT DOESNT CARE ABOUT THE MODDERS ANYWAY :)

This game is also full of bugs, one of the bugs that i hate the most is the bug that occurs when you're running through the fucking tunnel in the diamond casino heist and just get kicked to freemode and the beautiful loadingscreen we all love.
Happened twice yesterday, tried it again today with the same god damn result, LOVE YOU ROCKSTAR. (this bug has been out since the release of the casino heist) they just dont give a f about it.",1589325557,1708662508,False,6,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

GTA V incorporates so many aspects of other games and puts that all into one single game and then adds a bit of do whatever you want and then you have GTA V. Visuals look really good especially on some of the modifications and creator content plus there are plenty of vehicles that can be modded and resprayed at any time. Most of the problems you will find in the game are a direct result of money and how to procure that money and that leads to some interesting or weird moments usually involving a crime of some type. Eventually you can build up a vast criminal empire its just a matter of time. GTA V gets 8/10 Graphics and 10/10 game play plus 10/10 for sounds, overall you will not find any other game that offers so much for a single title. I would recommend to anyone but kids and mostly car enthusiasts, junkies, goths, gangsters and anyone who wants to make a porno.

Its over 11 years old now and still no new game title has challenged its reign for replayability. Massive variety of missions both in story and online mode from races to garbage collection! 
Graphics still stand up today and there are a plethora of mods now that can be added to further improve this and the game in general. 
Unfortunately the official online servers are teeming with heavily modded/hacking trolls who will teleport to your location and kill you over and over until you leave the server bc ""making people mad"" is their only purpose in life... Buuuuut the good news is that you are able to play in private/invite only sessions and there are third party clients you can download that will allow you to access unofficial servers which are moderated and do not have these issues.

In the city of Los Santos, where the lights shine bright,
A tale unfolds, in the dead of the night.
A life of crime, where the stakes are high,
In the world of GTA V, where dreams can die.

(Chorus)
Grand Theft Auto, livin' on the edge,
Fast cars, heists, and a criminal pledge.
In the streets of Los Santos, where chaos thrives,
A dangerous game, where everyone survives.

(Verse 2)
Michael, Trevor, Franklin, a trio so bold,
Chasing the green, in a city so cold.
High-speed chases, neon lights in the dark,
In this concrete jungle, where shadows embark.

(Pre-Chorus)
Loading up the game, escape reality,
In this digital realm, we break free.
A virtual world of crime, where we're in control,
GTA V, the thrill takes its toll.

(Chorus)
Grand Theft Auto, livin' on the edge,
Fast cars, heists, and a criminal pledge.
In the streets of Los Santos, where chaos thrives,
A dangerous game, where everyone survives.

(Bridge)
From Vinewood Hills to the Vespucci shores,
We race through the city, breaking all the laws.
Looting stores, flying high in the sky,
In this pixelated world, where we'll never die.

(Verse 3)
Heists and missions, a criminal's delight,
In the city's underbelly, where plans ignite.
But in the end, we're just players in a game,
Virtual outlaws with no one to blame.

(Pre-Chorus)
Loading up the game, escape reality,
In this digital realm, we break free.
A virtual world of crime, where we're in control,
GTA V, the thrill takes its toll.

(Chorus)
Grand Theft Auto, livin' on the edge,
Fast cars, heists, and a criminal pledge.
In the streets of Los Santos, where chaos thrives,
A dangerous game, where everyone survives.

(Outro)
As the screen fades to black, the story's complete,
In the realm of GTA V, where danger and pixels meet.
A virtual journey, we'll never forget,
In the world of Los Santos, our haven, our debt.",1708642505,1708642505,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Released in 2013, it continues to captivate players with its immersive gameplay, intricate narrative, and expansive virtual world. The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, a stunningly realized and meticulously detailed landscape that seamlessly blends urban environments, countryside, and coastal areas. The sheer size and diversity of the game world contribute to an unparalleled sense of immersion, allowing players to explore a vast, living environment teeming with activities. One of the standout features of GTA 5 is its triple protagonist system, introducing players to three distinct characters: Michael, a retired bank robber living a lavish lifestyle; Franklin, a repo man striving for a better life; and Trevor, a volatile and unpredictable criminal. The ability to switch between these characters dynamically adds depth to the narrative and presents a unique perspective on the unfolding events. The storyline is richly layered, combining heists, betrayals, and character development in a way that keeps players engaged from start to finish. The writing is sharp, filled with wit and social commentary, and the voice acting is top-notch, elevating the overall storytelling experience. The game's mechanics are a blend of action, driving, and exploration. The gunplay is refined, offering a satisfying mix of precision and chaos. Driving feels realistic, with a diverse range of vehicles that handle differently, from sleek sports cars to off-road trucks. The inclusion of heists adds a strategic element, allowing players to plan and execute elaborate criminal operations, further enhancing the gameplay experience.

GTA Online, the multiplayer component, extends the game's longevity with a persistent online world where players can engage in various activities, including heists, races, and missions. The continually evolving online environment, coupled with regular updates from Rockstar, ensures a dynamic and engaging multiplayer experience. Graphically, GTA 5 remains impressive, especially considering its initial release in 2013. The attention to detail in the environments, character models, and lighting effects showcases the technical prowess of the developers. While the game has received widespread acclaim, some criticisms include occasional technical glitches, particularly in the online mode, and a few missions that may feel repetitive. However, these minor issues do little to detract from the overall excellence of Grand Theft Auto V.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V stands as a pinnacle in the gaming industry, successfully merging an expansive open-world with a compelling narrative and diverse gameplay mechanics. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its enduring appeal and the lasting impact it has had on the gaming landscape.",1708536522,1708536522,True,1,0,0.525139689445495605,0,True,False,False

A lot of bugs have been patched out, & there are no more cheesy exploits in both Story mode & the Online version. The Online version of the game is feels more like a Saints Row game than a ""GTA"" game, It isn't what it used to be, no innovative content is being added, when a new update comes out the developers just uses the same old buildings & asset flips the same interiors rather than making something new from scratch. I know it takes a lot of resources & effort to make something from scratch but they reuses the same interiors every time they get a chance & the OG players know it, which is unacceptable for a studio like R*. Plus the developers actually doesn't care about the PC players of the game & continues to prioritize the new-gen console players by making GTA+ membership console-exclusive, which is quite the disadvantage for the PC players.

Are you having a hard time finding a baby sitter?

Are you tired of giving your kids attention?

WELL SHUT THE FRONT DOOR, YOU BEAUTIFUL B!TCH!

Why not try a GTA game? This one is the latest and it's HOT HOT HOT!

You're children will, LITERALLY, never bother you again!

Forget trying to get child support from ALL those other baby dadies; GTA 5 will take care of your kids like no one else will. And that's not just because, literally, no one else will.

Need a strong male role model in their life?

Say the FUDGE no more!

GTA 5 offers three to choose from and they come in wild variety of either black or not black at all!

Need more male role models like you need more men in your life?

Well, Karen, I've got some news for you; and it's not even fake! I swear, YOU CAN TRUST ME!

When Those standard male role models from the base game become old news, just like their real fathers; why not try [ONLINE MODE]!

It'll be like a new dad EVERY DAY! Those little buggers might even bond with a fellah!

There are so many to choose from, too.

All that your little tykes will need is a headset so they can talk to, possible, FUTURE DAD!

Not only will that new headset establish vocal communications with dads one through infinity; but it will also teach them valuable social skills.

Karen... I know what you're thinking.

One day, my kids will get older. How will I get rid of them faster?

Say no more, you glamorous manager seeker!

GTA 5 will also teach your little ones how to effectively drive anything from a small car to anything else that moves at very effective, moving away from you, speed.

Also, Karen, I assume that's your name because it's beautiful, Karen; your kids will learn how to defend themselves!

No one want's a sissy, right? Well that doesn't even matter when the caliber is super effective!
*Disclaimer- GTA 5 is hands down ineffective at teaching self defense skills against cougars.

But you already knew that, right? Cause YOU'RE a cougar. 

And hey, Karen... What's stopping you from taking that headset and getting a few D's, huh?
You know what I mean, Karen. THOSE DAD D'S.

Karen, you're a busy woman, we at GTA 5 know this. We are HERE, when YOU are ready.

Hit us up any time and don't forget to ask about that shark card.

All those dads just love it!

One last thing, Karen; are you interested in having your little tykes becoming a future programmer?

PLEASE, PLEASE, Karen; don't forget to ask about our special Modding program.

It's currently through the roof!

Everyone, and I mean everyone is going CRAZY about it!

Anyway, I'm sure we'll hear from you soon. Did I mention what a great rack you have?",1701154207,1708526146,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Ever since they added the Invite Only enhancement to gameplay I really enjoy online now. Takes me longer in the short run to get what I want but in the long run its quicker and easier then in a crowded server full of screw-offs, trolls, and hackers.

This once again proves that even though humans are social creatures, we can do really well by ourselves

OLD REVIEW:
The story gameplay and plot are amazing.

The Online, not so much. Rockstar has continued to make things more outrageously priced and they are making it impossible to afford the flashy stuff without buying Shark Cards. They also added a bunch of troll quality vehicles like the Oppressor Mk. II which is constantly used to hassle people without the money to afford something like that or people who are trying to just make money.

Unfortunately there is no real sane thinking behind all of this beside greediness on Rockstar's part.

Steam should really just refuse to carry games with outside launchers, have a problem with almost every single one.

Edit: Finally got it working last night, played for 8 hours - today the launcher wouldn't work again. I rebooted and tried a few times,got it to launch, and the game says I don't own it now.

My first time online,  all of a sudden money started appearing in my pocket out of nowhere.  So I put $850,000 in the bank, bought an apartment with a huge garage, and when I went into the apartment, a cage appeared over me, I couldn't do anything, I was stuck in a cage.   I logged out and didn't  log back in till yesterday.  I had to go through this email verification thing  to get my game to work, then  I begin online play.  I still have my expensive apartment, but no cage!! wonderful right?? I thought so too.  Anyway I'm playing, get a few cars I like in my garage, then right before an event as I'm hiding from the police, I get teleported to the middle  of the ocean because an event was about to start.  Something tells me one guy was teleporting everyone to the ocean so that he could win said event.  Still broken online play after all these years and that account verification garbage.

GTA online is one the buggiest shitty games that i have played. It can be really fun to play with friends as most games. But as a solo experience or with randoms it's usually awful, the freeroam is packed with assholes shooting you with flying BS bikes with homing missiles (Still bullshit even if it was nerfed). Or worse you have the hackers that can either be amusing and do fun things or as most of the time just assholes that wants your private information. Rockstar has also forgotten the PC version as when the next gen version for PS5 and Series X came out those upgrades did not come to PC.

(if you want a quick review just skip to the conclusion)

Story Mode:
In my opinion the campaign in this game is the best out of the entire GTA franchise. The missions are just perfect. All the prominent characters have at least some form of development. Each mission is unique however there are a few boring filler missions but you have to accept that out of any AAA game. And it balances it out almost perfectly with action packed missions straight afterwards. The single player doesn't end at the campaign either. There are still hundreds of side missions and activities to keep you occupied so you can work towards achieving 100% completion. One thing I have noticed as a downgrade from other games in the franchise is the lack of single player activities to complete after achieving 100%. On my ps4 version of GTA V where I have around 4000-5000 hours and 100% completion I find myself struggling to keep myself occupied in single player. However in other GTA games such as GTA4 there were loads of activities to do apart from the main missions and side missions. I suppose that was because the GTA4 multiplayer was no where near as developed as GTAV's which brings me perfectly onto my GTA Online review.

Online:
Now where to start? How to start? Well exactly that's what most GTA Online beginners ask themselves when they first load into a session. Nowadays the game pretty much just throws you into it without any real advice or even basic knowledge its pretty much just Lamar going ""Oh yeah and here's a pistol, don't die and get money."" Which isn't very helpful for a knew player especially when most of the lobbies are ridden with griefers razzing round on flying motorbikes and kids who have just figured out how to download a mod menu on mummies new PC. The reason why most players end up getting a mod menu is because of how hard earning money in this game is. Rockstar (Who made the game) make it as hard as possible to make money and just throw shark cards (The form of micro transactions within the game) at your face leaving them as the only option. Moving onto the more positive side the open world aspect of it is amazing. Being able to just drive around and chill in your hard earned cars in a private session is a sense of freedom not many other online games have been able to say they have achieved. The cars are pretty sweet. What did piss me off was when Rockstar removed half the old epic vehicles from the in game stores. They seem to be pumping out a lot more car updates nowadays which is cool but the prices of the vehicles is ridiculous. Like what Toyota corolla is going to be sold for 1.5 mil irl???? But on the other end of the scale what brand new high end military technology VTOL Jet is going to be sold to some random guy for 5 mil. The perception of money in this game is a bit warped if you couldn't already tell anyways here is the conclusion.

Conclusion:
Buy for story mode. Don't buy for online. Its as simple as that, if you have never played single player before this game is worth every penny. But if you are buying for online and think online is some amazing incredible game it is far from it. If you buy it to play story mode and after you have completed it you want to check out online then that's a great idea rather then you hopping straight into an online session only to come out thinking its a shit game and uninstalling it from your steam library. If you read to the end then congratulations because I don't think anyone is reading all this",1708427588,1708427588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most will not bother you if you don't bother them, however some will actively spawn kill you until you quit the game. Rockstar either genuinely doesn't care about the people abusing mods or are too short staffed to prevent them.

There are also countless unnecessarily difficult mechanics which just make the online experience a bit of a drag (having to buy snacks one at a time, having to constantly return to shops/ammunations for snacks and armour, having to call mors mutual even when the cost to replace a vehicle is free, having to travel to select areas for specific vehicles you may have purchased to spawn, being unable to access the pause menu while loading between sessions, being forced into public lobbys after finishing missions or heists, etc). Despite all of this, I still enjoy it and will continue to.

However, the main source of love I have for GTA V is it's story mode. 100% recommend playing it, some minor glitches aside I absolutely believe it's a 10/10 experience. It gives nice, understandable introduction of core game mechanics for new or unfamiliar players, and leaves ample space to challenge experienced players. Franklin, Micheal and Trevor are iconic and their unique abilities make them incredibly fun to use. How the story ends is left up to the player to decide, with three separate endings to encourage a second or third playthrough.",1708423637,1708423637,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you want the single player experience, go ahead and buy it, and enjoy it.  However if you want to play online, I struggle to recommend it.  Heres the reason why.

GTA Online PC is infested with modders.  Every lobby you will join, will have at least one modder, weather you know it or not.  Rockstar really neglects their games on PC and thats no secret.  These modders make the game borderline unplayable. They can do things such as teleport everyone, explode everyone, lock you in cages, spam spawn massive vehicles causing lag, godmode, and even more devious examples where they can crash your game (which will happen more than you think it will).  These are just the few examples.  It really sucks because sometimes it feels like the majority of players are modders, or people who worship modders.  For new players, you can expect to be targeted more frequently by modders as well.

You might be thinking ""why not just play on a closed lobby?"", well as of recently, modders have been infesting those as well somehow.  From my experience, every closed lobby ive recently played has had a modder in it.  They will not show up on the player list, but you can still spot them running around or find evidence of them, in the form of random vehicle spawns; a recent example I had being abunch of trains spawned in the city streets.

What has rockstar done about this very known problem? Well they made it slightly more difficult for modders to spawn in cash... because thats the main way R* makes their money through micro transactions.  For any new players reading this thinking ""oooo free gta money!"", grabbing said money can ban your account (if its alot of money), and is one of the only few ways to get banned.

Anyways, ill continue to play and try to enjoy the game, but its for this massive reason that I cant really recommend this game to any of my friends.",1708372678,1708376263,False,2,0,0.510375380516052246,0,True,False,False

Here is how your playing experience will go:
1) You log in and make a character. Then grind for hours to get property and businesses
2) You pay property taxes, employees salaries etc., all in all from 7k/in-game day up. You run out of money
3) You are broke and since there is no passive income you have to GO GET A JOB

Seriously folks, just skip the first 2 steps and go straight for the 3rd.

--- 500+ hours later ---
They have added a passive income source with the arcade.  
Basically arcade money will bail you out from the daily charges, if you want to do nothing at all.
And if u are up for 20 mins work, u can sell night club goods for 1 mill 

However, queues, blood feuds and hold-ups are still awful and it is honestly less of a 20 mins in and out dip and more of a Varus give me back my Sunday deal.
700 hours in, deleting it (for good?) despite the looming island update. 
Miss GTA IV pre station wipe. *Sigh*

--- 2024 ---
The game has finally been fixed. 
1. You now have a viable beginner's business (Acid lab)
2. Many businesses, such as Autoshop, Bunker, Office and Biker club now offer viable 5 missions for beginners (10 k pay per minute, 5 minutes total delivery missions)
3. You can finally host a private session, that loads fast(er) and has no griefers, so you can sell your business without fear of loosing many days of grind
4. You can finally earn enough passive income to cover all the expenses thanks to introduction of Agency on top of Arcade on top of Night Club
Ladies and gentlemen, GTA ONLINE IS FINALLY GOOD

Oompa, Loompa, Doompa-do-dee, if you've got time, you'll listen to me.

It all started back in 2015 on my nephews birthday party.
It was late at night for me at the time and he started up Grand Theft Auto.
I was amazed by the endless possibilities. the graphics looked beautiful on his PS4 and everything looked so detailed.
from that point I started my hunt to acquire the game myself. I bought a copy online, and when it finally arrived, I installed it on my playstation 4 and launched it. 
the loading time felt like hours. I played soccer in the backyard with my brother while waiting.
The opening scene wasn't what I expected but when I got the hang of it I found it very enjoyable
I did mission after mission after mission until tragedy struck. I had accidentally skipped a cutscene and now I'm stuck in a mission with a submarine. I could'nt skip the mission because it was impossible to die in the scene, and the cutscene would'nt replay when I restarted the game. I could'nt even find an answer on reddit. so I did what every like minded person would do. quit. and just play director mode for a whole year.
in 2018 I started GTA online, I sucked at it but it was enjoyable with my friends. I never really tried making money. just have fun in an invite only lobby. 
then in 2020 tragedy struck once again (yes I did not make any progress in story mode or try to make money in online) My playstation crashed and all my things were wiped, including story mode. 
while I was sad that my Minecraft worlds were gone (with some backups remaining). The story mode wipe was probably one of the better things to happen. because now I can finally play story mode again (I know I could have just restarted manually but I was too stupid it the time). now that I was a smarter version of me I actually understood the lore, and the hidden jokes/ easter eggs. I still spent a long time doing it because, I didn't play as much. mostly evenings since the rest of my time was still spent messing around with friends, and gaming on my laptop which I believe I got around this time. my only source on that is remembering playing minecraft in online class. 
around 2021 I finally started looking at money making methods in GTA online and started grinding my CEO office for... an opressor Mark II with the terrorbyte. I guess that was the best choice at the time, but now that the Sparrow and kasatka are a thing I don't think it's worth it. 
I started grinding CEO office. again looking back I should have bought a hangar but hey silly me. I made decent money. and when it came out, bought a kasatka. failing the Cayo Perico heist over and over (idk why cuz now I can do it in 20 minutes. still working on the elite challange) giving up and well I quit for another 5 months.
I lost friends I made new friends and finally bought the sparrow and not soon after a hangar.
these were the best 2 purchases I've ever made. and I used the hangar as a main source of money for a while completely ignoring all other businesses I had (my nightclub and my warehouse should've been running while I was grinding for passive income) 
The last thing I did on my ps4 was fail the Cayo heist with my friend again

4 weeks ago I bought this game on sale for my laptop and having a lot of fun with it. I used the knowledge I gained from my PS4 and made sure to not make the same mistakes again. kinda failed that by purchasing a nightclub early game instead of saving a little bit for the kasatka or the hangar with my free CEO office from the criminal enterprise pack. and this is where I'm at now Feb 9th 2024

As a player who has immersed myself in the chaotic and enthralling landscapes of Los Santos, GTA V continues to stand as a masterpiece that effortlessly blends a gripping narrative, diverse gameplay, and a meticulously detailed sandbox.

The first thing that strikes any player is the sheer scale and attention to detail in the world of Los Santos. The fictional city mirrors the vibrancy and diversity of real-life Los Angeles, with sprawling urban landscapes, serene beaches, and expansive countryside. The level of detail, from bustling city streets to the tranquil depths of the Pacific, creates an immersive and believable environment that sets a new standard for open-world design.

The narrative is a standout feature, weaving together the stories of three distinct protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber seeking redemption; Franklin, an ambitious young hustler looking to escape his rough upbringing; and Trevor, a volatile and unhinged criminal with a penchant for chaos. The seamless switching between characters adds a unique dimension to the storytelling, providing varied perspectives on the criminal underworld of Los Santos.

GTA V's storytelling is complemented by its satirical take on contemporary society, tackling themes of greed, corruption, and the pursuit of the American Dream. The writing is sharp, filled with humor and social commentary that adds depth to the characters and the world they inhabit. The performances of the voice actors, particularly Steven Ogg as Trevor, bring these characters to life with an authenticity rarely seen in gaming.

The gameplay in GTA V is a triumph of variety, offering an extensive range of activities beyond the main story missions. Heists, a central mechanic, stand out as high-stakes, multi-part missions that require careful planning and execution. The seamless transition between action-packed heists and more relaxed pastimes like tennis or golf showcases the game's versatility.

The online multiplayer component, Grand Theft Auto Online, further extends the game's longevity. The multiplayer world is a dynamic playground for criminal enterprises, offering a wealth of missions, races, and cooperative activities. The continuous support and updates from Rockstar have kept the online community engaged, introducing new content and events to explore with friends or adversaries.

Graphically, GTA V has aged remarkably well, especially with the enhancements made for current-generation consoles and PC. The character models, cityscapes, and lighting effects contribute to a visually striking experience, maintaining a level of detail that holds up even years after its initial release.

While GTA V is an undeniable triumph, it's not without its criticisms. The narrative, while compelling, may be divisive for some players, and the over-the-top satire may not resonate with everyone. Additionally, the expansive world can feel overwhelming, with occasional pacing issues in the storytelling.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V remains a tour de force in the gaming landscape, setting the gold standard for open-world design, narrative complexity, and gameplay variety. Its enduring popularity and continuous updates in Grand Theft Auto Online attest to its cultural impact and the ongoing relevance of this crime epic. For those seeking an immersive, boundary-pushing experience, GTA V stands as a testament to Rockstar's ability to redefine the possibilities of interactive entertainment.",1594776826,1708301718,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

Online is unplayable and a complete joke. You will be griefed by someone cheating/hacking/modding at least 9/10 times. I seen the salvage update and thought I'd revisit so I could try just mindlessly working as a tow-truck driver. Same gongshow I dealt with 4 years ago. 

It is so stupid. Why are you updating a game, charging micro-transactions, when players are fully exploiting the game, making it a terrible experience for everyone. They're getting IP information they shouldn't be. It isn't fun in the slightest. On top of that, I'll just speak on the original design of the online. It's an experience that you get currency through online PVE that is constantly being harassed by PVP playstyle. You are always in a death-match when it comes to making money efficiently, and any player can steal time from you. Even if when you outplay them, they will be in the advantage to hunt you down and stop you from completing missions.

The cheaters can be dodged. But you have to use literally use your PC's management to lag out your connection and get thrown in an ""online"" lobby with no one in it. And this is only a temporary fix, you'll eventually be forced into public interaction again. You shouldn't have to do this. Especially considering the earlier years, the online economy was an eternal grindfest/timesink trying to torture you into giving into transactions, and punished you for playing solo. They made it a lot better nowadays, but the cheaters still make online a horrific experience despite a decade of the game being out. 

It's pathetic, glad they dropped the price of the game, I unfortunately paid double what they charge now, and paid for some microtransactions like a fool. This problem should be known to players if they cannot fix it, it is slimy to continue to advertise patches and not address this problem when it is literally killing the online content. 

I regret trying to give this game a chance again. It has great fun online moments but, the frustration isn't worth it in the long run.",1708300647,1708300647,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the digital exodus through the streets of Los Santos, GTA emerges as a modern-day parable, where players traverse like nomads through a wilderness of vice and virtue. With controllers as staffs, they part the waves of traffic, a modern Moses leading the pixelated flock.

As players steal cars akin to chariots of old, they navigate the cityscape with the wisdom of Solomon, facing moral dilemmas akin to those of Job. Yet, like Joseph interpreting dreams, they rise from the pits of adversity to the pinnacles of power.

But as the Psalmist warns in Psalm 73:6, ""Therefore pride is their necklace; they clothe themselves with violence."" In this digital Sodom, let players beware, for amidst the chaos lies a cautionary tale echoing through the ages.

GTA: Sin City Serenade beckons players to ponder their own moral compass amidst the frenzy of pixels and polygons, a digital pilgrimage where every action echoes the eternal struggle between sin and salvation.",1708274818,1708274818,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GTA 5 is like this epic single-player journey through Los Santos, where you play as three badass homies hustling their way through life. The story's lit, the characters are on point, and the gameplay's off the chain.

Then you got GTA Online, which is like the multiplayer version of that same crazy world. It's all about linking up with your crew, causing chaos, and stacking that cash. Racing, heists, customizing your gear – it's all there, and it's all dope.

Both games got their own vibe, but if you're into living that thug life and tearing up the streets, you can't go wrong with either one.""",1708257242,1708257242,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Either you love GTA or you don't care for GTA. Nothing wrong with the latter, and if you are the former you've probably bought this game at least twice.

Great game with excellent production, magnificent music, good story (if a little bit shonky at times - the franchise has had better stories, admittedly), outdated political views that don't necessarily look so great now, and perhaps the most responsive and iterated gameplay since any GTA, ever.

If you picked up GTA V for one thing (the music, the visuals, the immersive world, etc) it would be an embarrassment of riches for that alone. The fact it crams all this into one game is outstanding.

Everyone who worked on this game, from the tiniest of details to the overall systems should be incredibly proud of themselves. GTA V is a hell of an achievement.",1708252995,1708252995,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

So every time we do a mission or a heist we have to spend ten minutes reconnecting everyone.

Not only that, but the game's controls are miserable and slippery to handle; even something as simple as leaving cover is a miserable chore. Any other game when you're against a wall, you pull away from it, or go to the edge of cover and push the same direction, and you pop off - but this seems to have the worst time realizing 'oh, the player wants to walk away'. The cars are greased up and control like you're butter on a hot grill - I seriously doubt real cars behave the way some of these cars do (and even so, why? It's not fun). The aircraft controls being bound to WASD and 8456 on the numpad too, what? Why not make it based on the mouse for pitch an yaw?

We did a mission where we needed to get a jet, one with veritcal liftoff, when you hold G to switch to thrust mode. Okay cool. I get in the jet, lift off, then hold G, my thrust turns on, and I go face-down right into another jet failing the mission immediately.

This game is not fun, this game is overhyped AAA slop with more problems than my parents' marriage. The game is successful only because of the name and memes.

For instance, the changes made to Cayo perico... Rockstar just loves to change the good into the bad, never the opposite. If something is good don't f*cking touch it, is it that hard to understand? Imagine a game where guards can spot dead bodies, and you have no power to hide them or anything of the sort, the stealth system in gta is the funniest joke ever and shouldn't even be a thing if Rockstar can't or doesn't know how to make it work.

Console GTA V currently features additional things that the pc version doesn't, animals, a photo event and the Park Ranger vehicle which I really wished for after so much hype about it, here's another negative point to the list until it's released to PC, thanks Rockstar.

The Casino features are blocked in my country, unfair RP + Cash advantage by players in other countries compared to mine, not even the wheel works, thus i'm marking this as another negative point.

Gta Online was good once, but no longer is, I keep trying but this game is probably one of the most frustrating games I've ever played, it fails at just about all aspects of enjoyment that a game should provide.

Cop outfits are restricted and it's 100% on choice by Rockstar.

In short if you want to play a game that drains you and makes you feel stressed and terrible, you've come to the right place, the online side of this game just keeps getting worse instead of better, unless you're on console of course.",1505159532,1708205570,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,9,True,False,False

*Update*
So, it turns out you can skip a mission if you fail it enough times, so that's not a problem.

The only complaint I have is for Story Mode. Eventually, I got to a point where it feels half finished, like it is trying to force me into Online, which made Story Mode feel like a long intro to Online.

It gets odd, where my guy Franklin is a Billionaire, but still lives at home with his mom in the hood. I seriously hope GTA 6 Story Mode gets more love.",1707063878,1708183855,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Introduction:
Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) remains a juggernaut in the gaming industry, defining the open-world genre with its sprawling map, complex characters, and dynamic gameplay. Released to critical acclaim and commercial success, it's a testament to Rockstar Games' ability to craft immersive experiences that keep players engaged for hours on end. In this review, we'll explore the depth and excitement that GTA V offers, while also examining some of its shortcomings.

Vibrant and Immersive World:
Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, GTA V's world is a vibrant and bustling landscape teeming with life. From the urban sprawl of Los Santos to the picturesque countryside and sandy beaches, every inch of the map feels meticulously crafted and alive. The attention to detail is staggering, with pedestrians going about their daily lives, traffic flowing through the streets, and countless activities to discover around every corner. Whether you're cruising through the city in a stolen car, parachuting from a helicopter, or exploring the underwater depths in a submarine, the world of GTA V is a playground of endless possibilities.

Compelling Narrative and Characters:
At the heart of GTA V is its gripping narrative and memorable characters. The game follows the intertwining stories of three protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber trying to escape his past; Franklin, a street-smart hustler looking for opportunities; and Trevor, a volatile sociopath with a penchant for chaos. Their paths cross and diverge in unexpected ways, leading to a series of heists, betrayals, and adrenaline-fueled adventures. The writing is sharp and witty, with dialogue that crackles with humor and personality. Each character is fully realized and layered, with their own motivations, flaws, and arcs that unfold over the course of the game.

Rich Gameplay Variety:
GTA V offers a staggering amount of gameplay variety, with a plethora of activities and missions to undertake. Whether you're engaging in high-speed car chases, engaging in shootouts with rival gangs, or embarking on elaborate heists, the game never fails to deliver excitement and thrills. The heist missions, in particular, are a highlight, allowing players to plan and execute elaborate robberies with a level of strategic depth rarely seen in gaming. Beyond the main storyline, there are countless side activities to enjoy, from playing golf and tennis to participating in street races and hunting for hidden collectibles. The sheer amount of content ensures that there is always something new to discover and experience in the world of GTA V.

Online Multiplayer:
In addition to its single-player campaign, GTA V offers an expansive online multiplayer mode known as GTA Online. Here, players can create their own custom characters and embark on a variety of missions, heists, and activities with friends and strangers alike. From engaging in cooperative missions and races to competing in deathmatches and customizing their own properties and vehicles, GTA Online offers endless opportunities for multiplayer mayhem and mischief. With regular updates and content additions keeping the experience fresh and exciting, GTA Online has become a thriving community of players from around the world.

Drawbacks:
Despite its many strengths, GTA V is not without its flaws. The game's story can feel disjointed at times, with the three protagonists' narratives occasionally lacking cohesion. Some players may also find the game's portrayal of violence and crime to be off-putting or excessive, particularly in light of real-world events. Additionally, the game's online multiplayer mode can be plagued by server issues and technical glitches, leading to frustrating experiences for players trying to connect and play with friends.

Conclusion:
Overall, Grand Theft Auto V stands as a modern masterpiece of gaming, offering a vast and immersive world filled with excitement, intrigue, and endless possibilities. With its vibrant setting, compelling narrative, and rich gameplay variety, it's a game that continues to captivate players years after its initial release. Despite its flaws, GTA V remains a shining example of Rockstar Games' ability to create compelling, immersive experiences that push the boundaries of interactive entertainment. Whether you're a fan of the series or a newcomer to the world of Los Santos, GTA V is an experience not to be missed.",1708104745,1708104745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2023 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he joined me in online. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Also I'm not sure why do I get teleported to a public server after I complete a join a heist or mission from my invite -only/crew session. I have to keep joining new session for that reason.

This time: I have to quit out of the game to collect my Nightclub Stash. It's small crap but it's noticeable every single time.

CEO Mission: Reward: 1 Crate valued at $10000 - $2000 for the finder's fee (This is supposed to be a legit business by the way, why am I doing criminal things?)
What the mission is: (It varies but here's a good example of what it takes to earn $10000 the way the Devs thought would be nifty)

Go 1 mile to this location, pick up satchel charges.
Go another 3 miles to the edge of the map to get on a dinghy.
Take that dinghy .5 miles out to sea (by now you're getting attacked by people on boats and in helicopters)
Dive underwater and blow up crates until you can find the crate you need. 
Take that crate however many miles back to your warehouse.
PS You don't get the money yet, that was just getting the product. Getting the money requires another god awful mission.

Sidenote: Throwing a guy out of your nightclub nets you $10000 immediately and you don't have to go anywhere.

PS: Online servers are completely screwed because no one is keeping up with taking care of people abusing mods.

What a fucking joke. I don't know why I still play but probably because every other AAA studio is just as trash and every other title out there bearing any resemblance to this one comes up short or is just as hacky and half-assed.",1707548080,1708023365,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GTA5 Is a game that is a story based open world shooter, The story is okay but isnt exactly amazing with many things not making sense, the gameplay is mediocre but is a complete downgrade compared to max payne 3 in nearly everyway, driving is alright but is more arcade like compared to 4, The city is nice and feels lived in better than 4.

Thats really where the only slightly postive things i have to say about this game end, with the online ruining everything that tried to make up for it, the online is unplayable with modders cheaters and micro transactions ruining everything, the community is terrible.

Grand Theft Auto V stands as an enduring testament to Rockstar Games' unparalleled ability to create immersive open-world experiences. In the years since its release, GTA V continues to captivate with its dynamic gameplay, rich narrative, and an expansive sandbox that is as thrilling as it is diverse.

The first thing that strikes you is the sprawling city of Los Santos – a meticulously crafted playground that feels alive and bustling with activity. The attention to detail in the architecture, diverse neighborhoods, and realistic NPC behaviors contributes to a living, breathing world that begs to be explored.

The narrative is a gripping tale of crime, loyalty, and the pursuit of the almighty dollar. The three protagonists bring a unique flavor to the story, each with their own quirks and motivations. The seamless switch between characters adds a layer of depth to the gameplay, ensuring that every mission feels fresh and dynamic.

The variety of activities and side missions in GTA V is staggering. Whether you're indulging in high-stakes heists, enjoying a round of golf, or diving into the seedy underworld of Los Santos, there's always something to do. The sheer scale and diversity of the open world keep the experience from ever feeling stale.

The driving mechanics and vehicle variety are a highlight, offering a satisfying blend of realism and arcade-style fun. From sleek sports cars to monstrous trucks, each vehicle has its own unique feel, making exploration and high-speed chases a thrill.

The addition of GTA Online has transformed the game into a living, breathing online metropolis. The constant updates, heists, and the freedom to create your criminal empire with friends ensure that the multiplayer component is a game in itself, offering endless hours of entertainment.

Rockstar's commitment to ongoing support is commendable. Regular updates, new content, and optimizations demonstrate their dedication to keeping the GTA V experience fresh and enjoyable for both new and returning players.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a timeless masterpiece that continues to set the standard for open-world gaming. Rockstar Games has crafted an experience that seamlessly blends gripping storytelling, diverse gameplay, and a living, breathing world that keeps players coming back for more. Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, GTA V is a must-play for anyone seeking an unparalleled open-world adventure. 🌆🚗💰🌟",1708006657,1708006657,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

That being said, for a lot of people, the online mode was the main draw on release.
It's essentially a giant sandbox in which you can do crime-related jobs, but mostly just mess around, get into random shootouts with other players, etc.
Over the years, DLC got added with more and more aggressive incentives to spend real-life money on cars, properties and sci-fi military equipment.

Makes you rip your hair out sometimes, and sometimes it's chill just driving in the nicely constructed map. Game kicks you from your own lobby if you keep the game minimised for about a minute or two to reply to messages...time it. Also a lot of modders unfortunately. Here's a list of some I've encountered:

- gta5_noob (Invisibility and Godmode, Killing randoms with mods)

- Bones (Godmode Fighter Jet, Killing randoms with mods)

- onuroemeryavuz ('Superman Jumps', Godmode, Godmode Jet, Teleportation, Killing randoms with mods) When telling them I recorded the whole thing, they replied with ""I don't care I can just make a new account and do it again"".

- VamiVamp (Teleporting everyone to one location, then exploding them. Godmode.)

- Lowkeysss (Godmode oppressor bike)

- ReportMyAss (Godmode, modding speed of oppressor and jets to make them far faster than any legit customised vehicle. Has modder friends in friends list also. They play the game as a little modder family going round in godmoded flying motorbikes, cute <3)

- 1_Elias_1 (Flying a jet that somehow has 9 other jets attached to it, godmoding these jets and flying around griefing people with these exploits)

- plewek09999 (Godmode, killing players in godmode with rpg-ak47, an ak with rpg rounds...)

- DeShaQViews (Godmode, Duplicating me, putting a fireplace on others in order to kill them, showed me modded vehicles, editing the map)

- Tokio936-FR (Godmoding on oppressor mk 2, infinite invisibility, exploit killing players on map, insists he is russian for some reason)

- TimeLapse707 (""TimeLapse707 has invited you to their apartment"" then my game proceeded to give me this message on a black screen with an infinite loading screen therefore I had to quit the game as usual. I'm not sure if TimeLapse707 is the actual modder, or whether a modder has disguised themselves by making it look like TimeLapse707 modded me. Either way he is suspect as it shouldn't give you a black infinite loading screen...it should just notify you on your phone.)

- ILuv2Liv (Godmoding Valkyrie and allowing people to kill everyone on the lobby with it. Whole lobby was spamming rockets on the heli and it didn't even scratch)

- SilentWolf72770 (Godmode jet. When I called them out, they said ""It's just a glitch""...later he crashed the jet into the side of a building and the jet didn't even scratch. He got out and was godmoding on foot after).

- Queen [probably changed their name using client side name editor] (Spawning in stupid amounts of vehicles to crash people from the server. We'll rename it to Karen.)

- WavyRevive (Using godmode and teleportation to kill people with explosive bullets from minigun. Targeting people who are fighting eachother...this is the kind of modder who thinks they're some sort of online white knight/saviour to the people stopping pvp, a main ingredient in GTA lol I wonder who will save them from the ban)

Rockstar has no interest in fixing mod menu abuse in public lobbies, has had no interest in doing so in 10 years, and it's only gotten worse over the years. Bright side, you can now do most jobs in invite only lobbies, kinda. If you like playing ""online"" offline that's a solution I guess. Getting into a public lobby, it's only a matter of time before someone spam kills you or crashes your game. Usually mid job. Other than private lobbies, your only real solution is to get a mod menu yourself and out-cheat the cheaters, which isn't exactly what I would call a fun use of your time.

From sun-soaked beaches to gritty urban alleys, the visuals capture the essence of Los Angeles-inspired Los Santos.

Gameplay:
The gameplay of GTA V is a perfect blend of action, exploration, and mayhem. Players can switch between three protagonists, each with their own distinct personalities and storylines, adding depth to the narrative. Whether engaging in adrenaline-pumping heists, participating in street races, or simply causing chaos in the city streets, there's always something to do in GTA V.

Storyline:

The narrative explores themes of crime, greed, and betrayal as players navigate the criminal underworld of Los Santos. With multiple endings and branching missions, the story offers ample replay value, ensuring players will want to return to uncover every hidden secret.

Multiplayer:

From cooperative heists to chaotic free roam sessions, the multiplayer mode offers endless opportunities for collaboration and competition.

Conclusion:
Grand Theft Auto V continues to stand as a masterpiece of gaming, offering a vast and immersive world ripe for exploration and adventure. With its stunning graphics, engaging gameplay, compelling storyline, and robust multiplayer mode, it's no wonder that GTA V remains a beloved classic among gamers worldwide. Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned fan, GTA V promises countless hours of entertainment and excitement.

Even though this game has been out for a long time, it's really fun, especially since games that are constantly being updated create a variety of new content to play online.

By the way, when playing online i meet someone there are lots of modders and cheaters in this online servers, therefore I suggest adding an anti-cheat to the game to reduce the number of modders and cheaters.

Right about now NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy motherfuckin' E
Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the motherfuckin' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothin' but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A Young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo
Beat a police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young nigga on a warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
Fuck the police (Example of scene one)
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident
Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a nigga so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin', ""Fuck you, punk""
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma fuck you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now, and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villian that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck the-, fuck the-
Fuck the police
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor!
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A sucka in a uniform waitin' to get shot
By me, or another nigga.
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin'
This is what I'll say
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-
Fuck the police, fuck-, fuck-
Fuck the police (The verdict)
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
Whitebread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie, that's a goddamn lie
Get him out of here (I want justice)
Get him the fuck out my face (I want justice)
Out, right now
Fuck you, you black motherfuckers
Fuck the police
Fuck the police

Years later, when I got a much better PC I fell in love with West Elizabeth and Lemoyne, spent about 350 hours on the single player alone, with a total of 3 playthroughs and 100% the whole thing, while RDO was kinda fun, Rockstar let me down for the first time, by leaving it to die in the mud.

Playing this game made me realize Rockstar doesn't really like the PC platform, yes, the story mode is one of the best there is, full of details, collectibles, an amazing and intriguing story, yada yada, everyone already knows GTA V, no use repeating what everyone else has said about it for the last 10 years, and it definitely deserves it's praise, yet Online has no anti-cheat and updates are delayed when they have been out for months in consoles.

I do recommend buying this game, everyone should get to know Trevor, Franklin and Michael, drive through the city of Los Santos, become a crazed gunman and take down hordes of enemies in a fit of rage, live a complicated life under the supposed shield of the witness protection program, GTA V is superb and that is the reason why this review is positive, because that experience outweighs the utter nonsense GTA Online is, along with a myriad of cheaters and spaghetti code like a friend once said.

For any achievement hunters out there, GTA V is fairly simple to complete, but Online is definitely a task, look up guides for the Doomsday related achievements because you're gonna need them, and be prepared for any randomness in the code that might ruin your run, it is possible with a group of dedicated players but will take some time.

In conclusion, if you haven't played GTA V for any reason, buy it immediately, it's a must play as you may have already heard from everyone else on the internet and feel free to try GTA Online but don't get your hopes up.",1707782632,1707782838,True,2,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

And now let's start from the beginning, from the distant 2019-2021, I then bought the game in their ""OFFICIAL"" launcher, the game was a very long time, and now I decided to return to the game after almost 3 years, and my game, like a copy of the PS3 GTA V, is already  not on my account, after a month of trying to prove that I had these games, they never returned anything to me

Now we return to 2024, when I finally decided to buy GTA V + DLC again, there was a very nice promotion for the product and I still decided to give a second chance to this company and the game, and as I wrote above, after the purchase I did not receive  its DLC, like many other players.
Now the results, the company that once aroused my delight, now only causes disgust, I do not advise anyone to get involved with this game, and I advise you to look for an analogue for your new “Legendary” part of GTA VI, I really don’t care.",1707772181,1707772181,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I payed for this hot mess, and i don't even have access to the damn game because of a random Rockstar account.

I can't recommend this mess if i am going to be stopped by a god damn online DRM. Either add an option to play this only in offline mode with no additional accounts, or just give people a refund who have been scammed.

My recommendation to anyone who wants to play this game is to just pirate it. Don't waste your money on Rockstar products that are locked behind a DRM, and for online users, well there are private servers.",1707687122,1707687122,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

But the fact you need 3rd party software to protect yourself from DDOS attacks, getting your IP leaked and now possibly even having corruption of your account data even in single-player or with the latest hacks, possible damage to your computer!?!

I can NOT recommend anyone purchasing this game unless they plan on solely playing FiveM which I assume most will be, thankfully!
If somehow the state of this game changes someday I will be happy to change my rating, but I'm not counting on that happening.

Well I first had to play the prologue which was one of the worst and most boring experiences I've ever had. It's most exaggerating to call the driving mechanisms car ""physics"". It has nothing to do with real physics. Gun handling is boring, the complete movement in-game is garbage. Never played another game feeling this clunky. 

The criminal enterprises pack never registered to my account, so it was just wasted Money. Same problem goes für the Great white shark card as well. Never could use it in online. Spend most of my time restarting and in loading screens trying to join a friends only lobby, which eventually worked, but as I didn't got what I paid for, I requested a refund and where very glad, when it got approved.

Developed by Rockstar Games, this crime epic stands as a towering achievement in interactive entertainment, offering players an unparalleled journey through the sprawling metropolis of Los Santos and beyond.

At its core, Grand Theft Auto V is a sandbox masterpiece, inviting players to explore a meticulously crafted open-world environment teeming with opportunities for mayhem and mischief. Whether you're cruising down the sun-drenched streets in a stolen sports car, embarking on a daring heist with your crew, or simply soaking in the sights and sounds of urban life, the game's unparalleled sense of freedom and immersion is truly unmatched.

But what truly sets Grand Theft Auto V apart is its narrative depth and character-driven storytelling. Set against the backdrop of a sprawling criminal underworld, the game weaves together the lives of three distinct protagonists – the ambitious career criminal Michael, the street-smart hustler Franklin, and the unhinged sociopath Trevor – in a gripping tale of greed, betrayal, and redemption. As you delve deeper into their intertwining stories, you'll find yourself drawn into a world of complex characters, moral ambiguity, and unexpected twists and turns.

Yet, Grand Theft Auto V's appeal extends far beyond its gripping narrative. With its vast array of activities and side missions, the game offers endless opportunities for exploration and discovery. Whether you're diving into the murky depths of the ocean in search of hidden treasures, perfecting your swing on the golf course, or participating in adrenaline-fueled street races, there's always something new and exciting to experience in the world of Los Santos.

Moreover, Grand Theft Auto V's online multiplayer mode, Grand Theft Auto Online, serves as a living, breathing extension of the game's single-player experience. Here, players can forge their own criminal empires, team up with friends to tackle heists and missions, or simply engage in chaotic open-world mayhem with players from around the globe. With its constantly evolving world, regular updates, and endless array of customization options, Grand Theft Auto Online offers a virtually limitless playground for players to explore and conquer.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is more than just a video game; it's a cultural phenomenon, a sprawling virtual world that beckons players to explore, create, and conquer. With its unparalleled sense of freedom, gripping narrative, and boundless multiplayer possibilities, it's a game that transcends boundaries and stands as a testament to the power of interactive entertainment. So whether you're a seasoned gamer or a newcomer to the series, Grand Theft Auto V is an experience that's not to be missed.

Good things:
 - Story
 - The world
 - Details
 - Online option
 - Missions
 - Some gameplay mechanics
 - Graphics that is for low - end pc and isnt lookin bad 
 - Multiple story endings
 - Music and soundtrack

For the story, you play not as one main protagonist, but as three. Not at once ofc, but you can pretty much change between them whenever you want.
The story is well writen and sometimes funny too. 
Plus as i said, there are multiple endings. 

For the world i can still say it holds up to this day. 
By that i mean the size and side missions, that can be random.
Not even talking about the random events that can happen when you are just drivin around. 
For example police chases or npc interactions. 

For the soundtrack, all i can say is that its good. It isnt like in Cyberpunk, when the developers hosted a competetion for music in the radio, but instead of that, Rockstar decided to just buy rights to some mainstream music. 
There are like over 20 radio stations with different genres, so you can be sure theres 100% something for you. 

For the online option i can clearly say that it can be basically all you want it to be thanks to the mods. 
You can also play on a random server with random people, or with a friend that can join your world.
That does not apply for the story mode tho. 

Bad things: 
 - Controls for aircrafts
 - Online Cheater problem

For the aircraft controls i think you will instantly notice that who created it, must have been high af because its very wierd and definitely not practical. 

The cheater problem isnt really gamebreaking tho, just dont play on random public servers and you are pretty much fine. 


Overall: 
I think its definitely worth it buying on sale for 15 euros or less. 
Maybe for the full price too, but iam not 100% sure to be honest.

Every single server in the game has at least 1 or 2 people who are either dropping thousands of trophies on your brand new account ruining the progression forever because suddenly youre rich and have everything and playing the game becomes completely meaningless. OR, and the far more common, the cheaters blow up all players on the map instantly over and over. or teleport all players into one spot to kill them all. Or trapping players in invisible boxes. You can press esc and jump to a new server, but it will have a cheater or two. Always. I've never seen any online supported game in my entire life with so much cheating. Literally half the community does it. Until Rockstar does something about it my review stays negative. I'l keep playing, maybe, I am losing interest really fast though. Your first hour of gameplay is always finding a playable server and 45 minutes of loading screens.

The other issue is that the game is incredibly easy to play with players who you don't know, and extremely difficult to play with people you do know. You have a hundred ways of entering jobs and heists but not if you want to bring a friend. You can queue solo, but not as a party. You can invite friends, but you cannot lock the lobby so that randoms cant fill it before your friend can join. My buddy and I wasted a FULL hour trying to do a heist together by quitting and remaking lobbies over and over and over until he finally got in before randoms did, and within 2 minutes of playing the actual heist a cheater crashed the servers by free flying a tank and shooting 100 rounds a second all around the map.

It's a fun game if you don't get irritated by the following three things.
Constant neverending cheaters. Not the fun kind either. 
More loading screens than gameplay. The ratio leans towards loading screens.
The worst co-op quest mechanics in any supported online game on the planet.",1481038129,1707497947,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After years pass of me playing this game, I realize the only good thing really is when you diverge from the main mission and have fist fights in the speeding highway. Some of these missions drag on so like it feels like a 10 gig game that cost 15 dollars and has mixed reviews. They do not need to be that long and straining. Still the times I had fun, I will never forget. GTA is a game that will forever live in your mind, no matter what games you play afterwards. But it will never hit the same it did when you had those good times. 
The main solo game itself has some good replay-ability. But? It’s also drags. The worst sin a game can commit, boredom.

My relationship with gta is weird. I wish steam wasn’t so split between just thumbs up and thumbs down, cause I would give this a middle thumb? I don’t know. It’s fantastic, but it also kinda sucks.

Unfair/predatory game practices
Buggy physics

GTA Online is a broken hellscape of griefers and hackers.

Even playing single player will not keep you safe. These issues seemingly cannot be dealt with by patches and hotfixes - this shit has been going on now for YEARS. YEARS!

Whilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.

Single Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. Even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.

A lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.

The driving is much easier than GTA 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in GTA 5 unless you have brain damage, but I guess it makes it more accessible, lol. Shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox.",1707435300,1707435300,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(9.4/10)

The multiplayer has a bunch of flaws though, which just have gotten worse over time. I haven't played in years but I remember loading into an online lobby usually took, when you were lucky 10-15 minutes without any errors but the constant money farming and the unbalanced vehicles is basically what killed the fun for me, it's like either pay for microtransactions or farm for multiple tens or hundreds of hours some GTA dollars to buy some (mostly) useless addon to your base, vehicle etc, for the majority just to have it easier to kill other online players, which is for the most part completly irrelevant. The heists were great fun, aswell as the custom gamemodes and races, with friends there was endless amounts of content and hours you could put into it, but for the heists you also had to do a bunch of farming before being able to do all of them.

Unfortunately that is bound to my steam account, so now I can't even play single player, let alone multiplayer, even if I was willing to completely start from scratch.  Still a great game, but very frustrated with Rockstar's ""integration"" choices.

Original Review: This game is a ton of fun.  The single player campaign is really good, and the open world keeps being interesting.  Playing with your friends is a blast, but the open multiplayer lobbies are hit and miss... you will commonly see maxed-out griefers, exploiters, and straight-up cheaters.",1704943946,1707333372,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Each session is rife with modders unleashing chaos, from spawning unlimited cash to trapping players in cages, ruining the experience for those trying to enjoy the game's rich online world.

The heart of the issue? Rockstar Games' seemingly indifferent stance towards this anarchy. The in-game report system, designed to curb such abuses, is disappointingly ineffective, with little evidence that reports lead to any action. This lax enforcement has only emboldened hackers, creating a toxic environment where they reign supreme with no fear of repercussions.

This negligence leaves players frustrated and questioning Rockstar's commitment to its community. Despite having the means to tackle these issues, there's a glaring lack of effort to safeguard the integrity of GTA Online. Until Rockstar takes decisive action against modders, players might find themselves better off exploring other gaming landscapes or sticking to the single-player mode. As it stands, GTA 5 Online is a testament to wasted potential in what could have been the ultimate online experience.",1707255259,1707255259,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Nine years later, Michael is living under witness protection with his family in Los Santos, under the alias Michael De Santa. Across town, gangbanger Franklin Clinton is working for a corrupt Armenian car salesman and meets Michael while attempting to fraudulently repossess his son's car; the two later become friends. When Michael finds his wife Amanda sleeping with her tennis coach, he and Franklin chase the coach to a mansion, which Michael destroys in anger. The owner turns out to be the girlfriend of Martin Madrazo, a Mexican drug lord who demands compensation to avoid further violence. Michael returns to a life of crime to obtain the money, enlisting Franklin as an accomplice. With the help of Michael's old friend Lester Crest, a disabled hacker, they perform a jewellery shop heist to pay off the debt. Trevor, who now lives in a trailer park on the outskirts of Los Santos, hears of the heist and realises that it was Michael's handiwork; Trevor had believed that Michael was killed in their botched robbery nine years ago. Trevor surprises Michael and reunites with him, after tracking down his home.

As time goes on, the personal lives of the protagonists begin to spiral out of control. Michael's increasingly disreputable behaviour prompts his family to leave him. When he becomes a movie producer at film studio Richards Majestic, Michael comes into conflict with Devin Weston, a self-made billionaire venture capitalist and corporate raider, who vows revenge after his attempts to shut down the studio are thwarted by Michael. Franklin, meanwhile, rescues his friend Lamar Davis from gangster and former friend Harold ""Stretch"" Joseph, who repeatedly attempts to kill Lamar to prove himself to his new brethren. At the same time, Trevor's reckless efforts to consolidate his control over various black markets in Blaine County see him waging war against The Lost outlaw motorcycle club, several Latin American street gangs, rival meth dealers, hillbillies, private security firm Merryweather, and Triad kingpin Wei Cheng.

Federal Investigation Bureau (FIB) agents Dave Norton and Steve Haines contact Michael and demand that he, Franklin, and Trevor perform a series of operations to undermine a rival agency, the International Affairs Agency (IAA).Under Steve's direction and with Lester's help, they attack an armoured convoy carrying funds intended for the IAA, and steal an experimental chemical weapon from an IAA-controlled lab. As Steve comes under increasing scrutiny, he forces Michael and Franklin to erase any evidence being used against him from the FIB servers. Michael takes the opportunity to wipe the data on his activities, destroying Steve's leverage over him.

Eventually, Michael, Trevor, Franklin, and Lester start planning their most daring feat ever: raiding the Union Depository's gold bullion reserve. By this time, Michael reconciles with his family. However, Trevor discovers that Brad was not imprisoned as led to believe, but killed during the Ludendorff heist and buried in the grave marked for Michael. Trevor's feelings of betrayal cause friction within the group and threaten to undermine their Union Depository plans. Steve betrays Michael and Dave, and they become caught in a Mexican standoff between the FIB, IAA, and Merryweather. Trevor, feeling that he is the only one who has the right to kill Michael, comes to their aid. Despite not forgiving Michael, Trevor agrees to perform the Union Depository heist and part ways with him afterwards.

The heist is completed successfully, but Franklin is then approached separately by Steve and Dave, who contend that Trevor is a liability, and Devin, who wants retribution for Michael's betrayal. Franklin has three choices: kill Trevor, kill Michael, or attempt to save both in a suicide mission. Should Franklin choose to kill either Michael or Trevor, he ceases contact with the man he spares and returns to his old life.Otherwise, the trio withstands an onslaught from the FIB and Merryweather before going on to kill Cheng, Stretch, Steve, and Devin. Michael and Trevor reconcile, and the three cease working together but remain friends.",1707251153,1707251153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing all of these since I was a pup. It took 29 hours without rushing, and the game said I was 65% complete holistically, if that helps you gauge if this is a time suck or not. Remember, this comment excludes online gameplay, which is the deep end of GTA.

I love the ability to switch between characters when you want a different gameplay style, get sick of the N-word or needless carnage and want to shift towards the type of energy you feel at that moment. Trevor ended up being my favourite, then Franklin, then Mikey, but all had fantastic, memorable, and pronounced distinctions that gave you a break from one another.

The game is an open world that allows you to do whatever you want. I played by the rules and just stuck to story and canon, and I can say it's a great comedy/action game with loads of funny conversations. I think driving so much will make me better at that, too. It's a 7 out of 10, and when leaning towards Red Dead Redemption, I'd choose RDR2—less chaotic without traffic and less argumentative dialogue. However, I could fly a plane and see the whole of Los Antos in missions in GTA and on a decent computer, it blew my mind and looked terrific.

I'll tell you what, though, in another life, say when I was 12 years old,  this game would have blown my mind, and I would just be running over people and trying to live while being chased by five stars and feeling fantastic rocking up hours enacting irrelevant carnage.

The graphics are sharp, and the characters are some of the best in any game. There was a time when the online mode was epic too.

It’s almost like they’re encouraging it by adding over-the-top vehicles that let people blow you up 23 times in a row without breaking a sweat. It was an amazing game, but playing online? You might want to stick to console for that. Plus, Rockstar's now throwing exclusive stuff at next-gen console players, kind of ignoring the die-hard fans who've stuck around through all the mess.

And then there's the actually unplayable content, so full of glitches that the most interesting part becomes ""Wow, I didn't know it could mess up like that""

Would I like to Update my review? yes, it gets worse. Rockstar support is unhelpful, tell you to do basic things and disable your entire firewall.

The latter means that the launcher is a buggy mess and the game fails to properly access the Rockstar Social Club profile that I was forced to create. Add on top of the fact that Rockstar has terrible technical support, along with aggressive microtransactions, and GTA Online is a recipe for frustration.

Update: Rockstar has apparently relegated the PC version to previous-gen. That means you will not receive new features available on next-gen consoles. Do not give Rockstar your money if you care about PC.",1432697564,1707070212,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Online is good content (a little repetitive for my taste but not too bad) and finally Rockstar have implimented a system that allows you to play the game without being constantly griefed, unfortunately as my friends have all moved on and playing solo is of limited fun value I still cant say this is worth your time, also personally my main aim was too build a collection of awesome cars and themed garages but with the cull of 190 vehicles this has put a serious dent in the potential fun I could get out of it, just constant L's for GTA5 online.",1580516440,1707069963,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The anti-AFK system is so trash, i alt tab for 30 seconds, i alt tab back, and i get kicked like bruh,
You get wanted level for literally walking, im just walking, or sometimes just standing still, and police just proceed to give u either 2-3 stars of wanted level, sometimes you are driving and a police car from the other side, proceeds to crash into you intentionally and u get wanted level for nothing, and also their aim is ridiculously insane, 
Also when u have for example, 1 star,  you try to escape, and let's say they lost you, and they are searching for you. They know exactly where you are even tho u lost them, and it takes 1 year for them to completely lose you.
The invites to your friends races, or sessions are sometimes failing, like my friend made a invite-only session, he invited me, AND the game procceds to tell me that its a private session and that i need to get invited, which i literally just did get invited, like wtf Rockstar

The world is huge, far bigger than the ones from previous games, trouble is, its incredibly empty. There isn't THAT much to do as one would expect.
Concept of having 3 playable characters wasn't done well as hoped,Michael and Trevor are alright,but Franklin is...side character who tries to put himself in the plot but fails.Most of Franklins missions are assasinations,that have literaly nothing to do with the main plot,Most of the missions in general are preparations for heists,and there are less heists which people had hoped,atleast there are much more heists in the online,if nothing.No matter how you play,you'll end up rich and you wont have to really work for that money too hard.After playing the storymode for the second time,lines became more cringe and i relized how little effort developers had put in the missions.
Perhaps my opinion will change after i play this game with friends,and if online turns out to be 10/10,well f*ck you dontrock,i really hoped story mode would be nice,but since all GTA games are pretty much overrated anyway,than it's my fault for not knowing better.",1586602092,1707029635,False,4,0,0.503496468067169189,0,True,False,False

Can I recommend GTA V? No I can not and there is a few simple reasons why.

1) Total grindfest: This game is nothing more than going from point A to point B trying to do missions to make money. That is the sole issue with online you do nothing but either kill players or walk around.

2) Cost: Everything online is overpriced as hell. Want to buy a simple car? Probably over a million, and if you want a ""good"" car that is going to cost you at least 2 million. If that wasn't bad enough there is no way in this game to make money that is actually reasonable. If you want to speed 12 hours of your day sitting around in GTA then you might be able to make a few million or so. But, that is not enough for the amount of effort you put into it.

3) Microtransactions: Not to much to say on this, this game is filled with them. A shark card for $100 should give the player way more than 8 million. It should give at LEAST 24 million. Because 8 million can be spent on 1 maybe 2 things in this game and then poof it is gone. Instead of trying to make the game more consumer friendly rockstar did the exact opposite and made it as hard as possible to earn money so it frustrates the player into buying shark cards.

TL;DR To grindy, has microtransactions, and everything in the game is over priced.




Update 2024:

So, most of my points are still holding even today in 2024. So, why am I changing this review to be positive over negative? Because the game [i]has[/i] gotten better from what it used to be. Well, what has changed you might ask? Simple really, the Cayo Perico heist. This heist alone can single handily change your whole perspective of this game. It's amazing for making money and super simple once you have it down. Sure, as of this review you can solo it with a 3 hour cooldown after completion but in that time you can do other things now besides crates. Air freight is an amazing way to make money that a lot of people seem to be passing up on. In my opinion the game is still a heavy grind, but at least you can have fun doing it now instead of just sitting in the Terrobyte doing crate sourcing all day long.",1527816513,1707018809,True,0,0,0.510010421276092529,0,True,False,False

With Los Angeles so well recreated, it’s easy to feel the blinding heat of the California sun through your monitor. Cause Michael Bay-level carnage under the Vinewood sign as the radio blasts good music, between good doses of satire. The humour is almost as rich as the then record $200 million dollars spent on production; money well-spent as decade old writing has dated mostly well, landing its well-aimed satirical humour and character-led story moments; while butts of the jokes have become preserved like a fly in amber, after a decade since the title’s release. Progression, exploration and gameplay are perfectly balanced in ‘Story Mode’; a favourite part of the story is on the early-game streets of Davis [Compton], as underdog Franklin ducks and dives his way between misguided but endearing characters.

In comparison to similar offerings, CD Projekt Red’s 2020 offering Cyberpunk is no contest; Cyberpunk providing unrivalled rich streetscapes and verticality of map design. Yet the immense levelling mechanics and single-player only has left the space for GTA Online to thrive in. Best for emersion, Rockstar Games’ 2018 release, Read Dead Redemption II, offers a picture-perfect exploration of frontier America, which can feel either comforting or dull depending on tastes. 

There’s still fun to be had with GTA Online: ‘Contact missions’ are a source of fun and virtual currency, while The Doomsday Heist (added 2017) plays great with friends, some may enjoy player-made jobs and stunt series. Issues with ‘modders’ are less frequent than prior years. Yet, the writing team have become the butt of their own jokes in recent with DLCs, that instead feel aimed at increasing monetisation. The secrets so subtly created in the base game around Mt Chilliad and aliens are a casualty in the decline of righting quality (a outcome comparable of Treyarch’s Call of Duty franchise). The mystery is close to ending as VI draws near, yet player interest and developer effort has fallen off. Imperfections in the base game are carelessly exposed as endless DLCs are piled atop one another: tons of supercars yet cars on the street remain a decade old, weaponised helicopters and jet-powered bikes rupture a map that was once expertly crafted to provide many stretches of road for immersive drives, while once great satire has become a stale look into the zeitgeist of a bygone time. Introduction of fantasy superweapons and vehicles changed the tone and proved a divisive yet fruitful attempt into mommy’s purse.

Six thousand people have contributed to this title, an effort that gets little of the attention it deserves. While it could be said Rockstar were first to create a ‘metaverse’, it is fleeting moments remembered, that are the true mark of success.",1707007760,1707007760,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

GTA Online is still a buggy mess after a decade. I think the coding that made this game in 2013 was a shaky foundation at best, and complete spaghetti code so convoluted nothing fundamental can be improved or fixed at worst. It has been 10 years and I still get loading screens as if I'm on Xbox 360 with a HDD. It's 2024 and more times than I can count I enter a building and am greeted with loading screens for 3+ minutes before I give up and alt F4. The inventory/interaction menu is unbelievably unintuitive and frustrating to use. You have to go through 10 different options fumbling around to heal yourself. The phone call system is still obnoxious as ever. Constantly berated with calls, emails, texts, and notifications from characters begging me to do or buy something. WHERE IS THE DO NOT DISTURB FUNCTION. My mechanic takes about 30 seconds to pickup his phone and half the time can't get my car to me. This was an issue in 2013... Matchmaking is a joke. If you load into a job you will rarely get to play a full match. You have to start the match in a public lobby to actually be able to invite anyone. The awful pay for the jobs contributes to the problem as why would anyone want to play this race for $5k when there are better ways to make money. The money you earned is directly tied to how long you played so it’s better to just afk the mission than play. Original heists still require 4 people and force end the mission if someone leaves. I cannot tell you how many times I've had an error loading into GTA Online and get sent back to Storymode. WHY CAN’T YOU REQUEUE ME? 

Rockstar loathes its player base. Zero communication ever. Programming cars to swerve into while driving. Nerf payouts of everything. Force players to glitch desired outfits like police uniforms and then blacklist and remove them. We can buy police cars now, but not uniforms?? I cannot believe it took a fucking decade to add police cars you can keep. Players have been asking for cops and crooks dlc for years and get only some half baked police cars. They even made the police suv a console exclusive. Arbitrary limits to the number of CEOs in an online session (you need to be one to do any mission). Add blatantly overpowered vehicles for players to grief you. Encourages players to grief you by making you a target on the map when selling stuff (you can do sell missions in solo lobbies now, only took 5 years to add but still). You have to install Rockstar launcher to play. Horribly unoptimized for online. Tanks your FPS going online from singleplayer. Poor vehicle diversity, max like 5 different car spawns. Sell missions forcing you to use 4 of the slowest vehicles in existence and drive across the map back. Die on a mission and need to retry? Any snacks and armor you used will not be reset so back out and restock or good luck. Playing with some people and you exit the lobby? Good luck finding them you are put into a different lobby. Not fun, just bad game design. 

The economy is still inflated beyond belief. $5 million dollars for a police car??? $2 million for a mustang? $400k for a rifle? They have made strides in improving money making capabilities with solo heists and improved business payouts, but you have to be experienced and willing to grind. You need millions of dollars in properties to be able to make any significant money, which is why they have a starter pack. You practically need this to play if you are new. Shark cards give you a pitiful amount of money for how much you spend. (please don't give rockstar money, buy a $100 billion dollar account from modders for like 5 dollars). This game has somehow been kept alive and milked for a decade from casual players and whales giving in to micro transactions. 

You think CSGO or Rust has a cheater problem? You wouldn't fucking believe the number of cheaters on PC. It's basically in the TOS that Rockstar doesn't care if you use a mod menu. They even reward them because they don't ever ban them, but will ban you if you do a money glitch. God mode glitches never get patched or banned.  There is zero punishment for cheating. Every other person is cheating. Maybe not overtly spawning spaceships and putting you in a death loop, but casually playing in God mode grinding. Abysmal security for online where modders can get everyone's IP. You played a heist and the money was never paid? Support will tell you to go fuck yourself. There isn't even an option for missing money on support, they couldn't care less.

They treat PC like last gen consoles by locking PC out of content on new gen consoles. They REMOVED 200 VEHICLES for purchase and made them available on a subscription service gta+. Animals have been added into online... for consoles only. PC has the best hardware and doesn't get the animals? Something that should've been in the game to begin with. 

They just keep adding DLC with more bloat. They add so many vehicles that nobody ever uses and just keep adding more and more. The missions and heists they do add are pretty good. Although a lot of them require multiple people to play.  

If Rockstar had any competition we would have had GTA VI years ago and a much better GTA V. Instead, we get this shit show. Cautiously optimistic for GTA VI. Rockstar is a shell of its former self. The heads of the studio that made Rockstar great have left the company.",1705628446,1706999997,False,36,3,0.730157613754272461,13,True,False,False

Now, Online on the other hand is dogshit, there are more modders, hackers and griefers than normal players. There is no anticheat, and all it takes for you to get banned is a 9 year old whit a hack client that drops you money. You can spot the average hacker/griefer/cancer pretty easily, they all have weird gamertags and their player looks like they got molested by a bunch of monkeys with crayons. They will often kill you and do it again, alot of times. One thing that makes the players so toxic is the k/d system, alot of 9 year olds think that higher k/d = gOoDeR sKilLz so griefers and tryhards go on and kill afk or people who are driving. There are just so many little details that make this game so incredibly toxic. Public lobbies are just very dangerous places to be in.
There are some many bugs for a game released 8/9 years ago, like sometimes you just randomly get stuck between objects, you can't interact whit things sometimes, it even happened sometimes that I got stuck in first person in a heist, and one time I was in the diamond casino heist and couldn't take my mask of so the guards shot me directly, and it was the big con approach... And there are so many infinite loading screens. I never found a way to fix that, so you gotta restart the game. There's this one bug thats so annoying, when leaving the compound by the main gate on cayo perico in solo, you sometimes get an infinite loading screen, so you have to restart the game, like cmon the DLC is out for 2 years now. And there are other stupid things like why are bushes on Cayo Perico harder than brick walls, why do the Merryweather soldiers on the side of the helicopters on some missions have aimbot etc... 
The games also not very beginner friendly as everyone knows. The community of the game is kinda shit, I mean there are alot of normal people but the bad side (hackers, griefers) is more present, like the first time I turned vocal chat on there was just a guy saying the n word whit a toaster microphone. 
It does't help that everthing is incredibly expensive, not only important things but also useless things, like you're telling me changing the colors of the walls in my office or apartment costs several thousands of dollars. DONT EVER BUY SHARKCARDS, please, not only is it a waste of money (duh) but rockstar has already made billions whit the money of kids.
One more thing that is... Lets say unfortunate, the first time I bought a depressor mk2 to grind faster, I stored it in my nightclub garage. Later, I bought an armored Kuruma and wanted to store it in my nightclub garage, and it said that the garage was full and that I had to replace a car, so I replaced it whit my oppressor because I thought I could just spawn it with the Terrorbyte menu or the MC menu, BUT what I didnt knew was that my 2.9 million dollar oppressor was gone, forever, because replacing a vehicle just removes its existence... No warning, and NO REFUNDS, whit only a few clicks I wasted 2.9 million dollars. Rockstar really wants players to buy sharkcards... 
Let's not forget all the annoying phone calls and messages from random retarded npcs like this fat ass Simeon, who wants shitty cars and is telling me that I owe him something, and yeah the only thing I owe him are 30 shots in the head. Then theres Dom, who calls you for idk what no one on this planet has ever listened to one of his phonecalls. But those 2 are nothing compared to English Dave... This motherfucking cocksucker calls you in the middle of a civil war and tells you to bring him and his fat cocksucking friends shitty ass pizza on his motherfucking little island, and you can't just stop the phonecall, you have to spend about 20 seconds listening to this dickhead before you can hang up, and that everytime you play, meanwhile you can't take any gun, can't fly correctly etc... 
It's really incredible that the game has no real protection.. Any a little experienced hacker can get your IP address in a public server, and they can do alot whit that. Like sometimes you'll see some weird codes in chat being spammed. Hackers have more power in this game than Rockstar, and in some lobbies I've seen hackers talkin' about their favorite hack client, and reporting them doesn't do anything. That's why it's recommended to use a VPN to protect your IP address, which is ridiculous if you consider how many billions Rockstar has made whit the game.
Now, the heists. The Doomsday heist : Its not profitable. Good story but I need money to pay my rent. The Diamond casino heist, pays good but takes alot of time to prepare. But one question... Why does your character take Gold on the cayo perico heist 90% faster than in The Diamond Casino heist? Idk either, the games really isn't realistic anyways so just make it normal. And the best heist is the cayo perico heist, its fast and always pays over a million (1.8 million is maximum), as you will evolve in the game, you're gonna understand that this is the fastest active money method, so you're gonna repeat and repeat whitout actually having fun while doing it, but the vehicles you will be able to buy whit the money are gonna be fun. 
Now, the vehicles. There are a variety of different vehicles, some are incredibly expensive and trash, others incredibly expensive but not trash, like the oppressor mk2, the vehicle that makes the game what it is. If Rockstar could just remove 100% accurate homing missiles on the mk2 there would be far less kids insulting eachother in the game chats. All other vehicles are ok I guess, but the oppressor mk2 really brought GTA into a gigashitty level.
GTA online has been close to being one of the best games, but now it's only known for it's toxic community, shitty bugs and glitches, hacks, IP address leaks etc...
That's why alot of players are leaving the game, after months of grinding, grinders don't have any more shit to buy, casual players don't have any fun things to do anymore and even hackers and griefers are bored of doing the same shit since 2014.
Good things? There are Franklin and Lamar in the new DLC. Also, Trevor in the original heists but it sadly doesnt bring much money. Playing GTA 5 online seriously in 2022 is pretty... Interesting. Since none of my friends play it anymore I always have to find randoms. After you get the Kosatka and the cayo perico heist it gets a little easier
 :)

I bought the Steam version for ₤15, and again, the story mode is definitely worth that price, but GTA Online... probably the worst most mind-boggling boring experience I've ever had. Constantly being shot by other players with their flying vehicles and the occasional hacker kicking everyone from a server. GTA Online just isn't my thing. Would rather play Roblox Jailbreak. GTA Online is incredibly repetitive and non sensical. Some of the missions like the nuclear waste mission just doesn't fit in with the game. Or the Opressor vehicle just makes the game unbalanced. Some people may like GTA Online, but it simply isn't for me.

Set in the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the game follows the interwoven stories of three protagonists – Michael, Franklin, and Trevor – as they engage in heists, skirmishes with the law, and various other activities in both urban and rural settings. This review evaluates ""GTA V"" based on its gameplay mechanics, narrative and character development, graphical and audio presentation, multiplayer component via GTA Online, and overall entertainment value.

Gameplay Mechanics
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
""GTA V"" offers a vast, interactive open world with a plethora of activities, missions, and side quests. The game's mechanics allow for seamless switching between the three protagonists, each with unique abilities, which adds depth to both gameplay and storytelling. The driving, shooting, and heist mechanics are polished, providing a satisfying and varied experience. However, some players may find certain mechanics, like the cover system during shootouts, to be less intuitive compared to dedicated shooting games.

Narrative and Character Development
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
The narrative of ""GTA V"" is a satirical take on the American dream, exploring themes of greed, family, and corruption. The story is engaging, with sharp writing, humor, and memorable characters. The dynamic between the three protagonists is particularly well-executed, offering diverse perspectives on the game's events. While the narrative pushes boundaries in typical Rockstar fashion, it might not resonate with all players, particularly those sensitive to the game's darker themes and humor.

Graphical and Audio Presentation
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
At its release, ""GTA V"" set a new standard for open-world visuals, beautifully rendering the diverse landscapes of San Andreas, from the bustling city of Los Santos to the serene countryside. The game's attention to detail, dynamic weather system, and day-night cycle contribute to an immersive world. The voice acting, sound design, and licensed music tracks on the game's radio stations complement the high-quality graphics, enhancing the overall experience.

Multiplayer: GTA Online
Rating: 8/10 - Good
""GTA Online"" significantly extends the game's lifespan, offering a persistent online world for players to explore, complete missions, and engage in activities with or against others. The continual updates and expansions have kept the community active, introducing new content like heists, businesses, and races. However, the multiplayer experience can be marred by long loading times, griefing, and a grindy progression system that heavily incentivizes microtransactions.

Overall Entertainment Value
Rating: 9/10 - Excellent
""GTA V"" is a landmark in open-world gaming, offering an unparalleled level of freedom and detail. The game's blend of storytelling, gameplay variety, and world-building results in a rich and entertaining experience that can absorb dozens, if not hundreds, of hours. The inclusion of ""GTA Online"" adds significant value, despite its flaws.

Overall Summary and Score
Overall Rating: 8.8/10 - Excellent
""Grand Theft Auto V"" is an ambitious and sprawling game that successfully builds upon the series' foundation, delivering a deep, engaging, and often provocative experience. Its combination of a detailed open world, compelling narrative, and robust multiplayer component makes it a must-play title for fans of the genre.

Hey fellow gamers,

I just had to drop a review for Grand Theft Auto V because, let's be real, it's not just a game—it's an experience. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this one.

First things first, the open-world of Los Santos is nothing short of breathtaking. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, from the bustling city life to the serene countryside. Whether you're cruising through the city streets or getting lost in the vast wilderness, the level of immersion is unmatched.

The storyline is a masterpiece, weaving together the lives of three diverse protagonists: Michael, a retired bank robber; Franklin, a street-smart repo man; and Trevor, a downright insane but insanely entertaining ex-military pilot. The character development is top-notch, making you genuinely care about their stories, flaws, and all.

Now, let's talk about the missions. They range from intense heists to absurdly hilarious side quests. The variety keeps the game play fresh and exciting. And the best part? The freedom to approach missions in multiple ways. Want to go in guns blazing? Sure. Prefer a stealthy approach? You got it. The choice is yours, and that's what makes GTA V stand out.

The level of detail extends to the vehicles and weapons as well. The car customisation options are a car enthusiast's dream, and the array of weaponry at your disposal is enough to satisfy any trigger-happy gamer.

But let's not forget the real star of the show—GTA Online. It's a wild ride of its own, offering a massive multiplayer world where you can heist, race, and cause mayhem with players from around the globe. The constant updates and additions keep the online experience fresh and exciting.

Of course, no game is without its flaws. The occasional bugs and glitches are a minor inconvenience, but they're overshadowed by the sheer brilliance of the overall package.

In conclusion, Grand Theft Auto V is a must-play for any gamer. It's a sandbox of possibilities, a cinematic masterpiece, and an adrenaline-pumping joyride all rolled into one. So buckle up, get ready for a wild journey, and remember: What happens in Los Santos, stays in Los Santos.

Now your forced to play in lobbies full of griefers and hackers, if you solo it merges you almost immediately promoting bullying and abusive behaviours. Making people who want to play legit frustrated because they cant do anything and if you do manage to do something its EXCRUCIATING and PAINFULLY slow in order to force you into buying up to 8 mill which costs you £80.00.

So not only do you pay for the game your buying money to play the game which is extremely pay to win. Considering most things in the game cost an idiotic amount of money like for instance the bunker outright costs in and around 4 to 5 mill to run efficiently. With there being multiple examples of this. Penthouse 6 mill, every good car 2 mill each, oppressor 4 to 6 mill and hundreds of other examples. This is absolute and utter theft at an executive, Triple A company like Rockstar, level. 

How people even start to complain over monetisation in other games yet this game is ignored in this factor... this is by far the worst game for monetisation and pay to win and even pay to play tactics. Not to mention the forced online play with children who only want to bomb you with their parents credit cards. 

Games a fantastic game but the company is worse than living in 1930s Germany as a Jewish woman. People will pay for skins. Charge for appearance crap whatever. But punishing players who actually like the game. get a grip Rockstar. You're only so far up the food chain because you promote bullying and racism within your games and allow kids with rich parents go off on one.",1706971704,1706971805,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I have over 2000 hours in GTA Online on PS4.  Very well polished and SO MUCH to do.
I haven't even explored 70% of the things you can do in GTA Online.  I mostly spent my time doing heists and making money with my online businesses.  
This is the type of game that you can play for years!  It goes on sale for $15 all the time and is 100% worth it.
Everyone should AT LEAST play through the single player campaign.  Online is great but not for everyone.
