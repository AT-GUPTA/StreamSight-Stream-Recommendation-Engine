However, the dice rolls are completely biased against the player in single player mode when playing against AI opponents.  This includes non-biased mode.  I cannot count the amount of times where there have been absolutely absurd outcomes due to this issue.  For example, attacking a single bomber (defend at 1) with 7 tanks (attack at 3), and losing.  Or, 6 infantry (attack at 1 without artillery support) versus a single infantry (defends at 2) and losing.  There have also been multiple instances where the player attacks with multiple bombers and fighters and hits nothing, even with multiple roles.  These types of absurd outcomes have ruined a number of very good games and resulted in a lot of wasted time.  Any experienced Axis and Allies board game player will tell you that although there will occasionally be very unlikely dice rolls, they are exceedingly rare.  In this game, it happens all too often, usually tens of times per game, and almost always in favor of the AI, not the player.  The team responsible for this game needs to work on this.  Also, in single player mode, when playing with AI allies, some of the AI moves make absolutely no sense.  One move that seems to occur fairly often is for the Russian AI player to completely empty its capital to attack, only to leave itself completely undefended for the next axis turn.  No human player would ever do this as holding one's capital is always the most important consideration, especially when allied help is on the way.  In conclusion, this game is fun, but too many sessions have been ruined by biased dice rolls and nonsensical AI moves.",1709067049,1709067049,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Examples
- Units are sometimes shown in the wrong zone, and are often in confusing corners of the right zone
- Unit icons often overlap, obscuring vital information like number and move remaining.
- The unit movement arrows will combine and split in ways that obscure their destinations. 
- The only clear list of units attacking a zone is nested four clicks deep in the UI
- You must re-navigate to the above attack list every time you deselect the attacked zone.
- List elements in the UI are absurdly big, hard to use, and often hide results behind scrollbars. 
- The UI, trying to be helpful, will quietly move your landing forces to wrong sea zones with disastrous effect
- Transport management remains so crazy it's hard to know where to start

The three of us got the game for Christmas and have started playing again, getting re-acquainted with the game, the rules, the units, the strategies... It's so much fun and we don't even have to worry about placement of units, movement and attack limit rules, fuel, dice hitting game pieces, etc.
Really enjoyable and challenging as always. The control interface takes some time to get used to though but, just as with any change, if you embrace it, stay the course, and practice the everything becomes second nature.

Who knows if they have fixed the issue in my initial review because now the damn game is so bug-ridden I can't even get past ONE round before everything on the dice rolling screen disappears. What a shame. And what a complete waste of my time.

Custom rules are bare bones.  There's no option to have figurines instead of icons (this was always a nice addition to the board game).  There's also some strange issues with dice rolling that frequently create lop-sided battles and seem to favor attackers.  As a person who's never thought myself a hardcore A&A player, I find this version rather disappointing.

I will probably still play this version bc it is the most up to date. But god do I wish the devs fixed the dice roll mechanics. I have questioned for so long if I am miscalculating or if it is an error within the game and I am left with no choice but to believe this game operates on a system in which ""the luck will come back to you"". For instance, a battle you have strong odds of winning may go absolutely horrendously for you, but in the same round a battle you should have no chance of winning will go magnificently in your favor. This results in insanely unrealistic dice rolling that would never ever happen if you were truly rolling dice. I could give multiple examples of attacking the computer or real players and receiving no hits on the first attacking roll, and say the defender has 9 units defending and all 9 units of those units receiving a hit. I have spent more hours playing the board game itself and while I have seen some ridiculous rolls, absolutely nothing tops the things I have seen on 1942 Online Edition. These rolls simply would never happen in real life. If developers could prove to me there are no absolutely no modifiers in dice rolls depending on which units are attacking, what territories, or what other battles are taking place in the same turn, then I might be willing to change my mind. But I am absolutely convinced the dice rolls are designed to give you extreme results in battle every so often, so that you may feel rewarded for ""taking a risk"". A&A should be a blend of strategy and risk, but there are sooooo many instances where ridiculous strategies, or insurmountable battles will work simply bc of the chance system. The low-luck and stabilized dice modes are slightly better but nobody plays on those. I truly wish the regular dice rolling mechanics had no influences but after seeing round after round of the same things happening it is impossible to believe it is pure.

It is pretty easy to get the hang of the controls for players familiar with the board game, and it is a great way to connect online to play this game. Since it isn't a board game the experience tends to go faster with setup time, moving the units, etc. It's also great to have the option to play the Larry Harris setup, since it is more balanced than standard 1942.

There are a few changes from the board game that I think hinder the overall experience. First, as of the posting of this review there is no feature to send fighter escorts during strategic bombing raids, which I think is an issue since in the board game it's an important way to protect your more expensive bombers. Additionally, since players can take their turns without requiring every player present, there are ""defense profiles"" to tell the computer which units to destroy first if you're defending. It's probably important for more experienced players to change the defense profile to kill Anti-Aircraft Artillery first, bombers later, etc., since that can be an important part of strategy in the board game version.

1. The fact that every patch continues to be riddled with bugs that crash what is simply a digitization of a board game, despite being out of early access, is inexcusable. 

2. Now that I have been using an odds calculator and watching the dice rolls closely, there is clearly something wrong with their dice logarithm. The root of the problem seems to be that the rolls come in waves - high percentage hits or misses by each round. Rarely does a single round roll how the odds say they should. The developers' solution has been to create a low luck dice feature (adding attack values and dividing by # of units), which does not address the bad programming and makes for boring games. There is a free online version of the 1941 game done by one single programmer that plays better than this-that should signal something to the developers.

I would quit playing and uninstall this game if there was not a group of friends that play online. Even as it is, I have to take breaks from this game periodically when the rolls become ludicrous (most recent break? attacking 3 subs in the Atlantic and all 3 defend with 1s for hits). Maybe someday they will figure it out...

12/4/2023 - Bought a new computer and hadn't played in a while. Decided to fire it up and see how the game was progressing. Started two games with random folks. First game I did the standard USSR attack 9 and 12 against the Germans in Ukraine and W Russia and...lost both. Ok, maybe I was just unlucky. In the other game I got to Japanese turn and threw everything I could at Pearl Harbor. I destroyed everything but a carrier and still had a bomber, 2 fighters and a carrier left. That one carrier...you guessed it, defeated my remaining four attackers. Immediately uninstalled the game. The dice rolls are so ridiculous in this game and they clearly still haven't fixed their logarithms.

Having played Axis and Allies for decades, starting with the first release, I am a big fan of it. I was excited to see this game online and really wanted to play.

The computer AI is terrible. This is a shame. Since I have a very busy schedule, I was looking forward to having some fun matches that I could go at my own pace. Forget it. The game play is just terrible.

Ranked games are the worst. I dislike that the game parameters are fixed to Gencon rules with no flexibility on dice or time options. I have to say there is a lot of suspect/fishy play going on in ranked games. Certain opponents win every battle in a given round with no loss of units and did consistently throughout a game. The odds such results are off the charts. If that is not enough, more oddball stuff occurs. In the decades of my playing A&A, never have I seen so many bombers destroyed on strategic raids. It also appears certain opening moves are largely scripted, such as guaranteed wins for the Soviets in Ukraine and Western USSR. 
The developers have failed to include a reporting a mechanism for cheating.  

Custom matches do offer a bit of hope. I like that the game and dice parameters can be adjusted. Funny enough, I have experienced significantly less nonsense here -- even when the dice are set in normal mode. I give these types of games a thumbs up overall. They can bring together five players. This is what a good Axis and Allies game is all about!


Some requested improvements:

There is not way from all the players of opposing sides to communicate. Only players of the same alliance may share map notes. This is a problem. Sometimes, a player(s) acts disinterested. A quick message would allow folks to figure out that player's intentions. Moreover, human interaction is part of the game. Banter is just as important as well placed infantry. 

A draw feature should be instituted. If both sides feel the game has gone from fun to total grind with no end in site, allow folks to walk away with a draw. Likely people will start a new game and get back to it.  

In the case of a group game when a player drops out, the alliance is handed over completely to the teammate. At this juncture, there should be an option to end the game and giving only the player who dropped out first a loss. The teammate who was suddenly saddled with more than he or she bargained for should be not be given a loss, if they decide to end the game. However, the player may decide to continue and if so, awarded a win or loss accordingly.

USSR and GB are the best allies to play for a somewhat challenging game.

USSR:  Most games are pretty challenging, as the Allies AI sucks, particularly GB.  GB AI doesn't build up an army/navy very well and just sends them to get slaughtered turn after turn, or doesn't build enough ships that Germany airforce just wipes them out.  So it's really just you and USA vs the Axis.  And US isn't the best either (they take too long to get going).
USSR AI:  Bad at keeping an army grouped.  
Germany:  Too easy.  You can cheese and take GB in most games.  Japan also does ok as an ally, and GB/USA don't put together a good D-Day force, so you can also just hard focus USSR.
Germany AI:  Doesn't build enough infantry which is bad in a long game, but actually makes them a bit brutal against he poor Ally AI early.  
GB:  The game feels most balanced playing as GB.  You can try to either full counter Japan, or 3 infantry turtle India, while building up your navy first for a European landing.  You need to make some kind of impact by turn 4, as USSR tends to lose turn 4-6 if they don't get help.
GB AI:  They need to be better at looking for a Germany potential England landing on turn 2-3 (i.e., spend a turn building full 8 infanty on england).  They also need to group up a strong navy and not just leave their ships scattered.
Japan:  Too easy.  You can steam roll India/USSR pretty easily.  
Japan AI:  A little slow at getting ground troops into Asia, but overall not too bad.
USA:  Usually easy, but sometimes USSR plays so bad that they lose before you can land in Europe.  You need to land in Europe turn 4 or 5 or USSR is toast.  You can try going full pacific vs Japan for a bit of a harder game.

One can play others online, the PC or even himself when learning the game... or even for taking to another level, as one might with chess. It's visually pleasing. The first was about in the early 1980's and it stands the test of time for a reason. World War 2 buffs will appreciate this approximation. For those who played the physical version, what a pleasure to be able to save, bring it all back up whenever you want, and not have the cat destroy the playing field. --- The AI is not perfect, insomuch as, if you play enough, and you're good, you can ramp up the difficulty level quite a bit by limiting your piece types or what you can attack and eventually kick the computer's butt. Slack for a moment, and the PC will make you pay. Although the AI has a few different ways to ""open"" against you, it will eventually fall into ruts in the long game. Though you can play any side and even all 5 factions, it's too bad the PC cannot play itself, or perhaps allow one to play fantasy scenarios like Germany and USA against the other three.

It works pretty well in that respect. The simpler and less convoluted rules of the [i]1942[/i] base-game make it quick to get into, and familiarise yourself with all the different game elements.

I have three main issues with the product, though.

#1 [u]No 'Remote Play Together' functionality[/u] - I regard this functionality as somewhat essential if you're trying to sell a tabletop boardgame as a retail PC game via Steam.
#2  [u]I experienced a crash-to-main-menu pretty early on[/u] whilst playing a single player match vs AI (possibly because the game was trying to access the Internet while having zero bandwidth available, and not handling the timeout correctly).  I haven't had that happen since, so not a major issue given that I have completed a couple of matches since with no issues over the course of roughly ten hours.
#3  [u]It would be nice if there were different A&A rulesets available as DLC[/u] - the base game is fine and all, but given the number of similar-but-distinct products in the line, it would be nice to have that variety available.

Oh, would also be nice if there was the option to randomise starting factions automatically.

Aside from that, it's pretty decent; although even at half-price discount the cost is a little bit steep given how many other turn-based strategy games are available on Steam that aren't designed around the limitations of tabletop boardgames.",1693600310,1693689221,True,12,0,0.621603012084960938,0,True,False,False

The interface is a little wonky, but once you get used to it the game play is fine.

As a developer (in my daily life, not for this game) though there are some things that I wish where there. All in all this is worth the price.

Positive Notes:
- Great improvements over the years.
- Great detail into improvements.
- Great at assisting new users as it makes it very easy to tell all legal moves for any given unit.
- Season roll-over isn't too frequent.
- You can choose how you want the dice to work. Great for those of us that like true-random (as much as is humanly possible given our current level of knowledge/technology).

Missing things:
- Ability to have a pause of kick times for a ranked game (should be agreed upon by both parties). Otherwise games that last for weeks may not be accounting for in our daily schedule and can give an unfair win/loss.
- To those of use that remember the OG computer game of this, it would be great to have technologies/improvements available.
- The ability to fly a plane to a space with no intention of returning it to land.
- Chatting without using map notes.
- Communication being available with your opponent. (This would be good for PvP games with friends but split teams)
- Dev team doesn't react to feedback with detailed information on weird issues/bug/problems found to be fixed.
-- One example of this would be the issue I found when you Shift + Click to move your planes in a Non-Combat move. If you are doing this to an ocean tile with more planes than you have available space the game instantly crashes. I believe this comes down to their program trying to determine if this is a legal more, or is trying carve out just the number of planes that can move to the available space and then returning the remainder to the cursor to still be moved.",1691710283,1691710409,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the earlier version losing the English fleet wasn't as catastrophic as they could rebuilt from what was left over.  The Americans always lose their fleet in the Pacific just like always, but it was usually pretty costly for the Japanese.

There are a few bugs with the UI I encountered during play, where orders wouldn't take properly because of the sea zone and land zone being attacked (e.g. doing an amphib attack into Algeria to retake from the US, I would get a ""can't do this movement with this unit"" error message, which required me to click into a specific part of the land zone and even then it didn't read my accompanying battleship for support which now requires me to double check if every move to make sure they are correct). This will hopefully be addressed as development continues.

Also have some questions with the dice mechanics being used which caused some fairly strange results in battles that raised a few eye brows. Would like to see more customization in the rule options to vary play or setting a difficulty level for AI play (would be good for new players). If you are a diehard A&A fan and looking to play online regularly, then this game will probably be a good fit, but the computer play only mode will get boring fast.

I was truly hoping for an engaging experience to play this game how I remember the old 1998 version. I can not understand how this game is so bad, but the old one was so good.

The ""Defense Profile"" has got to be the worst mechanic in this game. What a complete and utterly garbage feature. Part of the strategy and play experience is the decision making on what casualties are taken after each round of combat. The game is very unengaging and the play experience nerfed with this useless feature. If we wanted the game to play itself, why bother wasting our money to purchase it?

I do not care care that you can 'customize' the profiles. Each battle is an individual interaction on the battlefield. You can, and often do, change your mind on which pieces to designate as casualties. Different pieces have different strategic value, based on different parameters. No two games are identical. And even if they were, you may have a specific plan on how to play for the given moment. Or, perhaps on the results of a battle or the change in direction of an opponent's strategy, you may find a different strategic value on some pieces over others.

Seriously, this 'feature' is complete garbage. There is no reason for this to be the 'only' way to play. I'm not against additional features as optional time-saves for smoother play. But, it should not be a mandatory function of the game, removing critical interactive elements of the game. Bad feature is bad.

I will assume this 'feature' is used to make the online play experience 'smoother'. But, I disagree that it was necessary. Even if you wanted a smooth asynchronous play experience online, you should have split the combat phase + first rounds fired (offense and defense) on each skirmish of the attackers turn. Allow the defending player to choose casualties when they receive priority to take in game actions. The Attacker can then determine their casualties and decide whether to continue the attacks or retreat.

There is seriously ZERO reason for such a useless change for this game. Why did you take away one of the most important aspects of the game (decision making) from my most cherished board game franchise?

More then that when one is regularly attacking  one will encounter a defender who will get a hit at least every time one chooses to attack for 90 percent of the time. 

This will sap you strength and anyone who has played the game knows it comes down to one two men as the game goes on. You will essentially be nickle and dimed out of the game. The problem with the dice is that they are impossible. No one expects someone to hit a 1-2 roll every time they roll the dice. This is what exactly happens in this game. It gets ridiculous when you see  defenders hitting double 1s--snake eyes--throughout the game.

But I chose to not recommend it only to voice issues.  Once resolved, I'll change to a recommend status.  While it has improved there is still much to be desired with the game and Beamdog itself.  For starters, there are still many glitches in both game play and when joining games (you'll get a useless error report that apparently gets sent to Beamdog but they still haven't fixed it to this day).  Their customer support is useless and while they respond to technical issues initially, but rarely seem to follow up.  The dice algorithm for standard sucks (just google the game and issues with bombing raids and you'll know what I mean).  On the bright side they have a ""low luck"" dice option which is great, but isn't used in their ranked games.  Again, sometimes the tools they give you for a more enjoyable game are rendered useless when you need them most (why not offer low luck and standard dice options for ranked games?).  RE: Glitches...There have been games where I played a friend and I was able to select what shots are to be applied to his defenders, so naturally I could easily select the high value targets (i.e., fighters versus his infantry) rather than the AI automatically selecting his lower value units first in fairness.  Another time I was getting hits on a ranked player but they weren't being applied despite rolling hits.  That's frustrating!  Or your bombers and fighters may hit nil while their few infantry score ""ones"" and take out your fighters, just like in real life. Lol   So there is much to be improved as far as game programming, mechanics, glitches, etc.  More importantly, Beamdog needs to provide better customer service when customers submit technical issue/service requests. Once that happens, it can truly be a great company with a great product.  If you're willing to get past the above issues, it is an enjoyable game that is slowly and painfully being improved.  I hope to come back and retract the aforementioned issues one day.

I played the board game starting back in the 80s and still play it occasionally with my son.  In all the hundreds (if not more) games I've played on the board, not a single one of them felt as luck determined with as random outcomes as this game does.  The ranked play is a great idea, but the inability to switch to low luck in ranked play is a deal breaker for me.  Without this setting the game is just a frustration factory... and now your new setting makes a player who got beat because of bad luck to type the words ""FORFEIT GAME"" before they can quit and move on to a game where they hope they're the one who gets the lucky die rolls.

And actually that pretty much sums up how this game (and it's designers) treats its players.  These complaints have been made for over a year now and every release where they claim they've fixed the issue turns out to be nonsense.  If you enjoy randomness that forces you to play the same game over and over again, this game is for you.  If you enjoy watching a unit that hits on a die roll of 4 role 5s and 6s over and over again and get destroyed by a lesser unit regardless of your strategic choices, this game is for you.  If you enjoy watching your opponent roll a 1 10 times out of 30 when only a 1 hits, this game is for you.  

Absolutely do not recommend.  I'd like to get my $20 back, tbh.  It's a garbage game.

Came back and tried again in May 2023 after friend recommended it to me.  Same issues repeatedly over about a dozen games played.

Ever since i got it in 2020 i saw the dire need for a preview button that shows the map exactly how it will look after clicking end phase before you click it.  Shouldn't be too complicated and would make the game a 9 or 10 for me. 

Been playing a very close game for a week or two. 9 rounds in. Everyone is taking their time. During UKs turn we moved ships all over in our approach to germany. Axis and allies shows this with aarows.  So usually the screen has a ton of arrows (specifically in non combat)
I spent a half hour looking at the screen.  My two teamates were on the phone while i moved were also looking at the screen from their end watching the turn and all of us coordinating.   Immediately ( literally 3 seconds max) after clicking end phase we look in horror that 4 u.s  transports were left unguarded in zone 4 with a japanes bomber in range.  
If we were on a real board moving pieces around we would have noticed the transports alone the moment the ships moved just like we did 3 seconds after ending the phase.  
Now half the transports are gone and we can no longer stretch the german defense along europe.  This is a UI error.  

I took about 8 months off from playing because of this kind of thing happened to many times  and now i dont think i can devote anymore time to a game that wont add this simple fix.  (Preview!). 

2/10.  Its good until the ui ruins the game for you. Major flaw 

Many ppl have made this complaint and so far the only ""fix"" I've noticed is prettier arrows.

EDIT:  Can no longer recommend this game until the developers fix the latency issues.  This causes stuttering between 2-10 seconds almost every minute in every game played online.  Cannot recommend buying until they fix this glaring (and easily solvable) issue.  

If DOTA 2 can pit players from America against Russians with <100 ms ping, the servers hosting the virtual boardgame that is A&A 1942 Online should be able to as well.

Edit 2: Latency issues fixed!  Still crashes every so often but quite rarely and almost always involves mass movement of aircraft towards carriers.  Very fun game!

Edit 3: You kidding me??  The ""latency"" issues are back again?!  Thumbs down for you!  Also, 5x more buggy than before.

Edit 4: Okay, apparently the latency is caused by the A&A folder getting clogged with a bunch of files the more you play.  I forget which folder, but you can delete it and it will run smooth as silk again.  The only problem is that it deletes your custom settings (graphics, sound, DEFENSE PROFILES, etc.) so you'll need to reset all that back to what you had before manually.

The dice outcomes I've observed over playing the game extensively are so outrageous they are laughable.  We're talking about outcomes that are below 1% chance happening multiple times within the same game.  There are specific patterns I've observed as well that show up often.  Examples are as follows.  Single defending infantry hit on a two or less 50% or better.  Large groups of Infantry attacking at 1 or 2 will consistently roll under odds.  I've observed large groups of tanks (7 or higher) miss on every single roll.  I've NEVER observed similar groups of infantry missing completely.  The game will do ""make up"" rolls after a battle is decided to even out the final odds.  Crucial battles are where some of the most egregious dice rolling occurs.  A recent example was attacking with 12 INF, 2 ART, and 7 tanks against 6 INF 2 ART 4 Tanks and 2 Fighters.  Odds say the most likely outcome is that I would have 2 ART 1 INF and 7 Tanks left.

Specifically, I've played ""Axis and Allies 1942 Online"" 79 times (starting in season 7). So I am something of an A&A veteran. My overall take on this game is that it's very well done and fun to play.

The map is the same as the board game of the same name (minus ""Online""), and it's a good choice. The game flow is smooth and not too long (excessive time to finish games is the #1 complaint for A&A in general; I have multiple friends who won't play it and have stated this is why). 90% of games on this map are over in 10 rounds (or less), which is about right. The user interface is streamlined and (mostly) intuitive. The amphibious assault mechanism took me a bit to understand and the combat movement screen can be a bit cluttered, but all in all, pretty minor gripes.

The map uses version 3 rule set, which is the correct rule set (v1 is unplayable, and v2 is still unplayable, but less so). Not sure if the developers were doing a straight conversion of the board game to online, but I'm glad they picked this rule set! Transports defending on a 1 doesn't sound like a big deal, but it ruins the games (Allies can make fleets with minimal warships and just use a fleet of transports as a meat shield - Axis trades irreplaceable aircraft for transports).

Overall I'd say Axis and Allies factions are balanced, with perhaps Axis being slightly stronger (I know I certainly win more with them). If you're new, on every map Allies have an economic advantage and Axis start with more units & of a higher quality (more fighters, especially; higher ""TUV"", total unit value). The Q is if Axis can gain $$/lands before Allies overwhelming economic advantage comes to bear (read ""USA comes to the rescue"" - most often in D-Day style).

The developers did a good job of stream lining the game play without sacrificing the quality or fun (such as by altering the map to make it too simplistic, removing units, etc). LHTR have grown on me and I do admit I find the ranked play fun.

Matching feature is good and I am excited to compete in season 8 (my first season playing from the start).

Good luck!

The AI is BAD. Bad bad bad bad BAD. I played my first game as Russia (ever, including in-person games), and watched as the US sent its Pacific Cruiser and Atlantic Destroyer SOUTH on the first two turns, and rearranged its entire Pacific fleet to ensure that Japan could have its way with Asia. It even sent its fighter from China into Ukraine to ""support"" me instead of trying to help the British territories WHERE IT WAS.

It also seems like Germany has a VENDETTA against Russia in this, because as I tried playing the US and Britain it almost completely ignored every other country except for utilizing its original navy to unsuccessfully attack the UK's navy; it spammed tank after tank into Russia, leaving France COMPLETELY UNDEFENDED with two transports, tanks, and infantry on the east coast of the US and even more UK forces on the Island.

To boot, the AI's gameplay turns are INCREDIBLY, MIND-NUMBINGLY SLOW, interspersed with light speed battle rounds, ESPECIALLY if you follow them (so half the time you're left wondering what actually happened). The anti-air damage phase takes legitimately 20 times longer than it needs to in order to roll the dice digitally, and for some reason the Industrial Complex GETS A ROLL in that phase. Beyond that, THERE IS NO PAUSE FUNCTIONALITY IN SINGLE PLAYER, and AI rounds are totally automated. I couldn't step away to grab a tea without missing that my entire US carrier fleet was wiped out by Japanese bombers- a fact I found out far-too-belatedly the next combat phase.

There's even more I could complain about, but those are the major points, and I cannot be bothered to spend any more time on this dumpster fire. I've only played three hours of this- and I bought it strictly to play solo- but I cannot continue. I DESPISE the AI.

Please, take heed: I wish I could refund the game, but I gave it too much of a chance. Don't buy it if you ever want to play solo.

Oh, and the AI has one difficulty setting: ruthless.

Things I'd recommend:
- Bid option (player of a particular nation gets extra IPC to take a nation others don't want, could attract multiplayer players or be useful for custom singleplayer)

1) The AI controls where you can move and what pieces die when you defend.  This means that you constantly are blocked from moving perfectily legitimate moves, especially in the sea.  If your aircraft are positioned to strike an island in the Pacific, and your carrier can move there to allow them to land: both moves are unavailable, period.  Why?  No explanation.  Stuff like this happens every single game.a


2) Also, your bombers will die efvery time they're attacked, last.  You have no option to sacrifice them for the land pieces or even fighter you need.  Why?  No explanation.   Same thing with aircraft carriers: they will always be last to die, no matter how you set up your ""defense profile"" to avoid this.

Finally, as everyone else said, the die rolls are way out of any statistical possibility.  3 submarines took out your entire Atlantic fleet?  Yep, that happens every game.  I just played a game where the defending 4 infantry hit every time except 1 (that's 11 dice rolls of 2 or less, in a row) in 3 rounds of combat.

I've never played a single game where me or other player did not eventually forfeit.  4 or 5 rounds in, where the AI has absolutely destroyed the strategic encounter that both players worked hard to craft, someone is gonna pull the plug.  The game is ruined by Ai.  It's crazy, but in 2022 they still haven't produced a good copy of this board game.",1669395703,1673186697,False,0,0,0.513888895511627197,0,True,False,False

This is that the game will allow you to attack with fighters but, after the attack, you may not have the fuel to be able to land them and you are stuck, completely unable to proceed to the next round and thus, have to quit your game! For the love of God please fix this insanely bad feature! 2. On the note of fighters, I would like to see that you are actually able to employ air units in battle even if there is insufficient fuel to return to a friendly territory - the caveat being that no matter how the opponent rolls, these units will be lost. Think of it as a suicide mission. I see no reason why this can't occur as such incidents actually did occur in real life during the war (ie. Kamikazi fighters) 3. I've beaten this game probably over 100 times (always play solo against the computer) and have won as any of the five combatants. It would be SO cool if you could turn on your ally/allies - whoever is left after your side has captured all capitals - and fight your now former ally for complete world domination. This would be very interesting b/c, in theory, the last two remaining powers of the victorious alliance would both be strong. Again, there's precedent in real life, given ever-shifting alliances (ie. German non-aggression pact with USSR). Please allow the game to proceed after your initial side wins! 4. It would be great to add a bit more military functionality (ie. the ability to parachute in troops so that amphibious assaults are not the only way to attack when separated by water. 5. Finally, and this would be a very big advancement of the AI to allow for, but it would be amazing if - after winning the war - you could enjoy a summary of how the war was fought (could be limited to the victor's point of view to save bandwidth). I'm visualizing a way for the system to give you a synopsis of what went down in the war, round by round. This would include generic titles for the battles fought (ie. 3rd Battle of Sea Zone 48, etc.), casualties lost on both sides, relative IPC expended, etc. At the very least, I would like to have a bit more detail to review after a game is complete, showing overall totals for each country in terms of how much total IPC was spent/used, number of battles won/lost, comparative units expended per battle, etc. This would be very interesting. Heck, the system could even auto generate some graphical statistic to show how each country performed relative to each other.

I'm looking forward to somewhat expanded versions of the same game. The option to play standard dice and to switch between game setups is also great. While the standard (or other) dice can be slightly obnoxious (for example, when I lost a 93% chance of winning battle), it's still mostly reflective of the real A&A board game, where once in a blue moon, the 7% actually holds up against the 93%. I would recommend this game to any fan of A&A. The ranking system seems generally fair, and I've had a lot of fun winning or losing games. Granted, it's more fun to win.

EDIT: This game is a recreation of an old board game In which you assume the role of one (or more) of five of the principle powers that fought World War II. In A&A, you move pieces representing air. land, and sea forces to take control of enemy capitals. Each Power moves in its turn and each turn has phases in which you purchase, move, do battle, and place previously purchased units on your factory areas and plan your next moves.

EDIT: I would say that this game is an Operational and/or Strategic level type of simulation of the war. That is, each piece has its function and works as it is designed to be BUT you are attempting to take areas in a strategic fashion.

EDIT: Larry Harris is a genius and his/this game, in any form, has stood the test of time.

................................................

This game is a faithful rendition of the board game I have always loved. It has the look and feel of the original game AND you do not have to spend a lot of time setting up the pieces. Every piece has a ""Rules"" section so you do not have to leave the game to find out what is what. 

I DO recommend this game to others. 

I would like to see ""Secret Weapons"" research that was available in some editions of the board game added to this game.

EDIT: ........     I WOULD STILL like to see the ""Secret Weapons"" research option, that was available earlier in some game editions, added to this computer game version. 

The use of transports is sometimes confusing when you have a stack of them. It is sometimes hard to differentiate between loaded and unloaded as well as returned and outgoing transports when in the same sea zone but I was able to use them pretty effectively.  

EDIT: the devs have greatly improved the use of transports ... and other game aspects.

A lot has improved with the past releases. I still think TriplA beats this version in gameplay, but there are some nice features that makes it worthwhile
1) There is no cheating in this game, as you are unable to edit anything after confirmation
2) It is easy to set up a competitive game with friends and strangers and there is always someone to play against
3) you can play it on any device; laptop, Ipad and even Iphone and continue to play the same game. Although iPhone is not always the best choice due to screen size
4) You can manage yours games well, and have a good overbiew on which games are running and what th waiting times are

I'm still missing a decent battle calculator, and the pre combat hints to see how your likelihood of success will play out is not accurate (advantage for those that know where the flaws are).

Enough reasons to give it a thumbs up I would say


Prev Review:
""The game play is horrible, especially when you run it on a Mac.
The overview of the map is bad: you keep zooming in and out to understand what is going on.
Taking a single country turn takes up a lot of time, mostly because of the constant change in screens and animations. 
Doing and undoing moves to try your best strategies takes forever this way
Some functions like an amphibious assault is incredibly cumbersome, and disfunction half the time.
Then the amount of work memory needed for all these needless animations, runs your battery dry in 30 minutes.
Comparing this to the TripleA setup and gameplay, leave me no other choice than to say It needs another round or ten of iteration""",1585916567,1663765217,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Some notes about single player if you only do that. The AI is a bit lackluster, and I think it's mostly due to some hard-coding that's been done. Once you get used to it, it becomes very predictable, and pretty easy to abuse and win even in seemingly impossible scenarios. For instance, the UK will always build 3 planes in India on turn 1, which makes it laughably easy to take UK as Germany by turn 2 by launching 2 successive assaults as they don't replenish their troops, nor do they strike against protected transports right next door. If playing Total Victory, winning as the U.S. is a given, as Japan does a pitiful job protecting itself from early/mid-game U.S. aggression. I believe that the devs do this to play against the meta Germany first strategy that is necessary in multiplayer. Germany is hard-coded to never buy battleships to help dominate the Atlantic. Russia falls? Make sure to just take Japan and then death-stack battleships to keep Germany from invading the UK. Enough turns, and you can one shot Germany itself with bombardment and a tank landing.

All and all a great game, I just wish the AI was a little more adaptive so I can use it to test strategies for multiplayer. Allowing for custom board setups or more custom game modes would be great as well.",1663562953,1663562953,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

4/1/21 - They have implemented ""stabilized dice"" but not sure if I see any difference. 
5/27/21 - Well with the introduction of low luck which takes the dice sway out of the game I can recommend this as a strategy game.

 2) Ability to Custom your match more. perhaps a map maker?

Neither of these are part of the developers contract with the game license owner. So it would be a suprise if any of this ever actually gets done.

Very frustrating interface with lots of clicking just to do simple actions.

Cannot save the game for yourself; you have to rely on the auto-save which only has one save per campaign???

Cannot easy delete the one auto-save per campaign which starts to clutter up the single player screen.

There's a very frustrating bug in which the game doesn't destroy planes that cannot land -- instead, the game insists you land the plane and gets stuck in a loop.  Combined with the lack of a save feature this BREAKS the game.

Game screen turns black in the middle of a campaign; need to reload to refresh screen.

You cannot choose the order of battle.

Firstly infantry and artillery defence rolls.  I am sure that if they carried out a detailed audit the statistics will show that infantry and artillery defensive rolls are skewed in favour of the defender. Additionally more often than not if the first roll hits, subsequent rolls are likely to hit to. The RNG generator is in my view not up to the task.  I have played enough games to see this happening on a frequent basis to believe that this is not random.

I like it, Planes on Allied Carriers and Units on Allied TP's are not enabled yet and a Profile is set for auto Def. rolls to speed up Ranked games. I'm not ranked yet, but I will be before long. Give it a try.

By the 20th of July, I am ranked Gold in both Axis and Allies.

 I wrote those in season 2. I's now season 4 and they have improved the profile set ups for defence and I like it better than it was. They have added a choice in custom games to get a stabilized dice setting. I have played with it and I dont seem to notice as many odd rolls. This is to me a good thing, but I have not played alot with it, I tend to play mostly ranked games and this option is not available for ranked games.
 I would still recommend the game, but now with over 700 hours of game time I can better fill in what I dont like.
 1. Its been 6 months and several updates, but still Allies can not use each others Carriers or Transports. This effects most players on Allies only, so maybe they don't see it as a major issue. I do and I will tell you why. I use Transports with the Axis and Germany often cant afford to build them or protect them, but Japan can and they get to a point where they have too many of them and they just sit there as wasted IC. Japan needs them in the beginning, but if the Allies go KGF, then they can put a couple Industrial Complexes down to where they dont need as many TP's, then I would send them to the Med. to shuttle German forces. Also Allied Carriers makes no sense not to be able to land a plane on them.
 
 2. The dice. They may be 100% random. I have played this game 30 - 35 years and a roll of the dice can and does change the game, for better or worse. But this version as is... is just off the mark. You will get bombed to oblivion every round, you might shoot down a bomber once in 5 rounds. The same game, you buy a bomber and try an IC raid and you get shot down 1st try. Buy another and again shot down. I have tried it again and got shot down, mean while they are endlessly bombing me into oblivion. Then I have held my bombers in check till I got 3 and sent them and a few times they get threw, but most of the time one gets shot down so I buy one before the turn to replace the one I am about to lose. GOD forbid I get to 5 bombers, cause this seems to be the magic number. Stop sending them if this happens, I have lost 4 bombers in one raid more times than I can count.
 3. Still on the dice, you attack and you have 18 dice at 1 or 2 for a hit and I get no or one hit most of the time and the defender has 18 for 2 and he will get 10 to 14 hits. Tanks tend to stay around 50%, but an attacking bomber? You have 4 chances to hit on every dice for a bomber, yet I have attacked with three a lot of times and missed 2 rounds in a row. I have attack a lone bomber by itself with 2 bombers only to miss twice in a row and the defending bomber hit both times. Stats say it is possible, but I have sat here rolling dice on my table and have never come out with that out come. Yet in game this is a common occurrence.
4. Still on dice, There are players who constantly send a plane out to kill an Inf. A good player will risk it twords the end game to stop an inf or a tank from getting into undefended territory, but this is not what I am talking about. Round 4 in game Moscow needs to keep units in cause of German aggression and Japan has one lone Inf with in range of a plane and they send both planes out each after an Inf and they kill it and have no casulties, no biggie, except they keep doing it every turn and never get a plane shot down. This is BS.
 5. Still on dice....

 I like the game, I used to love it. I still give it a thumbs up.  But fix the Carriers and Transports already.

 I was tempted to just erase the above, but if those changes are made, the game would be Allie favored. This game is well balanced as is. I don't gamble, because I have bad luck at such things, so of course I hate the dice, but I hate lucky things, because I don't get lucky as often as I think I should.

Anywhoo, this is a very accurate recreation of one of the earliest editions of Axis and Allies. I have enjoyed it thus far. There have been much better boxed set editions of AandA( especially since Wizards took over) so it is a antiquated version. If you have experience with any of those this will feel odd. And that's about the only thing I can say is a negative. It does glitch here and there and I have to wait a minute or two for it to reset. Have loved being able to play one of my all time favorite turn based strategy games in a digital format. I can do it much quicker and have the ability to leave mid-game. Will never be as good as taking a day to play it out of the box. But this totally works for what it is  I do love it and recommend giving it a go

Ok quick update. Now that I have experienced a few more rounds of play there are a few tweaks I would like to see. A little more customization in order to create and or add house rules would be nice. A way to cross-talk between all players would be good. And I have seen it mentioned that the dice randomizer is glitchy.....Yeah. I have seen way too many statistical anomalies happen on the regular to comfortably agree with any test results to the contrary. last but not least. how hard would it really be to at least add some alternate rules and the newer unit types available in later copies of the game available in this one?

Only complaints?

The UI, wherein you can't easily click and grab units in some overly crowded zones. Can be worked around by using the selection box, yet it is bothersome, at times.

If you play exclusively zoomed out to see counters (I prefer them to the minis), the counters can cover up critical parts of the map. The infantry counter placement in NW Europe, for instance, conceals the slight overlap of the coastline into Sea Zone 8. Zoom in from time to time to really be aware of the lay of the land (and sea) to avoid unexpected moves. Still, it would be nice to see the infantry marker pushed a smidge away from the coast to avoid new players being surprised here.

Otherwise, a good game with a responsive and active online community. Give this a try if you played the board game or even if you haven't!'

Update:

Some crashes cause the game to undo moves - more than the move or action causing the crash. This seems especially true of a shore bombardment if you cancel it and then move the ship elsewhere. It undoes the ship move and reassigns it to its original shore bombardment. Sub and cruiser moving from Baltic Sea to attack UK starter fleet - it not only unassigned and reassigned the cruiser, it cancelled a sub's move as well. My two lonely fighters ended up attacking the fleet by themselves. Disastrous opening for a ranked game, so be wary of this bug. Still early access, so sticking with the thumbs up, but stuff like this needs to be fixed.

Update 05/20/2022:

A lot more polished and no bugs experienced in over 20 games. Occasionally the game will freeze up and give you a black screen, maybe three times over the 20 games, but it's easily fixed with a restart.

I really was a troll initially about the electronic dice, but it's no different than online poker vs. live cards. You learn to live with it, and evaluate risk. (Maybe a ""fair dice"" ranked ladder down the road would silence the critics).

The graphics and interface are integrated extremely well. With options for drag and drop or (my preference) much like the older hasbro interface.

The devs do try to resolve bugs that affect or crash gameplay. Existing bugs generally resolved by a restart.

For people who've always wanted to play the physical board game but never could find enough friends to play, this is definitely a much welcomed online implementation of the board game.  Don't get discouraged as a newbie! After over 90+ hours of practice playing against the AI, and a nearly equal amount of time watching online games and tutorials by expert players, I still lose much more frequently than win, but I enjoy the games nevertheless as there is always more to learn.

The game also keeps getting better and better with each update. The developers definitely love this game and are committed to improving and maintaining it. The most recent improvements make it easier for newbies like me to keep learning and improving their play.  Each upgrade brings the online version closer to the way the over-the-board version plays.

If you love Axis and Allies, and can't find people to play with face-to-face, this is a must have.  If you want to learn a game that has very complex and intricate strategies, but in which the randomness of the dice (battlefield) plays a significant role, this is also a must have.  Finally, you can play with friends who also have the game very easily. The setup for friendly games is super simple, allowing people of the same skill level to learn the game together before moving on the more challenging matches against expert players.

One thing I'd like to eventually see in a future update ,however, is the ability to send a ""thanks for the game' or other friendly and supportive or otherwise constructive message to one's opponents once an online game concludes or is 'forfeit'.  This would be a nice added feature, for much like in online chess (I'm thinking like the preset messages you can send on LiChess server)  it is very common for people to 'forfeit' (called 'resign' in chess), once they see that defeat is unavoidable. This is not 'rage-quitting', yet it seems some YouTube commentators of streamed games have equated forfeiting to rage-quitting.  Rage-quitting makes it sound like it's an insult to forfeit a game before playing out the last three or four rounds that will prove the game is lost. This is the exact opposite of how both face-to-face and online chess work, where the perceived insult actually comes from NOT forfeiting (not resigning) when it is obvious that defeat is unavoidable even with the time remaining on the clocks.

Basically, I view all games, ranked or not, as amicable competition or learning experiences--the goal is to have fun, don't play if it is not fun. In that context, I want my opponents to know that if I choose to forfeit a game it is because I actually don't want to keep wasting their time as they are going to win, as best as I can assess with my limited skills--just like in chess. Yes, the dice can throw a wrench into the works, but if I estimate the odds of that as being highly unlikely, why should I delay the better player's victory, just on the off chance that I may have a 1000 to 1 against odds of changing the outcome? 

Great game!  Definitely worth the full price!

Now there are some nuances that differ from the board game; which, would be nice to iron out.
Coalition fighters can't land on coalition carriers - this hems up the Allies pretty bad.
Subs' sneak attacks are not immediately removed from the battle strip when destroyers are not present.
Naval Bombardment hits are not immediately removed from the battle strip.
Each landing unit in an amphibious attack rates a naval bombardment - not each landing ship.

This is where It becomes sketchy because they have 2 check boxes selected already to start sending your info so they can analyze your crash.

Honestly, this game is OK. It's a straight port of the board game. If you're really into A&A, it's probably worth the price. But, if you can get it to run, the old version from the '90s is better. It had both deeper options and, more importantly, MUCH better and more intuitive controls. The display style on the board also made it much easier to keep track. 
The controls are the major issue with this version. They are very fiddly, and the display style makes it very hard to tell what's going on once there are multiple unit types moving in a given space. You either have to see every enemy moves, or none. There is no option that I can find to let you, for instance, fast forward the enemy's turn, but still get a closeup of the battles your forces are involved in. As was the case in the previous game.

examples? sure thing.

Germany:
turn 2 i can take UK capitol (london) every game just by building 1 transport and the rest cruiser/destroyer. HOW?by moving my planes to norway after the initial battle against sovjet that also does the same simple and easy move every time

Japan:
make sure no more than 1 transports can reach US and they never build up in the pacific or place troops in alaska, making you able to focus entirely om land battles

US:
focus pacific and VOILA japan is easily defeated as UK has time to build up as well

UK: focus europe. remove germanys fleet and (almost) ignore india by placing 3 infantry each turn

Sovjet: not really much to say its meant to be a suviving battle but play agressive and buy US time to invade france and VOILA you get time to rebuild but that is basically the only nation that actually has a challenge only based on dice rolls

First the negatives:
--No difficulty setting. I played 3 games, and got rolled 3 times. I have played the original board game, and the original PC game so I know my way around it. Played as allies all 3 times and Russia just gets rolled every time. Even letting the computer handle all but USA, Germany rolls Russia every time. I give up.
--Almost no choice of which units get destroyed in combat. They are my units, I want to choose who dies!
--Wonky unit movements and user interface, takes some getting used to. At one time I could not use my naval fighter to help an amphibious assault because it was 3 moves away, and game would not let my carrier move to that spot until the non-combat move.
--Computer kept placing new naval units in occupied sea zone, completely freezing my navy due to combat. The original game had an option to allow or disallow this. 
--No research or weapon improvement ability

Now the positive:
--Added units, and adjusted unit costs
--struggling to find more. Country specific unit models are nice. Updated graphical map and combat screens vs 1998 game.
--Multiplayer ability to play with far away friends?

I got this game quite a while ago since I've always been a fan of the axis and allies game but never played the board game, only seen videos of it. I finally got myself to install it and damn, I'm really glad I got myself to finally play it. It looks like a lot of information at first but it gets a lot easier to get the hang of it after some trial and error. I haven't played that much of it yet, but I definitely see myself playing it quite a bit. A couple of stuff I quite like along with a couple of negatives:

I really enjoy the fact that there are different dice modes so it can keep the game fresh both against the computer and against other people with the custom games mode.
At first I wasn't even quite sure how many people would be playing this game, but it seems there is quite a bit of a player base. Numbers wise it might not look like much but the main thing that caught my interest is that just like in online chess for example, you can run multiple ranked games at the same time. And not only that but you can queue up a search and literally leave the game. The queue for a ranked game doesn't stop regardless if you close the game or not. You can literally just come a couple of hours later and you would already be in a game. You have 24 hours to make a move so its not like you can miss it. Then again when I searched up I got into a game within a minute so Its not like you don't get into games fast anyway, but in the cases that it doesn't pop up fast enough its nice to know that you aren't stuck in the game waiting for something to pop up. Plus when you get into a game you can just queue up for another ranked game while you're still playing the current one. This all might be a standard thing in turn based games but personally I haven't played any, so for me its something new and interesting and overall a quite big positive. The option to play ""co-op"" with a friend or a stranger vs other AI is always welcome and quite fun as well. Helped me get a grasp of the game easier (sorry to the random guy to which had to deal with me taking territories with planes and not going in with infantry to actually capture the territory after which resulted in me stalling the game for longer).

Something that might not seem like much but for me at least it is and its also the reason why I decided to write the review. I was going through some of the reviews of the game and noticed that the developer is quite active. Responding to whoever had issues or questions/needed help. Might not look like much but for me personally, being used to a lot of silence and ignoring of problems that other studios do, its a huge positive in my eyes. Shows that they really do try to fix problems and help other people if someone has an issue.

On a ""negative"" note, the only issue I guess that I have is that as a lot of people pointed out, the transport system is extremely confusing and clunky. Again the developer did state in a review I read that they have added an option to opt out to the previous design but personally I think that they can look into it more and possibly fix the confusion that most players have with the current way it is.

Apart from that I really don't have any complains from the game. It would be nice if they add even more game modes or dice modes or anything else that can create even a bigger variety but I'm happy even with the current way it is. Hopefully they will keep on working on it and improving it with time.

Hope this review was helpful to people and hopefully other people that have no background with turn based games see this and would get an insight of what this game is. Highly recommend the game for people that would like to chill and use their brain without having to feel rushed to make decisions.",1645202607,1645203276,True,4,0,0.540670871734619141,1,True,False,False

For some strange reason, Axis & Allies was unknown among me or my friends in the 80's. We kids played ""Risk"" instead. Didnt realize what I missed out on until now. 

Pros: 
* Strategic depth without too much micro-tinkering. The core gameplay are straight forward - conquer enemy territory and gain troop-production capacity. This can be seen as a contrast to most hexagon-type of turn-based-strategy, where the gameplay are mission based, e.g. conquer X territory in X nr of moves (Panzer Corps, Unity of Command). I prefer Axis and Allies conquering-and- gaining-production-points-style of gameplay with no limit in turns defeating the enemy. 
 
*Built in imbalance in starting round that punishes stalling from both sides. The genius of Larry Harris - he created a starting scenario where the Axis has the troop-placement advantage but the Allies has the troop-production capacity advantage. Slowplay the Axis and the Allies will catch up...   

* Excellent user interface, e.g. big text. One of few strategic games you can actually play from your sofa with Steam-controller. 

Cons:
* AI are at beginner-level. There are some decent opening round moves, but no decent tactics. The AI chooses same tactics every game with small variations. This results in AI fighting tooth and nail for certain territories and Victory cities, while giving up other victory cities almost without a fight. The AI cant figure out how to merge troops from different territories to gain superiority 

* No different scenarios, no customization of victory cities, starting-round troop placement etc.  

*Not possible to skip cutscenes before every dice-battle. Edit: yes it is! Excellent.  

 I warmly recommend this, and I hope the devs add more scenarios in the future.

However, there is one feature the game lacks that breaks it for me.  The lack of a ‘go back’ button.  Yes, you technically have 24 hours to make sure you do your turn properly and yes you are required to hold down the ‘next’ button to proceed to the next phase but as in real life I find it common to be mobilizing units only to notice a unit (or units) I forgot to move.  In the real world this is no big deal.  Even in a highly competitive “I don’t want to lose” game with friends, you allow people to correct such mistakes.  USA wants to bomb Germany on T2 but forgot to move their Bomber to UK T1, I let them move and bomb this turn as it was an obvious oversight and I expect the same leniency in return.  I don’t expect this game to go to that extreme but I don’t think the option to go back to non-combat movement from the mobilization phase is a game-breaker.  It is very discouraging to have so much time invested in a game only to make a simple mistake that then ruins the game.  I realize some people may wish to play in an environment where you capitalize on others oversights, which is fine.  Much like there are multiple options to reduce chance in the dice (or not) there could be an Ironman mode that forbids going back.  For me, until there is an option to correct such oversights the game is unplayable.

Additional map and unit versions would be nice but I guess that’s what TripleA is for.

All in all a good game but with a missing feature that ruined it for me.

I just quit a game where I was attacking russia's 17@2 with my 21 @3 and 4@2, should have been an easy win.  I ended up ""winning"" with one fighter left.  I was logging the rolls for the game, I had switched to ""low luck"" dice for most games because my rolls were so bad but wanted to see if it was as bad as I remembered.  So I entered the results of every roll into a spreadsheet, here's the results.  

I compared my rolls to the average expected result based on a 6-sided die.  If I was rolling @3 I should have a 50% chance, for example.  So at 1 I hit 13.46% instead of 16.66% (expected average), 2 was 14.71% instead of 33.3%, 3 was 38.35% instead of 50%, 4 was 53.85% instead of 66.66%, basically I was about 10+% off all my rolls, and the ones I got hit the heaviest on were my 3's and 4's that you would expect to hit a lot... and that you rely on when you're calculating losses to actually hit something.

Meanwhile the computer's rolls I can't see when it attacks me, I can only see their defense rolls but here they are: 1 was 22.22% instead of 16.67%, 2 was 38.1% instead of 33.3%, 3 was 52.94% instead of 50%, 4 was the only one he didn't beat the average at 62.5% instead of 66.6%, although it should be noted the computer didn't roll very many 4's so that's a smaller sample.  

Now comparing the numbers, you can see that rolling THE EXACT SAME DIE, the computer somehow has an average 10% better chance to land a hit.  That is a huge difference when you're talking a game full of rolls stacking things a little better for the computer.  It always seems to get lucky when it's needed too, like when the odds are close to even it will begin somehow rolling 50%+ hits with 2's, or I'll somehow miss several rounds with all 3's or 4's.  As the russia invasion above, I went 3 rounds with 6@3 with 2 hits, so 2/18 rolls with a 50% chance...

Many many games cheat to overcome the player, and that's ok when it's transparent, but changing the math in a game all about calculations is a frustrating experience and I've ragequit several games I was winning because of unbelievable losses in a single battle.

My original review is below, that was recommended.  I will change it back if they ever release a fix for this but it's unlikely.  

Good recreation of the board game without the long setup time.  If you liked the board game, this is the electronic version.  

If you never played the board game, this is a ww2, turn based game where your turn advances in stages.  Each area you control gives you industrial production, which you use to buy your units at the beginning of your turn.  Then you perform your combat moves, where you distribute your forces, each of which attacks on a 6 sided die roll.  Stronger units hit easier, with differing attack and defense roll values.  

I don't play the game online, just vs the AI usually.  I expect it would be fun with other players, but the long time of the turns might get boring.  As for the AI, it sucks as usual.  After you play vs it, you can make certain moves and know how the computer will react, or what it is going to do next when you see it perform certain ""setup"" actions.  It isn't very good at being predictable, or gauging how many units/where it should be defending.  It goes by what it thinks is enough, and doesn't plan ahead many turns or see problems in time to react to them.  It will try to defend everything and not fortify its victory cities enough, or attack with too few forces and lose everything.  It doesn't factor in the ""cost of replacing units in battle"" enough, just trying to decide whether it can win a territory, not whether winning it is worth it in units, time, or ability to get reinforcements/keep the territory.  

I only get a up or down vote, but the game does have a few problems.  I get a weird -1 kill count bug sometimes during combat that crashes the game.  It remembers the exact place and roll when it does, so no big deal other than a few secs to restart.  Similarly, I've seen a few graphical hit bugs where the game will say I got X hits but take more/less off my stacks.  I think it is calculating the rolls right, but displaying the hits wrong.  Again, not a huge deal but how hard is it to display the resulting hits from rolling a bunch of 6 sided dice?  The graphics are not good, and the UI is clunky and slow to react on my 8 core 16 thread ryzen with 32g memory.

Now the game delivers on it's promise, but the default game is pretty heavily sided with the axis, there is a game mode option that lets you change the default starting conditions, but I wish it let you do a ""custom start scenario"" or use first edition rules with high tech rolls (who doesn't love heavy bombers).  A scenario builder or even map maker could easily be built on top of this game and increase it's replayability by a factor of 100.

The last part is conspiracy theory, but this game's version of random seems to favor the computer AI so much  I can't rely on standard statistics to calculate rolls.  Yes random has some streaks in it, but the game gets so ""lucky"" sometimes, for several fights in a row, I have trouble believing it is just luck.  I could give individual examples but that doesn't prove anything.  Basically, you have to always bring way more units than you think you need, because the computer seems to beat the ""expected average"" by several hits almost every time, while your ""easy hit"" units repeatedly fail to hit somehow.  Nothing is worse than 3 infantry taking out your infantry, tank, artillery, and fighter.  I thought it must be me, but I googled the question and apparently it was such a problem the devs did a ""random test"" to make sure it was, then implemented biased roll options because the players had such a problem with the rolls, so it isn't just me feeling this way.",1641926873,1643849219,False,2,0,0.541984736919403076,0,True,False,False

I've enjoyed playing Axis and Allies forever and a day. From the board game, to msnzone/warzone hasbro, up to triple A games.
This 'early access' game takes the cake.

Pros:
A working autosave feature. Never lose your work.

Defensive Profiles. Want to change your German submarines to auto submerge?

Hot seat and single player and ladder play online, 

A strong community thus far of people that enjoy playing what i call: Risk on roids.
https://discord.gg/DFMnGF

I was not sure initially what to make of asynchronous play and reserved my judgement. I was rewarded.
Although players do not select each and every piece on defense..asynchronous play shines in this rendition of axis and allies.
Need to go do some real life stuff? Your opponent may take their turn.

It's Beamdog. A top notch company with production values.

Cons:
No editor.
No 'bid system'
UI is vastly improved yet could use some polish.
The AI is 'just ok'

Overall, I'll be enjoying this title, and i hope you do to!
20 bones gets you in the door to countless hours of fun.

It has single handedly ruined every session my friends and I have tried to play so far. If you have a stack of transport ships that need to pick up units and move them during your combat phase, you might as well just quit. The game uses this archaic series of arrows and summary screens to try to communicate what you're doing, and if that wasn't terrible enough the system of selecting one ship from the stack is nearly impossible to navigate. How hard is it to pick up 4 tanks and 4 infantry with 4 transports? Hard enough that you'll be lucky to send 3 ships with 4 units between them. And it's not frustrating in a cute, ""I just need to learn the UI"" sort of way. It's a total slog. Avoid it until they get their act together.

Love the fact I can play as many games as I want without the hours of set up time. What drags this game down to a zero is the dice mechanics. Every time they to make a chance to the dice system it goes from bad to worse. The dice will be 100% random in terms of earning you hits or not to the point that you cant play the game. If i use a two fighters on a carrier, i would expect to win and maybe lose one fighter. Not play 5 rounds where i land 1 hit and the carrier kills both my fighters. This goes along with other units as well. It makes risky moves impossible ones and often games are decided before turn 1 is over based upon who is getting more fucked by the dice rather than who is making the smarter moves/ investments. One game last 30 turns because Russia stacked nothing but inf and was winning on attacks on Germany who had inf, arty and tanks. Eventually Germany won but why does 15 units attacking at 1 land 7 hits per turn where tanks defending at a 3 land  nothing that same time? I love this game but it makes it impossible to play at times where by the time turn one ends and its already a lost cause to keep playing.  its also frustrating to see thought and planing going into an attack or defence and see it being wiped out with little to no cost to the enemy. I had the PC version  of this back in the 90s and that game had a better dice mechanic in it. Lastly, they prevent you from using profanity  in the game. Its great unilt you try to spell do, Germany, Japan, troops, end, ect.

You can set it up so you get emailed when it is your turn, making for very easy management. Compared to the version that was bouncing around 20ish years ago, this one is superior. It uses the 3.0 rules for ranked which is an attempt to even the Allies/Axis win rates. There is a note system as well, where you can leave yourself notes. Quite handy when you have multiple games going on.

Cons: I've been playing strategy games for far too long and I hate to say this but the user Interface is probably the worst I have ever seen. You will have to grapple with it a lot. When you're ""used to it"" it's functional, but you can never plot moves and step away from the game, because when you sit back down all the swirling arrows with inconsistent pathing and vague trajectories is just plain incomprehensible. It's also completely inconsistent. Units are just placed randomly into territories. Sometimes all scrunched in a corner, sometimes left, sometimes right. There is no rhyme or reason to any of it.

Bugs: I have run into 1 soft lock which ended a game. Besides that, no problems for 20+ games. 2 additional crashes, but the game went right back in without issue and there is an internal report function. Some bad interface interactions when it comes to accounting dice in certain situations (like amphibious w/ bombardments) that make things more confusing than they need to be, but it's still functioning. Besides the soft lock, I have not experienced any bad bugs.

Dice: They're dice. It's a dice game. It WILL screw you over eventually (and sometimes a lot). This is the nature of probabilities.

Russia can no longer just stack infantry in Karelia to survive.  Yet the old strategy of buying a lot of infantry, and an occasional fighter still seems to work well.

So far, I am impressed with the Germany/Russia/Japan land campaign, but must admit that I have not yet tried playing any faction with a real navy just yet.  Landing fighters after combat on aircraft carriers may prove to be difficult.

One other item that has proved to be difficult to learn so far, is that you really have to ""PRESS & HOLD"" that END TURN button, or else the player's turn just does not advance to the next phase.

Also, use patience with the opposing force's turns, as the game has not stalled out on the human player, those AI countries just take a long while to make their decisions.

All-in-all, I am enjoying this game.  Just wish there had been a better set of readable instructions included with it.  My one country experience so far (Russia), suggests that playing a dozen or more ""throw-away"" games is the only instruction manual.  Sort of explains why it is a $10 dollar game currently.

In summary, my advice is this:  If you are a game player that enjoys turn based games, historical games, or strategy games, then you will probably enjoy this version of Axis & Allies as well, but it's going to take some time investment to learn how to play it.

It's is only really worth playing online with actual people in my opinion.

I preferred the old Axis and Allies PC game we had in the 90's. (Sorry)

My main issues with this iteration of Axis and Allies is there seems to be bugs that require working out with the AI.
 
Japan and the United States always steam roll the entire map, yet when the computer AI controls Germany it rots like a dying fish and barely puts up a fight. I don't understand why the AI is different between the nations, but it sure seems to be.

Idk, at the end of the day I do recommend this game. But it's 10x more fun playing with actual people rather than the AI. If you play singleplayer you'll essentially play the same game every time, same outcome, same everything. The computer sucks at adapting. Either the computer is unstoppable or a complete moron, why is there no in between? Or even a setting allowing varying levels of difficulty for the AI? You know like most RTS games have in a skirmish mode like ""easy, medium, hard, brutal"" or something along those lines?

I also am aware that there are three modes for dice rolls, I only ever play on random because it seems like that would be the most balanced. However some games it heavily leans in favor of one specific nation. I've had a game where Japan ALWAYS had amazing rolls, I've also seen it where the US gets godlike rolls constantly. All of this occurs on ""random"". 

Seems like there is some balancing to be done between the AI and the ""random"" dice roll mechanics.

Outside of those complaints the game itself does scratch the itch for an Axis and Allies showdown. I don't recall how much this game was, but I don't remember it being expensive. So even with the things I complained about I do feel the game is worth the price tag.

One final note, I will give the developer credit for how far this game has come. I bought this game back when it was early access and that being said it has improved since then.

The AI in this game is not good.  It's not challenging, and makes poor decisions.  Just silly stuff.  The only good way to play this game is against human beings.

The profanity filter in the game is both (1) a bad idea, and (2) poorly implemented.  It is VERY frustrating leaving notes in a multiplayer game, to the point where my friends have stopped doing it.  I still suffer through the system to try to leaver them messages.

The lack of a save and load feature (besides the exit save) is annoying, and speaks to the sense that the game developers have a paternalistic attitude about their player base.  If my friends and I want to save a multi-player game and see what would happen if someone tries strategy X, and then also see what would happen if that same person would have tried strategy Y, why can't we do that?  The answer, of course, is that the developers probably want to avoid people ""save scumming"" in single-player games--who cares?

The lack of mod support is also frustrating.  It would be so nice to be able to simply modify the start conditions of the game so that you could play out different scenarios.  Wouldn't it have been fun to be able to make your own scenario so you could start the war in 1940?  1941?  1939?  Nope.

All that said, this is a great way for me to play a PBEM game with my friends when we're too busy to get together in person to play a proper wargame.  If that's what you're looking for, then this game does that OK and you might be happy.  This is not a good single-player game, and I would caution anyone against buying it for that purpose.",1641335467,1641335467,False,2,0,0.546044051647186279,0,True,False,False

This version of A&A is probably the best video game/online version I've played over the years. Setting up the multiplayer was a little wonky, but once it gets rolling it is well thought out and a smooth experience. Excellent game as always, and represented well here. Hoping it does well so we see other versions introduced down the road. Highly recommend!

Note about the dice since it is mentioned heavily in reviews -
Axis and Allies dice can be a thorn in the side of many players - online, or in-person. It is the nature of the beast. I have been playing it since the mid-80's. It sucks to lose, especially when we think we have the odds in our favor. 

There is 'nothing' different with the dice in this version than the real version. Except maybe that the developers have added dice alternatives to pander to people who do not like this component of the game. Those who feel it is biased or unevenly stacked. 

I have played live games with people who roll garbage turn after turn. It is so sad it is comical. Even they laugh...after the tears dry. Regardless, a healthy way to view dice in A&A (I take no credit for this as it is likely a confluence of many views I've seen over the years):

The dice act as a way to account for the randomness of warfare. Even with the odds in our favor in a particular battle, the dice account for things such as - weather, supply line problems, harsh terrain; tanks stuck in mud, planes bombing through heavy fog, troops trudging through snow; fighters strafing your runway before you can get off the ground, artillery misfiring or worse - friendly fire; ships going off course, or breaking down, an enemy commander with an exceptional defense or counter-attack strategy, etc. etc., etc. The best strategy in the world can be thrown off by unforeseen events. There is a lot of events in war that are simplified in this game by the dice rolling. It accounts for said occurrences even though it is unspoken.

Another aspect - 
As we brought this back to the table again end of 2021 - some complaining took place from all of us about infantry shooting down bombers, etc. I did some digging afterwards and found this great attitude about such things - units on the board are representations of divisions, squadrons, fleets. Said units are often accompanied by anti-aircraft equipment. So while at face value it seems ridiculous an infantry division is taking out a bomber - they might have AA with them, or fighter support, or the bomber was flying low due to bad weather and hit a mountainside. :-D",1641324910,1641324910,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Transport loading and unloading is somehow made extremely complicated. Also highly annoying is the inability to pick combat order, it's picked for you which is ridiculous.

If you've played the board game, enjoy the board game, and you want to be able to play your friends who also understand and enjoy Axis and Allies, then this is by all means a great game!

The game is certainly not without its flaws, i.e. questionable dice rolling (I recommend low-luck dice); questionable casualty decisions (defense profiles help, but it would be nice if there was an option to allow the other player to pick their own casualties if they are there and present for the combat); the interface is a bit clunky at times and doesn't allow for an undo if you get click happy; and finally, the single player AI is abysmal and ridiculously easy. 

The game shines as a multiplayer experience that allows you to play what is a very long game in segments - very similar to the old play by email style versions of this game. The fact that the players have the capability to play the game at different times is a really great feature. 

Honestly, the biggest drawback to the game has nothing to do with mechanics, design, or AI; instead, it is that the developers chose the A&A 1942 ruleset - I really don't care for that particular version. If Beamdog released a DLC for the 50th Anniversary Edition or the 1940 Global Set, I would buy it on the spot, no questions asked.

What this means is that games last a week or more at worst, as each player can take up to 24h to make their move. This is ridiculous and caused me to lose interest very rapidly in a game that I was seriously anticipating. 

The game itself is great, it's a fun ww2 board game with lots of room for strategy. Despite the issues with this game, I do enjoy it a lot, but the fact that there's no time option right now just makes it unplayable for me. I need my games done in 2 hours at MOST. For me a 45m or 1h option is a must. 

Now to some of the in-game issues. The most obvious one is the axe that the axis get turn 1 without any chance of counterplay, which is frustrating. Japan almost always loses half their navy including a carrier which is just wonderful, and Germany loses a bomber and massive amounts of troops in Ukraine. A big misrepresentation in the game and something that might throw you off if you're a history person is that the USSR vs Germany and Japan vs China fights are hilariously lopsided. Yes, it's a very UK/USA focused game. So much in fact that China is owned by the US and is worth some 4 points and NEVER holds. The USSR on the other hand is stuck to producing 8 infantry every turn, at least that's what I've seen Allied players do. Italy is also missing. It's just sad that they could add China and Italy and make this game a much more balanced experience with even more room for strategy but instead they went with this simple approach. But hey I guess even after you lose 20 million men in a war, ww2 board games will still misrepresent you as a small part of the conflict. Looking at you, USSR and China. 

So that's it, a decent game overall. Could be MUCH better. Don't recommend until they add the timer.",1638010068,1638010068,False,1,1,0.507844030857086182,0,True,False,False

for those not familiar with the mechanics of hasbro's game, the learning curve might be a bit intimidating, but well worth the effort.
there are some tweaks that could be made..
-First (and most important), no research.  that was always my favorite part of the board game...risking that precious money to make your troops better adds so much to the game. we always made house rules to expand on the research part, so hopefully that could be added in an expantion or something
-Second, a clearer picture of what your opponents accomplished during their turn.  
territories gained, troops destroyed, or troops repositioned during non-combat
-Third, how much IPC,s each country is earning per turn.  perhaps I never found it during my first playthrough, but it seemed that was a mystery as opposed to the board game where that was clearly visible to all.
and thats it.  those 3 things are the only faults I could find...the AI is smart, the board is clearly visible (not to mention a vast improvement to the 45 minutes+ it takes to set up the board during the real game...and most importantly, your dog cant ruin a game with a single wag of its tail, scattering your peices everywhere..haha (happened more than once).

Great job guys. Well done. This game stays so close to the board game i played as a kid and still do to this day. From the start locations of troops to the victory point conditions. Bravo. The only down side is the limited replayability of the game without friends or others to challenge my mind. I beat it with the axis and the allies and tinkered a little here and there and it is only 7 hours.  

I believe giving the player a little flexability in terms of starting conditions/victory conditions, would go a long ways to more replayablility. There is a bit too much clicking on the transport side, though i can understand why, took me a minute to figure easiest way out. I had 2 friends buy it already, now i just have to get them to play it with me. They are scared i think.

Movement can be a bit of a pain sometimes, normally with transports and loading / unloading, many a time I have had to move all transports out to load one and send it off then cancel an empty transport move to load it and send it off. The map has disappeared a couple of times after combat but I found the mouse wheel brings it back. Imagine this will get fixed with a patch in the near future.
See they now offer another starting setup..... think they could offer several more variants this or maybe give each side three choices of setup :- Germany (Rommel setup = another tank in Africa)(Manstein=2 Infantry in Poland)(Kesselring=1 Infantry in France, Italy and Germany).

This is common- 10 tanks (need 3 or lower for each) to roll 4,5,5,6,6,3,3,4,4,6.  That is 2 hits where you have a 50/50 chance on each.  Then the next roll will have 1,1,1,4.

I would still recommend this game to people who want to play against others, or within a group of friends. The solo or computer play is lacking though. 
1) The computer is predictable, it makes the same moves every time depending on what country they are controlling. 
(Also Russia, in my opinion,  should NOT get to attack Germany on the first turn, this makes the game unrealistic to the challenge that was WW2.. Russia was mainly a defensive force.
2) There should be degrees of difficulty for the computer, ""EASY"" to get people drawn in, ""REGULAR"" for casual play and ""HARD"" for those who want a challenge. I havent played Axis and Allies (the board game) for about 20 years, an easy mode would have been a great way to warm back into the game. 
3) More options to tweak your individual game play, like being able to change who are the Axis and who are the Allies. Other options could be like having the ability to create handicaps (One player gets an additional amount of points every round more than the others) This would create new and interesting outcomes for the game play.

I've started more than 5 single-player games and each time after 2-3 moves and solid troop positioning, the combat system decides a group of 3-4 infantry is able to wipe out my attacking tanks, artillery, and airplanes! I gave developers the benefit of doubt, thinking maybe early in the game the Axis had a significant bias, but after many moves the computer just kept rolling over all my hard-fought resources.

If it had only been one or two games, I'd be frustrated but could keep trying, but a few games with the same results of hugely-biased computer rolls tells me the game is beyond redemption. Recommend don't waste your money.

[edit] - the bias dice and low luck modes do make it a little more balanced, but still heavily favors the computer player--roll algorithms are just not realistic. A force of 2 tanks (4 or less), a fighter (3) and an infantry (1) should not get owned by a single infantry (1 or 2). A force of 5 bombers (4) should not flame out against two tanks (4). 

Reliably, when the computer has a superior force, it's over on the first roll. When you have the superior force, you have to sit on the edge of your seat and suppress all the #@&#!! that come to mind as you watch amazing roll after amazing roll by the computer. I really enjoyed the first A&A (Atari/TimeGate 2004/06), where you had tactical combat control and could leverage your advanced units to decimate inferior infantry forces. If you didn't want to spend the time in combat, you could let the computer do a ""roll"" for the outcome, similar to this game.

Yeah.  Me, too.
So, anyway, I really wanted to love this game, but... I can't spend more than a few minutes playing it before my eyes cross and the impatience descends upon me like a dark cloud of buzzing, biting flies.  I grew up playing the board game and broke it out recently to play with one of my sons.  The board game was famously flawed -- I won't go into all the reasons why -- and really the only reason a person in the modern world would play it is for reasons of nostalgia.  War games and board games both have come so far in the intervening years, even the casual ones.
Well, unfortunately, this computerized version of the flawed board game doesn't really make it easier to play, other than not having to deal with all the fidgety little pieces (and let's be honest -- those little pieces were what made the board game so cool back then), and that hoped-for ease was the only reason I bought this.  Granted, the learning curve isn't all that huge if you are familiar with (any version of) the board game, but going through all the steps... I don't know.  I can't explain it intellectually, all I can say is that my son and I found this game emotionally draining and blah.  I guess the tl;dr is, if you're going to play a computer war game, play a modern one, not a computer port of an old, flawed board game for nostalgic reasons.

The game utilizes complex tactics involving sea combat, aerial combat, resource production, bombing raids, combined assaults during beach invasions, and blitz mechanics for tanks, allowing for a varied strategy. Unfortunately this game suffers from the same problem as the original 1942 edition of the game that the 1940 Edition never suffered; Axis fatigue. With Germany fighting for itself on 3 fronts (Africa/Middle East, the Western coast and the Eastern baltics), you will have to pick a theater and hope to god that the Japanese player/AI does a competent enough job to take heat away from the US. In the 1940 Edition, the Axis had the addition of Italy as a playable faction, which while far weaker than Japan and Germany, allowed the German player to focus less on losing the southern regions. Lacking also are the Research Upgrades that you could use to surprise the enemy with. Playing as the axis, you can make or break your entire campaign within the first 3 turns, especially if you play as Germany. Japan has more lee-way with the weaker Asian countries that it can steamroll, but then has to contend with the giant that is the US after turn 5. Unless you're a strategic genius, or you just get lucky with the dice in a few battles, you'll be heading into a sure-fire loss if you don't take out Russia before turn 10. This is all relatively accurate to the board game though.

Overall, the game is fun and offers a lot of great depth even after understanding and grasping the meta and the game here does an excellent job at recreating the board game experience, with the help of plenty of useful tutorials and informational aids to the player during play, but it unfortunately suffers from the same balance issue as the 1942 version.

It also offers multiplayer. In doing so, it also adds an interesting play-by-mail type feature where you can play on and off in a multiplayer match with someone, finishing your turn within 24 hours by coming back to the game when you feel ready or have the time. This is a must-have feature for a game like this and it transforms the game more into a chess-like struggle and less a competitive beat-the-clock type game.

As for future updates, will other factions, units (mechanized infantry), and Research upgrades be implemented? Well it varies. On the one hand you have the community managers saying they won't be, but on the Early Access video the CEO of Beamdog says it's absolutely a goal if the game sells well enough. Personally, taking or leaving the other faction additions, Research was always an important aspect of the 1941 and 1940 editions of the game and without them in the 1942 edition it feels like the players have no way out when things start turning against them. Once Russia begins steamrolling, it's the end of the Axis. Once the US takes out Japan, it's the end of the Axis. With the addition of technology, it's not so clear cut, as heavy bombers allow you to deal far more damage behind enemy lines and improved shipyards can help you reclaim lost sea territory. While the core 1942 game can definitely stand on its own and be a fun afternoon with friends or a week long war through the play-by-mail feature of the multiplayer, the lack of the above content feels like a missed opportunity.

Massive improvements to the game every update, the game went from a clunky, unrefined interface to a simplistic and easy ui. Honestly, if you've played this game online last year, you can tell just how utterly improved it is. Three new dice modes make for some interesting play, and the ability to play competitively makes it a lot more fun. Im in school, so its very hard to get 4 other friends to sit down for 8 hours and play the game. I have a game going on right now with 3 other friends where we just take turns online, which streamlines the gameplay and still allows us to play. The ONLY downside to this game is the AI. The AI is extremely predictable, and only has one gameplay to it. If you play as the Axis, it is guaranteed that America will completely and utterly withdraw from the Pacific, and join forces with the British in the Atlantic to launch a D-Day. They will only ever buy destroyers and cruisers, never aircraft carriers, subs, or battleships. Russia will be extremely offensive but will only ever buy infantry and artillery. If you play as the Allies, the Japanese will withdraw completely from the Pacific to invade mainland Asia from the backside, completely ignoring India to take out Russia. Germany will ignore all of Africa to go full force into Russia, and never tries to defend a D-Day. The AI gameplay is good, but there is only ever one option, and so it is NOT a repeatable way to play the game. If you don't have at least 2 friends who are willing to dish out $20 for the game, I would recommend NOT getting the game, as the AI isn't a good use of your money and the competitive play is iffy due to most players never taking their turns and a game forfeit after 24 hours.",1634683156,1634683156,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game ends when either side captures enough key provinces.  Axis tries to get Moscow and Calcutta(India).  Allies try to get Shanghai and France, Italy and/or Germany.   The scales have tipped by the time either side has these provinces so the game ends.  

The AI is okay (at best) at handling the limited objectives.  But the AI uses the same strategy each game.  For example, I have never seen the USA try to win in the Pacific in any game.  I haven't seen Japan try to invade the USA either.  Germany always builds troops and artillery first round, never tanks.  Opening moves are always the same.

The game has a ""total victory"" mode where you have to capture all key cities including capitals, but the AI doesn't know what to do after it gets or loses the provinces mentioned above.  It lacks programming.

It's been good fun for at least 30 hours of play, well worth the cost of the game, but it's getting a bit repetitive now.  I haven't tried playing against other humans but I bet that's a blast.",1628548366,1630561087,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I do not know what board game version they adapted, but it is bad. The map is cluttered and nearly impossible to read. Numbers, circles, numbers inside of circles, dull, washed out colors, the map and unit numbers blur together in an almost incoherent jumble. Unit pictographs are tiny and not well defined. I've played numerous A&A adaptations on the PC, and this is by far the worst in terms of visual interface.

The UI is not intuitive. As a veteran A&A player, I know what I want to do, but figuring out how to do it with this game's interface is nearly impossible. It feels like it can't decide if it wants to be point and click or drag and drop, and the pop-ups are not helpful. 

The gameplay is equally atrocious. There is no option to adjust the AI or gameplay at all, and it most certainly needs it. Defiinitely feels like tha AI is rigged against you. Take, for example, many of the standard A&A opening moves. We all know them, we've played them a thousand times. Try them yourself, you will get curbstomped without fail. But miraculously, the AI pulls off all the classic openings more often than not with relative ease. It's hard to judge gameplay balance because the AI is so flawed and cannot be scaled in any way.

On top of all of these gameplay flaws, the game is glitchy as hell. Constant error messages, skipping, stuttering, crashing out of the battle screen only to be jolted back in suddenly, sometimes with the error resolved, sometimes not.

Overall it is a frustrating experience. I am a veteran of both the table top and previous electronic versions of this game, and this one just doesn't hack it. It's not true to any version of the board game I've ever played, although to be fair, I've been playing for like 25 years and they may have released some dumbed-down 'new' version of the board game I'm not aware of. I've played 2nd and 3rd edition, as well as numerous remakes such as World at War, expansions, etc, and this one just plain doesn't hack it.

When there are free alternatives out there that may not have the graphics, but blow this game out of the water in terms of gameplay, this one is a hard pass.",1628015702,1628015702,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

However, with the Axis and Allies in Steam, I can just open the game anytime, playing with AI with a very little downtime on each turn, and I can finish a game in like a hour. It's great if you want something to cure your nostagia.

I've played every Video game version of A&A and this one is (STILL), BY FAR, the worst.

In the product page it says this: 

July 2019
""Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?
“We expect to stay in Early Access for a few months with regular updates.”""

This game has been in early access for almost 2 years now, and it still lacks basic functions from the Boardgame like research and Allied Carriers. 

After 20 games I thought I'd elaborate on some other issues :

1) There is no way to watch an an animated review/recap of previous turns 
2) there is no way to review a game after it happens, it just unceremoniously ends 
3) there are no graphs and charts for stats over multiple turns 
4) there are functionally no alternative maps and scenarios
5) information is needlessly buried in tiny windows in the bottom of the screen
6) units are often left behind due to confusing UI and masking by Graphics
7) game looks like mobile cancer 
8) game uses too much space between assets between phases so you can't see clearly whats goign to happen
9) the Dice programming is bad and they should feel bad 
10) it doesn't tell you WHY you lost a game or give you a warning when the opponents are close 

In short this game is still much worse then even the JAVA based one and takes no advantage of its larger budget and steam access. 

20 games in, still a thumbs down, someone's wasted a lot of money making this game. 

My original comment about transports which has been somewhat fixed: 

The Transport mechanics are so hopelessly broken that I'd return the game if I hadn't accidentally left it on all night and blown past the window.

Strict interpretation of the board game rules that don't work well on the computer. They make you click for everything. A simple combat can take several minutes of clicking, no option to commit to the battle and determine results. Simply awful for something that should be gratifying. Worst time suck ever.

After your opponent's turn, you're given 24 hours to make your move which can all be executed under 10 - 15 minutes on average or even quicker depending on how much you want to contemplate your moves. Playing the board game version, it would become tedious and very rarely if ever did a game complete the same day it was started. Often, the game direction would be dictated in the first two rounds. 

The digital version removes the crowded aspect of miniatures on zones that comes with the board game but in some ways, adds a bit of its own. Meaning, when you have a unit move, either attacking or non-combat, it draws a line from your starting location to the destination. This can lead to a bit of clutter but with time, you can adjust and become cognizant about how the digital version performs. As of this writing, the developers are working on reducing this clutter. And in some cases, you may leave a unit behind.

Starting out I've played against the AI which has a major failing in that it doesn't take into account the grand strategy but instead focuses on small, regional conquests. So while it may have assets it can bring into a fray, it more often will leave those units behind and attack with less strength than you were expecting. For its failings, it does its job adequately and for new players, it serves as a good primer to become used to game controls and flow.",1624478249,1624478249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Having played this game for 25 years and on ewarzone, I was sure that the 24 hours time limit for a turn was going to break the game but not its actually make it really nice to play. when you start a ranked game, you can usually play a few hours without having to wait the dreaded 24h. players are fast and when you are tired or want to go, you just leave and come back when you want, and usually the oponent come back in a few minutes or 1 hour.

If you start a game and the oponent leave for too long, you can start another game right away, even 2 or 3 or more game at the same time. So the 24h work fine for any case. it improve the game.

Also im not sure about having no chat in the game...! I mean come on!!!! what game is not proper more than axis and allies to have a little chat while playing?...Well again, id like to have alittle chat ingame but on the other side, not having a douche that constantly whine about the dice results and tell you to hurry up is a actual relief :) soooo maybe its a good idea not to put ingame chat... but then again its always nice to chat and get to know the community...axis and allies gather to a small select group and meeting the same players over and over again will probably happen, id did for me twice.

As for the gameplay, its impecable, the interface, the music, the sounds, its really fast to find a game, the matchmaking seem even, no crash, and the only time i had one, the restart was exactly after the dice rolls in the middle of a battle, so not even  reroll.

What else? Its just amazing, a dream come true to have this classic cult game revived and having the whole community respond. I would have paid 80$ usd for this game easy, even more. another thousands hours of this game will be added to my life for sure.

As much as I love this game, it seems like everything is heavily leaning in the axis favor in this version, and I swear the game itself will cheat in favor of the axis. 

In this version the Axis are way more stacked up initially than they were in the original, combine that with the fact that Russia is broken up into huge chunks of territories in the east, making it to where japan can be on the Russian border in just a few turns. o and the axis only need 9 victory cities to win, when the allies need 10. I wonder if they could possibly stack the odds anymore in the axis favor! considering these factors, its no wonder that every average two bit player that thinks they are an expert because they watched an axis tutorial video on YouTube, wants to play as the axis so that he can feel like a good player.

As if the axis advantage wasn't enough, I have seen time and time again where the axis player attacks a huge defensive force but only loses 2-3 units in the battle, additionally I have seen axis defenders that the game makes into super defenders, allowing maybe 10 units at 2 get 8 hits in the first round for example. and lets don't forget that the German AA gun has to be the greatest AA gun ever made, with about a 50% kill rate!

All in all this is a great game, but I have always loved playing as the allies. with all of the concerns mentioned above, I believe I am going to have to give this game a break.

++Positives++

I have put quite a few hours into it, just against the AI which I beat nearly every time but still enjoy playing it.

--Feedback--

Hoping more versions of the game are added as expansions or updates. Would love to see the 1941 Europe, Pacific (with the global option) 2nd editions. I imagine it would be hard online as a longer experience but fingers are crossed and I'm sure I'm not the only one hoping for this.

!! Final Thoughts!!

During AI turns (and likely online but I don't know) I have no control over casualty choices during combat. This speeds up the game but can be a critical decision space at times. Not sure if this is a plus or minus.

The board game itself is great. If you don't like the 2nd edition Board Game then that is not really an issue relevant to this adaptation. The randomness of the dice rolls and the different strategies is what brings you back for more. As Axis do I go for Russia, England or even the US first? As Allies do I concentrate on fighting Japan or Germany? Do I need to establish more strength in the ocean or can I begin my invasions with what I have? Do I drive into Moscow this turn or try to build up a few more tanks before trying to take Russia? As Russia how do I slow down Germany's push until the British and US are slowing them down on the Western front? A satisfying game.",1589468157,1621689057,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Keeping in mind that the game is in early accsess: It does work.
The game itself feels stable, it has not crashed to me (played most since May 2021)

The UI and visuals are fine. I can farily easy tell the difference between a transport, destroyer and a cruiser.
Red movements for air units and blue for ships is nice. 
Ladder-game seems OK, and is very exciting. 
No interaction with the other player yet (as far as I could tell. Mabye a notification comes if the other player quits and waits 24 hours to make his move? if not, we need that) 

Some issues:
1: The AI is not great, so playing this game alone gets boring eventually. 

2: It gets a little tricky to keep everything under control when you move many units at once, especially when transports are involved. Transports are the hardest units to control properly. For example:
Did I move all the transports? Did that transport load units? Did it load the tank and the infantry, or did it load two infantry and left the other transport with just one tank and a artillery stuck on the coastline? (Always load the infantry last to solve that)

3: Defense profile
I understand the reason behind this. And it is smart, allowing one player to make his turn independently of the other player. 
However, there are so many cases of defensive combat, that 1 profile at the time can't really cover it all.
Two examples that bothers me a little. 1: Sometimes you might have to sacrifice bombers or AA-guns in the first volley of combat, because you have to defend the territory. other times, you want to keep those units safe, despite low (or zero) hit chance later on.
2: Carriers and fighters: Ideally, you want the best dice in combat, but you must prepare for the possibility that your units survive, and then the aircraft might need that carrier to land. Loosing all fighters first is wrong, and loosing all carriers at first is wrong if your fighters cant land anywhere else.     

What I want in the future of this game:
1: Assign a specific defensive profile to a territory. I have different priorites in defending a capital vs a normal territory.

2: A warning that ask you if you wish to shore bombard a territory if warships capable of this are in the sea-zone where amphibious combat takes place.

2: A optional notification that tells the player that a transport or a bomber has been left unattended in a sea zone / territory. There is a difference between forgetting to move units, and not seeing the units because of the UI. (This happens a bit to much in this game IMO)  

3: Another optional notification, that tells the player that a transport was not unloaded.

All that said, I recommend the game! It is fun, it works and it gets better for each patch that comes out :) And what I struggle with regarding movement and defense-profiles, might improve on me as I play more

While this is ideal for people with very busy schedules or during the week, it would be nice for those players who have a few hours to spare on  the weekend to have an option for a quick game with limited time allotments for turns.

1. The AI is completely terrible which means that its impossible to practice single player in order to get better because its nothing like multiplayer
2.  Incredibly Long Games
-For someone who just wants to play a quick game in one session, its not gonna happen, the game allows a 24 hour grace period per TURN, one turn. I understand that its great for people who are short on team but for the player who just wants to get a quick game in they need to add a modifiable turn timer limit so people can play games within a few hours, no days or even months
3. Very needed DLC
-The game's replay ability stops after a few weeks with similar scenarios every time which is why there are multiple versions to play
- A $10 DLC of a version like global 1940 would easily add variability and more time to invest in the game
4, Very Click Intensive
-The Battles include needless clicking to get through a single battle, one to start the battle, one to roll your dice, one to roll the enemy dice, one to select casualties, and that's just one turn in the battle and there can be multiple battles of this. This leads to constant clicking and time wasting that drags the game along when it could move much faster.

- Sea Transport is not super clear and sometimes a bit buggy
- There is no easy access to a section where you can have a review of all the troops and their ability. I use Alt+tab and go in the rule book, however, that sometimes makes the game crash.
- The AI is pretty easy and there is no option to choose a Hard AI. But ok, it is A&A online after all. 
- When you follow an other player, the battle part sometimes blocks for a while.
- This game does not work on my laptop (on which GTA V works). Only on my gaming PC.

The way transports function needs to be fixed. Drag and drop and detail exactly how you want to load your transports with the selected units. Then make the transports move as a group the same way every other stack works. Also, a ""Go Back"" or ""Are you sure you want to end x Phase?"" Needs to be added, Did you get distracted and forget to move some critical units? Sucks to be you, you lose.

Like most strategy games, the AI is only strong enough to give you a feel for how the game works. If you are going to get this game, make it for the flawless online play. The game gives players 24 hours to take a turn in ranked matched and 48 hours for casual games. This system makes playing online a similar experience to play-by-email without having to exchange save files.

The dice rolls are better now but you do have the option to use the swingy algoritm if you would like.

The game does a good job of being faithful to the board game, which is great! The map is beautiful and the pieces look nice. I will echo my original comments on the UI and phases being a little bit cumbersome. I feel like I'm clicking a lot and something that would take me  minute in the board game might take 2-3 here. I expect this would be completely resolved by playing a lot more and becoming more familiar with the game. But, I'd love to see the UI and the on-screen information made a little more helpful and balanced (Large almost full screen pop ups aren't ideal in my opinion). I'll try to expand on this in updates.

One thing I'd love to see is unit placement in country made a little more uniform, sometimes they are at the bottom of the country, sometimes they are at the top, occasionally this can cause you to miss a unit.


On the transport issue: think I ran into some sort of issue, but I haven't been able to replicate it since, so I'm not really sure hot to explain it but I couldn't for the life of me get a transport to unload!  I appreciate the developer response, and if I'm able to replicate it I will definitely reach out. Now that my frustration (okay, rage) has subsided I'm excited to dive in more.

INITITAL REVIEW: Not intuitive at all. I really wanted to like this game. I've played A&A for years. I own the A&A classic version in board game format and am very familiar with the rules. This game is not intuitive at all - it seems overly convoluted compared to the board game and I simply cannot seem to do so some moves no matter how much I try. Want to land in France? Nope, the game gives you to multiple warnings but won't let you actually land there and you can't click. Wanted to like this, but it feels really rough compared to the relative simplicity of the game. It's overly complicated plain and simple.",1614410402,1614629457,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The most work needs to go into SIMPLE PIECE PLACEMENT, and phase-to-phase transition.  It can't be that hard to have a drag and drop system, where the pieces are moved toward their destination, but are greyed out until the phase is signaled as complete.

Too many times in the last 3 hours of play have I finished a round where, ""OOPS, I was going to attack that coast with 4 transports, I loaded 4 transports, but I only attacked with one of them, WEIRD!""

There is no obvious distinction within the stack that something went right.  You can say that ""there's a confirmation screen!!!"" But the board itself was all the confirmation you need.  It -should- be all the confirmation needed.  There was no secretary who held a piece of paper between you and the board demanding agreement to the accuracy of the player's actions contained therein.

Having played old school table top A&A many times, I held on, but 2 or 3 ruined games because the interface is simply not there is just, bah.  

I think someone far less patient would be requesting a refund.  The interface is that painful.  Otherwise it seems to do what it's supposed to.  

The game functions, but it needs serious user experience, quality of life, interface fixes.  Call it whatever, just make the pain of setting up a strategy, just to see only half of your forces mobilize.

3) I like the graphics (nothing fancy, but it's a board game and I can read the board). 
4) Tournament Rules are standard and there are ""weighted"" dice for more consistancy.
5) Frankly it has all the advantages of being an online board game -- much easier to have enough chits and troops for everything I need to do, significantly easier to find people to play with
6) You forfeit if you don't do anything in 24 hours, which is fair and helps (though does not perfectly) keep games moving

The physical board can take up to an hour to set up, and here you can get started in seconds. The controls are sensible and easy to learn. The only frustrating difficulty I had with the controls was maneuvering transports in certain conditions. The graphics feel true to the physical game and the way the plotting of moves are visually indicated is executed quite well. Once you get accustomed to the interface, everything makes sense.

You don't have to have the game open the whole time either. You can make your move and then close the game and then the next player has 24 hours to complete theirs. You can leave notes for players on your team too, and there's a log of the previous moves each nation performed for their phases in each round. It would be great if the logs were a little more detailed (could be viewed visually and see the progression of the overall war). You can also watch the other player perform their actions if you keep the game open while they are taking their turn.

So tried searching for open games online, just to see what kind of games were going on. Maybe I could fill the spot of a single nation in one of them or something... and by just simply viewing a game suddenly meant that I was committed to playing all of the Axis nations. The game hadn't started, but I couldn't back out or cancel or anything without it counting as a loss against my ranking. I was a little surprised at the lack of a sort of game lobby and nation slots and confirming interest etc. So yeah I am playing this match I didn't actually want to be playing.

I also found the tutorial to be kind of, not good. They tried to make it nice with voice acting and putting you into scenarios and treating you like a commander or whatever. It did an okay job at explaining the controls, but, it didn't really explain how the game is to be played, and the format of the rounds and that sort of thing. AT one point it's like ""Oh his majesty sent us reinforcements, we can use them to blah blah"" and to me that's like well, no, that's not how it works; this is misleading to a newcomer's expectation of what goes on. Reinforcements just don't appear out of the blue in random places. I just disagree with the way they approached their tutorial.

Be very precise when loading transports and moving them ( i.e when invading Norway from Great Britain move your transports up to sea zone 9 and than right click on Norway otherwise it will have your transports landing from sea zone 8 and thus be exposed to fighters from Germany.) Also remember that IC's ALWAYS have an anti-aircraft capability  against strategic bombing even when no AA gun is in the territory. The computer AI is reasonable on turn 1 but has a tendency to use excessive force to take/reconquer victory point territories. It divides it's naval force too much with Japan allowing the US player to focus on portions of it in detail also it allows it's air units too often to be adjacent to strong enemy forces ( i.e putting 2 fighters alone in a territory after a combat phase or worse building 3 bombers in Germany after moving all the ground forces out of the country, and Britain has 3 transports with 6 ground units just 2 sea zones away! ) A competent player will thus be able to readily defeat the AI unless the die rolls are absolutely lop-sides against them, and speaking of die rolls ANY SHORE BOMBARDMENT will fail 80-90 % of the time in either dice mode (I've noticed this with both sides.) Logically even with but 1 cruiser bombarding you should hit 50% of the time but not with Beamdog's RNG. That's why round 1 invasions of India fail so much especially with 7 British INF stationed there. But the AI will pick up on any glaring errors a player makes so always make sure your transports and planes and odd ships are not exposed BEFORE you end your non-combat phase. (I've forgotten to move the British transport off Australia and have seen the AI send it's empty CV to pick it off!)

Will not attack when they should, waste multiple turns doing nothing when they have huge forces and no opposition to using them, UK will not build transports ever, not even over multiple turns when the germans have no navy and few planes on the west of europe, so Russia just slowly sits dying alone other than random US/UK fighters that get sent occasionally. So far Russia has never lasted more than 6 rounds when I face off against them and I was able to hold out until round 11 after which the massive allied armies sat and died one by one while the axis built up around them in very obvious ways that should have been stopped. 

If you want to play multiplayer with 5 players this is probably fine, I see no flaws that should be a huge deal but it does need more features to justify the price. But if you want a game to kill an hour at in single player wait until they either fix the AI or add enough extra features that we can tweak it ourselves. Or just play the whole team I guess.

Firstly, other versions of this game (ios versions) usually include a free for all mode. This would be awesome for some friends to get together and create some pretty unique scenarios like UK fighting the US and USSR. Also the AI in single player mode is way too easy. It would be really cool to have a challenge waiting for me when I can't play online or when I don't want to wait for other players to take their turns that seem to never end. I just played a game last night where I was playing as Japan against the AI. Everything was going well until Berlin fell (global domination mode was enabled). Every single game the US AI goes FULL GERMANY and just spams units out into the Atlantic. Japan usually goes pretty unopposed except for some Russian far eastern units and British India units. I was able to beat the allies single handedly while Germany was out of the game. The allies had Rome, Berlin, and France and proceeded to spam tanks into Asia. I also kept a massive fleet off the western coast and the US AI kept spamming cruisers and destroyers in that same territory (sz right off the coast of Western US). Every turn I would have to destroy a IPC wasted fleet while I suffered no casualties ( I had 3 battleships to absorb hits). The US AI proceeded to waste all of its money into buying that fleet every turn. As you can see the AI needs working. I think difficulty modes should be available that could potentially challenge even the most seasoned of players. Also, you guys should consider a 1940 start date or different game all together. This would allow for longer games, more general interest, and more playable nations (Italy, China, France, Anzac). I find that this game is too simple and quick (but at the same time there are no other digital versions of A+A available). Paying 20 bucks for a game that cannot be moded and lacks any difficulty or game variability is kind of a let down. It also sucks that the workshop cant be accessed for this game at all. If it were then players could make their own version of axis and allies including Global 1940 and even lesser known axis and allies games like 1914. If this were possible I'd recommend this game more. But its going to need more features and replay-ability before I can do that. Some of the rules were also a little different. Maybe consider the rules a little more in another update. I hope the developers get to see this and consider these changes. You guys are certainly onto something here!!

In particular the screen fills up with arrows indicating that units are moving but you can't get a preview of what the board will look like if you confirm your moves.  If you make a mistake in the purchasing or non-combat phases of the game, there is no ability to undo your move even though from a game-play perspective there would be no harm.  The fan community is also inundated with complaints that the dice-rolling algorithm is completely broken (although personally I find those complaints very overblown).  Also the full set of game rules isn't even implemented- players in the same faction should be allowed to share ships, but they can't.  I would actually give this game a lower rating except for one thing- it's the only game in town with no competition.

Everything requires you to confirm that you want to do it, sometimes twice.  Doing simple things like initiating a battle, rolling dice, or assigning hits is all super un-intuitive and obtuse.  Units sit in funny places in the territories that they are in - for example, I thought as the USSR I didn't have any Infantry in Leningrad, but it turns out I did, but they were just up at the veeeery top of the province where my brain did not register that they were there.  Another example is when confirming my combat moves it gives me this huge breakdown about where everything that is moving into combat came from to get there.... but there is no way to condense it into something comprehensible that fits on my screen without scrolling - there was so much going on with that screen that I missed the fact that I only committed two infantry to a big battle because instead of a simple summary of what was being sent into the fight & having the option to ""click this here button to see where the combat units moved from"", instead you JUST get a huge clumsy list of where everything was moving from.  Then, when it was time to fight a battle I had initiated, I had no idea how to tell the game that I wanted to go ahead and fight it (apparently you left click?).  Then once I was in the battle I didn't see anything obvious to get things to actually get moving.  I feel like I could go on and on about every single thing because its all just so awkward and clunky.

It is so bad, to me, that I cannot even get through one game turn.  It is miserably slow and tedious for something that should be simple and streamlined.  Trying to get through another faction's turn is an exercise in agony.  I _do not_ need to see every combat resolve.  I like the things Beamdog did when they modernized the Baldur's Gate games but this electronic version of Axis and Allies has some baffling design decisions that I just cannot wrap my head around or bear when trying to play.  If you want a good example of a simple streamlined electronic version of a boardgame, play ""Scythe"", its an excellent electronic adaptation of an amazing boardgame.

UPDATE: After my friends convinced me to play some more, I can confirm that the UI is god awful.  I would like to add that the dice are completely broken.  I've had bad dice my whole life but this game takes it to a whole other level.  Its insufferable and ruins what would otherwise be competitive and fun games.

And.... the game designers have taken a great boardgame, and ruined it with a truly awful dice algorithm.

They've implicitly admitted as much -- but still refuse to change the number generator for ranked games, which (unfortunately), now routinely force you to suffer through losing battles that, statistically, you'd have a 99.9% chance of winning.

They've rolled out a ""smoothed"" version of their ridiculously non-random algorithm...but it's only for casual play; if you want to hop on and just play someone, you have to use ranked...which means you're going to get entirely hosed by the dice.

All sorts of users have complained -- I've emailed them repeatedly, myself -- never gotten a reply.

Hopefully they'll eventually change how they crunch the numbers for dice rolls, but as is, they've taken what had been a great game with a large skill component and made it no better than Risk....and arguably quite worse, as their number-generating algorithm for dice seems to take malicious pleasure in consistently delivering insanely low-probability outcomes that make the game all but unplayable.",1609016039,1609016039,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

- transport usage is TERRIBLE. I had to watch a tutorial video just to figure it out.  And once you do figure it out, the whole loading and unloading is not user friendly or intuitive.  
- there appears to be bugs involving antiaircraft guns and how they display their hits during combat
- I have had the game crash several times.  The upside is that the game has always recovered and returned to the exact place where the crash happened and no data was ever lost
- Although there are defense profiles, it is not nearly adequate.  There needs to be an option after non-combat movement where you can set the defense profile per zone on the board.

Nothing wrong with the dice.  Axis and Allies is designed to have swingy combat results.  Most units have a low hit chance to begin with, and you roll buckets of dice per game.  Keep in mind that most people are playing a dozen or more games at once, so you're going to see some improbable outcomes when you roll that many dice in that many games.  

Gamers have been blaming dice, cards, joysticks, and cheating for their defeats since the dawn of gaming.

I like the ranking system and the pacing of the game is pretty quick.   Most opponents play multiple turns a day, and they usually finish in 1-3 days, though I had one game go for 10 days even though we were both taking multiple turns a day--It was that close!

The PC game itself is mostly fine but I have some issues with it:
- Game crashes after AAA guns fire, and allows me to choose non-planes as hits?
- Game skips right to defending fire after naval bombardment shots without allowing attacking shots first.
- Overall the graphics are nice, but Japan and the UK colors are too similar and I often make mistakes in my movement because I think the other nations ships are mine. Also why is Germany blue? Germany was always either grey or black. France was always blue.


The other issues I have with the game result I think mostly from the fact the game is based off the 1942 editions. The game is more complicated than the original in some ways but simplified in others. Overall, I don’t like it. There are more units which is cool but it’s still missing some of the ones added in the 1940 editions like mechanized infantry and tactical bombers. The game adds more game spaces which makes countries like Germany a lot harder to defend and slows down the game pace. I also don’t like how you have to play with Victory Conditions for ranked mode, I assume they were put in to make the game end sooner, but it just means you have a lot more to manage. It also means that you don’t get the satisfaction of creating a world empire as the Axis or stopping them completely as the Allies.

Here are some additions I think the developers need to add to truly make this game great.

- Allow players to choose between the Classic, 1940 (Europe, Pacific, and Global), 1941, 1942, and 1914 maps and game rules.
- Allow players to customize the rules and unit stats like in the old 1998 Axis and Allies PC game.
- Allow players to create their own maps, units, and scenarios and upload them to the Steam Workshop.
- Bring back research into the game.
- Allow options to customize nation color (ex. Allow players to have Germany be grey instead of blue)
- Better IPC tracking, in the 1998 Axis and Allies PC Game, they showed you a graph of the IPC values the end of the round so you could see where everyone stated and where everyone is now.
- Different AI difficulty levels and/or personalities.
- The dice feel wonky somehow. I can always guess what the other person will roll based on my roll. Sometimes they feel really biased depending on what country you are, the territory you are trying to take, and how your nation is doing game wise.
- More music. There is only one song in the game. It would be nice if each nation had their own song, or playlist of songs.
- Ability to choose between a horizontal or a vertical battle board.

As it stands now there are no reasons to play this version of Axis and Allies over the others. If you can get it to work, the 1998 Axis and Allies is a much more fun classic Axis and Allies experience. And for what Triple A lacks in UI (it might as well not have one, the graphics are horrendous) it makes up for it the shear amount of customizability it has. Not only can you play any of the Axis and Allies versions, but also the HBG versions like 1936 global and even custom maps like Middle Earth, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones. The only thing this version of Axis and Allies has over Triple A is graphics and the only thing it has over the 1998 game is the fact you don’t need a virtual machine to get the game to work.

The developers released a ""stabilized"" dice mode just the other day to fix whatever the problem was (I haven't tried it yet, I thought the original was fine). 

This game desperately needs a mode that allows people to undo phases of turns, or even whole turns (if you undo enough phases). It's our popup culture that has trained our brains to automatically close any popup without reading it. When you're focused on your strategy, it's very easy to close the popup without reading it. There are three very common places people mess up their turn and need to undo. The first is when they fix one of their factories that has been bombed and then they click end phase thinking the fix factory option was it's own phase. The second is when they move their planes on non-combat after they attacked then click end turn thinking they just ended the plane move and actually ended the whole non-combat. The third is when people think they moved a group of a bunch of troops but didn't realize they left one behind (like one of their two battleships). This can really mess up a battle plan, causing it to take an extra turn, or not have all the troops needed to be successful. I've played many hours and I still make all 3 mistakes every game. I understand this isn't fair online with strangers, but when you're playing with your friends it should be an opt-in option when setting up the game, and require consent from all of the other players every time it is activated. The only option right now is if everyone agrees to skip their turn until it gets back to that person's phase. This way is really broken, because inevitably the double money everyone gets the next turn will give one person a huge advantage. Last game I played I won the very next turn after my friend asked me to skip back to his turn, because I spent my double money on buying 7 transports in Great Britain and invaded Germany suddenly.

Scenarios would be really great, like WW2 actually involving different countries besides the 5 in this game, or only being able to use land and sea units. 

The ability to turn on or off certain rules would be great. Different options on win conditions would be great, like first to take over one victory city wins (there's already a total victory mode, but I'm looking for more options beyond that). An option to turn off the rule that stops a country from building units when they're taken over, as long as they have a factory or can build a factory. An option to turn off the rule that gives a player all the conquered player's IPCs when they lose their capital. The ability to modify units' IPC costs, like make planes as cheap as tanks. The ability to make country specific differences in purchase IPCs, like japan has cheaper planes and America has cheaper battleships. The ability to change which cities are victory cities and how many of them there are. The ability to change the number of IPCs on any tile. I understand this breaks the balancing between units and countries, so I would probably only make prebuilt scenarios from the developer available in match making, and free for all rules available in private parties.

To go along with the last thing I said about being able to modify the rules, it would be best to have the ability to save these changes to the map and rules in a template for easy use in future games, not just a single game.

More maps / game modes would be fun too. I would pay for dlc to get 1940, 1941, 1914, or axis and allies and zombies. Risk online does all sorts of crazy maps they just make up and that would be fun here to. The coolest idea would be if there was a community map maker that people could share maps. Community unit maker would be cool too, people could make things like the pigeon bombs, zeppelins, or kamikaze pilots.",1606382622,1606384913,True,1,0,0.498489409685134888,0,True,False,True

The reason I've changed my review is because the game does not let you choose your own losses/'enemy hits' like you should be able to. Instead they have 'hit profiles' or something that let you pre-determine which hits you want to assign (automatically) to which of your units. IMO this is an extremely important part of the game and I've made some game-changing snap decisions based on the battle at hand in the past.

EXAMPLE: typically you want to assign an enemy hit to the CHEAPEST unit you have in your arsenal; but let's say that Japan is attacking your US navy and you know you're going to lose - what if you've decided in the moment that you want to assign the hit to your expensive but low-defence aircraft carrier instead of your cruiser (which is less expensive but attacks/defends better)? It's impossible and your 'hit profile' will automatically assign the hit to your cruiser (cheaper) rather than your carrier (more expensive / less threatening).

It might sound ridiculous but for this soul reason I never play this game! I play Tabletop Simulator with the A&A mods I've worked on and would love to play this game with my friends but I find this feature so profoundly important to my experience and feeling like I'm in control that I would rather not play it. I've saved a bunch of my friends from picking it up as they agreed that it's silly that the game seems to be designed for 'play over email' rather than an MP game that we can all play together.

I've expressed my eagerness for an update that AT LEAST GIVES US THE OPTION TO CHOOSE OUR OWN HITS but the developers seem sturdy in that the game is designed to be played over email and that they have no interest in making this change for those of us who want the complete experience. I really wish that I could get a refund at this point but I bought it on release and am way passed the two-week grace period. If the devs have a heart; please give me a refund for this game which I've spent almost no time in!!

Here is a summary points of my original review:

- This team has done a good job with the UI and GFX (no complaints here).
- I found that the AI was decent in this game - I had never experienced that crappy dice rolls that others were getting but I had only ever played one complete round.
- Transport units felt clunky on release but I'm assuming that's been fixed by now.
- Combat I felt 'fine' with. A little bit 'over-stimulating' for me but I could be okay with it if it weren't for the 'auto-combat resolve' nature of hit assignment.
- I had also made notes about a lack of 'time machine' and/or save state system as it seemed that if I had made a silly mistake that it was impossible to undo without restarting - not sure if this is fixed yet either.",1566911859,1604705623,False,2,0,0.545454561710357666,1,True,False,True

Its incredibly frustrating to play and all around awful. Playing it literally makes me angry because of how dumb it is. I have actually never written a review for a game before on Steam, but this game is so bad, I had to write one. Growing up, I loved playing A&A the board game, but always felt like a PC version would be fun to play--help clarify confusing rules, speed up gameplay, etc. I couldn't have been more wrong, at least with this PC version. I bought it on sale for like $10, but would now I wish had spent those $10 on literally anything else. Its worse than garbage. The user interface looks like it was built back in the stone age and is incredibly unintuitive. The tutorial teaches you nothing about how buttonology, where to click, or how to control units. There are all sorts of little things going on in the game that you have no idea what they mean until its too late. Way too many button clicks needed, way too many different color lines everywhere, way too hard to click on the unit you mean to use. The zoomed out map looks awful, but zooming in just makes things garbled and confusing. The ""help"" feature is completely useless, and doesn't explain any rules or what anything means. The simulation gamespeed for AI users is either extremely slow and makes me want to kill myself because its so boring, or way to fast to understand what's going on. It doesn't allow you to control defense, it simply simulates its and shows you the results. The gameplay that you do control feels stiff, not fun at all. I really have nothing positive to say about this game, which is a real shame because I got pretty excited when I heard a new PC version was coming out.

AI is all I have played with as none of my friends are board gamers for the most part.  My most fun with AI was my last game where I was the Brits.  I was secure in India and was paying a high price in IPC loses trying to amphibious assault France.  Germany and the Luftwaffe could sink my transports and support ships faster than I could afford to build them.  But finally I put 6 tanks in France supported by the US and their 4 infantry and 4 tanks.  Since Im losing ships and cant get my troops off the mainland into Europe I decide since reinforcements are in place to build a factory in France.  I ask for support, but the US moves from France and assaults Berlin... they win, but Germany counterattacks and kicks me and the US back out of Europe.  Next turn US invades France and now has factory capability... ugh.  Kept me off the mainland of Europe for another five turns.  AI so far seems to refuse captured manufacturing capability.  US has factory in France, but still using transports like crazy coming from North America.  And then... Germany is defeated and I push onto Tokyo.  USSR has Vietnam and Korea but wont build a factory... Japan is done... just Tokyo and Okinawa.  USSR is sending transports from St Petersburg through the Suez Canal.  For total victory Im left all alone sending troops into the amphib meat grinder.  Approximately 100 IPC losses to 10-15 Japanese IPC losses for 5 turns.  But the US sure has a nice Atlantic Fleet..... Not sure what they are doing... but hey they got that one bomber in Hawaii helping out.    Wish I had friends who played... but until then hope the AI gets some work.  Great implementation of a game I grew up playing.  I found no issues with the controls whatsoever... other than from my ignorance.  Tutorial is excellent.

Please don't waste your time and money on this game. This is the second worst video game I've ever played, next to E.T. for Atari. The game play is TERRIBLE! First of all, if you're defending, you don't get to hit the roll button or decide which units to kill, the game does. Secondly, you can't roll more than six dice! If you attack with 15 infantry, the game will roll 6 dice and then randomly decide which ones to count double or triple... it's very different math than getting to roll 15 times for ones. Also, the board doesn't really show you what's going on, and it doesn't automatically pause when you're being attacked. You can't tell what's going on during the rolls because the hits and misses show up on the units before the dice have even landed - which doesn't matter because half the time the country being invaded changes color with the outcome before the dice are even rolled. The tutorial is POINTLESS; it explains the very basic unit movements and that's it. I remember with the board game you used to be able to spend your income to role for scientific advances. The graphics of the board game are actually WORSE than the PC game I had 20 years ago. Also, you have little to no control on how to load transports, you have to keep loading and unloading until you get the configuration you want. The AI is really bad - I just watched 5 Russian infantry attack 20 German tanks... guess what happened. But hey, if I was stuck in this game I'd want to end it all too.

Developers are now deleting posts with legitimate criticism of the game, calling such ""trolls"" and ""personal attacks"".  It's a fact that the developers haven't properly investigated their PRNG, that there are differences to the 1942 second edition board game that they refuse to acknowledge in the store description, that the 24 hour deadline on ranked games doesn't accommodate players with full control over their schedule.  And that's just the stuff they refuse to address, much less fix.  It's been over a year and fighter/carrier movement is still not working properly, fleets can get improperly locked in combat movement when they shouldn't be (the ""friendly/hostile"" workaround works for only *some* cases) - whenever they ""fix"" an issue another pops up.  I don't even know if they've fixed teleporting transports or the extra air movement exploits yet, then there's the system requirements and not performing even on computers that supposedly meet the minimum specs - you get the idea.  There are loads and loads of issues, and mentioning them just gets you censured, banned, attacked, or ignored, and really just horrible unprofessional treatment on all levels, made worse by the fact that the developers let nasty attack posts pass if they're from ""supporters"" of the game.

Post legitimate criticisms, get horribly treated.  But post short nasty troll comments ""supporting"" the developers and you did nothing wrong.  The developers had an *active role* in building a community with a big toxic element.

If you go on forums, you'll see posts all over saying ""fixed"" or ""problem solved"" or ""this was addressed"" - but if you dig deeper, you'll find that isn't the case.  Do not trust the developers.

I even think the developers manipulated their reviews; in the space of a couple days, months ago, reviews swung from ""mostly negative"" to ""mostly positive"".  This is not a criticism I've ever leveled on forums, but it's something potential buyers should know.

I wanted to support this title.  I really did.  I put in hundreds of hours putting together documents, screenshots, doing writeups including mathematical analysis, only to be treated with the most horrible contempt.

That's just ONE document.  All right, it's a rant, but does it look like someone that doesn't know what they're talking about?  Does it look like I'm trolling or making personal attacks?  It took a long time to write up that document, to edit it, to put in the screenshots, to run the numbers.  And what do you think the developer response was?  Wipe their ass with it and throw it back in my face.  ""you have a hundred hours in the game, you must like playing it"" was it?

Acknowledge the points made?  Oh no.  After all, I must like the game since I spent so much time in it!  Couldn't POSSIBLY be that a good writeup would REQUIRE spending a lot of time in the game, could it now, oh no, let's not even acknowledge that possibility (much less the effort involved in the writeup.)  Nothing's wrong, it's a ""win!"", player ""likes the game!"", that's their little narrative.

And of course you can imagine what would happen if I *didn't* have whatever hours in the game.  ""You haven't even played it, you haven't given it a fair shot"".  Lol.  That's exactly the sort of games you can expect with this bunch.

Look for TripleA - a free and legitimate application that lets you play various games - it has save files that you can review the full and complete game history of, in-game chat, and loads of other features that 1942 Online does not have.  Sure, it isn't perfect, but it *is* better and free, and *their* developers aren't crazy.",1572810820,1602149020,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all let me say I LOVE Axis and Allies and was very excited about the prospect of this game coming out!  Not only for myself but for my two boys 11 and 9 who are just learning to play.

So I thought this would be a great buy since we would be spared the hassle of setting up the board (a pain in the butt for sure) and could just zip down and play. 

I was also excited to play the single player version when I just wanted to relax play against the AI and learn some new strategies.

So while many of the gameplay and options are great one thing tanks the game:  ""asynchronous play.""  A fancy name for taking away 1/2 of the game and combat - defense.  So, while you get to assign your hits in real time for offense, defense you don't even get to see the battle board.  WHAT!!!???  
Yep, if you played the game for real, get this through your head - NO BATTLE BOARD for defense!  You just get to see the bloody aftermath on the large map!  The best you can do is assign ""defense profiles"" from the game settings so you can pick a profile for defense - but that is about it.  Why they thought this would be great gameplay, I cannot answer.  They claimed they wanted quicker gameplay.  (Checkers instead of chess).  So gameplay was sacrificed for speed sake.  If that was truly the case then they would included this as a click option rather than it being the ONLY option.

It makes the single player version unplayable and the multiplayer versions of it unfulfilling.

At first, you might make dumb errors because you didn't realize that you sent a unit into the wrong spot or didn't select all of them. If you play a few games, you'll get the hang of it.

Some users are giving this game a negative review because they claim the AI's dice rolls cheat. That's complete nonsense. I've mostly played offline against AI, and just like with real dice, every once in a while you'll get destroyed when the odds were supposed to be in your favor. The AI will lose fights that should have been in their favor too. That's how RNG works, people.

As for the AI's competence, it's incredibly aggressive. The Japanese AI will almost always attack India on their first turn even when the odds are way against them. The German AI always attacks Angola on their first turn. The Soviet AI always stretches itself too thin, and a good German commander can take them out in about four turns. The AI won't be much of a challenge after a few games with them. If the developers are reading this, I think that playing with AI could be improved by giving us different aggression levels to choose from. The Soviet Union, especially, needs to learn how to hold onto the Eastern Front.

My final complaint isn't related to this video game, but with Axis & Allies 1942 itself. Once one side gains the upper hand, it is incredibly unlikely for them to lose it. The game is pretty much determined by the third round. This can make the rest of the game a bit of a slog.

It's about as good as you can get for an online version of the game that you also can walk away from.  Ranked play is a nice touch, haven't tried it yet.

1) When you right click an amphibious landing and the transport can use two different zones to get there: it should force you to pick which zone the transport goes to.  Almost every single time it picks the wrong one and puts itself in harms way/out of strategic position.

2) If you only have 1 destroyer, and your opponent is attacking with say 6 subs on your AC, BS, 2 planes, etc., in many cases it's just better for the destroyer to not die so the subs don't get a massive surprise attack round the next round.  It should probably be an option on defense.

3) I'm not sure why when you have a stack of 3 transports with nothing in them that you have to individually left click each to move instead of being able to right click them all into a zone. Results in a lot of them left behind.

4) AI is not dumb, but it's not smart either.  Worst example was a 4v8 on India first round: 2I,2P v 5I,2T,1A,1AA.  You can guess how that went.  Needs some better AI and difficulty settings.  The main strength of the game is it's online play though, not single player.

5) If you click through to the combat mode or one of the other modes but haven't done anything yet, you should be able to go back one.  1st turn Canada transport in N sea with all other defensive ships in another zone = unhappy face; same with clicking your planes on an AC after an attack and then clicking ""DONE"" + facepalm moment, and MANY etc's.

6) Probably hard to do online given the ""walk away from turn"" thing, but allies can't load onto each other's transports.  Just be aware.

I think this is still in beta, or just released?  Whichever, plenty of time to add some fixes I think.  Clearly adding some of the older game boards etc. would be great to mix it up a bit too.  Overall, I can tell that the devs played it back in the day.

Axis and Allies 1942 Online is so close to being the perfect video game version of my favorite board game series, but is hindered by one ""fatal"" flaw (pun intended) and a minor flaw.

Let's begin with the good. The rules of the game are incorporated from a few different games, as simultaneous land and amphibious assaults are possible, cruisers are in the game, bombers only cost 12 IPCs instead of 15. Many more complex elements, especially from the 1940 games, such as Italy, China, ANZAC, Mech Infantry, Dive Bombers, and military facilities are all missing from the game, but this is a positive as it keeps the game simple for newer players that can be overwhelmed by the number of combat rules in Axis and Allies. The map appears most similar to Axis and Allies 1942 and the revised original, as it features only the usual 5 countries and has fewer Chinese territories and only 13 victory cities instead of 18 (anniversary edition). The game play is just like playing the original, following the usual phases of your turn (minus technologies, national advantages and bonus IPCs for national objectives, such as ""Lebensraum"" for Germany in the Anniversary Edition), and the combat system is perfectly replicated in this game. Another positive, again taken from the board games, is the freedom to select total victory or a minor victory to influence the length of the game (though this should be expanded upon to include more than these two options).

Now I will discuss the two flaws with the game, one minor and one major. The minor flaw is in the team work and communication with the AI players does not seem to work. As the Axis, this really is not a problem (unless you're Italy in the board games) as you function independently from each other on opposite sides of the global. However, this is brutal for the allies. Upon playing as Russia, Britain and the USA will ignore any suggestions or communications you make with them, leaving you alone to fight the German player that will always press all of their forces onto you. This leaves the Western front severely under defended, but your allies will refuse to attack any part of Western Europe or North Africa, and you will lose within 5 turns, regardless of your strategy because of the biased dice rolling. Biased/unrealistic dice rolling is the fatal flaw that makes this game unplayable, regardless of the level of detail in the rest of the game. Strategy for any of the five factions is irrelevant. Significantly outnumbering your enemies is irrelevant. The game will always severely favor your opponents in the dice rolls. At first I thought I was playing on the master difficulty (and the difficulty of this game should be based on AI skill, not luck of the dice rolls), but then realized there is no difficulty setting anywhere. Thankfully this game is still in early access so it's okay to have a few bugs here and there, but this is a game-breaking issue that needs to be fixed for those playing against all AI.",1598768089,1598768089,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Single player is incredibly limited with options unlike older version from Hasbro. There is no way to adjust the AI so that you can practice, learn, and get a feel for the game. RNG on the dice rolls are incredibly one sided favoring the AI. Anyone with a basic understanding of math and statistics can verify this. I would NOT recommend this game. The AI is incredibly cheap with its constant domination of dice rolls. Takes me back to the days of the old board game where he who manipulated their dice rolls the best--WON. Its just not fun to lose battles over and over again to an AI that seems to be more rigged than a Vegas slot machine. At least in Vegas I get a complimentary drink. The AI just screws you, and not in the fun kind of way that Vegas has the potential for. Advice to the devs: Fix the RNG to be balanced. Maybe then I'll purchase again. 

Another suggestion would be to add in an ability to correct mistakes made in the non-combat movement and unit placement.

I would only recommend this game to people who are huge AA fans.  While you can get somewhat familiar with the interface, it still lacks any real clarity about what troops are going where, or if the transport is loaded or why it won't move,  I still don't understand why they didn't duplicate the old AA video game.  They should play the 2 versions side by side so they can figure out what I mean.

It has some minor bad luck rolls where the AI wins.  If you only run one country and the others are all AI, don't count on your allies doing anything useful.  I played Germany and the Japan AI never used it's fleet to battle the USA.  Instead, they focused on a land war with Russia, which never went well.  

If you can put up with the interface, then it's a ""good enough"" game if you real need to play AA.  Lots of little things I could mention, but this is by far the biggest issue.

==============
I have to agree that the interface on this is pretty darn bad.  It makes the original Axis and Allies (which is pretty close to this one) look like a 1980s game.  It's a huge step backwards.  You used to be able to just right click and undo stuff.  There used to be a time warp for going backwards if you made a mistake, it's hard to even tell where  the units are going.  This is maybe 60% as good as the game from 20 or 30 years ago.  I assume that the company has abandoned this project since it's still Early Access started a full year ago.

It shouldn't be that difficult to see what units go moved, before you commit.

Plus it would be nice to have a go back button. Like have the option to go back and purchase units ONLY if you haven't initiated combat yet.

The AI for the game in multiplayer is run from a central server. The server is *constantly* offline. The AI can take hours, or DAYS to take a single turn. On top of that, the AI makes terrible choices, doesn't follow even the most basic concepts of the game.

Summary
PROs
Game was fun to play – I don't recall the destroyer piece from the original game, but its been a long time and I may have forgotten it.  I do like its addition to the game if it is.  Still a decent amount of strategy to consider and implement minus some of the CONS  listed below.


CONs
It takes to long to play a ranked match - The game takes a ridiculous amount of time to play ranked matches.  When you go somewhere to play this game you know you are setting aside a block of time to play the game.  I've had games go on for close to two weeks which should only take 3 to 5 hours to play, maybe 8 if there are a few beers going around.  This large amount of time is due to a 24 hour timer between turns between countries.  It also appears to me that when some folks don't have the upper hand they only make 1 move every 24 hours.  I guess hoping you forget to make your move and forfeit.

Game over simplified - To me the game was simplified to much with the use of victory cities.  I guess folks had a hard time adding up the IPCs for its victory.

Dice Rolls -  I have two issues with dice rolls.  One only the offensive guy is present for them.  I understand why its set up this way and I assume it ties back into the long timers.  The second issue is I think the RNG is off.  I realize when you roll dice any out come is possible, but it appears to me on rolls for naval bombardment I rarely hit with it and if I'm strategic bombing an industrial complex the AA seems to roll ones more often than not.  Its to the point unless I'm up in a game with a lot of bombers I wont use that strategy.  I've seen rounds where multiple pieces that are rolling 4s or lower not hit for 5 or more rounds.  Bad luck or not who knows.  It appears the RNG for dice rolls is flaky to me.

Automatic Canceled Combat moves – I've had moves canceled moving from combat movement to combat phase which has left me short on what I wanted to attack with.  If the game is going to cancel a move it should spell it out better.

Not as fun as the original game – This is probably just a con for me and not knowing there were so many rule changes from the version I originally bought.  This game is just not as fun as the original game.  I miss my heavy bombers and super subs.... and yes I can count to 80.  In my opinion only having 13 victory cities to protect devalues the majority of the board.",1594743128,1594743128,False,0,0,0.468217909336090088,0,True,False,True

Figuring out the transports is insanely difficult. I had to google how to use it just so I could get through the tutorial. It's one of the most unintuitive experiences ever. It also takes a LOT of time. So, I suggest playing just the USSR the first few times just to get the hang of the game. Then, if you've got lots of time, try using the transports. Good luck!

I love Axis & Allies however the dice on the computer system don't work well. It is insane how high probability attacks rarely work while low probability defenses consistently come up.

I've played the original 90's version on PC via CD...all the way up to last week. LOVE IT, but even with slow-down programs it runs so fast that scrolling on the map is just evil incarnate. Played some Triple A mixed in there as well. Then I purchased 1942 Online after waiting for a discount. The game has many issues, but I would give it a 71/100 currently, just enough for me to give it a thumbs up (barely). I do believe future patches might put this into the 70's for me, and if so, I will change the review.

1) As a person who enjoys single player against the AI, it's VERY upsetting that, as a defender, I can't assign the hits (you can use default settings the AI uses for losses, but that's just tedious at best). I mean, if I play against AI, I will always be there to assign hits. It's lazy programming from multiplayer (since opponents won't be there live to assign hits). If there are losses, I want to choose the results based on the situation. Sometimes you want to lose a high IPC item to take land, etc.

2) The UI is...overwhelming. The original Axis & Allies on PC was so easy to understand visually. Where you attack, how many, etc. With the current UI, you can't easily tell where things are going, or how many. You can't even just right-click a movement to cancel. You have to do that through a menu. UGH! So tedious! The different color arrows are suppose to help, but just makes it all confusing to take in. 

3) I wish they would let you keep the original rules from the 90's PC game as an option. I hate what happened with transports not able to be selected as a loss during combat. The 90's version had so many extra options and rules you could turn on and off.

4) The combat UI was SOOOOOOOOOOO much better in the 90's version. This is obviously an aesthetic upgrade, no argument there, but functionally it just confuses and overloads a simple system. When you attack, you can control the tempo to take in what's going on...but when attacked by the opponent, it can be hard to take in all the losses as the AI just takes over everything. They do offer a results screen after, but it just all feels...like the player isn't directly involved in the events.

5) No undo button. This would make everything so much better, especially given how many nuances happen, like your battleships not assisting in amphibious assault without any known reason.

6) No phase rewinding (essential given how the UI functions and mistakes are made). You can't go back to previous phases (like combat if you realize you made a mistake or misclicked in combat setup, etc). 

7) Also, when it's the AI's turn to go, it just does immediately after your turn is over. I'll be reviewing the end of my turn history, and the AI just starts moving around behind the update info. I miss the way the turns worked in the 90's A&A, where you clicked to have them continue.

8) Finally, the AI gets stuck once in a while. 

Overall, while this looks wonderful, and I do like the extra ships and units (never kept up with them as I played the PC version with very little board game use), it just feels unwelcoming from a UI interactive standpoint. If, like me, you play against the AI a lot for whatever reason, and don't like multiplayer, well, this game is not created for you. It's still decent single player, but they sure didn't have it in mind when developing the game.",1593822155,1594074027,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,True

Couple of things I would like to see:

- Text Message Alerts when it's your turn versus e-mail (see docs.ytel.com, they sponsor game devs for this type of deal)
- Allow user to press button to alert next users turn (via e-mail or SMS) versus it just going out on each turn.  Decrease spam.

We have a combined 90 years of board gaming.  This game has issues, unit movement and control needs to be improved, especially transports. However, as a DICE game, we agreed it is not statistically aberrant from actually throwing the dice. If you don't like dice games, play something like Diplomacy. Yes, not selecting your units on defense is a big deal and a game changer, but this is overall a good compromise to make asynchronous play possible. I still give it thumbs up  but I think the movement and confirmation pages are a real bummer.  Missing a transport unload because your sea zone is packed and you can't make sense of what is going on there stinks and can be the difference in the whole game, as can missing a noncombat move because of the confusing interface.

This is Far Far Far below 1998 version of Axis & Allies. Sure the game feels weird and looks different but is acceptable. Now on to the main problem and that is the DICE. People might say is you have bad luck but when you have friends buy this game and say the exact same thing it is not bad luck. The computer always gets their rolls resulting in hits while you on the other hand get nothing but 5's or 6's resulting in your army, navy, air force getting obliterated. If I can compare this game to a war it will be the Winter War. The only way to win is to out number your enemy by such a margin that you will have to win by sure numbers. But don't let this fool you, you can send 10 tanks, 6 infantry and 2 bombers to a spot lets say in this case belorussia or India which might have 2 tanks and 3 troops. You might think you have a 100% chance of victory but NOOOOO you will get your dice to hit 5's and 6's all day long resulting in misses and the computer will curb stop you with 1's and 2's slaughtering your army. My worst encounter was in Africa trying to defeat one British troop and he wiped out 4 tanks and one infantry. When it gets to the sea battles as much as the animations look cool the DICE will ruin you. Battling a sub as Japan against the U.S.A i have 4 destroyers and you guessed it, 4 misses in a row while that sub hit every.... EVERY TIME. What really grinds my gears is when I play as Germany the U.S sends one bombers (I am sure every player knows this or experienced it) they send to bomb my IPC points. You would think building anti air would shoot it down... Nope they get away bombing 15 points every round resulting in me having to repair my factory. This happens every game and is unavoidable. Invading the UK might as well be borderline a massacre. You can send 15-20 fighters, land 3 tanks, 5 infantry and still get curb stomped by their few numbers. It is major bs resulting in a game that should take an hour into a whole 5-6 hours to beat. When I say beat this isn't a oh man that was tough type of beating a game. When you are 2 hours in you are saying you want this hell to end. The AI isn't hard but the dice is the only thing making this game a real pain in the butt. I see reports from devs saying the dice isn't rigged but experimenting these battles proves it to be a lie. There should be no possible way one should lose these 100% winnable battles and have one infantry or sub wipe them out. Overall the game looks different but excusable but the dice really break this game and give nothing but headaches and empty feeling of why am I playing this game just to relive a game from the past. Heck if you play the board game version there will be no possible way your rolls will be worse than this game. Do I recommend this game, short answer is no. If they fix the dice problem then absolutely. Remember this game has no difficulty, your only enemy is the dice. If you get this game, may Neptune have mercy on you and get some Advil. Maybe this would be a good game to record to show the mass amount of nonsense it has to offer also from a viewer's stand point might be really fun to watch the player's rage from said game.

I know this game is based on RNG, but this is not RNG it's a poorly executed mechanic that crowns the failures of all the other mechanics, that the devs claim is fine because they ran a test of the RNG without putting the dice rolls into small batch in context (you can find it in the forums if you're interested).

The AI is not particularly good, however (although probably somewhat better than that of the mid-1990s version).  The ""flash screens"" (SURPRISE STRIKE!) are annoying, especially when compared to the speed with which die rolls appear and disappear.
(One thing that old version did which would help the new version is show hits as red dice and misses as white ones; this helps a human player to see what's happening).  The latter issues are cosmetic, and the former probably doesn't apply to the online game.

However, I do have one very serious objection to the fact that defender casualties are not assigned manually, but according to a rank protocol set in advance by the player (with a game default).  In a land battle where the defender has bombers, you can't choose *at the beginning of an individual battle* whether you want to take them first or last.  In a crucial battle (e.g., defending Moscow) where the defender must win or, at least, inflict maximum casualties on the attacker, you would accept losing bombers first.  If, on the other hand, the attacker can't hope to take the province but expects to inflict a couple of hits, the defender should definitely keep the bomber(s) and accept the loss of an infantry or two.  Similar situations apply in naval battles (in which one side might prefer to accept the loss of a fighter or cruiser in order to keep its last destroyer around).  

While I certainly see the merit in resolving all battles in an asychronous game turn simultaneously, without input needed from the defenders each round, I think that a defender ought to have the option of a special protocol to be used in particular cases (maybe with checkboxes applicable to certain situations, e.g., ""Use if defending capital/Victory City/industrial complex"" or ""Use if X or more defending units present""; likewise, you might want the option to give a higher precedence for ""last destroyer if enemy submarines present."")",1591044493,1591044493,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,2,True,False,True

The game generally works well but there are many quirks that should be easy to fix that you only figure out the hard way.  The new patch makes transports better, which is a massive improvement.   I can't count how many times before the patch that I wanted to throw my computer because it would make me load transports one man per transport across all my transports instead of one transport at a time.  Still there are annoying glitches that make the game different from what you'd expect having played the board game.  In the game you can land US fighters on a UK carrier; not here.  That UK carrier with no planes on it that I just bought is now a sitting duck; yup, Germany just sunk it, it's gone.  Yes, this is buried in the rules for the online game but that's not the correct solution; the correct solution is to fix this.  Next game, I'm offloading US troops on transports into UK; for some reason the transports get put in the sea zone north of Scotland instead of with the rest of my fleet in the Irish sea; transports are now sitting ducks, yup, they're gone too.   How about asking me what sea zone I want to put the offloading transports in when there is more than one option?  These outcomes are things that would never happen in the real game that you learn not to do the hard way, it's frustrating.

There's much ado about dice, but just ignore those people. If the dice roll consistently badly for you, that means they rolled consistently well for the other guy, but you don't hear anyone complaining that they keep winning because of all these great rolls, right...? 

Transport UI got a lot of grief, but even after the most recent patch where they ""improved"" it, I still use the prior system (which is still in place) because it takes all of about 1 game to get used to it.

The latest patch changed some other details on the map, but I don't see the point in harping on those because they are iterating on the design, so that's fine.

The point is, the core is beautiful, the map, beautiful. A good video game reproduction makes you never want to play the real board game again because it takes care of so many minutiae for you. This game does that in spades.

Figured out how to change the speed. Fast AI speed makes a lot of a difference. AI does need a lot of work but overall I think the game has a lot of potential and I'm enjoying it.

The computer air defence is amazingly accurate for a 1 in six chance, It's virtually impossible to reach 50% hits with the 3 in 6 units (armor and fighters) for the human player. The only ""save"" is it saves the current state of a game so you can pick up where you left off, no way to explore other potential stategies without a complete replay.

If you want to make an AAR, or look back at the results, take good notes, because the summaries provides only cover the current # of territories, production, and ""attack power"" (a useless stat).  And forget about seeing the total dice rolls over the course of a game (you'll have to be real quick to record them on the computer turns).  The combat interface requires acknowledgement of every roll, except on the computer turn where the dice roll before the proper section of the chart is highlighted. They stuck too close to the board game in combat resolution by insisting on resolving losses with each section of the combat board.  It would have been better to have the die rolls for each section just appear on that line.  Then it would be one big roll for the attacker (barring subs' shoot first ability), choose losses, a place to pause for acknowledgement and digest what happened, then the same for the defender.  Also, if the computer is the attacker, your losses are picked for you and combat goes with out any input from you.

Interface wise, it's a little clunky. Left click to select, right click to move, shift-right click to cancel.  The summary of individual phases require a lot lot scrolling if you committed a lot of actions because the windows are so narrow. 

The ""Help"" only addresses the current phase overall, but the rules of the sgame are nowhere to be found.  So if you don't have much experience with Axis and Allies, pay close attention during the tutorial.  It's not a diffcult game, but that are some oddball rules here and there. 

For some reason transport moves sometimes abort, even if other transport moves to the same location go through.  This can really mess up an invasion.  Also some off-shore bombardment will sometimes abort.  You are alerted this happened, but not why, and not given any way to go back and adjust it.  Those moves/attacks are just lost. 

If you like Axis and Allies, this game might be worth getting on discount. If you've never played and are curious what A&A is all about, definitely don't buy at full price. Be aware it is a long game on the human turns and very jumpy on the computer ones, just like the board game. You'll spend a lot of time after computer turns looking around to see what happened.

- Well polished graphics and sounds
- The newest rules and overall balanced sides
- Not too many bugs (but suspect there are cheats, more on that later)
What I don't like:
- The interface is not always intuitive, especially on transports.  I am aware that many were used to the old Hasbro Interactive version from the late 90's  But even then, it's a bit frustrating trying to load/unload transports.  Sometimes you want to load up 2 inf on one trans and it automatically puts one on each separately.  I understand that maybe you want one or the other but right now there's no simply way to tell and doing it manually can be tedious.  The other major interface issue is when you ""confirm"" something, especially during non-combat moves, the view of the map is obstructed and there is no ""final state"" you can look at--just all the arrows going everywhere.  It would be very nice if like the Hasbro version you could actually SEE what the map would look like after you moved everything around and THEN be able to confirm for sure rather than just reading the pop up.
- There is no in game chat feature that I could find (if there is, then ignore this point) and the matching system for ranked play seems very random and haphazard.  Furthermore, it would be nice if you could customize the time limit to more than just 24 hours if both sides agree (and also limit your time if you plan on playing a game just straight on through).
- Finally, everyone's favorite: Dice and cheating.  I consider myself fairly good (not great, but not mediocre either).  While in Silver League I didn't notice too many things out of the ordinary.   I got good/bad rolls and so did my opponent.  BUT, once I started in Gold I noticed a few matches where the dice were acting suspiciously.  And what's more, they would seem to act suspiciously at critical battles (not just back and forth as you might see with Germany/USSR).  At first I just chalked it up to bad luck, but after reading more about it, I think there may be something going on here.  To any developer who says ""cheating is not possible"" is at best naive and at worst lying (seriously, how many times of cheating/hacking do people have to see that nothing is 100% fullproof).  I have a masters in Statistics, and the Law of Large numbers states that ""in the long run"" experimental averages (i.e. real dice rolls) will converge towards their theoretical probability.  In other words, that '1' for shooting down anti-air will occur in the long run 1/6 (~16%) of the time.  It's a fact.  If it doesn't it isn't truly random.  Of course, there is no magic number of how many times a ""long run"" but most reasonably a couple hundred samples should farm this out.  And yes, it is not going to be EXACT, but should be in the ballpark.  However, from what I've been reading, and some people who actually have been writing down data, I do believe that something is amiss with some players.   What would help the most to sniff this out is to have an entire game log somewhere of all the rolls in a particular game.  That way people can see if someone just happens to be lucky or consistently ""lucky"".

In sum, I would recommend if you are want to be ""casually"" involved in this fun game but long game (and accept the fact that dice can hose you).

this game is nice when i am playing by myself because i dont have to set up the board but sometimes the ai can be weird. if you are looking to get into A&A i would recommend this or 1941 edition. they cost about the same when not on sale and both take less time that other board games. this is better because it has unlimited units and no required setup, 1941 is better because you feel more control when your units are in front of your face and the rules are simpler.",1588715109,1588715109,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I think some of my negative review of the transport ship part still holds, but parts of that mechanic have improved, and once you get used to it now, it (mostly) makes sense now.

I now expect that the developers will continue improving this game. However, I think this is still  currently just a ""barely recommend"" for me and for the sake of clarity, I am leaving my old review here:
""I really like Axis and Allies, and I used to play the old Iron Blitz computer version for HOURS when I was younger.  I was really hoping to like this version, but it is not ready for purchase yet.  This is too bad, because I do like the AI (which is MUCH better than the old Iron Blitz edition).  I really do think the developers will improve this game further, and I am hopeful, but I cannot recommend it right now.

The movement mechanics (of the interface) are just too complicated and not intuitive at all (especially for ships and transport ships). In a game like this, even a single missed move or turn without transporting units can cost you the game, and it is far too easy using the current movement mechanic interface to leave units behind and or fail to pick up units correctly for transport.  You end up counting and double-counting that you moved everything and it takes like 10 million clicks (exaggerated) to do so, and then if on turn 7 for Britain you fail to perfectly count the ships you moved, boom you lose and have wasted like an hour and lost on a technicality.  The board game if you move a unit it clears out of the space you moved from and you can easily see that the space is cleared.  This version does this weird arrow thing and you can't easily tell what's been moved and what hasn't without further investigation.  Then once you click to go to the next step there is no way to go back and correct your mistakes.  If you do buy it, you'll easily see what I am talking about and be equally disappointed.

Don't buy this game unless the developers do a full 180 and acknowledge there is something wrong with their dice.  I've asked them to publish all of my dice rolls for the past several games I've been playing so people can see for themselves how their supposedly fair dice generator actually performs in real play.  It's awful and you'll see a LOT of people saying the same thing on the forums, especially about AA dice and shore bombardment support.  They are also very ""streaky"" where you can attack with 5 infantry, 2 tanks, and two fighters against two infantry and your entire force misses, not only on the first round, but one the second and third, then in the fourth round, every single unit hits.  Meanwhile, the two enemy infantry have hit for two in each of the first two rounds and then one more in the third.  Sure, this can happen.  It's chance.  But it's not chance when this sort of stuff happens OVER and OVER and OVER again.  Buyer beware.


UPDATE:  I've had to change my review to negative.  After hundreds of hours of playtime and ~75 ranked games complete (reaching Platinum level in both Axis and Allies factions), I believe, and many others believe, there are some major problems with this game's dice algorithm.  To their credit, the developers have repeatedly tried to comment and address these concerns, but if you check the game's discussion forums you will see complaint after complaint after complaint.  I'm pretty adept at math and statistics, and I'm certain that MY experience was certainly different than the normal laws of probability.  I may be an outlier, but according to the discussion forums, it certainly seems there are a LOT of ""outliers.""  Something seems very off.  And please don't even bother with strategic bombing runs...it is a losing endeavor...again, the dice are wildly skewed and not at all representative of normal probabilities.

Many people are requesting a ""low-luck"" dice option and the developers seem noncommittal.  I cannot recommend you spend time and money on this game until they either fix the dice algorithm, or institute a ""low-luck"" option.  As it is today, you'll get more frustration than fun out of this title.  Good luck and happy gaming.


ORIGINAL POST:
I purchased the game the day after release and waited a few days before writing this review.  The game is ""Early Access"" which means it is not done.  The developers are still working and have bugs to fix, interfaces to improve, and concepts to add and expand.  There were a lot of negative reviews the first day or two after release as there were some MAJOR bugs that made the game virtually unplayable.  All of which I agreed with, but since it was and is an early access game, I reserved judgement for at least a while, and intend to update this review as the game is more fully built-out.  They have since released a patch (on day 2 or 3) to fix many of the worst issues, so with that patch, I felt it was ok to now give this a thumbs-up.

At a high level, the game feels like you are playing a digital version of the Axis & Allies boardgame.  They did a great job of capturing that feel.  The art, sounds, dice rolls, etc help bring it to life without going overboard and changing it into something it's not.  Sometimes these can feel a bit much in a single-player game, but in a multi-player game, you really want each engagement to stir up some excitement, since in a 5-player-game, it can be a while before you are active again.  They did this well and I think from that standpoint at least, this will prove to be a pretty cool multiplayer game.

I am actually unfamiliar with this version of Axis & Allies (there are several) and found some of the pre-release concerns from players about the heavy slanting of the game in the Axis' favor to be worrying.  After playing a few single player games, I can definitely say this is the case, but I managed to win as the Allies on my first playthrough using them, so it isn't a totally broken ruleset, by any means.  Now, whether a skilled human Axis opponent can be beaten without a great deal of luck remains to be seen.  Hopefully the developers will institute other versions of the game rules or include a ""bidding"" system to help level the playing field.

Overall, if you know and love Axis & Allies and are looking for a new digital take on the game, I can say I recommend this one.  There are still kinks to work out, but I think the developers are generally being responsive and it seems like they DO actually want to make everyone happy with a great digital version of the game, and I for one think they are succeeding.",1564839616,1588078661,False,0,0,0.502905130386352539,1,True,False,True

I started playing the board game in the early 90's. The original board game rules are different than the 1942 version so if you've played it, don't expect it to be the same. I also played the computer A&A that was out years ago, and that game was way too easy. This is one is much more challenging. I agree with the reviewers who posted that the controls are difficult particularly with the transports. Trying to load, move and attack takes some getting used to. I'm about 6 games in and get it right about 75% of the time now. That definitely needs improvement. I also agree with the strong computer dice rolls. It could be that we are just pissed when we lose, but sometimes it seems too much to be true. I would say to the dev team that if the dice rolls aren't completely random, then shame on you. It could be me being a poor sport in some battles but some times it feels like the computer wasn't ready to give up that territory just yet. But again, it could just be randomized like the board game is and I'm being a crybaby about it. There is also little documentation that I can find around the rules although I haven't been to the developer site yet and don't own the 1942 version of the game.

I have won a game in this against the computer, I'm 1 for 2 so not bad. But I will say overall this game is really good and I'm thankful that someone put it together. I am such a fan of the board game and get it play it so rarely that this is truly a treat and I can't stop. I'm playing online with friends who play the board game with me and it's much easier than setting up the board and arguing about gray areas in the rules.

Like others have stated certain elements of the UI are not intuitive. The largest issue are loading/unloading transports (the transport has to moved on top of the units to be transported, and then the transport moved to the required sea zone, and then the transport moved onto the landmass for amphibious assault).

Shore bombardment the user has to drag their cruiser or battleship onto the landmass being amphibiously landed. The game allows those ships to move during the combat move phase (which is fine), but will not tooltip the player about bombardment (if they want and which territory) - and it is easy to forget to drag the ship onto the landmass to initiate shore bombardment. In other cases, the combat move phase does not tooltip to tell you if there are not enough ground units being landed to bombardment ships when trying to move more cruisers/battleships to support. The game just forces them back to their original sea zone and state they have to move in the non-combat phase.

Moving multiple units of same type from same territory - situational depending, may have to click the number on the bottom right corner of the unit icon to move the remainder of that unit stack one-by-one.

THERE IS NO TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT PHASE in this game - which is unusual for an Axis and Allies game (there is no option to turn it on either).

Reading the negative reviews, the biggest issue people seem to have is with the User Interface, which I found pretty intuitive, and the tutorial does a good job of explaining. The other issue seems to be related to the the dice rolling. In my experience in playing with friends, die rolls always favoured one player, meaning each battle was skewed. The other issue is with offline AI, which takes an inconsistent and unacceptable amount of time. At the time of writing, we are waiting for an AI for about 16 hours in a game, and had another AI take about 15 hours. In other test games, the AI took 15 minutes for its first turn, and subsequent turns were almost instant.

* Graphics are not even what the game was a decade ago, but how good does graphics need for a game like this.
* Sound is boring but not irritating
* Movement is functional not smooth. It could have been much more simplified but shortly into the tutorial you get it down.

This game has a great potential to really (and finally) have a modern implementation of Axis and Allies. So far there are somewhat too little customization options for games, also missing expansion rules and original rule set. Some bugs (e.g. no way, at least not that I was able to find it, to distinguish damages BS' from healthy ones in move phase. Or transport ships have to be selected individually to move more than one in non combat move phase).
But overall gameplay, graphics, etc. is adequate for modern expectations. I hope devs will implement more game types and flavours incl. customizable rules based on existing spin offs and expansions from the past decades of AaA (I wish you guys can add the scientists and atom bomb, conquering neutral countries, transport extension, heavy bombers, super subs, ground transport, etc.).
Another plus is the online mode and hotseat mode to play with friends saving on all the hassle of setting up a game and keeping track of all details. No more mistakes in counting distances, no forgetting of landing planes after combat, etc.
My favourite is that in window mode size can be adjusted freely and without hassle. This allows (being a turn based game) to have it run on the side and continue from time to time while waiting for something else you do to complete or cover a turn in your coffee break.
Let's hope development progresses swiftly and we see a full version including the above soon.

What I like about this computerized version of A&A:
 - It gets rid of a lot of the ""accounting"" needed to play the board game: looking up rules, rolling actual dice, adding/removing physical pieces to/from the game board.
 - During the combat phase, it highlights which of your units can attack something, and when you click on those units, it highlights the territories that unit can attack.  A big time-saver.
 - In other words, it streamlines the experience to the point where it's almost as easy as playing Risk.

What I'd like added:
 - Some way to know the Steam ID of your opponent so you can add them as a friend on Steam.
 - (Maybe) Some way to communicate with your opponent.

I think the computerized version makes the actual ""game"" of A&A a lot easier for me to appreciate, where when I would play the physical version I felt overwhelmed with the complexity relative to Risk.  I do think it's better to play with a battle-odds calculator, otherwise you'll have a brutal time slowly learning which combinations of units perform well when attacking and defending.

One downside of the computerized version is that it does feel less ""epic"" than when I'm playing in-person, especially if I have multiple online games going at the same time.  I don't get as emotionally involved as when I'm playing in-person.  And in my opinion, one of the big appeals of playing games like Risk and A&A is the emotional drama between players, the trash-talking, seeing your opponent's face when something good or bad is happening to them, etc.  So this is a great way to play if you can't play in-person, but I don't think it totally replaces the in-person experience.",1586125675,1586958305,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

You get an email when it's your turn and the game makes it easy to see what happened during your opponent's turn. And you can leave notes on the map to remind you of moves you want to make in the future so you don't forget between turns. 

At first it feels a little clunky but after a game or two it feels pretty good to me. Moving a large number of units around the map can be a little time consuming, and the way the transports work took a bit of getting used to. But it's not bad, and I'm confident that the devs will continue to make improvements over the coming weeks and months. 

The AI isn't stellar, but good enough to practice up a few games before going online where the game really shines. No AI can replicate the interesting/challenging/unexpected moves an opponent will make. 

Ranked play works great and keeps track of wins/losses. So far I've had very good luck matching up and playing very fun, competitive matches against other players. Awesome job beamdog! 

BTW all my multiplayer comments are talking about the game like it's 1v1. I know you can control a single country, but that doesn't seem very compelling in this format to me. Come to think of it I much prefer A&A one on one in real life as well. 

Over all the game gets a passing grade and is definitely recommended for fans of the game or games like it. Twenty bucks seems a little steep for people like me who have spent hundreds on the game over the years, but I'm happy to support a development shop that appears to listen to its customers and work hard on improvements. Keep up the good work!

UPDATE: As expected the game keeps getting better. If you like A&A buy it without hesitation. Play a couple matches against the AI to get used to the new unit placement and the way transports work, then get online and enjoy.

First the zoom out function sucks... you can never get a look at the entire game board, which is important when it comes to not forgetting an important non-combatant move at the end of your turn, etc.

Other players are so annoying about playing the game out when they have obviously lost. There should be other ways to win besides capturing a certain amount of cities... economic victory, etc. Furthermore, any country's forces going COMPLETELY down (UK, Russia, etc), should signify an automatic victory. There is no way to recover from such a thing, yet many players will continue in hopes of drawing the game out and frustrating their opponent into forfeiting. This also works if life gets in the way and their opponent can't take their turn in 24 hours... I know that seems like a long time, but things can happen. The point is that players are intentionally drawing out unwinnable games in hopes of drawing a forfeit, which completely ruins the experience and finally got me to uninstall. 

Forcing another 3 or 4 turns might add up to several hours of game play mixed in with 3 or 4 days of checking to see if they've finally gone (one has 24 hours to take their turn, etc)... who has time for such childish nonsense?

The other aspects of the game that are wonky involve the beginning positions, which give the Axis Powers a clear advantage from the start. This is different from the original version and takes some getting used to, but it's manageable if not enjoyable. Additionally, the new rules involving battle ships, submarines and destroyers take some getting used to as well.

Finally, while it could just be chance, there have been times when it almost seems like the dice are being hacked. I've had large scale mathematical advantages and still lost battles... badly. Of course, there's no way to know for sure, but from a statistical standpoint die rolls should average out over time. However, there have been a few games against other players where this just never seems to happen, leaving me to wonder if something's going on, etc.

I played 9.3 hrs before writing this review, and I think I gave it a shot. I like playing against AI, just like most of the games. First things first. There is no way for me to beat the AI. I tried my best, different tactics, many games started. After 3,4 rounds, it's a certain defeat for me. There must be a way to determine the difficulty level of opponents and choose the one that you feel you can compete. There's no way of getting better if you just lose and don't take from easy to hard. Also, there could be a way to save your games, not just autosave, but it's not a must. Anyway, the graphics are ok, the gameplay feels natural, and I would really love to play some more, but it's frustrating to keep on losing after a few moves. I played the 98' version a lot, and I think I am not a novice, although not an expert. For people that are not experts in AA and want to buy it, I would not recommend it.

What a fun way to recreate the greatest conflict in history.   much of the issues i have is with the interface when selecting groups of transports to load them up with dudes and tanks and arty.  some sea zones get kinda crowded.

I miss the ability of not being able to take away IPCs, eventhough repairing  your factory has a similar effect.  

I do miss the tech tree tho.  R&D added some crazy OP scenarios.  Maybe one day having the ability to mod the game to build on the old optional rules like Russia not attacking first round or Germany or Japan having some starting tech.

But you are at the mercy of the attacker watching the dice rolls,  so if they skip thru fast you end up with the result only and no real idea how you got there.  Communication with an ally is also difficult, and communication with your foe is non-existent.

Unfortunately, this is because it is trying to copy WWII. At the beginning, everything is set up for an Axis blitz and no matter how many forces you set up against the Germans or Japanese, they will overcome: the way the game does it is to allow many fewer hits for the Allies than the Axis forces through the die activity at the very beginning, thus you could attack a small German force with Five times the force, and you would lose the battle, if it was a critical one, for example in Kyrelia SR. I wondered why there were tutorials only explaining the first moves for each side on You Tube, and this is why. The first move can only really be played one way for a maximum effect because the Axis advance is weighted against the Allies. This continues throughout the first moves of the game until it evens out a bit more near the middle of the game and the Allies are allowed to be more successful, thus supporting the game design for WWII, which is that Axis wins at the start, and then the Allies win. This game never starts with the Allies winning and the Aixis pushing back. So for me it wasn't an 'open' game where anything can happen at the start.

Whats right with it?

I played the original board game back in the 80's in the UK and just had a long overdue rematch with players now living in Australia and Canada so its recommended for that alone. In this case the Play By Mail (PBM) aspect is excellent.

Visually it looks like a board which is a good thing and it seems to have captured the essence of the board game pretty well.

The AI provides a reasonable challenge but like most AI's is best left for practice/experimentation of tactics.

What's wrong with it?

There is currently no in game audio communication which defeats the play with friends aspect a little so we use Skype.

The customisation is also poor as far as I can see especially as there is no ability to increase or reduce the 24 hour 'take your turn' limit for the PBM,

Unfortunately all sides are created equal it would better if some players could be granted advantages such as granting additional income to certain players especially new players. I have young grandchildren and it would be helpful to increase their countries' income whilst they learn the game. Especially as there is no AI level (or Grandad) adjustment.

Transports are 'clunky' at best, for example you seem to need to be extremely careful how they are loaded, moved and unloaded.

There is also an unbelievable amount of clicking with each group of attacking/defending units needing to be rolled individually so you need to click roll dice up to 4 times per round. 

Casualties are then inflicted by each group, in the board game the total casualties were removed in one go, this in rare occurrences can effect whether to lose that last ground unit or not.

A minor point but you must click end phase and confirm it even when the phase is unnecessary, in the worst case in one of our games the Russians were completely eliminated but the player was still required to click through each phase.",1583535922,1584020641,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I spend more time trying to get the transports doing what they're supposed to do in the time it takes me to plan out 10 turns. This is the ridiculous annoying part of the game when you're trying to coordinate 3-7 transports and units going to different places. To the Devs - On the map you need to separate units so you can specify what is loaded with what and where they're going. Another thing that's a big let down is combat vs AI. It's junk. There's no assigning hits, there's no rolling, there's nothing. AI attacks and you just watch the map change color. On the positive side it's a great early rendition of the game.

The big thing I have an issue with is that tanks roll 3-3. In the old game it was 3-2 which I feel brought more balance and variety to gameplay and strategy. There's really no reason to use anything other than tanks. Before because they were mostly an offensive unit it would make more sense to defend with men since they're cheaper and have the same def roll. Now there's no reason to. You get more mobility, offense and defense using tanks. I prefer more strategy in unit composition. It's also too easy, against the AI at least. AI needs work with transports. I blocked the territories USA/UK landed on in Norway and the one above Germany and they just stopped landing altogether lol. I miss the tech upgrade options, paratroopers and scorched earth. All those other settings you could tinker with was nice. Also sucks screwing up and not having the time machine ha ha. Another gripe, the sneak attack for submarines used to be offensive only, now it's only defensive which is strange and it rolls every turn in battle which doesn't make sense.

Early access is indeed a method in which companies can get funding to have the ability to work on their projects.

The positive.
-Nostalgia. For me this game holds a great deal of nostalgia, I recall when I was younger huddled around a table playing this with my dad, brother and some friends. It was a fantastic strategy game and replaying the online version I cannot help but feel that hint of remembrance from my childhood. 

-Simple and easy to learn. The pieces, information and everything you need to learn how to play the online game is readily available and often just a click to pop up a tool tip, see a units stats and any other bits. There's even a system that lets you mark points of attack, points of defense and other bits to mark points of interest to other players. I've introduced 2 people to the game thus far and both have been able to pick it up and learn reasonable well in a short amount of time.

The negative. 

-Constant distruption of game play. The AI is controlled server side, unless you're playing singleplayer. My friends and I have had countless games suddenly grinded to a halt because of an error, an outage or otherwise from the server side of the online experience. Even when the server side isn't down, as we could often make a separate game and the AI would be working for the new game, the AI will often just stop playing and won't take their turn. 

-The AI is absolute trash. This is speaking for the Allies AI. I have never seen such a horrible designed AI. This is Big rigs level of programming absurdity. Anyone with a nascent of knowledge in history will tell you that the U.S fought, with much difficulty, to beat back the advancing Japanese navy might in the pacific. You'll experience none of that here unless the U.S is controlled by a player. The AI entirely ignores Japan beyond the initial starting turn. I'm not speaking just of the U.S, UK will as well in Asia. 

UK will pull units out of India right before a major attack, leaving it entirely defenseless even when they have superior numbers. You could argue this is a tactical retreat with some thought towards taking it back, but no. UK will never take back India once Japan has gotten a hold of it. UK will not take back it's lands in Africa either. So if you're playing Russia, plan to spend most of your playthrough trying to retake lands that both of your AI partners refuse to defend or reclaim.

The AI is programmed to purely focus on Germany. This leaves Russia's flank entirely exposed and will never be given aid by an AI beyond at best a plane or two. The country with the worst currency per turn is fighting both major axis on two fronts and given practically no aid by their allies. UK might land in Karelia, but that's about as much help as you can expect. They will spend the entirety of their focus trying to land units in France, or leaving them doing nothing in Norway. 

The amateur nature of their AI programming is evident further with their lack of total conquest mode. The AI can only focus on Germany currently. It will offer no divergence of tactics.

I would not recommend buying this game if you expect it to be like the board game, it's not even close. I bought this game expecting it to be like the 1998 version of Hasbro Interactive Axis and Allies which was like the board game only an electronic version.  Unfortunately this game falls short for a couple reasons.

1. Dice: The dice and the rolling graphics are sad.  They don't even look like dice and when there are multiple dice with the same number they only show 1 dice with a small quantity number next to it.  The actual board game has 6 dice which are then re-rolled until all the combat has finished.  The 1998 version actually had multiple rolls and multiple dice and did the same thing with multiple rolls.  This game does not do that and the dice are not even animated.  There is an option to show animation but it's only a cheesy outline and it doesn't keep up the hit markers if you have it turned on, even if you slow the sequence down.  This does not even have the feel of a board game but more like a phone app.

2. Assigning Damage:  The developers have removed the players ability to manually assign damage for each defensive action.  You have a profile that you can set up but the damage will be assigned by that profile automatically so you have zero flexibility when assigning damage.  This is another thing the developers said they have no intention of changing.  Personally I like the option of assigning my damage during the rolls.  Since it all happens automatically you can only view the log to see what happened in the combat.  Even slowed down it's too fast to follow. Also, you cannot use empty troop transports as cannon fodder which was allowed in the original board game. I don't know if that has change since I played it, but all ships in a battle group should be in combat not just the armed ships.

3. Interface:  The map interface is a bit confusing when moving your units.  There is no drag and drop and it's all done with left click / right click of the mouse.  It makes it hard to undo your moves and I found myself canceling out all of my moves and starting over many times.

The positive side is that they have a really good start on something that could be turned into a great game if they make some improvements in the interface, dice rolls, and damage assignments.  I would like to see dice rolls like Hand of Fate (grab the dice with the mouse and roll them) but at a minimum they need multiple dice and multiple rolls and the option to manually assign your defensive damage.

Unfortunately for me I waited too long to get a refund so I'm stuck with this game.  I can only hope they will improve it by the time it comes out of early access.  If no improvements are made I will uninstall it and chalk it up as another mistake buying into early access games.  I will not recommend this game to anyone expecting an electronic board game or anything like the 1998 version by Hasbro, it doesn't compare.",1582043203,1582043203,False,20,2,0.63177192211151123,0,True,False,True

Multiplayer: If you can maintain a stable connection for 2 hours you might be lucky enough to play an entire game without some sort of glitch especially during combat rolls, the game will simply not throw the dice.

For one, the Soviet Union is such an underpowered faction that it will eventually be defeated without Allied help. The issue with the Allied help is that, if Germany attacks the U.K. with its navy and aircraft in the North Sea on the first turn, Germany has a 59% chance of success in the battle (I ran the numbers). If Germany wins, it will usually just blockade the British Navy in port. Since the British only have one major port in the empire, and since the majority of the U.S. Navy is in the Pacific, this situation usually prevents D-Day from happening and U.S. troops reaching europe until Japan is defeated, not the other way around like it was historically.

Speaking of Japan, why are Japan and the Soviet Union at war with each other, because they weren't in 1942.

Related to combat, infantry is underpowered in the game. Infantry has an attack of 1 and a defense of 2. They did have anti-tank and anti-aircraft guns. Look at the Soviet Union, which had a lot of infantry in WW2 -- and if infantry is so poor in combat, then how are they supposed to have a fair fight?

In addition, tanks have a better defense than they should. In my opinion, tanks should have a defense of 2 and infantry should have a defense of 3.

I also don't care for the fact that aircraft cannot scramble to intercept enemy forces in one territory of the aircraft. Also, anti-aircraft guns should take part in the defense of enemy bombing raids.

First--Beamdog--you need to change the transport mechanics for load and uploading. That is counter-intuitive and needlessly opaque. That should be an easy fix--and you will see in these forums plenty of folks commenting on it....

THE GOOD: It's Axis and Allies and the ""one more turn"" appeal is certainly effective here. You will need to check out the tutorial to get a handle of the interface and flow of the game. Look, if you enjoyed Axis and Allies back in the day, then here is a chance to get some of same thrill and challenge without spending an afternoon spread out on your parent's living room floor, with 2 or 3 buddies. Now you can do it all yourself, play faster games (without the pain of setting up the board!) and have a pretty jolly time.

THE BAD: There are a few odd interface/mechanics choices. If you get stuck, just do a quick Google search or watch the Tutorials. There are the occassional glitches and even the occassional crash---but nothing too outrageous. They're still fine-tuning the engine.  

REQUEST: If the games makes money for Beamdog, I hope they add alternative scenarios, like ""Zombie Apocyalpse"" or some weirdo alt-history opportunities.

Pros:
+Runs relatively smoothly, especially for early access
+Experiencing very few bugs
+Can play any and all 5 countries and any combinations (US, England, Russia, Germany, Japan)
+Lots of good quality of life features such as keeping track of IPC accurately, ability to speed up battles, readily available rulebook, easy-to-access description of all units, and much more
+Online works relatively smoothly

Cons:
-When the AI does their turn, it is VERY difficult to follow. The moves are done SO fast it is hard to process what is happening
-Cannot watch battles you do not initiate. IE if I am Axis and US attacks Japanese in naval battle, the battle happens automatically, and you cannot choose which units take hits, or even how the battle ended sometimes because it's so fast.
-Music is horrendous. Just mute that shit and throw on Netflix or Spotify.
-Sometiems have to exit to main menu and rejoin because map goes blank or you can't advance your turn.
-No online chat feature.
-HUGE one here: opponent has 24 REAL LIFE HOURS to make a move online. Absolutely unacceptable. They need to do very small time limits for each phase.
-AI. When I was the Allies, the AI actually put up a decent fight, mostly because Germany kept up good pressure on Africa and Russia. Japan was questionable. When I was Axis, the Allies were horrendous. Russia was too aggressive, England was almost non-existent, trying to put resources into India, and letting Germany strut through Europe. America actually had a nice invasion of France, but let Japan run hog wild and take Canada, Hawaii, Alaska, and China uncontested.

I am changing this to a thumbs up.  The UI still needs work, but once you get the hang of it, its pretty easy.  The main issue is the AI going down during multiplayer games, but it isn't as common as it was when I originally wrote my review.

The main reason for the change, is that the dev's are actually working on the game and improving it.  After being burned over and over on early access games, this seems to be one of the good ones with a good Dev team.

Although there are a few things I'd love to see added.
1 - I'd love to see the Zombie version of the game added as a game option
2 - And conquest mode on multiplayer.  



---------------

Overall, I think this game has a ton of potential.  It is fun when it works, because even when the odds are stacked against you, you can in.  But in the current state, I can't recommend it. 

Pros
It stays true to the board game - a lot of games like to ""make it their own"" and end up ruining aspects of the original game that make it that game.  These guys don't do that. And that's great. 
Online Co-op play - this is a huge draw for me since I love playing games with my friends.  And we prefer to work together than compete. And it being assymetrical means that we can 

Cons
Controls - the controls aren't done too well.  It can be difficult to do simple things such as load or unload transport ships. Even in the tutorial and reading what to do over and over, it was clunky.  
Online Co-op is done poorly - its  cool that it is asymetrical, but rather than the host's PC making the AI moves, the moves are done on a remote server.  Unfortunately in the past 3 days, the server has been down for 2 of them.  So you literally cannot play against the AI online.

And these issues are bad enough to make it where I can't recommend this game in the current state. But both of these are able to be fixed, and it so, this will be a resounding positive.",1579500310,1580634910,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,6,True,False,True

For veteran players it wont pose to much of a challenge.  The arrows some times get in the way  and you have to be careful to make sure all the units are going.

Major issues that need to be addressed:  Defenders need to be able to choose their casualties.  For example.  Naval battle is going poorly and you want to inflict maximum damage, choose the carriers over the fighters where other times you may want to keep carriers at all costs.

Saves need to be a thing to recover from AI errors/crashes.

Being able to ping the map needs to be a thing.

Response to Julius Borisov:

I bought this game in full awareness that it was in early access should have perhaps indicated it did an awful job of meeting my expectations rather than simply labeling it awful.

I anticipated a board game in development: buggy, not 100% functional. I did not anticipate your design choices. 

Why does online play depend on the server being up? Let me host a game locally that my friends can join. We’ll keep track of wins and losses on our own, thanks.
 
Combat does not allow for the defender to decide which units are removed from the board unless an in-game template is applied. The template consists of a list of units to which you can apply the order in which they are removed from the game board. It’s linear and insufficient. 

There is no in-game communication save for a note posting system. I have not read of plans to improve this, but may have missed it.

In recognition of the game's early access state I am not commenting on performance, or the UI, or bugs.

I want a board game I can play remotely with friends in a fashion similar to actual board games. Real time. Communicating, laughing, taunting etc.

So let me get into the review. The tutorial was not very helpful, had to just figure out most things, but it's early access so I was not expecting everything to be perfect. So the tutorial really needs some work. I have only tried the single player options. I have completed about 8 games so far, all allied side, controlling all 3 allies. I am in my 1st play through as the axis, controlling both Japan and Germany.
So here it is so far:
1. I have had several (4 or 5) times when going to the next phase the game locked up, with a black screen & sound still playing. Shut down with task manager and was able to restart the game and finish. (4 as allies, 1 as axis)
2. had one crash with ""reload"" message (unhandled rejection) blah blah blah. version 0.61.0 couldn't send report in offline mode. the relioad worked correctly and game restarted (I took screen shot and can forward it if you let me know where to send it)
3. The allied side is HARD! I tried a couple of times on standard mode and got but kicked (but learned some of the game play. then tried the ""competition mode"" was then able to win on allied side. seems a little more balanced. 
4. am in my 1st play through on axis side in the ""comp"" mode. and might pull off a win.
5. I haven't tried VS mode online, I assume I need to already have a friend that has the game to try it. So hit me up and friend me and I will give it a try. (a match making option if it doesn't exist would be sweet)
WISH LIST: I would love it if all the customization options from the orig. game were added! at least for single player. But it would be cool to be able to have them in VS mode to add nearly unlimited ""custom"" variants for tourney/online play.
keep up the good work!

And the AI doesn't seems to construct industrial complex? Not sure if that's its decision or failure to utilize game's function. But overall, a fun game to play.

There will be time when you're crushed by losing to unlikely battles, but odds are still odds, never guaranteed. Best thing you can do is shaping the odds in your favor. Unlike Math, where you can apply the same formulae and get exactly what you expected. The tide of the war can turns itself around by a single dice roll, testing your resolves. Meaning the more dynamic the dice rolls, the more challenging the game becomes and I've learned to appreciate that. (but really, tbh, I think it's even more consistent than actual dice rolls in real life...maybe I got scammed, lol)

Degree of predictability is just like that as of life. And you can always get plssed of by it but what's the point? There's an ancient Chinese quote ""Man plans, heaven ordains."" It will do you wonder to be more open-mind and accept the outcome, which may, or may not be the consequence of your actions. To my understanding, majority players of ""strategy"" games are excellent tactical players, the kinda people who would prefer definite objectives, clearly defined course of actions and consistency of things in general. So it makes sense for randomness belong in this genre to suffer certain amount of backfires. But as a player, I think it's still rather unfair to give negative reviews simply because of the dice, as no man has influence over it. (assuming dice rolls in online matches made remotely on the server?)

Haven't play many board games myself, at least I think it's more fun than Risk.
- I would love custom placement options, campaign replays and stronger AI.
- In-game performance needs real optimization, and a faster startup will be a good addition.

I can see so many rooms for improvement, but since the developers seems to be very active, I will wait and see how it goes with great expectation. It was a good purchase, and I'm still enjoying it.

Cons:
 My biggest complaint is in multiplayer, not being able to select which troops you want to lose while defending is a big problem. In a battle with a friend, I had an aircraft carrier and a fighter defending, the game chose to kill the fighter when I took a hit, making the possible damage the fighter could have done non existent. Beyond that, transports feel very weird. Seeing as they are very important for an allied victory, their mechanics should be looked at.
The UI isn't that bad, I do wish it would not keep popping up every new turn, instead only when I clicked on it.
In Multiplayer you should be able to be on the same side as a friend, the ai in this game seems fairly capable of wiping the floor with you and being on the same team with a friend would be a fun time.
There's occasional bugs but what would you expect. it's early access.

Pros: The Multiplayer is super fun. If you get a friend to play with you, even better. 
The dice rolls are balanced I feel, sometimes you will outright lose an easy fight. Sometimes what should be a disaster, isn't.
The sounds are GREAT, I love going into battles with guns and bombs going off, really adds to the suspense.
The auto landing of planes in noncombat is a really good idea and was not in the old game. But you should be able to choose where they land.

Suggestions: Fix the things I said in the cons, they are not big problems but they would definitely be a big step for a more refined game.
Battle ships should not repair out of combat unless next to an industrial seazone, the repair enables you to just mass battleships and never lose them.
In multiplayer, you should not be able to close out of a defending battle. This goes along with being able to choose which troops get hit.

It is a lot more simple than other strategy games you can buy on Steam, such as Hearts of Iron IV which is a very in-depth strategy game, thus making Axis and Allies (PC) as a pretty good beginner strategy game or a game to kill time with. Skip to the end for what I think should be added to the game.

The turned based aspect of the game is separated into five phases: Purchase, Combat Movement, Combat, Non-Combat, and Mobilization phases. Each phase is pretty self explanatory, but will be briefly gone over. Purchase is when you can buy units with Industrial Credits, Combat Movement is when you can move units into attacking enemy territories/units, Combat is when you resolve the units moved into combat, Non-Combat is when you can move units about without getting them involved with combat, and Mobilization is when you can place bought units from the Purchase phase onto Factory territories. Units that can do stuff during each phase will be highlighted, but you don't have to move them if you don't want to. The order of turns are as such: Russia, Germany, UK, Japan, and US.

Combat is resolved through simple, random dice rolls for each respective unit in combat. Each unit has a roll to it such as ""Two or Less,"" meaning the unit has to roll a two or less to garner a ""Hit"" on an enemy unit. ""Hits"" are indiscriminate, meaning they can hurt any unit on the battlefield. The one being hit gets to assign which units die, so let's go over a quick scenario if this sounds all confusing.

I send an infantry unit and an airplane to attack a territory held by Japan with one infantry unit in it, an Infantry Unit without Artillery is attributed a One or Less, and the plane has a Four or Less. The defending Infantry unit always gets a Two or Less, since they have the advantage. I roll a two for the infantry, and a three for the plane, so garner one hit against the enemy unit. The enemy unit rolls and gets a one, so now I have to take that ""Hit"" and essentially kill one of my units. I decided to kill my Infantry Unit, and the enemy AI does so, too. Now combat has been resolved, however I can't take the territory since planes cannot land in enemy territory, so the land stays in enemy hands. I would've won the battle, but it is overall a failed invasion.

The various attacks are so: Land Invasions, Naval Battles, Amphibious Assaults, and Air Raids. Doesn't sound like a lot, but honestly that's pretty much every game and this reflects the overall simplicity of the game.

Graphics are pretty much what you'd expect and don't lie in the above pictures, and are very much inspired by what the board game looks like.

Controls are actually pretty simple, and I'm very confused as to why people are having trouble with movement. Left click to select a unit or group of same units in a territory, you will then see tiles that are high lighted red or blue where you can move the unit. Red for attack (during Combat Movement Phase), blue for non combat movement. Right click to send a single unit there, right click multiple times to send multiple of the same unit. It's actually very easy. Transports can gather units off of adjacent land, select the Transport and right click the units you want to transport, you can have two max. Then right click on the tile you want to send them within range. There is one bug to Transports, which I'm assuming is what is ticking people off, and that is where you can't right click multiple transports to send them all to one tile. Instead, you have to click on the group > click the drop down menu > then select each transport individually and send them. This is a pain, and I can see why people get frustrated, so get this fixed!

Here are couple things I don't like about the game: there is no fast forward button during single player, which is a real bummer. However, the game can easily be placed in window mode and fitted to whatever size you choose, which I actually really like or else I wouldn't play this game as much as I have been. The Russians are way too weak, which leads to the inevitable demise of the Allies in most matches. I feel the Russian units need to be cheaper and a starting factory to the east because they simply get choked by the Axis on both side, leading to the demise of the UK in India, thus losing the game. Seriously, buff the Russians, they're way too weak. Online is pretty much non existent, but the potential is there! Currently online servers are user made, which is great if you want to play with friends, but you don't get that same thing with strangers. There isn't a server list to choose from unless other people have made servers, so you have to make a server that others can join. You don't need to buy a server, but you do have to host one.

Overall, I like the game, and I'm going to be making a guide on this address many of the issues others have been hiding. I can't stress this enough that this game is faithfully based off of the board game, so don't expect HOI 4 expectations. It's cheaper that most strategy games, and I was able to snag this for a cool $10, which is very much worth it if you can buy it for that price. I personally think $20 is a little too much unless they fix the balancing, for it is really hard to win as the Allies at the moment.",1579220972,1579220972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The developers over complicated the way you move units in the U.I.  
They should just make the units drag and drop, rather than left clicking and right clicking the units and zones (the poor design of the U.I. makes the board game actually feel easier to play especially when trying to back out of or trying to cancel multiple moves)

Transporting units by Transport Ships is confusing and not intuitive.  
Its difficult to move multiple units on same stack to different locations. 
Its difficult to determine what units are being held in cargo in each transport of the same stack.
When attacked by A.I. the screen skips over the dice roll and the results of the attack.   So, units will disappear on map after a turn completes without any knowledge of what happened to those units.
U.I. design - A.I. movements and attacks are hard to follow.  You will hear clicks and see arrows drawn and at times you will see the screen pace back and forth 5-10 times with nothing happening. The developer has added a button to unfollow movements to prevent the screen from jumping around.

It seems like a good game.  The underlying artwork, animations, and phases of each turn for the PC version have a good flow.  Just fighting with the U.I. in its current state just makes the game hard to follow and annoying to play.",1579201595,1579203440,False,0,0,0,3,True,False,True

The AI seems pretty easy, and there are no difficulty selections, so I assume the main selling point is the online mode (which I have yet to try). All that aside, there are a few specific things I'd like to see in this:

1) A difficulty selection, with harder/more skilled AI.
2) A way to select all units in a zone at once when attacking/moving.
3) Additional options for victory conditions. Total point value, number of capitals, etc.
4) As is, the defender in combat must have a pre-set definition for which units take hits & in what order. This is a really cool feature, but I wish it was optional, and I could manually select pieces. It's weird that you can manually select hit pieces when attacking, but not while defending.
5) Once victory conditions are met, an option to continue to play indefinitely if you wish (sort of like in Civilization)
6) Different versions of the game. It would be nice to jump into Classic, 1941, or even the WW1 versions of the game to mix things up.
7) Custom game modes. I would love to be able to modify the board's default state and create custom game modes. Maybe even a map editor? 
8) I don't like the little circle icons the units turn into when you zoom out far enough. It makes them harder to differentiate at a glance. I'd love an option to turn those off and just have the pieces themselves scale down the further you zoom out.
9) I think having unit icons next to the transport they are loaded on would be a cleaner solution then having to click on one to see what's loaded on it. In general, the process of loading and unloading units feels clunky.

I don't often go for Early Access, and was surprised at how complete this feels.

At AI isn't terrible and doesn't always make the same opening moves like on the older version of the game.  That said, the AI strategy starts to go downhill after about turn 3.  

The one complaint I have (and some others have noted as well) is that during AI combat moves things just sort of happen behind the scenes.

I recently purchased this online version, and having the ability to find a game at any time has been fun (harder for me to do using the actual board game). In the game, you are one or more countries that represent the Axis or Allies. You can play with and against one or more players (1v1, 1v2, 2v2, 1v3, 2v3). Each player has money they receive for the territories they control. You use this money to buy combat units - infantry, tanks, planes, ships. The units have an offensive and defensive value when battling the enemy. With these units, you try to take and hold a pre-determined number of Victory cities to win the game.
One of the best features of this game is that it is turned-based, meaning you can leave it until it is your turn to play. Note that you will want to customize your Defense Profile settings to have certain units lost in battle first. While this may not be the overall best solution, it does keep the game moving (otherwise there would be so much waiting that the game would be unplayable).

Before I delve into my improvement requests, I would absolutely recommend this game to people who enjoy war strategy games.

That said, this early version does come with a learning curve. My first curve is I was not familiar with the 1942 rules as I play the 50th Anniversary edition. For those unfamiliar, there are slight differences. To get at least a little familiar, I did play a few games vs computer though I still found myself with questions once I started playing other people.
Second the user interface is basic. I had trouble with the right-click/left-click sequence when loading transports. Additionally loading transport with infantry in England is hard b/c the game wants you to click on a very specific spot. Zooming in helps. As this is an early access edition, hopefully a new user interface is added in the future.
Third, chatting with teammates is also basic as you leave notes in territories on the map. Upgrade request: keep this feature, but also add a chat box so teams can have a live discussion.
Fourth: add 50th anniversary rules as an option please... lol
Fifth: custom Defense profile on a territory-basis. For example: I want all my territories to follow my game settings, but I want Caucasus to be slightly different. It would be nice to have a custom defense setting for a territory (with an easy remove setting once I want it to return to general game setting).
Sixth: If playing live, allowing defensive player to select unit loses.

Pros:
 - The game is identical to the board game in every way.
 - It's fun, easy and simple to understand and learn.
 - If you want to play the board game, or want to play the board game knowing that nobody will play with you, then the AI isn't terrible.
 - Learning different strategies with other A&A players.
 - Multiplayer against other players (2-5) and play a different game everytime!

Cons:
 - I said the AI isn't terrible, but it isn't good either.
 - Bugs... A fair few bugs... Game keeps crashing have to reload the game.
 - India, a strong nation for the UK to build units out of, doesn't do anything in single player. Making the game that bit easier for the AXIS player against the AI.

The game is in EARLY ACCESS and isn't the final product so I can understand the bugs and the AI, this is just the beginning. I among a lot of other people are REALLY hoping for AI difficulty, bugs fixes, edit mode and A&A Global, whether that's a free update or a DLC down the line.

I would play this game everyday if the board wasn't so labor intensive to set up. Which is why I was stoked Axis & Allies created an online Steam Version. However, the developers have really missed the mark on this one. 

Graphics: 4/10
Reasons: This game should not be as resource heavy as it is. I have played better running mobile versions of this game. The way the map/territory names disappear after you zoom out even a little is ridiculous. I am also plagued with the ""Memory Leak"" the previous patch was supposed to fix. My computer far exceeds minimum requirements of this game (My comp can run Star Citizen, just let that sink in)

User Interface: 0/10
Reasons: The controls of this game are GARBAGE! The map is covered in unnecessary display windows and simple actions such as ""loading and moving a transport"" are a 5 step process. The act of moving units around leaves a lot to be desired. Again, I have played mobile versions where you literally ""click and drag"" units around and I feel that is better function than the current control scheme of this game. 

Settings: 3/10
Reasons: The Auto Casualty system is a bad decision. The game forces you to set ""Casualty Priority"" when defending. There ARE situations where having the ability to manually select your casualties while defending could be the difference between winning and losing. 
Example: If I am defending and I have only an infantry and a fighter plane left, I have just won my defense but need to select a casualty, I might elect to kill the fighter as the next round that fighter can not capture adjacent territories. What if the next territory was an undefended capitol? That setting has just robbed me of a possible victory.

Conclusion: I am a very ""easy to impress"" gamer. I have been playing video games and table top games most of my life. I WILL revise my review of this game at a later time when the developers overhaul this ""missed mark"" of a game. I feel bad that I am even leaving such a bad review of one of my favorite board games, but I just can't be silent about this one!",1578079094,1578079094,False,3,0,0.514555633068084717,0,True,False,True

However, this version of the game definitely needs work. I own the 1998 version of the game and it works better (and actually has customization options), and runs at a higher framerate (somehow this game feels like it runs below 60fps even on a beast of a computer). Some controls are unintuitive (for example, loading transports), and there are random cutscenes where I'm sure we would all appreciate the original combat mechanics from the 1998 game (including the ability to choose what gets killed during defense in a single-player or hotseat game instead of the computer automatically doing it for us).

Other than that, this game is amazing because it's Axis and Allies. It is worth buying even with these inconveniences, but will hopefully be much better after a couple updates.

The game has cut scenes for each battle you fight going to the combat board. Transport movement is just like it has always been. You can move pick up units move again and drop them off all with in the 2 space movement of a transport. Its not clunky like reviews say, you just have to not be an idiot to figure it out lol. Its a combo of left and right clicks. Only the attackers see the battles, so if the AI attacks you, you don't see the battle. But there is a review log for each battle for every nation. The log shows where the attack was, and the units lost on both sides. I figure its to speed up the game so the player is not forced to watch every small battle of 1 infantry lost. Yes Germany has an advantage over Russia much like in the original. Russia depends on the help of the Allies to survive. Strategic naval moves between US and Japan make the island hoping a challenge. Battleship and Aircraft carriers are significant for controlling the pacific. UK cant just lolly gag a navy around the Atlantic with the German air power looking to knock out undefended ships and transports. Tough decision if you play USA. Do you go after GE and leave Japan unchallenged. Or do you build a powerful navy and attack the islands of Japan, leaving UK and Russia to deal with Germany. I find it tough for US to commit on both fronts effectively. Best to pick one or the other and be decisive with funds. US needs to get in the fight asap. Overall a good game.

Note: If you are new to A&A, ignore the rest and get the game. It is very good. Devs, please read.

1. Better AI: The AI can make some pretty dumb moves and tends to turtle way to early. Russia AI pretty much buys ONLY infantry, never artillery. Japan and US spam destroyers when they lose a lot of naval units. Also, PLEASE enable AI for total victory. Even if you have to make a game mode where the AI wins with standard but the player needs total victory, it would make the game so much better.

2. Custom setup: The only available setups are standard 1942 and some tournament setup. I would love the ability to change the starting troops and territory control and save custom starting maps, as well as playing with different alliance setups, eg, I saw one player on a forum who liked to play USSR/Germany vs. UK/US/Japan with the board version. It would really help to make the game more interesting, especially in single player.

3. Make it easier to give orders to multiple transports in the same sea zone. I have no trouble with single transports, but when I have a stack of two or more, they tend to not pick up only one unit.

4. Finally, add more A&A versions. I would like to see the original A&A, Revised edition, Anniversary edition, both 1940 games and global 1940, 1941, and 1914.

All in all, I think custom setup/alliances and more versions is most important in order to keep the game interesting.",1577926776,1577926776,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

I only bought it because Im a huge A&A fan. the games biggest problem is the damn die roller. The Die roller is merciless when rolling for the opponent in a computer game. when going through a combat sequence the die roller throws the dice so quickly you don't get any time to analyze the results. If you have dice animations turned on half the rolls are not even visiible. Please be aware this is on the VERY SLOW game speed option.   Another problem is when the computer just skips over combat sequences and just plasters the results instead. wanna do that naval battle first? You get to skip that and watch invisible dice in land combat instead. If beamdog's programmers cant even get a simple dice roller right then maybe they should make a patch so that the computer can never roll dice.

This is the game that A&A fans want, and while it's still in Early Access, it has touched on multiple areas of importance and has so far been receptive to the criticisms and desires of the community.

This is a great default map to use for players, it's not as condensed as the 1941 version but also isn't like the large version that can feel drawn out and monotonous when you aren't playing with a group of friends in person. Also, I appreciate that there are two versions already available for playing with different troop layouts. While it's certainly weighted in the Axis favor, an experienced player (not me) can figure out an Allies strategy or two after some experience. Playing online in a 5 person match can be a blast when you can communicate with your allies over strategy. However, I wish that in non-ranked matches, there was some sort of chat you could use for everyone in the game, to perhaps talk over strategy with friends during a match. 

Mechanically the game works really well, at this point in time very few glitches and bugs, and ultimately only minor ones that can be easily remedied. I'm not sure how defending submarines submerge when I'm attacking them sometimes, but otherwise I have no complaints.

I took a fast look at the early  access of the continuing creation of A&A in what they did well and what they need to do to improve this large undertaking:
PROS
Presentation: Well first impressions matter and it's all there. The look, feel, sounds, graphics from the large board map that you used to take out of the box down to the zoom in and out miniatures. Beamdog does a nice translation in the overall feel and look of the famous board game.
Game play: I enjoyed the voiced tutorial that allowed for easy game functions that the versions made for good solid turns, movements and easy planning of your turns. Nice music and easy functions for all ages. Skirmish or fast play,  and multiple player set ups are nicely done. Good start
Controls: Though some confusion on transports, it does not over complicate the movements. The combined multiple arrow movements, highlighting of movement areas and special effect displays are  a nice touch. 
Price: People have short memories if they do not remember that the board game and older versions are a handy forty to a hundred dollars. You get it all for one low price on your PC. Not bad.
Passion: Clearly they care and will work with the community to give the best version of the game and its still early access. I am sure by the time its in full release. You won't be disappointed. Caring developer who adapt is a good thing. 
PvP: Is a huge appeal to A&A and offering their own unique multiple game play may enhance the experience of A&A instead of standard skirmish modes and long turn play. 
CONS
Visuals: I understand your coping the board game, but the first thing I noticed that was kind of a let down was why not present it with superb graphic terrains, oceans, and superb ship models that rival World of Warships. You could have up'ed the graphical representation given your own stamp on the visuals of the game and still maintained that board game feel to it. Slight con for me.
Camera: Though it may change, I would like to see the camera follow the AI's turn better instead of fixated on the current player.  for example if your Japan, and its Germany's turn the camera should automatically go to Germany , Russia or the US, so you can counter their movements. Though you can move the mouse to those locations. you should not have to. 
Handicapped: Game should have adjustment controls for sharp colors for the color blind and better camera movements for the eye impaired. 
Sounds: The sound effects of clicking movements can get annoying, in between turns, especially in long AI turns. 
Persona: It lacked a player's involvement to the game. An avatar of the player would have made them feel part of history instead of a generic spectator. Slight Con
AI: They will continue to improve on the AI, but some coding, bugs and puzzling AI moves that they will need to clean up. 

Early Thoughts: If you love Axis and Allies, well you get it plain and clear in Beamdog's new version and there is a learning curve to the game that is not too difficult for all ages. Beamdog doesn't give you a premium presentation of altering the vision of today's naval superb translations like World of Warships, Atlantic Fleet or Cold War in A&A, but it translates A&A beautifully as a simple board game and I am sure they are not quite done. As leader of the group Turn Based Genre, A&A is a wonderful adaption and will get stronger with time. See the VIDEO above discussion to see if this classic board game is for you before buying. Axis and Allies is good clean fun for all ages and a fun board game for the price. My initial score 3.0 out of 5

The biggest drawbacks for me are the visual fidelity, music, and the dice rolling animation.  The physical board (along with expansions) and pieces has greater detail than this digital product which bothers me.  The digital map is seems barren and muted by comparison.  The looped music is a missed opportunity to add more national immersion for each player.  The dice rolling animation seems more like a slot machine.  I think recording actual dice being thrown would be an easy audio fix.  As a work in progress the UI is clunky, but I am sure Beamdog will make it slicker given time.  As it stands this game does not approach the level of a digital replacement for axis & allies.  It clearly needs a visual/audio overhaul. Also, it appears there is no way to communicate with other players short of  posting a sticky.

 The patches have helped a ton on the computer turns, but the insanely slow and antiquated interface on your turn is still stuck in the 90s and is hard to believe it is a newly designed game (all be it from an old game, ha ha).  I really want to love this, I really do... but just can't.  I thought they would fix all of this, but they seem stuck on their very poor gameplay model.  Sad.  I just say pass on this.  They have my money, but no need to give them yours!


Initial review - The first thing that comes to mind... crash, crash, crash.  I am playing the full version on a Mac and I can say that on the first night, it has crashed three times and locked up my computer twice.  Additionally, the interface is easy to understand, but works like it is from the 1990s.  A nostalgic game doesn't need an old style interface.  You can't drag and drop anything, can grab the map and move it, and everything just takes for ever in the game play.  I love this game in person, and am sad that the computer version isn't better given modern gaming.  I would wait about 6 months or a year, then purchase after they get the massive amount of bugs out of the system.  Sorry A&A, that would be a defeat in this combat... sad.

First:  This game is certainly worth investing in.  A&A is a classic war game, and is a lot of fun.
1.  Having an online mode is a great thing.
2.  the map with its constant scroll is very good.  zoom and pan works well.
3.  Game is stable.  I haven't had any crashes or freezes during play.
4.  If you want 3D graphics and are complaining that the graphics aren't up to some standard, this is a board game.

The critiques, and I hope these are to be addressed in the updates:
1.  Version variability will be a great addition to this game.  The 1984 map, the classic one, is a MUCH different game, strategy wise from this one.  It will encourage replayability to have some of the variations available, without altering the game engine much.  TripleA has done this for years, free and open source, and it should be easy to implement it when you are collecting money.
2.  Industrial development needs to be returned, whatever version you make available.
3.  Transports and Aircraft Carriers are just bonkers.  There needs to be a more intuitive method of loading onto transports than click transport->click on INF->click on territory to invade.  On the same note:  naval bombardment can be easily neglected unless you remember to click on the cruiser and use it to ""invade"" the land.  There should be a more intuitive way to do this as well.
4.  For Online play, you should be able to start a game, send an invitation, and then be able to log out while your friend logs on at some later time.  Your invitation should remain, maybe for 24 hours, before it is erased.  I'm not sure why this method of a persistent invitation was not implemented, and both players have to be in the lobby before the game will start, but if the person who created the game leaves, the invitation goes away.

These fixes are more or less superficial, but would be great improvements.  I look forward to more updates.",1575215476,1575215476,True,1,0,0.516198694705963135,1,True,False,True
898920,58819121,76561198045394907,134,9,1553,0,766,1644821750,"Its very obviously early access, there are tons of features that still need to be added. Still recommended because it is a fun game even if it still needs work and the devs do seem to be working on improving it and adding features.

Features that need to be added:
1) LET THE DEFENDER ASSIGN THEIR OWN HITS
     - This is a massive flaw and I have no idea why the whole ""defense profile"" (in which you automatically assign hits in a hierarchical fashion whenever you're on defense) is even in the game. Especially with how buggy the ""follow player"" button can be with combat it is quite often that I don't even know if I'm losing battles because I can't see the play-by-play. This especially sucks as sometimes you may want to assign your hits in a different order than what your profile would allow in a specific situation such as needing a destroyer over a cruiser when defending a fighter-containing carrier from submarines; or choosing if you want a fighter vs a bomber to be killed first depending on how the fight is going. The only advantage that I can see for this way of assigning hits is that it allows combat to progress with only the attacking player in the game, but I would at least like to get an option to allow me to assign my own hits.

2) RESEARCH
    - This was a HUGE part of all the versions of A&A that I used to play, and a single research could change the way you played the game entirely, and research being completely gone from the game just makes it feel like it isn't even Axis and Allies. Seriously no research makes the game really bland and quite often really predictable.

3) Better AI
    - Luckily this game DOES have multiplayer, and it also supports hot-seat play, so playing against AI isn't your only option, but it still needs so much work. Germany AI doesn't know how to defend its capital, USA AI doesn't know how to use transports, Japanese AI doesn't know how to build planes or maintain its navy AT ALL, Russian AI just doesn't know how to play the game at all, UK AI just stacks infantry on Britain and India and does NOTHING with them. Seriously the AI is a joke and a player with 4 brain cells could still beat it in 4 rounds easily.

4) The ability to change which version you're playing/Adding special rules
    - Axis and Allies has had many different versions, with different maps and different rules, over the course of its life. For the longest time I only knew the original version of the game, then after I lost that one to a fire I got the 1942 Avalon Hill version with Italy and special rules on China, now this version is entirely different. I understand that this is supposed to be a specific 1942 version or whatever, but it couldn't be that hard to add the ability for the user to choose which version they wish to play, or to just allow the player to change some of the rules (like in the original version playing with Germany and Japan starting with research and Russia being unable to attack on first move). They ARE starting to work on this and there is already a slightly altered start that the player may choose to play, I just hope that the developers are able to add MORE into this game such as victory conditions other than victory-cities. 

5) Bugs
    - This is an early access game but that doesn't mean that bugs are any less annoying, and I've had MANY game crashes, thankfully the devs do seem to take note and the bugs are getting ironed out.



Conclusion: It is still in early access, and the devs are working on it. It needs features for sure but it certainly is still an Axis and Allies game and it is fun. It's much less time consuming to play than the physical board game and for 20 dollars it's even cheaper than a physical board game.",1575158745,1575158745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

If you're a fan of any of the earlier versions of this title, you will likely not enjoy this game. It plays nothing like A&A. The beauty of those games was that all the information you need to play was easily visible and accessible on the map. In this adaptation, you must go through multiple clicks in different places to see and evaluate movements/units/and info. In an apparent effort to cater to console controllers and ""other 4x games"" they've rendered the game overly cluttered, clunky, and counter-intuitive.


And don't be fooled by the images on the current store page. As of this date, they don't remotely resemble what the game actually looks like.


It's EA, so I won't fault them for crashes and bugs, that's only to be expected. But the design of the gameplay? That's another matter.


Since Update 5, the devs inexplicably changed the UI to... well... a complete mess. And while I will give the devs/community managers credit for being active and engaged with the forums, they are clearly committed to this (wrong-headed) path. I'd love to be wrong about that. But you don't have to read too deeply into their comments to see that while they offer the usual platitudes about ""listening to your feedback"" and ""wanting the best for the game community"", they aren't interested in making any substantive changes.


Any time anyone mentions the current (post-update 5) UI design making it harder to see what's going on on the map, the devs invariably say ""it's easy, here's a link to a 12 step instruction set on where to click to see your units!"" But not on the map.
If someone says it's harder and less intuitive to move units, they say ""we tested it in house and this is the way other games do it, so we think once you get used to it, you'll like it better."" Well, I don't. It's not better, it's way way worse.


The single player options are pretty much for show only and offer no choice of victory conditions. As the Axis, just take two Victory Cities (Karelia and Honolulu are easy) and the games ends immediately. And I mean, immediately. No warm glow of satisfaction, no option to play on anyway, just a quick end game title screen. You're done, mate. Next!


You'll see a lot of reviews and forum posts referencing the old Hasbro Interactive version being better and easier to use. Because it's true. You didn't need instruction sets on how to see what was taking place on the map, because all the info you needed was displayed visually ON THE MAP. And moving units was a simple LMB to select a unit, LMB on a location to move it. Simple, elegant, easy. The complete opposite of this game in it's current state.


I say ""in it's current state"" because I love this title so much I genuinely hope the devs come to their senses. If the game ever gets back on the proper path, I will amend this review. But for now: Give this one a pass.",1574816140,1575093440,False,43,0,0.729471027851104736,3,True,False,True

What is this game like?: this game is still in EA so there are some simple issues one i had was the game skipped my deployment phase and i lost all my money also the AI can be very smart or very dumb randomly which can be fun except when they're so clear that it only an AI would make a poor choice but the game has ran very smooth a couple of fix up on the UI when it comes to placing troops into enemy states would be very helpful.

Multiplayer: now i couldn't find a standed game but the ranked is ok i quit because i dont like the idea of me controlling the entire allies or axis side and it would be cool if you could do a team ranked but the servers ran perfectly fine for me (im Australian)

idea's: making this game on tablet and nintendo switch would be amazing as i would love to play this on the go especially if i had some friends around and for a small DLC idea you could add axis & allies & zombies as it is compatable with the 1942 edition and doesnt need a crazy amount of features to be added into the game.

in conclusion: this game is worth the buy but it depends on if youre a fan of A&A if you havent played the board game but are interested this does have a tutorial and is cheaper then the board game but this game really shines with friends so i would highly recommend this game for old fans and new fans especially its very new player friendly and even if youre interested $30 AUD isnt alot and will save you about $90 AUD picking it up from a game store

When playing against the AI, you can't get a grasp of what's happening on the map. It's hard to tell what units the enemy is purchasing at the beginning of the turn. It's hard to tell which units they're using in their attack. For instance, when moving various units into a combat zone, only a number reflecting the total number units is displayed in the zone. It does not tell you how many of each unit is in the combat zone. If 8 units are moving in for the attack, you have no idea which 8 units. Is it 7 infantry and 1 tank? Or is it 7 tank and 1 infantry? You can't get this info until you click. You should be able to see the info you need all from the map. You shouldn't have to do all this digging around. 2.) The 1998 PC version of axis and allies was drag and drop. You could click a unit and drag it to the territory you wished. Now it's click this and click that. It's very tedious.

Except  --> when your opponent is attacking, casualties are automatically taken according to the lowest value units first.

Here you have the first real Axis and Allies online version of the real Boardgame since Gametable online went offline!

I like this Version of A & A, also the last A & A edition I played was Spring 1942. This is a later edition. So keep in mind there are several editions of A&A 1942!

To the game:

So the mechanics work smooth in single Player so far. No major Bugs or big lags.
Multiplayergame still nieeds improvement. Since I reviewed  for the last time, the game has improved much, but still missing some options.
Since the last Updae (Patch 5), there are several new functions to smooth up the ease of use, like better recognition of moving paths of your units and a ladder, in which turns can take a max of 24h (still to long). A 2 vs 2 or 5 player Ladder is still missing.  
One thing thats really still missing, a multiplayer chat. So you can better talk tactics with unknown players. There is a kind of flag system but it didnt draw my attantion when my teammate tried to get my attention. 
ANother thing whats for my opinion is missing is a turn-timer. People how played A&A on gametable online will know what i mean. A timer for each phase would be really nice and would make an e-mail notificationsystem obsulete. Because Turns would have a limited time. 
I dont want to hype Gametable online here. But the experience of the makers of Gametable online had years to run a smoth A&A platform.
Last but not least one importend thing was added. The Larry Harrison gamesetup! I love this version!

Overall its a pretty good A & A engine that hopefully will be great!

Thumbs up! for everyone who misses GTO and searches for a new way to play  A&A online!",1564856292,1573981694,True,11,1,0.583085417747497559,0,True,False,True

The online concept is great since it takes all the set up and combat times and some of the rules and automates it to bring a potentially 8 + hour game down to 3-4 hours.  I remember playing with friends til the wee hours and then getting yelled at to go to sleep by parents.  The 1942 game has a different map from the original game (it divides the map into more territories so it is harder to access Karelia or use it as a hub of attack for example).  There are artillery pieces that enhance infantry attack and 2 other unique naval units.  AAA guns are now for battles only and Industrial complexes seem to come with their own AAA guns.  Other rule changes as well.  Since I played the beta version this may be obsolete.  Even with some of the glitches, this is a great value for $20.  Some improvements could be made so that we can clearly see naval units at the southern end of the map (under Australia for example), I understand now the need if you are going to play against a player over a period of days to have a prioritized and customizable troop removal during combat but I still don't like it.  I would suggest during online play that if both players are playing in real-time that they have the option of removing units manually.  Other than that it is still a fun game.

Most of the negative reviews are due to the bugs in the game and that's expected in an early access game.  Worth $20?  Maybe not unless you are like me and wish to support the developers to reach a clean official release of the game.

In regards to the bugs, there is an extremely easy 'reload' feature that the developers have implemented that makes the fixes of any bugs that occur a small thing.  Also, the games are saved on the server so you can even restart the game if necessary and join your existing one exactly where you left off.  As for developing workarounds as they QA the game this is a major win.

One particular critique that I have is the battle and dice roll feature.  I don't like the auto-placement of defensive hits when I'm on the defensive.  I think the default defensive profile should be applied to all computer players, but the usage of it for defense as a human player should be optional.  There are times that I would prefer to keep my land unit over my fighter in certain situations and I'm unable to do so as I normally would due to the automation of defensive hit markers.

Other than that, the generic streamlining and smoothing out of the follow, interactions, camera, phase statistics, etc. are all being worked on 'I suspect' so there's not really too much to comment on other than the defensive automation I mentioned before.  If that one thing gets fixed then it's a true 'early access' release of the board game in all of its glory.",1571615402,1571615402,True,0,0,0.498338848352432251,0,True,False,True

1) Axis and Allies is amazing... this videogame mostly.
2) The game is correctly traposed to online version
3) You can save the match
4) playing against AI is fun, for a while

Cons:
1) DEsign choice to support non synchronous hgames: 
you can't choose which unit to remove in combat, but you have to use an automatic strategy (with the limit to loose some control over battle)
2) Dice are rolled only by the attacker, even in party with friends
3) The most annoying and biggest problem is the combat screen: Even setting to follow dice rolling, you don't get them most of the time. The dice roll log updates randomlly and sometime did not update at all. This makes followujng a battle from the defender point of view pratically useless.
4) When you follow player moves, the map jumps form side to side for each move even on the same territory.
5) Crashes (but the games reloads in an instant and in single player it restores at the exact same point so, pratically just few seconds lost, not a big deal)

Axis and Allies is a big fun and this game allows me to play with friends so I was glad to pay the price (also reasonable around 15€), but I sincerily hope the devs will fix the combat screen and introduce a real time online mode where players  can have a better interaction during battles.",1571527887,1571528169,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

  1) During other players/AI turns everything goes so fast its hard to tell what is happening (and you dont get to see the die rolls)  There is a turn log you can dig though if you need more info.
  2) If you are new to the axis and allies board games, I dont think the tutorial does nearly enough to get you up to speed,  It skips some of the more complicated things that can come up.
  3) There is some minor input lag, but seeing at it is a turn based game this is fine.
  4) I would also like to see more variations (1941 setups, Total victory Option, some Optional rules that could be turned on to spice it up)

But it is early access so I expect alot of these issues to be solved by release and look forward to any new content they add.",1570217665,1570217665,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

We are both avid A&A players from way back and the game went 9 rounds, one of the best we've played. This review address only the online version with a friend. Cannot speak for AI.

Fantastic implementation of the base game - extremely well done. Very nice graphics and UI very intuitive. I understand this game is EA and there are several issues with the multiplayer that need to be addressed

1) As far as I can tell, there is a 24 HR time time limit for all turns, meaning that if Germany does not take it's turn within 24 hrs, it's on to Britain. There needs to at least be an option for changing time limits, including no time limit. We are both busy and may need more that a day to finish a turn.

2) When playing real-time with him, I could not see the battles as they occurred. This is essentially a deal breaker for simultaneous play. We both need to see the dice as they roll real-time so that we can complain to each other on Skype, and as a defensive player I need the ability to pick which units I lose. It's fine to have the customisable algorithm for defender losses if the defending player if offline, and it worked well. But if online, I need the ability to watch the battle and pick my losses.

3) My bombers were sent through the shortest path to a target, even if the shortest path had 1+ AA guns along the way. I have not played this exact version of the game and assume AA guns fire when flying over, not just at the final destination. But if this is the case, player should have a choice as to which route to take.

4) My friend ends the game while I'm offline. I log on, and there is no record of the week-long game we just played. Would like to see a game summary, my online record, my record against him, etc.

That's all I can think of right now, but there may have been another. Will update as these issues are addressed and others come up. Great job, great game!",1569204359,1569204985,True,1,0,0,2,True,False,True

The developers did a good job moving the game from early access to release and I'm confident they will continue to develop the AI and work on what few bugs are hiding in the corners.

Gameplay is consistent with the original board game (documentation makes clear the differences), and has much the same feel as playing on a tabletop.  If you're familiar with the board game, I think you'll enjoy this product.  If you've never played Axis and Allies before, the tutorials do a good job overall of introducing you to the game.  (NOTE:  I had some issues with crashes going through the tutorial, but the devs have said they've solved this since I started playing.)

One piece I particularly appreciate is the fact that combat moves MUCH faster that the tabletop version, especially when there are lots of different kinds of units.  Ditto movement around the board.  I agree with other viewers that an option to participate in defensive combat would be a nice addition, but I recognize that it speeds the game along and that matters more to me most of the time.  I hope they continue to develop the defense profiles.

Another thing I like about this game is that it provides for asynchronous gameplay.  I'm not in college any longer and don't have entire weekends to devote to a game like this.  I love being able to play with/against friends who don't live nearby ON OUR SCHEDULES.  

It took me a little bit to figure out how to resolve transport movement (especially when it involved loading units) and the aircraft/carrier dynamic felt weird at first because it's not obvious when the planes are connected to a carrier.  Using the game with a mouse (not a touchpad) felt much more smooth--especially with a wheel on the mouse to zoom in/out quickly.  I have found playing every side in the game winnable (albeit with very different strategies) except Russia.  Save playing that army for when you're experienced, I guess.

The devs have said they're going to work to improve the AI, and that's good.  I get that coding AI for this kind of game is a challenge, but the deeper it is the better this game will be in single-player mode.  It's not awful, but it feels like it's too defensive right now and that buys me time to do things I know I shouldn't be able to do as a player like not fortify positions as strongly as I should so I can throw everything at an attack without fear of reprisal. 

I would LOVE to see a 'total victory' option in this game (other reviews have suggested it, and it was something we used to enjoy as part of tabletop play years ago).  I would also love to see ever more initial setup scenarios (there are two, but it would be cool to see options for, say, 1939).

I'm enjoying the game and I'm excited to see Beamdog continue to improve it!

A lot of guys over a certain age, like me, want ""a game, with a real person"", without the noisy game club, or, the obligation of setting aside 3-4 hours for an online game (on an evening or a weekend).

Asynchronous Game Play is the special nuance and beauty of this game. What many people have described as this game's biggest flaw, the Defender Losses Profile, is actually its biggest asset. Because without this implementation, a game of Axis & Allies would take much, much longer (in a play-by-email game, the need to stop for Defender Losses might stretch out a player's turn for weeks).

I've just tried the one game, as Germany, with the A.I. And while I don't know for certain how strong the A.I. is, at this point, it is certainly a (VERY) good introductory opponent for new players (or those just getting back into it).

It is NOT a good ""real time, online"" game, as, you have to click and move each unit individually. And be warned: there are new and or changed rules which are VERY different from the original (1980's) release. But if you are a play-by-email gamer, this is EXACTLY what you've been looking for. The program rolls the dice for you, and it is impossible to replay a turn over and over again until you're satisfied with your results. And if you accidentally break a rule, the computer will catch you doing it, and disallow it in the first place.

The gaming community has needed more asynchronous programming for a long, long time! :)

1. More feedback is required for industrial bombing. Because the screen is so zoomed in I miss a lot of things that I would normally not miss if I was playing  the tabletop version of the game. I have lost count how many times I forgot to conduct an air raid on Germany with Britain . I would recommend zooming  the map out to show more of the map on a default look. I would also recommend more feedback to inform the player. Air Raids AKA industrial bombings are crucial to any game of axis and allies if you can not limit your opponent's ability to purchase new units it puts you at a significant disadvantage. I believe that feedback warning the player . When he has bombers on the field.  that the player has not executed a air raid also known as an industrial bombing before he moves to the next phase.
2. Allow the player to return to the previous turn if no action has been committed. There's been a few times where I purchased wrong item in the production phase. I know that there is a screen that pops up to tell you what you buy. But I would also recommend that you allow the player to return to the previous turn if he has not completed in action in the current turn.
The hitboxes for all units seem to be a little off. It can be difficult to click on the unit that you are attempting to use it seems like you have to frame perfect on where you push the mouse button.
3. Allow extra modes of play against computers. I noticed in Hot Seat commode you're allowed to play either the standard version were you take a certain amount of cities. Or the Total Victory where you have to knock out every faction. Although the Total Victory makes the game longer . I prefer that version of play because it allows for more room for error. And a chance for the player to pull a victory out of the jaws of defeat and perform last-ditch efforts to win since the game does not end until all factions on the opposing side have been eliminated.

4. Allow the player to conduct research on better units. I know in future versions of axis and allies they removed the ability to research advanced technology for example jet fighters. I would recommend adding a new version perhaps calling it classic Mode for the game introduces old rules from previous versions that are no longer used for example the ability to research new technology that mechanic greatly increase meaningful choice and added an additional element and make a gamemore enjoyable.




5.  The AI needs Improvement I have read some of the documentation on the bug fixes with the AI in its current state the allies artificial intelligence is too easy and the axis artificial intelligence is too difficult in my opinion. If possible in future versions I would recommend having mixed difficulties allowing the player to pick the level of difficulty when facing in an enemy artificial intelligence.

UPDATE!!!
With the second patch coming out with a different way to start the game, plus bug fixes, I would have to say that this game is becoming more and more well polished!! So far after a handful of games, my only complaint is that the AI when you play against the Axis becomes very one-tracked on trying to destroy Russia even at the cost of losing Germany's capital. I had troops building up in France, but the AI ignored them and placed no one in Berlin, instead opting to attack Moscow and not placing troops in Berlin during the mobilization turn.

It is enjoyable to play and takes me back to the mid-Eighties playing for hours on end with friends in our basement. I do, however, have a few issues with the game. First off, I have only played solo so far with the computer playing the other countries. I have noticed that Great Britain doesn't utilize its power in India. Yes, they try and reinforce USSR with aircraft but they never move infantry or place tanks in India to really help with all of the IPCs that the USSR starts to lose when Japan rolls roughshod all over Asia. The AI just doesn't allow for it. This is very apparent when the Caucasus fall to Germany. The AI just doesn't sense the danger. 

Another thing I noticed is that the USA doesn't reinforce its beachhead in France once taken. I have seen multiple transports move back and forth between sea spaces over multiple rounds in the North Atlantic without picking up fresh troops either in Eastern USA or Eastern Canada, all the while Germany is given time to reinforce and build its navy having already taken out the USSR. 

The weakest country, despite having the resources, is Great Britain by far. They don't even attempt to take back the Suez Canal or get their IPCs back if Germany (when I play them) takes all of the their countries in Africa. They do try a few naval things in the Pacific but Japan is just too strong for them. Speaking of Japan, I have used the Aleutian (Alaska) attack just like the Japanese did for real in WWII. In my case though it is successful. Japan takes Alaska the first round and has plenty of time to build an industrial complex for troop and naval placement and the USA never even tries to take it back. I was able to start placing tanks there and then blitz into Western USA with the AI just waiting for an attack vs. driving me off of the continent. Last thing, I think it would enhance the game if one could play either all of the Axis powers against the computer or all of the Allies against the computer. I am not a coder or a game designer so I do not know all of the details regarding AI, but if this could be pulled off, and be given as an option, I think all of your gamers would appreciate the choice. 

The point is, the AI could be better when playing solo. I cannot speak on the multiplayer aspects of the game. I will try this next. Please do not take this as a slight, just an observation. I really enjoy the game.",1566616058,1566617311,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have many editions of the Axis & Allies line and even the Axis & Allies: Iron Blitz pc game from Microprose.  
For someone like myself, I do not recommend that A & A fans pick up this game in it's current state.  Since it's still an early access game I hope that some of the recommendations I propose get addressed when the product is fully released, and if Beamdog makes those changes I'll gladly change this recommendation.
For someone who may be new to the franchise I think that they provides a modern take on the newer A & A editions and rules set.  Beamdog did a good job translating the board game into a digital equivalent.  Here are a few things I really liked about this game: scrolling out and still providing unit composition, numbers and detail was really great work.  This was something that even Iron Blitz never did.  I like the popup unit details that come up on the left the screen as well as how intuitive transports work (once you get used to the UI).
Here are some of the things that I really feel need to be addressed; not just from a purist A&A fan, but in order to help make this title successful into the future:
1. Please update defensive battles to allow users to participate.  I know there is a method to update the default settings, but there is really is nothing worse than being a spectator in your own game.
2. I've beaten the game 3 times against the AI, and know that there is not too much more I can do with it.  The current AI model is not too sophisticated and at a certain point becomes too defensive to the detriment of it's own survival.  The ability to make the game harder would add a lot to being replayable.
3. I hope it is in Beamdog's overall game plan to enhance the current state of the game.  What you have in this is truly a remake of the 1942 A&A new edition board game, but they have the opportunity for so much more.  One of the best parts of the old Iron Blitz digital A&A was multiple scenarios that you could play the game in; try playing in 1939, try 1940 instead, fight in 1942 but the US never joined the war.
4. I know the newer editions dropped the tech tree in A&A but it would be nice to make that optional as well as some of the other Iron Blitz options that were available; scorched earth, paratroopers.  Heck, there are several home brew tree options that could be added as well.   Naturally, game balance testing would be needed.
5. it would be great to see some type of unlock or achievement system in the game.  I keep thinking of the old Risk Playstation 2 unlocks.  I know that is not A&A style but wouldn't it be nice to achieve a particular objective and have some kind of dice skin, new map screen that can be used after the unlock.  Again, this speaks to that desire I have of getting some replay hours back into the game.

Overall, I hope this review helps others.   Thanks!",1566364317,1566364317,False,23,0,0.636756837368011475,2,True,False,True

So far I'm partially in love: I love that its finally here but I need to see some improvements for it to be love and not a fling. Therefore right now I don't see myself playing this very often as it is not challenging enough. Don't be afraid to enable a beast mode against us which we can't beat, that's why we love to play this game for hours on end. It's supposed to be a hard fought game!!

1. I'd love the AI to be much tougher. The AI is too easy to beat. I've tried many configurations of army control but always the AI lets itself down by not being able to manage 2+ fronts of battle at the same time.

2. I'd love an option to disable all the in-battle/post-battle confirmation screens which summarise what just happened. Fine to show it but don't make me click yet again to dismiss it. Remove all the extra clicks when I'm doing in battle and between battles. It makes fighting tedious which is definitely not the aim!

3. I'd love to have only 1 set of the 5 flags (displayed on the top right and on the lower bottom left) to avoid confusing whose turn it is. I'm sometimes looking at the wrong one when I click to end a phase only to realise that I've made a mistake and need to reverse the click. Doh.

4. I'd love to roll my own dice in defence. Or at least make it an option for players to choose to see or not to see their own defences.

5. I'd love to see the Europe only and the Pacific only flavours added to give some map variety. I guess that's coming down the road.

6. I'd love an option to see the potential battle board for a territory I'm trying to attack. When there are alot of units it can be hard to see what I've sent in vs what the defender has in that zone. The level of zoom isn't enough to give full clarity.

7. I'd love an option to stop the auto-zoom into territories and let me decide to only do it manually. It's necessary to maintain an overall view of the game board and the auto-zoom just forces me to take action to zoom back out all the time. I'll zoom in when I need to. Nothing wrong with all of the lovely battle pieces, they look great!! I just need to maintain perspective.

Fix my needs and I'm yours forever!

Great Classic Game!  I couldn't think of a better better strategy game to the digital collection.  Sadly, as of 08/19/2019, this title by Beamdog is very buggy and prone to crash!  If you play single player, it crashes and goofs less.  However, if you have the same luck as any of our circle of friends who attempt to play it together, you're in for a real struggle.  Half of the time, we can't get the hosting service to properly display the servers, or allow us to invite from a private match.  The other half of the time we get into a match, someone's client gets stuck and they either have to Alt+F4 to escape and reboot the game, or they have to wait several minutes for the server to catch up on the game's side.

We all have mid-high performance PC rigs... The problems are NOT on our end.  

All in all it is a very fun and brain-heavy strategy game with risk, reward, and grit.  However, as of August 2019, it is rife with bugs that sometimes so bad online that we sometimes have to shelf our Axis & Allies plans for another game instead.

Beamdog, we like what you've done, but please - make it playable 100% of the time.  Anything less is a bust.  Consider letting us make client based, private host matches so we don't have to go through a 3rd party that crashes.

Also, please bring back super weapon investments.

I tried playing the russians. It's impossible. Germany invades Karelia every single time with no difficulty and you don't have the resources to fight back.

First off, I only play the game vs the computer. I'm also a big fan of the original board game as well as the 1999 PC version of the game. I mention this because this game made some changes to where it is a different game the original versions. 

They added in additional units which I do feel to be a plus. They also added additional zones to the game which opens up additional strategies and was something I had wished for in the original game. But they changed the winning criteria. Instead of capturing 2 enemy capitals, IPC victory and total victory modes they only left a mode where you have to capture a certain number of cities which are spread around the map. This seems like a step backwards and is one of the things I don't like about this version. Also gone are the technology upgrades which I saw turn the game around many times in the original versions. 

Overall, this is a solid stand alone game. If you like turn based strategy games this is worth playing. If you're looking for an updated version of the original game, this is pretty close but it is a different game.",1565998381,1565998381,True,1,0,0.519230782985687256,0,True,False,True

I am enjoying the experience and think Beamdog did a great job.  There are glitches, as there will also be, but the benefits by far outweigh the bugs. 

There were a few feature I liked on previous versions and would like to know if there is an intention to include them moving forward:

- Ability to save and replay games
- Ability to edit units on new and/or saved games
- Ability to move a 'stack' of units instead of 1 at a time.  There was one version that would select an entire stack of units if 
  you did a Ctl+click.  This can save a lot of time moving units.

(and that is not a comment on my weight) In 1984 this board game ignited my love of games. I fell in love with A&A at first sight. I went home and did chores as a kid  to earn the $48 I needed to buy the original version of this game. I have since purchased many versions of A&A, but not the 1942 version. I have probably played some version or another of Axis and Allies 100 times or more, including the earlier video game adaptation.

I was concerned when I read the mixed Early Access reviews on Steam of the game, but I decided to give Beamdog my $20 and give it a try.

My verdict: I am pleased. I feel that I have definitely gotten my money's worth out of this game and it is still in Early Access.

At this writing I have played 2 games against the AI. Once as the Axis and once as the Allies. The AI is a mixed bag. Sometimes it will surprise you with a move that you did not anticipate. Other times it will make a move that will leave you scratching your head in bewilderment.

I have not yet tried multiplayer, but I imagine that is where the real fun lies.

The game crashed once during the tutorial, but when I reloaded, it picked up close to where I had left off.

The music is okay. It could be better. I wish for more varied cut-scenes, different songs from the era and more and varied sound effects to reflect the combat. It'd be a nice touch to customize your dice, like Pathfinder Card PC game.  All for these comments are nitpicking, I admit. The AI needs to be beefed up or, at least, allow for different difficultly settings.

Some reviewers  have commented that they were unhappy about the fact that you could not choose your own casualties from combat losses when defending. I had thought that this would bother me, but in playing, I found that it did not really concern me at all. Rather, the game is much sped up by making these choices for you.

Perhaps this is sour grapes, but I felt like the AI seemed to hit more often than statistically should be the case. Does the AI ""cheat"" to compensate? I cannot state that for a fact. I wish that I could lift the hood and peek at the engine and tell if the game was fudging the dice rolls at all. 

Regardless, if you like Axis and Allies or a lighter WWII war game experience that you can start and finish in a few hours, I recommend this game. I certainly hope that the developers keep polishing it. It could be a real gem.",1565921476,1565921476,True,15,0,0.64734649658203125,0,True,False,True

Since A&A is a ""soul crushingly"" long game in board game form Steam does not disappoint, this online version is impressively, brutally long as well.  Yes the first launch of early access was painful but that is to be expected, kudos to Steam for letting A&A hobbyists get an early glimpse. I have only played two full games so far both of them, single player against AI.  First game I played AXIS 4ish hours, second game I played Allies 7ish hours.  Much of that because I am still learning the nuances of 1942 second edition as I am an original aficionado on both Board and 1998 PC format. 
Here my likes and loathes of this game. 
Likes - 1. Art and graphics are well done.  2. AI is clever enough to keep me playing for 7 hours, could always get smarter but that's why we can play online if you want real competition.    3. It conforms to the 1942 second edition rules.  I see some comments about self selecting casualties.  Well, it does allow it that but it conforms to the rules of the edition which has strict rules around what can be claimed as casualties in specific order specifically around transports and subs.  4. The War Report is super helpful.
Loathes - 1. My BIGGEST complaint is that transitions to the next nation is BAD.  Its SUPER easy to mistakenly skip the purchase phase and no way to reverse.  I skipped Russia's purchases three times because it appeared that the US turn was not yet completed.  I was intentionally careful and still screwed that up.  Need a fail safe for that.   2. Map navigation is brutal.  I am playing on a MAC,  no snicker please from you PC peeps out there :-<.  Zoom is OK, and I use Arrows for up down left right but is basically sucks but I am dealing with it.  3. Loading and Unloading transports takes some time to get used to.  Maybe the process could be a little cleaner in future revisions.  4.  I wish I could control the pathway of aircraft flights.  It seems that the games selects the pathway even when I have two legitimate flyover options.  Same challenge with blitzing tank paths.  5.  Game Crashes - over a 7 hour game play I encountered 3 or 4 game crashed but the recovery is pretty quick and seamlessly recovers to the correct point that it crashed at. 
  
Other than that, very impressed.  I look forward to feeling confident enough to try my hand at online.

This isn't Axis & Allies. It's like a shareware clone from the late nineties! You really gotta fix some stuff while this is in early access! I promise I'll change my review if you change this game. Deal? Deal.

This is just too weird. I love Axis & Allies. The board games, the old PC game, I even still have the disc from the 1998 Hasbro version for Windows 95/98. Problem is, that version is still better than this. 

I'm utterly baffled by two particular things: 1) [strike]No research, whatsoever. Just poof, gone.[/strike] Ok so Beamdog kindly told me they are doing 2nd Edition 1942 which does not have research. I own this board game, plus 1st Edition and 1941, my bad, should have known. 2) Defenders cannot select casualties!? This is really not good for a game like this, where you might need to sacrifice a more expensive unit to salvage a future battle plan. Yes, I know you can technically design a custom ""Defense Profile"" in the options menu to change the way casualties are selected by the computer in your absence, but holy poop if the default isn't just ""lowest IPC unit dies first no matter what"". Goodbye, huge chunk of strategy! 

The price? ($19.99US) Meh... I'm close to whining about that, considering what the game looks like. I'm not in love with the map, [strike]I have a cloying feeling that some map lines have been redrawn (will have to bust out the board game and look)[/strike] I took out my board and looked. This map is pretty accurate, however: the map art and overall graphics are pretty lackluster.

The dice rolls are odd too, with the transparent dice that have the numbers fade in after they hit the table. How about just dice? Ok, I realize now I'm getting nitpicky, so I'll cut this short. I'm only on turn 2, playing as the Axis against the AI. It just... doesn't feel fluid, or even accurate... I don't know. This is going to need some work.

Edit: One of the devs, Julius Borisov was gracious enough to reach out and reply to my review, even to point out some mistakes in my own perception, and I have total respect for this. In fact, this is the first time a dev has ever responded to a review of mine. I'm actually super impressed. I still don't feel like this game is good yet, but I have a significant amount of hope. And as I've stated, I will totally change this review as the game evolves. Here's hoping for another Beamdog success.

Edit 2: So after finishing a game as Axis against AI Allies, the things that bugged me most were:

1) The ship scaling on the map. Sometimes subs look larger than battleships. They can even be different sizes on different tiles. Its hard to tell cruisers from destroyers for the various nations, and they're even tough to click on sometimes because of how narrow they are.

2) My kingdom for a ""drag box"" selection ability, instead of by unit type. 

3) The single player AI is not so bright. In my game, England put more effort into India than Europe, but never moved the units out of India. They also had a fighter sit in West Africa the entire game. It never moved or attacked after it got there. 

The US AI devoted nearly all its strength to the East Coast, built up a sizeable navy, large invasion force... except it scattered its transports across the north Atlantic in small groups... and never actually loaded troops on said transports. The entire game, the US sent a single infantry to North Africa and was quickly repelled. They never again embarked another unit despite having numerous transports. Their planes spent most of the game in Gibralter. 

Russia abandoned Karelia on turn one, leaving 1 infantry, and essentially handed Germany a free factory above Moscow. The Russian AI seemed most competent otherwise, probably because they just built infantry and waited to capitulate along an acceptable looking front line, rather than do the peculiar empty transport raids of the US, or the decision not to defend the homeland like the UK. 

To be fair, this game is called Axis & Allies 1942 Online, so I suspect the AI is not meant to be much of a challenge in lieu of human opponents.",1565341556,1565680934,False,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The feedback we give is important, but how is us giving it a bad review for not being our perfect image of a finished game helping. They are trying to give us a game that nobody has tried to do in over 20 years.

And this is a great first attempt. Honestly. If they keep expanding and making improvments then we can for sure see our beloved game transfered into the digital age. Cause I would really love to see this game expand and get better with time. Just as the first game did back in 1981. Let it grow and expand.

Pros:

Axis and Allies without the mess- instead of playing on a board where you have to worry about setting pieces up, figuring out which place your troops are in, and figuring out everyone's IPCs, playing it online allows you to not worry about it. It cuts down the length of the game by a lot.

Balance- It feels like this version of Axis and Allies is much more favorable to the Axis. The game that I have, Axis and Allies 1941, give the Allies a massive advantage in IPCs and does not give the Axis players much room for errors. Now the Axis has the ability to take a factory from the Allies in Leningrad or in India and position themselves for an early victory.

Units- All of the units that are in 1942 are in this. Gives the player plenty of options in regards to naval and land purchases. Depending if you are attacking, planning an amphibious invasion or defending, there are units that are specialized to help you.

Cons:

Performance- Game runs slow for me, and sometimes takes more than one click to move units. I have not even attempted to try online yet. Perhaps focus on gameplay more than graphics, since it's a complex board game. 

Personal Preference: 

Movement- I have a hard time figuring out which place my troops are in when attacking. Instead of just placing the units in the place where they are attacking, they are put on borders that make it difficult to see which place they are at. Whats worse, when attacking with units from multiple places you then have to add up all of these units to see if you are making a smart attack. I would recommend just putting units in the place they are attacking together and have some kind of drop down menu on the right that lists all my moves so I can undo them if I want to.

Excellent rendition of the A&A 1942 Second Edition to computer.  

Eventually, I'd love to see the all the other ""versions"" (1914, 1940 Eur, 1940 Pac, 1940 Global, D-Day, Guadalcanal, Battle of the Bulge.. etc) of this classic game come to life on the computer screen as well, either as DLC's or separate games... doesn't matter.. I'd buy them all.

The only downside to playing the board game was the lengthy set up and managing of the various aspects of the game.  But when a computer is handling all of that for you the game is nothing but great fun.

The computer game plays like the board game with some slight variations from the mid-80's version because the rules changed as the board game versions updated through the years.  I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of the board game, or World War II games, or just war strategy games in general.  The price is very reasonable when considering the hours of fun you will have playing it.

My two suggestions for the game are:

1 - As mentioned by other reviewers; let us see and take part in the defensive dice rolls when playing solo.  I understand why this can't be done in PVP due to all players potentially not being on at the same time, but against the computer it should be implemented.  The combat dice rolls are the most thrilling and intense part of the game.

2 - When playing solo the AI seems a little funky.  My assumption from my limited experience playing is that there is an RNG to determine the skill level of the various computer controlled countries.   There should be a way to adjust the skill level of your computer controlled allies and opponents.

I've been a long time Axis and Allies player, first with the original board game which I first started playing around the early 90's. Later, I played many of the variant board games, as well as the Axis and Allies and Iron Blitz computer games.

I hate to say this, but 20 years later, those games still have this one beat.

My review from here on relates only to the single player portion of this game, as I have not played the multiplayer online game, and am not that interested in it.

Pros:
- Sticks pretty closely to the rules of the game today
- Map is decent, and navigating it, controls, etc, are reasonable.
- Very few if any bugs that cause glitches moving units around, etc (vs. Iron Blitz where it was quite common that you could not land fighters on carriers for no reason and would lose them, etc).
- When bugs do arise and the game crashes, it has always reloaded automatically and quickly for me, and right back to the moment it crashed. This doesn't happen too often.

Cons:
- Game is painfully slow for what should be a really simple thing to implement. Why so much lag when moving units or even panning the map around? Doesn't make sense.
- Interface can be painful at times, especially when moving large amounts of troops. Why can you only move large stacks of troops one at a time? Why do you have to click each individual unit in the stack, often with a lag of a second or two at a time before you can move the next? It's really tedious. Likewise during combat, the game often asks you for completely irrelevant info when assigning casualties. If you choose to lose an infantry and you have a stack of six infantry, it then opens a popup box so you can pick which one of six identical infantry to assign as a casualty. Huh? Why? That just wastes time and gets annoying when you have to do so time and again.
- There is a total lack of flexibility or customization when playing the game. It's all down to capturing the victory cities, but you can't even adjust how many each side needs to win. Iron Blitz had WAY more options for customization. At least give us options for more or less victory cities, etc.
- At first I thought the AI was an improvement, but actually it's pretty darn bad. I've now played single player games controlling just one power and tried out each of the five countries to see how the AI behaves. At times, it may seem like they finally have a method to get the AI to handle naval shipping and amphibious assaults reasonably well. At other times, not so much, and countries like the US appear to just be dithering around while the war is lost. But even the land based AI is at times absolutely terrible. Never let Russia be an AI as it absolutely can't do anything right to defend itself. Germany is laughable with its focus on Russia, to the extent that it will gladly trade off the defence of the homefront in exchange for taking Russia. I even had a game where I played Japan, together with the Germany AI we had victory 100% secured, Russia fell, but then Germany proceeded to build nothing but land units in Russia and submarines and transports in the baltic sea. Over the next four or so turns, America captured France, Italy and Germany proper while the Germans did nothing to defend themselves.

Overall I really want this game to be a fun modern version of the board game I love and the previous computer game version from 20 years ago. Alas, it's not there yet, but hopefully it will be improved on and will get there at some point. Reluctantly, I can't recommend the game at this point but will continue to see if it improves over time and will revise my review if the game improves enough to warrant it.

For now, unless you are an Axis and Allies addict like me, I recommend you sit this one out and wait for improvements.",1565322244,1565322568,False,0,0,0,1,True,False,True

First: the price I think this game price too high for what it offers i think $9.99 or $7.99 is much fairer specialy for other reasons  I cant recommand game.

Second: reason is this game really buggy for what little it offers nothing works and there bots that troll join public matchs and dont do any thing so you force to forfiet the game.

Third: game spams emails to your email like constantly its a malware like how bad this game will send emails too many email features that need to go they do let u disable it but you have to constantly uncheck it cause its on by default.

Forth: AI the AI really broken for online and limited to standard not total victory and AI even in single player pending what faction you chose like if you chose brits expect to always lose cause the AI makes really dumb moves like russia always loses in 5 turns and america will never confront enamy ships and go around them where germany builds crazy massive fleets and armys overwhelming you as brits and russia.

Fifth: Public matchs the UI setting up games really buggy and lagging and oftin things dont work and bug out alot so extremly hard to set up matchs

Sixth: Zero steam support the game wont even allow steam overlay and even the private public matchs you cant invite your friends cause it never sends them invites so the private match feature of the game useless and dosnt work at all.

Seven: No ingame text chat or any thing so you cant chat with your team mates or the group of people playing the game.

I strongly recommand devs fix these things and also offer this game on all platforms once they do and a Mobile Phone version where those users can also play with the pc users to make this game injoyable and have more people to play with it.

Do not buy game at this time or at the price $19.99 devs asking for way too much for what there offering and how broken game is and how badly this game needs tons more work cause its lacking too many needed features and bug fixes and platform supports they launch game from.

1.  Where is it at?
2.  Where is it going?
3.  Does it add value, or does it have the potential to add value?

1.  For me, the value proposition is definitely there.  I've loved Axis and Allies since I was 13, (I am now 37).  This scratches my ever present Axis and Allies itch.  Is it perfect, in it's current state?  No.  However, it is Early Access, and so you really should educate yourself on what that means before review bombing.  Is it a fun way to kill sometime while hungering for those games of yesteryears?  Absolutely.  Also, just a tip, you can turn down the graphics resolution to improve performance.  If your game is ultra laggy, it might be that your hardware sucks.  This was definitely true in my case.  I just set all of the resolutions to the lowest quality and ""walla"" I'm in business.  Now, if you're frustrated that your comp can't run the highest resolutions...that's a you thing, not a Beamdog thing.

2.  Beamdog has proven amazingly responsive at taking feedback.  I submitted a request for a future feature, and I got an e-mail within an hour letting me know they were looking into it.  Within the first few days they have been submitting patches, hotfixes, and gathering feedback.  For me, this shows that they are committed to the ongoing state of the game.  Additionally, the game is incredibly ambitious.  It's going to take time people, but the payoff will be amazing.

3.  I've been thirsty for some A&A for what feels like forever, and this scratches that itch.  And, if you hate it now, remember, this is probably the worst state the game will ever be in.  Even in that worst state, it still satisfies the strategy itch.  I can't wait to see where it will go from here.",1565202725,1565202725,True,0,0,0.498338848352432251,0,True,False,True

It's pretty good.
It's clear, effective, and I find almost everything from this boardgame that I love.
AI is decent (but sometimes takes silly decisions, so a veteran of the boardgame will beat it easily).

Some things need to get fixed, as it is still in alpha :
  - Lag in solo game against AI, especially during the end game
  - Having to move each unit one by one, you guys should create something simple to move multiples units to a territory (cursor...)
  - Not rolling dice when AI attacks you! This one is unacceptable, because that stops immersion. And you don't see easily which units and territory you lost. I REALLY hope you will fix it.


I see a lot of negatives reviews after less than one week of alpha. Give them some time to improve the game, we already had updates in the first week.

I was originally going to post a positive review.  Even with all of the little complaints I had.  However after I saw the lack of ability to chose loses or even see battles when you are attacked is by design and won't change.  I can not.  I am aware of the profile system and how that can be adjusted.  However it still creates a static decision process that is based on a rule set created independent of the game I am playing vs real time choices based on the situation on the board in front of me.  The same over simplified rule sets that make for weak AIs instead of competitive ones.

Anyone that has played this game at a more competitive level will tell you there are times when you might want to take first hit on a battleship and others you don't.  Same thing with all of the other units, I won't always go by lowest cost unit first.  This concept to me is a HUGE fundamental flaw in this game.  Not seeing the defending battles also stinks.  Nothing like having 20+ thought out units defending a territory, and then poof you have none and the territory is gone and you don't know how the turn by turn battle went other than you lost.

The AI unfortunately offers you little to no challenge, and there is no difficulty option at this point.  So if you like to play solo you will want to consider this.  I probably haven't played in about 20 years, i have never played this rule set, and still have yet to lose vs AI.  Even when I had AI on my team to handicap me. Perhaps this will change and improve, however if you are purchasing it now, this is probably a consideration.",1565023940,1565023940,False,21,0,0.677480757236480713,0,True,False,True

Which in some ways is more user friendly. This game just came out and it has its bugs but I found playing it for the first time was great. At least in my opinion, it was easy to understand. I haven't played it online. Though I do have a few things I think the developer should fix or add.
1. Tech development. (normal techs that have always been with Axis & Allies)
2. Country or team bonuses. (control a territory or several territories)
3. Show AI combat/follow all movements and be able to pick your own units that are killed. It's a surprise on your turn if they wiped out a fleet or an army.
4. Different maps or update the current one - Break up a couple of the larger land zones China's territories and Eastern Europe's territories and add more cities. Cairo, Stalingrad, and Sydney as a examples.
5. The AI seemed too easy at times, but others times a bit of a challenge.
6. I had issues with the transports, I would load transports up, send them to do a attack for a amphibious assault, one would do the attack and the others wouldn't. I noticed it with the AI units as well several different times, they would just sit in the Baltic sea till I attacked and killed them.
7. Add AI difficultly level. (easy, normal, hard) and Add AI for online.

The gist of it is: It needs A LOT of work. But it's Early Access, so I guess that's okay. 

+ It's Axis and Allies, and it brings up the Axis & Allies feeling
+ Easy to play and understand
+ UI is not that bad
+ Sounds are fine
+ Devs - for now - seem to try hard to fix the worst game breaking things

- Feels like everything has been done with as little effort as possible
- The game is SLOW and clunky. Devs must have been really lazy or it's simply not optimized at all yet to be so slow with no fancy graphics at all. Also gameplay itself is to slow.
- Bugs bugs bugs, LOADS of bugs
- No neutral countries to invade as far as I can tell
- Zoom even a little out and you don't see army models anymore, just placeholders
- Some things could be done faster (Why do I need an extra step to choose between my total identical foot soldiers which one has to die?)
- I feel like I don't have any overview of the battle field at all. It feels...wrong. Again, clunky.

Regarding online multiplayer, each person has 24 hours to take their turn. I think in addition to this 24 hour turn game mode, there should be a different game mode.

I really would like a separate online game time, like ""lightning"" or ""Blitz"" game type, where each player has 15 minutes to take their turn. This way, we can get an entire game done in one night. The current process is taking DAYS just for two people to take their turn.

This new ""lightning/blitz"" mode would be on a merit basis. You miss your turn, you get a demerit. Miss too many turns and waste everyone's time you get a penalty on playing lightning/blitz mode. Maybe the penalty could be you cannot play lightning mode for a week. Maybe the penalty is you only get paired with other players who have the same bad reputation.

In any case, I really don't like having to wait days just for a few turns to go by. I want to get an entire game in every once and a while, and devote a few hours to it. There should be a mode in addition to the current modes, allowing for a quicker game type, 15 minutes (or something under 24 hours) per turn, with penalties when you are unreliable in doing this.

- When suddenly you don't trow at least one five or six, the battle crashes and you have no option but start over the entire campaign

I wanted to load troops from Italy to Lybia while an enemy destroyer was in sea zone 15 which prevented me from an amphibious assault to Lybia..

I have only played one online game. I lost quite badly. But, it was enjoyable. There is no way to message other players during the game, which kind of sucks, because I would at least like to congratulate my opponent for totally destroying me. 

Also, online games seem to have a problem with getting started? Even though there are 5 players, and we are all ready to go, the game just doesn't start right away.

It is hard to find people who can set aside enough time to play the boardgame together and having a digital version for local hotseat as well as online connections combined with AI is something we are very excited about :)

The tutorials were easy to follow and gave us the basics of how to control the game.  The tips in the top left of the tutorial were also good.

We have not played a full game yet but played a couple of turns as Allies and then a couple of turns as Axis to get a feel for the game.

Thanks Beamdog for being excited about the game and bringing us a new version to play online!

Based off our first session we are enjoying the game and it is playing like the board game.  The turns still take some time to navigate around the map and move through the various phases of build, combat, non-combat and placement.  Combat is thematic and in keeping with the board game.  It is harder to follow what happens on other peoples turns (or the AI turns) and we are having to use the War Diary to go back through the actions and battles to really clearly understand what has occurred.

The good stuff:
1. Thanks for the hard work Devs and the whole Beamdog team that you have put in so far to get the game to us and available as Early Access while you work through the rest.
2. Local hotseat and AI which is something our family loves (we still play Heroes of Might and Magic 3 as a family at times in local hotseat :) )
3. Boardgame mechanics
4. Battle thematics and backgrounds
5. Reminders if you have not made certain actions like landing planes or moving units.
6. War diary allows you to go back through opponents turn phases to see what happened.  The zooming in to battle locations and movements and placements is good.

What would we like to see coming:
7. A setting to be able to watch AI or others turns at a pace that allows you to see what is happening.
8. When you are defending being able to see the battle occur and feel like you are part of what is happening (as well as being able to see the size of armies and casualties occurring on both sides.  The excitement if a battle is coming down to the wire when you are on Defence as well is something that we would like to see.
9. Being able to play or have AI take on Italy and Australia/NZ (ANZAC).
10. Research (not something I always would look to use but can add a nice option).

Recommendation:
If you like the board game or enjoy turn based strategy games I would recommend giving this a try.  Be aware it is a game that is slow paced in terms of the game phases and actions but the outcome of battles can turn the tide of victory or defeat very quickly depending on what strategy you go for :)  Also keep in mind it is still early access and there will be bugs and features still to come.  For example we hit a few bug crashes in a couple of battles in 1.5 hours playing but on the positive side, the game automatically restarted the campaign in the same place and nothing was lost.",1564833183,1564833256,True,3,0,0.502412557601928711,3,True,False,True

Everything works smoothly once you get used to how this implementation does things.

I found I was able to either figure out or find the info I needed there among the controls in the game.  There were a few more pop-ups than I'd like but I found you can adjust a lot of that in the Settings.  It's true that the AI is not strong, but then it took TripleA a long time to come up with stronger AI.  There are a lot of good conveniences - running reminders of things like how close you are to enough victory cities to win, a game summary at the end, being able to see all legal moves for a piece, etc.  I found the Map Notes kind of odd and annoying, but then I just ignored them.  The map zooms in and out good and is easy to get around, or at least as easy as the other implementations I've played.  I didn't experience any bugs in this first play.

I am a huge fan of the Axis & Allies Board games. I have never played the 1942 version, though I may get it as a board game as well since its probably best to introduce friends to. There were issues with crashes at the beginning but they seem to have subsided with the few patches since its release. 

I have not tried online play yet since I hear it's still buggy I may soon though as the computer is getting very easy to beat (just wondering if I can sit for several hours against people online). I do like the fast option when computer plays though and its possible to read what happened if it went too fast for you. But I did at times wonder what happened to some of my units then I read what happened to them. FYI new players don't leave transports by themselves especially if they are in range of enemy planes the computer tends to focus on those easy kills. (Developers maybe make fast time an option against computers?)

Overall I am enjoying this game since I do not tend to play with friends much since I own them and the game is too long for them. For some of these negative comments its in early release and the developer are still working out bugs but to me its not quite perfect and I am looking forward to the other game maps as add ons but most likely will be paid for DLC.

(Examples: A&A 1941, A&A Pacific 1940, A&A Europe 1940, Combined Europe and Pacific to make A&A 1940 Global, A&A WWI 1914, A&A Zombies? Please developers put these other maps on as well!)",1564830765,1564830765,True,2,0,0,1,True,False,True

I have loved Axis & Allies since the board game came out in the 80's. The PC game that came out about 10 years ago was not perfect but it was extremely good. Sadly it is not supported on Windows 10. This new version is not.

I cannot believe how slow and clunky it is. Even the Iron Blitz add on that came out for the old version was less buggy and clunky than this. 

Bad Things.
1. The graphics. Just lazy poor basic graphics. The original (released in 2004, some 15 years ago had far better graphics.
2. Slow. Really slow. Every time I move a piece it takes seconds per piece. And you cannot move more than one at a time! Whats with that? Imagine having 20 soldiers. Move each, one at a time, each one taking 2-3 seconds. Just moving them takes over a minute.
3. Defending is automatic. WHY????? Yes you can set up priorities to loose, but I want to PLAY it when they are my troops being killed. 
4. CRASHING. Oh the crashes. This is the single biggest problem, and it is up against some really stiff competition, believe me. It keeps loosing connection to the internet and crashing the game. The only way  it was playable was by disconnecting wifi on my laptop. Isn't this supposed to be an online game?

Good things

1. It is Axis & Allies.

Summary

I feel absolutely ripped off with this. If I could, I would get my money back. It is only just playable.

Just be grateful there is actually a real way to play Axis and Allies online now.
They already launched a stability patch one day after EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH.

They released the game July 30th.. ON JULY 31ST there was a hot-fix already!

So for all you looking to buy please note this is early access and the stability is going to improve. For people giving negative reviews on stability maybe try giving at least 24 hours next time before you review.

As for features: I think it is awesome how you can jump in and out seamlessly right where your turn left off, even if you disconnect. My friends and I can play whether we have time together or we just take our turns throughout the day!


I'm not a fan of the 1942 SE choice but eh... there's worse things in life, and this game makes sense because it's much more reachable to newcomers. :) 

Highly recommend.

Seriously though... how many people give negative reviews on stability Regarding an EARLY ACCESS launch... Give me a break... It boggles my mind. It's not they launched it and said ""Here's you're finished project, we aren't going to make changes.""

UPDATE - Clarification - in an AI game.  Have no idea what's being attacked or going on. Would like to roll and pick my casualties when being attacked by AI.

So this is my second review of this game (my first was simply a first impressions and very vague) and I was wanting to do a much more in depth review.

Problems I find with the game:
1. The game will completely restart if it loses its connection to the servers.
  (Playing the offline Single Player mode is irrelevant)
2. The board (while a faithful recreation of the physical game), is very bland.
3. The game does not allow you to play all the different modes in offline single player.
4. The UI is not very ergonomic.
5. Movement controls around the board are very sluggish.

-the combat dice roll screen is very fun and simple to use, creative, and rewarding.  
-The map was well created, and your loading screen images are very well done.
-no unit cap, very nice!
-Automatic AI movement was swift, and easy to follow.
-randomized AI tactic was refreshing, and kept me on my toes both times i played, as the same nation.  

Improvements- While you can select 1 unit(s) and move that unit(s) by clicking one at a time into the map, it would be easier for a select all option, or even a common click and drag to move your force into the region you desire.  
-While we have offensive combat dice rolling screen, I would love the option for defensive dice rolling screen.  Not being able to control my defensive looses was a hassle, and sometimes stressful.  This would also be nice to see allies rolls as well.
-while you has a beautiful soundtrack, it is repetitive.  Maybe if possible more soundtracks in the future?
-Research Tech.  In the original game you could spend 5IPC to gain 1 research dice, that would unlock 1 of 6 techs for your nation.  this was conducted at the beginning of your turn, before unit purchase.
-Nation Specilizations-  the original offered unique game experience, such as the Japan Kamikaze, American quick transport, and several others.  If put into the game, this would vastely change and reshape the tactics provided, and would be fun.

Glitches & bugs- As you gain more firepower, and more land mass, unit placement/ movement under all circumstances starts to dramatically decreases.
Black screen- Sometimes after the non-combat phase, or during a combat phase, you will get a black screen, but still hear audible cues and can still play, without visual support.
Online crash-  While the game does autosave after every move, online crash will force you to reboot in offline.  Once the game finds your online connection, it will ask to see if you want back online, but doing so makes you loose online connectivity every time after 1 turn or less.
Menu crash-  Rarely, I would be dropped to the main menu due to some error.  
Combat Wont Exit-  Sometimes if one of your units gets killed and when you select the casualty, the game will not advance, and will keep asking for a casualty selection, or it just wont move forward into the next stage of combat.

Pros-

+ The game gives you that old classic Axis and Allies feel with the board the units and the dice roll
+ It runs smoothly never getting frame drops
+ Brief and right to the point tutorial dropping you right into the game
+ AI isnt too hard for new players and makes it a easy to pick up and play game

Cons-

-Game crashes multiple times even in my hour of game time
- Multiplayer is laughably bad for a multiplayer board game online
-Game breaking glitches top make it playable past the first few rounds
- Cant see what the people are rolling when they attack so it ruins the immersion and youre just sitting there just doing nothing 
- AI are also laughably dumb as well easy for veterans of the game 

Verdict-
I know i dont have a lot of hours in this game but the little bit i had made me remind me off my childhood playing with my uncle both the board game and old floppy disk pc game. Its just left a funny taste in my mouth on why they made this a early access game with subpar game play when they couldve kept us waiting a bit and polished it and made it a fantastic game the veterans would love and the new comers could also enjoy. I just hope the devs care about this game and will fix it but in this state ill just have to uninstall and just wait that it happens one day till then i dont recommend this game.

1. You're not allowed to purposely let aircraft crash. You can potentially be stuck on a noncombat move turn because of this.

2. It frequently switches back and forth between online and offline mode. When it does- it will reboot the game and send you back to the main menu. No skipping over the intro sequence or developer title animation allowed.

Game started shaky, immediate started in a tutorial, would have liked a menu to start.
 
Started first game as single player.  At one point I accidentally clicked an invalid move for a tank and the game went black and I thought it had crashed... nope just lagged out terribly.    Later during the same first game, it just crashed out right.  Something about loosing connection to the server, seemed like it made several attempts then gave up.   

Couldn't even make it through a single game. Spent 68 minutes on that one game, made a request to refund before I went over the two hour mark on a second attempt.

If it can't handle a single player game, how is it going to hold up with multiple players sending data back and forth.  I was testing this out for my friends and was thinking about purchasing a full round of AA for everyone I used to play the tabletop version -- after trying it, I just don't want to subject my friends and veteran AA players to this ""product"".



Merits of the game:
If you knew how to play AA this is pretty straight forward the same game, didn't have too much trouble figuring out the play of the game.

Cons of the game:
(deal breaker)  ""failed right out of the gate""  Couldn't complete a single, single player game.  *First Refund Request Ever*
(minor) Movement with the arrows is somewhat confusing, when moving transports to offload it wasn't clear which space they were disembarking.  Had to undo the move and redo it a couple of times to be sure it was doing what I commanded.

Biggest gripes: 
Lack of visibility into defending battles as you  you can be attacked and dont know why your entire army or fleet was wiped out. No way to detemine which units take hit first as far as I can tell is is wieghted purely on IPC value not defence 
UI is also slow and not efficient, turns take forever and should provide more detail for how long they take. 
Not color blind friendly with no national flag on fleet or unit cards annotation who is who and only very similar unit colors to work off of. 
Ai needs work as they have a habit of leaving transports completely undefended. 
Russia is doomed to any determined advance from Germany and Japan. [more of a problem with 1942 than this iteration specifically] Allies need to help the eastern front but good luck finding players willing to devote resources to it and the AI will almost never. 
Need a way to zoom out more. 
Cant grab whole stacks of units and when you have 28 infantry holding the line in Russia and need to make a push with cannon fodder... I mean comrades, that is a big deal 

Pros:
Multiplayer! No easy way to find a people to play A&A.
