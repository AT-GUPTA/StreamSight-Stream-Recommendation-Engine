A lot of different blocks! And the objects are ACTUAL objects like you have real lamps, doors, banners, columns, chairs and more compared to other certain cube (voel) games.

I swear, not a single crafting/building game can reach Dragon Quest Builders 1&2 level. Both are so good that every other building game is boring to me. I've been looking for good ones but none of them were even CLOSE to this here. Both Builders games are very enjoyable and fun!! I can't get enough. I just finished DQB1 but since I started with DQB2, there were some features I missed. But nothing too crucial.

However, to actually build in Terra Icognita..... Well. I'll spend my time in DQB2 (over 165 hours) instead.

This version can be considered the definitive version of the game as of 2022, due to the numerous changes and improvements present on it. It was later ported to PC in 2024.

●It includes everything available on the Switch version of the game.

●This version supports every language the game has ever been translated to (Japanese, Korean, Traditional Chinese, English, German, French, Spanish and Italian) in a single version. It also includes two new translations: Brazilian Portuguese and Latin American Spanish. The PC version also includes Simplified Chinese.

●There is an ""undo"" button.

●There is autosave. It triggers when sleeping or when using a chimaera wing.

●A buildnoculars-like feature called ""Build Mode"" is available from the start. Players can build and destroy from afar with this feature by just clicking on the screen.
○The ""Builder Mode"" is expanded in Terra Incognita. It's a function even more similar to Builders 2's Buildnoculars, allowing for a great level of accuracy due to it's crosshair.

●Doors open automatically when the player moves close to them.

●Equipment degradation is gone.

●The character can now run.

●Players can now choose how many items to craft at once.

●The menus are completely redone.

●Opening the bag allows access to the colossal coffer.

●Each slot can now hold up to 9999 items instead of 99.

●The bag can now hold more items as well. Chests can hold 50% more items, and the colossal coffer is also larger.

●The colossal coffer can now be organized normally or separated by item type.

●The color globes now emit a ray of light for extra visibility.

●The Big Bash technique from Builders 2 is available and unlocked upon obtaining the giant mallet.
 
●The recipe list now shows what monsters drop monster-only materials.

●The Bashmobile does not stop after colliding against blocks or items.

●Ability to unlock infinite materials for the workbenches in Terra Incognita, similar to the infinite materials from Explorer Shores in Builders 2. They can be unlocked by purchasing the related manual with Pixel blocks.

●Rare items can be purchased with Pixel blocks as well.

●New tools, accessories and items for Terra Incognita:
○Gloves: They function similar to their Builders 2 counterpart, allowing players to hold and rotate items without breaking them.
○Mega minecart: Ride tracks even faster than before.
○Liber Destructica: Turns Big Bash into Bigger Bash.
○Meteorite shoes: A pair of shoes that greatly increase speed movement.
○Reverse curved rail track: A rail section that turns to the left.
○A new item type for Terra Incognita: ""Figurine"". This type of item includes replica models of monsters and npcs, which can be assigned animations from a list.

●New DLC for Terra Incognita:
○Magic Carpet allows players to fly.
○Pixel Ring triples the drop rate of pixel blocks dropped by enemies.
○Astronomy Set unlocks recipes to create the celestial bodies of the Solar System.
○Boss Monster Model Set allows players to place replicas of the story bosses.

Quote from the TouchArcade review:

The PS4 and PS Vita original 2016 versions are still full price digitally ($59.99 and $39.99), but the former gets discounted to $34.99 during some sales. The Switch version is priced at $49.99 usually, but it also sees discounts to $34.99 once in a while.
[b]The discounted console price is still higher than the full-priced Steam and mobile version.[/b]
The mobile version is priced at $27.99 usually with $5.99 of optional DLC. [b]The Steam version is priced at $27.99, with all the DLC included.[/b] There is also a discount if you own the sequel.

I don’t know why it took so long for the game to be ported to PC, but nearly eight years after debuting on consoles, [b]Dragon Quest Builders has gotten a PC port, and it is the best version.[/b] As a value proposition, features, content, technical performance, and more, the Steam version is also the way to go, and [b]it shines on Steam Deck.[/b] Once the mobile version gets controller support, it will be a very close second to the Steam version.

There are however, some things missing that are exclusive to the switch version. Thanks for reading.",1707848342,1708922331,True,37,0,0.722842872142791748,7,True,False,False

(1) People who played only DQB 2 and are wondering if they should get this one

(2) People who played the original on Playstation and are wondering if this port is different from the original

[h1](1) I played DQB2. Will I like this one?[/h1]

Here's a list of things you might wanna know:

[list]
[*] NPCs don't talk your ear off nearly as badly as DQB2. Dialogues are generally shorter and you skip through them / ignore them a lot faster. DQB1 has a story but doesn't place as much emphasis on it as DQB2.

[*]There is no ""Isle of Awakening"". There are individual story chapters (similar to the different islands in DQB2), but there is no ""hub"" connecting them all. You just select each chapter from a menu basically.

[*] Your build areas are smaller. Much, much smaller. That makes beautifying and getting creative with your towns much more difficult. But if you're a person who enjoys trying to squeeze brilliance out of limitations, you might actually find this satisfying in a way.

[*]A bit less block / decoration variety since this is the first entry.

[*]There is no Malroth or equivalent ""companion"" character.

[*]There is no glider and movement is overall slower. 

[*]Hunger works differently. In DQB2 if your hunger drops to zero, it just applies a debuff to your attack and prevents you from running. In DQB1, if your hunger drops to zero, you will slowly lose HP over time as if you are poisoned. You will not completely die, however. It will reduce your HP to 1 and then stop. Even so, hunger is a more serious problem in DQB1. Especially when you get into chapters 2 and 3 where food stock is more challenging at the start of the chapters.

[*]You have little to no control over water in DQB1. The water jug is not here.

[*]Some of DQB2's building refinements are not present (e.g. laying chunks of blocks at once, swapping blocks, etc).

[*]The awfulness of Skelkatraz does not exist anywhere in this game.

[*]Some things are a bit more difficult to accomplish in DQB1, such as replacing grass, which you can kinda only do by farming bats for grass seed drops.

[*]This is a mobile port of the game and not the original version, so some aspects of the UI feel ugly or awkward and yet have QOL improvements over the original so UI is both better and worse.

[*]There is a ""Terra Incognita"" area where you can free build similar to Isle of Awakening, but it is its own separate place and is not connected to the story chapters.
[/list]

[h2](2) I enjoyed the original but heard this is a mobile port. What does that mean? Is that bad?[/h2]

Yes it is a port of the mobile version, not the original version. Is that bad? Yes and no. Here's some bullet points for you

[list]
[*]It does not affect visual quality at all. You can have up to the same resolution as the original here, so it doesn't look worse. But note also that you can't have BETTER than the original resolution, so it's not improved either.

[*]FPS is better than the original, so you do have improved FPS at least.

[*]Weapon durability is removed in this version. Weapons and tools last forever.

[*]The game's HUD and UI have been completely replaced with new HUD/UI that was redone for the mobile version. This unfortunately means that visually the HUD and UI look a bit like trash. There were functional reasons why they needed to change it for mobile, but when those are brought over to PC where they're not really necessary, the functional advantages are moot and you still get the ugly clashing appearance. It also means you get other weird artifacts like the item hot bar being obnoxiously high on the screen. Something that probably made sense on mobile, but on PC it just looks EXTREMELY weird, like there is something wrong with the config or something, but nope. Port problem. The HUD / UI aspect of the port definitely sucks, but it's also the worst demerit. Out of all the things that could be awful about a port, this isn't the worst. I wish this was better, but it is what it is.

[*]You get a few positives here as well, such as all the QOL upgrades made to the game since the original release, such as the ability to save anywhere, an ""undo"" function while building, and new creative content in the Terra Incognita mode.

By the way, if you didn't play 1 because you skipped the Switch and you're a grown adult like myself who refuses to game on mobile, it's okay.  The summary of the game: it's a ""what if"" of what happened in Dragon Quest 1.  And if you never played that game - first of all, shame on you, but...

Dragon Warrior (Quest) 1 was one of the very first games where a choice mattered.  You were given this choice by the last boss himself, and making the wrong choice basically gave you Game Over/bad ending.  Oh, and did I mention that back then, you couldn't just save before the boss like you whippersnappers can nowadays...so if you decided to take that choice, you were footing it alllllllllll the way back to that island, alllllll the way back to that castle, and allllllll the way back to the boss.

Dragon Quest Builders is basically the playout of that bad ending and you get to experience what happened to the world as a result of that choice, hundreds of years later.  It's not required to play Dragon Quest 1, but it definitely helps.  Because otherwise the things that happen won't have any impact on you if you're an RPG player at heart.  If you do decide to play DQ1 first, it's a very short game; I figure you can complete it in less than 10 hours all told if I recall correctly (there's some grinding in there of course).

[H1]What's Good[/H1]
✅ Graphics are good (part 2 obviously has better graphics because it's part 2, but the detail here is very good)

✅ Framerate is fairly consistent.  60fps is dirt simple, 120fps might be depending on your hardware.  In my case it doesn't hold 120fps firm, but it never drops below 70fps and never stays down for more than a few seconds.  You might think that's pretty severe, but that's with everything maxed completely out.  Draw distance and foliage (possibly due to shadows) seem to be the big hitters, and the game is smooth enough at 60fps that anything more is icing on the cake, frankly.  It ran at a fairly consistent 30fps on the Switch, so for me this is an improvement regardless.

✅ QoL improvements are both good and questionable.  Let me explain the ""good"" here and the ""not so good"" later.  Everything feels less tedious overall, and I'm not sure what to chalk that specifically up to.  Movement is certainly more fluid, HP has been bumped up (which was needed) and the Big Bash with the mallet makes gathering fixed materials way less dull and dry (because there are so many useful materials everywhere).  Also I don't remember being able to run in the Switch version, but I might just be imagining things.

✅ Load times are very brief.  The Switch didn't have significant load times either, but these feel even shorter.  Quite a feat given how large the game world actually is especially Terra Incognita.

✅ I can't tell if it's just me remembering the Switch version so clearly or that the overall game has been made less challenging, but it certainly feels like things are much easier.  Used to be that you wouldn't even be able to get materials for things until the game felt like letting you advance that far; here, I'm never feeling like I'm behind on anything and in fact, have built things in advance because I knew they would be needed later.  Obviously things like room types are straight out of memory, but other than that, it's hard to explain why it just feels much more low-key and smooth than it used to.

✅ I might be imagining things, but Kol and Rimuldar feel much more accessible starting out.  In the Switch version (and this was kind of the point) you started out with less around to make food, so you would frequently go hungry until you finally found something to cook.  The increase in enemies as well as various plants seems to help this a bit.  Tantegel is still a bit rough, but it's understandable given what's happened to the world there.

✅ The final weapon in Kol now controls MUCH better.  Let me repeat that - MUCH.  FRICKIN.  BETTER.  

✅ Magic carpet - although it's a bit clunky to control, so I ended up not using it much.

✅ Certainly feels like the number of enemies wandering is a lot more than I'm used to.  

✅ Terra Incognita.  It was always decent good, but a lot's been added that makes it much more entertaining and less of a chore, like the Building Cards (if you've played 2, it's where you can ""sketch"" a design) that let you share and reuse designs that you find.

✅ NO.  MORE.  MOTHER. FATHERING. WEAPON/ARMOR.  BREAKING!!!  You can't imagine how annoying this was.  Trust.


[H1]What Ain't Good[/H1]
❌ So I talked about those QoL improvements.  One of them is (allegedly) the menu structure and control scheme.  I hate it.  It makes sense on a mobile; it doesn't make sense with a controller, in my opinion.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the Switch controls but even they were more intuitive to me.  For example, the ""Clean Up"" didn't seem to be combining the same item consistently.  I don't know why, because there's a Combine option, yet Clean Up should do it and it didn't except the one time.  ""Accept"" and ""Cancel"" buttons are transposed (basically, think Switch, not Xbox/PS5).  

❌ The reason I didn't think the Switch version had run, is because (unless I'm misremembering and I do plan to check at some point) the camera zoom was one of the bumpers and one of the sticks.  Now, it's this wonky double stick business that just makes no sense to me (because the bumper is how you run).

❌ You're still forced to collect Chimaera Feathers to make Wings so you can warp back to the base (part 2 doesn't have this requirement).  Also (and I plan to confirm this too because maybe I got it wrong), I could have sworn you only needed 3, not 5.  That might just be my age playing tricks on the memory though.

❌ They didn't fix the drop rates - so you're forced to farm for stupid things like the scorpion horn that don't want to drop hardly at all.

❌ I can't stand the new inventory management.  I can't really explain it - but it feels like the ""Recent"" should just have been a swap to the Colossal Coffer.  You can always press Up on the D-pad to access it, but then you're forced to do cleanup and there's no ""send all to coffer"" or something to expedite.

❌ Equipping accessories is also a bit annoying, because equipping a new one always replaces the top one.  It'd be more intuitive to round-robin between them instead.


Notice that my negatives are just things that I think could and should have been addressed.  This is still (to me) the better of the two if you like RPGs.  Because 1 is an RPG with builder elements while 2 is a builder game with RPG elements.  1 is more my speed and tells its story much better (in my opinion).

Bottom line is this.

[B]IF YOU JUST WANT A BUILDER GAME[/B] and don't care about the RPG stuff, I strongly recommend skipping it.  It's not that you won't get that experience, but again, it's an RPG with builder elements.  Part 2 does a better job of catering to the builder crowd, in my opinion.  

However, Terra Incognia (Part 1) is a [B]vastly[/B] superior playground than what you get in Part 2.  Which is why I would recommend learning to appreciate the RPG elements for what they are.  Then enjoy both games, because they're both fantastic.",1707966337,1708392710,True,8,0,0.545925140380859375,0,True,False,False
2436570,158672769,76561198098438730,0,2,3190,3191,1366,1709005949,"I was so excited to find out Dragon Quest Builders was coming to Steam. I have extensively played the PS4 and the Vita versions, and I'm playing the Steam version on Steam Deck. Now at the end of Chapter 1 I feel I have a good grasp of the changes and want to share my thoughts.

This is the same game we know and love with more positive changes than negative ones. The game has never looked this good and been as easy to play. Tools no longer degrade, you can equip a weapon and a resource gathering hammer at the same time, and saving is possible anywhere you are in the main menu plus there is an auto save function after using things like chimera wings or completing tasks. They cleaned up the inventory management systems making it so much easier to see what you have and what you need for current goals, plus increased individual stack limits to 9999 versus 99 (big structure builders and resource pack rats rejoice!). I've only noticed two gameplay changes that get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.

1) It went from simple to almost impossible to destroy a block directly above your head with a hammer. I am a tunnel fan, and would often carve stairs and tunnels through mountains to make shortcuts to popular locations but with the new control scheme I am more likely to fall off the block I'm on trying to make the block above my head highlight. This is far from game breaking as there are many other ways to climb mountains but annoys me every time I try.

2) The interact distance is increased, unintelligent, and imprecise. In the original release you had to be really close to an object or person to interact with them. In the Steam release this appears to be increased by almost 10x and you are more likely to interact with the wrong thing or person. When I say the interact distance is unintelligent, I'm referring to its inability to recognize walls and floors. For example, my kitchen is underneath my storage room. More often than not when I go to get something out of storage, it will start a conversation with an NPC I can't even see in the kitchen instead of the chest 1 block in front of me. I have to aim the camera pretty high to get it to ignore things on the wrong floor or in a different room. If the devs could make this system smarter or restore the original distance the game used it would no longer be a problem.

Overall the controls are superior to the original release but fans of the original game on Playstation consoles will want to go into the settings and swap some button mapping options. For example, ""B"" is used to accept things and ""A"" is to go back. All the general buttons for character actions were moved to other inputs. I don't know why these changes were made, and the default configuration was hard to play with. I ended up changing ""A"" to confirm and ""B"" to go back, and then changed the mapping for tools, attacks, and jumping to match the associated button on Playstation. After those changes this quickly became my favorite place to play the game. I think the devs could make multiple presets so it's more user-friendly for those who find the default configuration difficult.

Steam Deck specific:

If you are playing on Steam Deck in handheld mode there isn't anything you need to change to play. If you are docked to a TV using a controller you will need to change the controller order in Steam Deck's controller settings every time you start the game. The game also defaulted to low on every graphical setting but I found I was able to maintain 60 FPS with everything adjusted to medium while water reflections and bloom were set to off.

Tl,dr: This game is amazing and Steam is now my favorite place to play this title due to all the quality of life improvements, but if you played the Playstation releases you may find a few aspects about the game that annoy or require relearning the game.",1708297048,1708297048,True,7,0,0.603174567222595215,0,True,False,False

You visit each major city and rebuild it while doing quests for the locals. You get to build the city as normal or crazy as you wish, as long as you fulfill the wishes of the townsfolk.  At the end of each town you face a BBEG holds a legendary item that you will need to move on.  There are also special quests that you can fulfill for each city, but you only find out about them after you beat that area.  Also, there is a special area called Terra Incognito that allows you to build whatever you wish, with access to areas that allow you to collect materials.  There are special areas in Terra that you can build on that allow you to share your buildings with other players.  

For those of you that did play this game before on another port, they did make some really nice quality of life changes from the original.  First off (and the best change IMO), weapons and armor don't break anymore.  You only need one mallet to farm to your heart's content!  Second, you can specify exactly how many of a recipe you want to make.  In the original, it was either one or maximum.  Third, if you are playing mouse/keyboard, you can switch between your weapon and your mallet with just the push of your mouse wheel.  Really handy when farming in an area with a lot of enemies.  Terra Incognito seems to be for the most part unchanged, and with the new players this game will get from joining Steam, there will be new players to share ideas with.

When they introduced DQB2 on steam, I always wondered when they were going to put this game on here as well.  Well, Square Enix didn't disappoint, other than taking their sweet time in doing it. 

I'll address the usually question I see on these review:  is it worth the price?  You could probably get a better game at the same price ( I know that PalWorld is nearly the same cost).  If you love a modern twist on very classic games (the original is 28 years old in Japan and 25 years old in the US), get the 2 Builder's games in a bundle and enjoy them.

I played it originally when it came out on console and I appreciate the quality of life changes for the PC version. I like that items do not degrade and you get the large bashing from your hammer to name a few.

Only complaint  is that I wish there was dash. Run speed is silly slow (Yes, I know that you can get gear to improve that), but it slogs during the first few chapters.

Overall, fun experience and it makes me want to go back and play DQB2 after I'm done.

- It's a story-driven game with a level/chapter structure, and the story is typical Dragon Quest (seemingly tongue-in-cheek but quite dramatic at times)
- You are not just plopped into a huge open-world; the game is about exploring multiple small maps that get unlocked slowly as you progress in the story
- You are never left to figure anything out on your own, you are ALWAYS given a concrete goal and you're never confused about how to reach it
- You unlock recipes very gradually and are never overwhelmed by new mechanics, new things to build, etc.
- There's a ton of focus on quality of life, like infinite storage chests that you can access from anywhere through a menu, or huge attack that let you gather tons of ore in seconds
- Building and gathering stuff is simple and VERY quick, and so far there's been no real case of farming since all recipes take very few ingredients that you can get very quickly
- Very appealing graphics, but the game is somehow less than a gigabyte in size (!? Magic ?!)
- You don't need to explore much at all, but I found myself compelled to anyway since distances on these maps are so short and traversal is so fast
- Despite having mechanics like a ""hunger meter"" and things like that, the game is completely stress-free
- It's easy, simple and yet still very engaging

I have a lot of nostalgia for the game this is based on and found myself intrigued with the concept of returning to that world.  I have played the hell out of it on PS4 and always wondered why it hadn't been brought to Steam yet.  And now, here it is.  The experience is, for the most part, exactly what you would expect if you're a DQB veteran.  There are, however, a few things to note (no spoilers):

1.  Carrying capacity, both in the item bag and with the Colossal Coffer, have been increased.

2.  Starting HP is higher.

3.  Building height limit is doubled.

4.  There is a 'boost' to run but the speed increase seems to be insignificant (maybe 25%?) so it's really not worth much at present.

5.  The user interface is a bit goofy if you're used to playing this on consoles.  Those of you who've played it on mobile devices might find it familiar.  Another potential issue is, if you're used to PS4, having to deal with the controls being different.  You can mitigate this somewhat but you'll likely be fighting muscle memory until you adapt.

6.  The weapon and armor durability has been eliminated.

7.  Hammers and weapons are now assigned to two separate buttons/keys and operate similar to how they work in DQB2.  Weapons are for enemies and hammers are for building/demolishing.

8.  The builder can walk up one block high steps without jumping.

9.  All the DLC from every version is here.  That includes the magic carpet and the pixels.

10.  The chapter challenges remain with one difference: instead of a time limit you're tasked with gaining a specific number of materials.

Terra Incognita has a vew QoL upgrades too, from the magic carpet that makes the teleportals all but irrelevant since you can literally fly to the other islands to the pixels which allow you to buy an infinite supply of materials.  Not all materials, mind you -- the rarer ones still need to be collected -- but a useful number.  You can also use the pixels to buy a lot of materials that you might need.

I want to make this abundantly clear: I have played Dragon Quest Builders 2 first, and never have played the original on the PS3/PSP/etc. In addition, there will be spoilers below.

[h1]The Review[/h1]

I have played this all the way through the entire campaign as of this review, and haven't touched Terra Incognita, which is basically a semi-creative mode for the game. The story [spoiler]involves the ruin of the first Dragon Quest title where the hero takes the offer of the Dragonlord at the end of the game, and is given ""half"" of the world to rule.[/spoiler] You are a Builder, not a Hero. You are tasked with cleansing the world and helping the art of creation to be re-infused into the people of the world. It's s simple yet complex enough story to draw you in as any Dragon Quest game should strive to do. [spoiler]DQB1 and DQB2's stories aren't linked at all whatsoever. However, you [i]can[/i] extrapolate that the Soul of the Builder in DQB2 is the same Builder from DQB1, depending on how you look at it.[/spoiler]

For the keen-eyed, you may note that some screenshots provided have a stop-sign on the time indicator, this indicates the screenshot is taking place in Terra Incognita, where you can stop time permanently until you want it to move again. In addition, the DLC items / features, such as the Flying Carpet, cannot be gotten in the Campaign, which is fine, as the game's story would be easily completed with such items. That said, I haven't found where to get them in terra Incognita, but I also haven't been in all of the menus there either.

The mechanics of the game are pretty cut and dry. and the game is meant to be played with a controller in most cases, but the porting team did well enough to allow Mouse and Keyboard to play. That said, there are some numerous pitfalls to the game's design. Such as being unable to scroll your hotbar while sprinting. (This works in DQB2.) A lot of these are minor issues and can easily be played around. One thing that irks me about the ""Builder Mode"" where you go ""First-Person"" is that the camera sits slightly above the player's head, which can cause some awkward angles here and there. In addition, it would be nice to have more hints from NPCs concerning certain objective portions. Such as where to get Gold, Zerinthium, Orichalcum, etc. later on in the game.

[h1]The Conclusion[/h1]

But for those looking for a simple ""Recommended"" or not, I offer a question: [i]Would you rather have a polished game, or would you rather experience a ""Proof of Concept""?[/i]

For those wanting [b][u]a polished game[/u][/b], I would highly recommend not getting this one, and instead buying [i]Dragon Quest Builders 2[/i]. It is a far better game, and offers a more streamlined experience, with many more quality of life changes. Though you do lose the nicety of the ""Colossal Coffer,"" which allows you to access a consolidated inventory from anywhere. (This is replaced by the ""Bag"" feature in DQB2, which offers a similar experience.) It should be noted, the inventories of all chests are linked to nearby crafting tables in both games. So that's not an exclusive QoL improvement between either.

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072420/

For those wanting a [b][u]proof of concept[/u][/b], this is a good game. But I'd [i]highly[/i] recommend getting it on sale for 14.99 USD to 19.99 USD. It's not quite worth the nearly 30 USD that Square Enix requests from purchasers.",1708044208,1708065803,True,10,0,0.615073084831237793,0,True,False,False

You can disable the mobile UI elements shown in the screenshots. The game ties certain graphics to weird settings. When you start the game and build your first jar for example. It is not at all rounded, it looks almost like a diamond shape. If you increase your settings to high it does nothing for this. However, if you increase LOD Distance from ""near"" to either other option it rounds it out. I dont' really get why it does this. I assume this applies to other objects. And this is when you're standing right next to the jar. On near it does nothing to make it rounded. It's very odd.

These things aside, I'm still very happy to have this game ported to PC because I never expected this day to happen. I've played it on PS4 previously. Each world introduces more and more mechanics and challenges. The speed runs are a nice balance of stressful and fun though I never did all of them. I did the first two worlds 100% on PS4. The third one is rough just on the normal one for the start with food.

Aesthetically it's DQ, music is DQ, and it has all the charm of those games melded into Minecraft essentially and it's a great blend. I can't wait to build out my base with knowledge from the start. You can move water sources into your base to create rivers and moats and lakes, but also accidentally flood your entire house by removing the wrong block. It's awesome. 

It isn't as good as the sequel in QoL at all, but I think it's still worth playing.

edit; actually this version has a lot of added QoL features from the PS4 version. I guess added from the mobile version. A first person view when building, ranged building as well, a box that overfill pick ups go into (I really don't recall that in the original; it kind of negates any challenge of the base game since part of it was needing to ensure you had what you needed but also space for new things; now you can open a menu and grab food from your base if you're hungry, or even grab the ingredients and something to cook it on and place it all without going back to base).

The problem is it’s a mobile port with sometimes instructions to swipe the screen and has Nintendo controls by default (ABXY reversed) when navigating menus. This can be changed with some remapping. Resolution is also capped to 800p be default, you have to change to exclusive fullscreen to fix.

While some decisions are baffling there are a number of QoL improvements made which make this the definitive version of the game imo. Perfect for handheld, pc OR the tv depending on your choice of pc device.",1707861979,1707868493,True,3,0,0.54356849193572998,0,True,False,False

It has few nice QOL changes. Such as higher stacks, being able to sprint, much bigger inventory space, and an UNDO function!

But it looks noticeably worse than the Switch Version, It's UI is akin to that of the Mobile Version, which is okay besides scaling as some UI will change with the size slider, but some remain the same and overall not too good customization of that. The game also looks overall more softer and not as sharp(as compared to the switch.) 

Though if you haven't played this title yet, It's not a bad way to play it! I personally would recommend the Switch or PS4 version though.",1707868416,1707868416,True,3,0,0.551820755004882813,1,True,False,False

As for the game itself dragon quest builders one was always a favorite game of mine. If you've never played it and enjoy builder style games then this is a must play. If your a huge fan of dragon quest builders one on console then yeah get this game. 

I will say though if you've played the second game first you might strugle a bit playing this one. The second game added alot of quality of life changes that this one doesnt have.

This is a pretty decent port with many QOL changes like adding the big bash from DQB2 which allows for much easier clearing of stuff. The standalone game itself is also pretty great, 4 chapters with an engaging story and hours of content for the main campaign, and practically infinite time afterwards as the game becomes a complete sandbox after the main story on Terra Incognita!",1707865546,1707865546,True,8,0,0.575682401657104492,0,True,False,False

Getting a big bash earlier in the game than normal also helps a great deal.

Still a few minor things that seem like they will get fixed in patches, like the very wonky controls when you are trying to place ladders or ivy to climb, especially on the sides of mountains. Have to jump backwards while facing the direction you want to place the ivy, and hope you get it placed correctly... just very counter-intuitive. The UI scaling works more on some parts of the UI than the other things, for example you can have a very tiny quest objective list, but the buttons and your displayed inventory are still rather large. 

A very good port and hopefully a sign to the developers that there is interest in a part 3.",1707865316,1707865316,True,20,0,0.65457451343536377,0,True,False,False
