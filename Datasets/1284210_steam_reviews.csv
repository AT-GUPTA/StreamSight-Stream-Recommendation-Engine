Rather than feeling a rush to the end-game because that's ""the real game,"" you can actually take your time to explore and the community has been more than welcoming in my experience. GW2 has, of course, been around for a while so a 'fresh' take may not be the best expression, but it is new to me. If you have tried other MMOs like WoW, FF14, Runescape, BDO, or ESO, I think you'll find that GW2 has some of the best features of others while giving you plenty of room to make it your own game and journey. The beauty (including the ENORMOUS amount of outfit options) and animations remind me of FF14, though they are not as animated. The freedom to explore and check out your area reminds me of BDO and the Fractals/Raids kind of remind of M+ and Raid Wings in WoW.

Update: A new expansion just rolled out and is also on sale now if you want to grab it before the it ed the original GW. I love that there is still content coming out and servers kept up after all these years, original included. Worth trying the base game and give it a shot especially since it's discounted right now. The other content comes up semi-often.

Update 2: Note that any content you buy through steam does NOT transfer outside of it.

While the graphics start to show the age somewhat, the gameplay is still good, and I believe some modern MMORPG's can learn a lot from GW2.

I personally love exploring, finding secrets and solving the jumping puzzles. Still, there is something for every kind of MMORPG player here. The main story is quite good and has decent versatility depending on your race and character origin choice. If you are more PvP oriented, you can skip all that and jump straight to max lvl and duke it out in various arenas, or take part in World vs. World for greater scale PvP battles.

GW2 has some unique races and fun classes to play and experiment with.

I highly recommend trying it out if you are looking for a nice, stable and not too ""grindy"" MMORPG.

I would recommend that anyone who still enjoys playing after their ""free"" mount trial expires buy at least the HoT/PoF expansions, if they can. While there are ways to stretch the mount trial out, when you don't have it you notice the absence. The mail attachment and auction house restrictions also bite pretty hard, especially if you like to be a team player and share things. 

Full disclosure - played on another ""unlocked"" client since launch. While I don't like the FTP restrictions I understand the rationale for them, and think they reduce the danger of free accounts becoming gold seller hell.

As an aspiring indie game developer I often think about games and their design and when I think about this game it seems to do pretty much everything right. Leveling up feels very good: there was never a moment while leveling my character to 80 that I felt bored or unsure of what to do or what the perks of my next level would be. The game made sure I knew what I could look forward to a few levels from now up to ten levels from now.

There's no concept of a ""fetch quest"" in the sense that you repetitively fetch items and mindlessly bring them to NPCs. There are collection achievements in the pursuit of which you will collect many items but there's typically some lore flavor text or otherwise story motivated reason to fetch the things and bring the things to the person who asked it of you.

There are 9 unique classes (called a profession in the game's parlance) each with 3 distinct sub-professions that truly redefine the playstyle of the core class. I expected the Guardian to play like a paladin but I was surprised to learn that the Dragonhunter has ranged capabilities, the Firebrand is focused on decimating enemies with flames and the Willbender has the ability to dual wield swords and decimate enemies with flames rendered by the sheer force of their will. The other professions have similar interesting, game play defining subclasses at their disposal.

The final point I will make, but far from the least, is that I truly feel like the game respects my time. It doesn't beg me for a subscription. The ""battle pass"" (the Wizard's Vault) is free. It merely presents me with the choice to purchase the expansions and I'm free to enjoy the game as I choose. If I grind out the gear I will always be as powerful as I was when I logged out last (balance patches aside). Nothing in the expansions outmodes something I have and only provides a new way to experience the game.

I have played the game for almost 400 hours at the time of this review and I plan to play this game for the foreseeable future.

This game has something for everyone, no matter how casual or hardcore the player. You can simply log in every day for daily login rewards and do nothing else, and still be gaining something on your account. If you care to do more, you can, but it's not required. Even those who only have 30 minutes to play on workdays will find something worthwhile to do!

For those with more play time, there are a plethora of achievement collections and activities to be done in PvE, WvW, and PvP. If you only prefer one of those play modes, you can get almost everything you need to gain serious quality of life upgrades.

Gw2 is the greatest MMO in terms of respecting your time. The gear treadmill from other MMO's may appeal to some, but for me, I like the fact that I can jump in and out of Gw2 every few months, and be no less powerful than when I left off. As mentioned, I have a LOT of hours in this game - you'd think I'd be out of things to do, right? Nope. 

If you're an avid achievement hunter, you'll be playing this game until you die. 

If you're a casual/social player, you'll find lots of wonderful people who enjoy the exact same sort of game-play.

If you're a fan of MMO end games (or just more difficult content like me), Gw2 is a little on the sparce side of content drops. But what it does offer right now will still give you quite a few hundreds of hours of enjoyment. The game has raids, non-traditional dungeons called Fractals, scaling up to 100 (think mythic+), Strikes (basically smaller, self contained raid instances) and more.

If you're a fan of massive open world PvP zergs, we've got that too!

The game is free to play with some decent restrictions, but the expansions are buy once own forever.

PvP (small scale) and WvW (large scale) for those that like to clash head on with other players.
Fractals, Strikes and Raids for those that like to group up and take on the developers best instanced content.

+ Great story & Well Crafted World

+ By far the friendliest MMORPG community I've ever experienced. 

+ Unique Build and Combat system

+ Fun group and Open World content

+ Very casual MMO (You could stop playing for a long time and still not feel ""behind"")

+ Beautiful Customization, mounts & style options

+ Great Buy to Play model (worth every penny)

(I could list more but you don't have time for my ramblings.)


CONS:

- Anet's support is very lacking. Not bad but slow with some things.

- The grind to unlock some things is repetitive and annoying.

- PvP is bad (WvW is ok though)

I went on to other parts of the map and started helping a trader get along their route with the bull, within seconds multiple all max level accounts started killing anything around without a chance to even get close, I wish I could say this was the last time it happened but everywhere I went I felt mobbed by people trying to either be helpful or trying to kill things before I got there on purpose.

Fair warning - think whether having to play skillfully instead of stomping people with farmed gear, is your cup of tea. GW2 requires you to gain knowledge and work on your gaming skills, you can't just equip +100 smasher of n00bs and run around one-shotting everyone and everything. You have to actually learn the game.

On top of that - vast and lively world, great storytelling, AMAZING voice acting I never saw in any other MMO. Lot's of events, activities, PvE wise, PvP wise, minigames, jumping puzzles, absolute ton of collectibles... It's just a gigantic box of fun :)

The ""killer feature"" - GW2 progression is mostly horizontal. It's not about grinding months to be relevant in multiplayer activities. It's about finishing the tutorial (getting lvl 80 :D), buying some gear, and then being relevant in various activities you can join. This is the polar opposite of games like Black Desert Online (for example), where you progress mostly vertically and it can take months to be able to participate on even ground. I personally find that very much to my liking and I feel like we have been taught by the gaming industry it's all about vertical progression and gear grinding and nothing else make sense. Well, vertical progression is not going to give you much fulfillment over time, because when the numbers become big, you lose sense of improvement as you can no longer distinguish when your damage becomes even higher :). The second biggest downside of that approach is the ever growing and shaking balance between skills and classes. Of course it's not perfect if you stop increasing max level cap and gear rarity, but it's much better. All in all, I think this is what makes GW2 unique and lovely.",1671315529,1671329013,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then I spend some money to buy the ""legendary edition"" I'm 40 levels in and I think to myself ""hey, if I use this level 80 boost I can play around with all my abilities on this class!"" And then, every single time I gain experience the game shows a popup that I need to stop whatever I'm doing and go do this one specific storyline quest to unlock masteries or something, that I don't care about and will never care about. Basically I got burned out of 40 levels on a character by buying a level boost.

So I quit the game for a couple years and come back with a new account on steam. I buy some gems because I want to get some of this new stuff! Hey that armor set looks cool! The armor set is a ONE TIME USE that unlocks for my wardrobe which requires paid, real money, transmutation charges for each piece of clothing that I want to change, even for ones that I spent real money on(yes I know about outfits, those are inflexible). Then I find out that my account has been flagged because I spent money on the game and for the last couple days my ""purchase has been in review"" which means that I can't use anything on the auction house and say... buy a larger than 4 slot bag.

This is a fun game, I'm having fun playing it, but every time I have ever spent money on it the game slaps me in the face and calls me an idiot. Here you spent money on the game, have a popup that shows up EVERY TIME YOU GAIN EXPERIENCE, ENJOY. Here you spent money to buy gems?

WoW has always been boring compared to this (at least a decade ago it was okay until hit max level and then there really was nothing to do except same dungeons day after day so crowds gather to hang out in front of the bank and auction house because they are bored). Perfect World was better than WoW (doesn't look so great today). ESO was good until it went F2P. At their best none of those ever came close to GW2. GW2 quickly became what others wanted to be and even WoW has borrowed from it where it can. The only other MMO I really love is in development right now where I have been testing a long time.

It's less grindy than others. It keep s things interesting with level scaling so you don't get totally bored when you have to go in a lower level or go to help a friend or guild mate. It's constantly expanding over time. It's always had some great developers. You can play every day or take weeks, months, or years off and come back and continue on without a problem.

I played it briefly a couple years ago off steam, but didn't stick to it because of other time commitments.   The main reason I like it is that the shop is not in my face. I can easily ignore it.  Unlike a lot of other F2P MMOs I don't feel gimped in the inventory department by ignoring the cash shop.  I had plenty of bags just dropping out in the world.

Things I like 

1.  Combat is easy to pick up and intuitive.  Being in water, you get a different set of attacks based on aquatic weapons.

2,  Your attacks change based on the weapons you have equipped which makes for a variety of game play and similar to Elder Scrolls Online you can swap 2 weapon sets.    I play warriors so wont speak about casters.  I did Necromancer when I played the first time but I barely remember it.

3.  Horizontal progression rather than the usual boring vertical where you keep growing in power.  Once you cap, the gear you have is the gear you have and rather than being like WoW where you are constantly chasing gear you work on completionism (playing the game rather than redundant game play loop of chasing gear through the same set of dungeons only to have said gear get obsolete next patch/expansion)

4,  Character creator is decent, the races are interesting enough except for one but more on that later.

5.  Everything you do gives XP and exploration is rewarded.

6.  You have a personal storyline per starter zone/race and I enjoy it a lot more than FF14 because in GW2 they respect my time rather than force me to sit through long cut scenes for a story I do not really give a crap about.  The GW2 personal storyline is entertaining and gives you something to do rather than the FF14 style that basically treats you like a movie audience.

7.  Free form enough where if you just want to go around murder hoboing you can.  The ""quests"" are really just suggestions and the main story quest can be done at your pace.  Unlike FF14 that forces you to progress in it to get to the content you actually want to play.

8.  Cash shop is easy to ignore and never in your face the way Elderscrolls online is.  It's there for those who want to do that sort of thing, but for those of us not into such things it is as if it does not exist.

Cons.

1,  Race choice is limited.   There are two human races, regular humans and Norns who are basically giant nordic types.  Giant is meant literally.  A human female standing next to a Norn female she is like more than half my height. I play human, my first time playing I played Nord and Sylvari.   Sylvari are like ""elves"" more on them later.  There is also Charr, they are sort of like if you mixed a minotaur with a tiger.  Then there are the Asura.  Basically huge eared WoW gnomes.  So 5 races, 2 of which are really the same thing (humans and Norns).

2.  Sylvari are cabbage people.  They are basically the ""elves"" but they are so heavily plant based in looks that  to me they are visually unappealing.  My take on it is if you are going to put in an Elf race, do it right.  Just take the page from Tolkien and do them right.  I like Elves, I want to play an elf, not a cabbage person with elf like qualities.  Even the name, Sylvari is elven.   I hate when game designers try to be fresh and original by ruining elves.  They are perfect as they are depicted in traditional fantasy media -- they are elves after all.  If you want to play an Elf and you like Elf stuff, this game wont deliver.  They should have just called the race something planty like Greenfolk or Leafae (get it leaf fae) and I would not have this petty complaint.

3.  Dwarves are mentioned but there are no playable dwarves.   

4.  When there are few players in your area the game spams you to let you know so you can move to a more crowded mapset.   Most mobs, and ALL trash mobs are easily soloable so having more players in your area while leveling just slows you down.  Let those of us who actually enjoy playing with few other players around enjoy the experience.  After all, Sigurd didn't have any friends killing Fafnir.  Yeah, yeah, I get that MMOs are Multiplayer.  But most people like to solo play them anyways.   Oh, and when they spam the message about few players, they give you an hour to accept moving to another world server instance with a buff.  If you decline it, they move you anyways after that hour.  Because waiting around for respawns is so fun, NOT.",1661887083,1661887083,True,3,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

The best part is, when I decide to take a week off or a month off or a day off, I'm not suddenly behind when I decide to hop back in. Worst case scenario, I missed out on some great sale or a new cool skin they put in. I love how casual the game is, I love that it doesn't hold your hand and tell you what you have to do, it just suggests you do things.

I've read wiki pages for so many things I probably have a pve content mini-encyclopedia in my head but at least there's an in-game command to /wiki whatever thing you're trying to figure out. (Example: /wiki Not So Secret) It just opens your browser to the wiki page searching the thing you entered.

Oh and I will say, as I came to it off Blade and Soul, I very highly recommend the ""Toggle Action Camera"" setting in the Control Options tab of the options menu. Just set a keybind for it and turn it on and try it out. You can always click the keybind again to turn it off. It makes your mouse your camera without any click drag and your Left Mouse Button (LMB) function as your 1 skill button. Note: please go through all your settings or watch a youtube video about gw2 settings, you can customize the game to be played in whatever way is most comfortable for you so just take the time to do that immediately.

I set up my steam account as a secondary account and plan to build it up over time and maybe support my main account with money and materials I guess. I know plenty of other players do that but this is my first time trying it out.

Game on folks and give this one a shot, it's got content for all sorts of play-styles and no pressure to do any particular game-mode. I know folks that only play world-vs-world or only player-vs-player because that's what they love.
