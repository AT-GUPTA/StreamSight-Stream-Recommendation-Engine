Everything in the game is all about unlocking and recruiting your troops. But once you unlock them the fun seems to stop. Why? The only thing you can play is siege and its cross servers which seems to be laggy and some times not sure of death. NA should vrs NA alone and bots should fill gaps. Game is also lacking in choice of map players should be able to select favorite maps or choose if they are offense or defense. You always basically play the same 3 maps when their is tons of maps. Whats the point of season 17 if you never get to play the map.. Side battles never make progress on your unit quest their for they are useless like the areana. Second thing that made me almost quit twice and third time I probably will is field battles Que is so broken. I have it figured out if it says 2 mins that means endless you will never get thrown in battles. I been qued a few times in field battles for over 2 hours. It should have a timer on it of 5 minutes maximum as soon a someone ques up it should be ticking and if players fill the slots it can start. If only one player fill the slots it should start no matter what at five minutes. My favorite thing I enjoy most in this game is pvp field battles but they seem to never start. Nothing is more rewarding then really learning your units after unlocking them.

Game is pretty fun. Leveling up your troops to increase their effectiveness is nice. Like the progression of getting better armed troops is good too. Look forward to this game being better optimized. Have to set graphics to low to keep it playable while on The Division 2 I can set it to high. Biggest issue I have is the match making. There is no level segregation after 30, so you could be lvl 31 and be matched against some 150 levels higher than you with high end troops and just get destroyed. Even in a match with 20 people, that one high level player will most of the time equal a win for that team. Classes def need some balancing. There are a few that are just way too OP.

However the company behind this game ravages the fun of the game with an increadibly predatory loot box system. Where everytime new content comes out it says you can 'technically unlock SOME of the content' with hours of play, or you could basically pay for the game's original price but monthly to get access to all the content they come out with. They also hide much of their content through RNG, meaning that even if you spend real money on a loot box, there's like a .1 percent chance of getting the item advertised.  People have to spend an average of 300-500$ to get a legendary drop. 

Overtime each 'season' that has come out has been getting less and less content, and yet it still take the same amount of time (or money) to progress through it.  

The game has an open world system that is practically pointless. The whole game still feels like it's in beta after years. What was once a feeling of 'can't wait for the game to finish' has become a realization that this is all the game has. 

And lately the game has been so plagued with server problems, desyncs, and crashes that it's impossible to play a single match without getting kicked from the game. Lag so bad that even though you are moving around and thought you were playing, the game considers you AFK and kicks you.  Strategies have started developing where if you see certain symptoms you close out of the game and relogg because you're just going to be kicked in time once you see them. 

People do pay a lot of money to play this game, but the developers have basically just camped on their current cashflow and have done nothing new with the game lately.

Lag issues, being kicked out of matches for no reason, most of the time, when I am doing well, which got suspicious after a while.  an elitist community that will shun new players from enjoying or even learning the game. and it is only getting worse as player base dwindles. 

Pros:

1.) PvP hero combat is unique and engaging.  Least it is for me.
2.)Cohort system to allow players to play without needing to join a house, and jump into 
     battles without having to get ganked outside, makes it enjoyable to play a cohort for a 
     spell.
3.) Territory wars fun and engaging.
4.) Competitive.  Like extremely competitive.  If you can't roast people who try to roast you for 
     your gameplay, I do not recommend going for this unless you are a masochist or a glutton 
     for pain.
5.) Strong Community that helps people no matter the question you ask, someone will be there to help you.

Cons:

1.) ALL WEAPONS need reworks to work better against gold units that really steal the fun out of the game.

2.) improper unit balancing.   Im sorry....But when you kill a player by pressing one simple x button after a cc or a stunlock, the second the unit even remotely taps your character, you die.

3.) lack of advertisement for the game.  It used to be good but now, I havent seen an Conqueror's Blade advertisements in a long while.  which only hurts the player base.  As more players like me and many others leave to play other titles.

4.) Toxicity can be a problem for some if you aren't able to deal with it.  Like entire simp filled houses hitting you for making one simple comment.  like talking bad about a female player, they will never sleep with, nor would you want to.  Lmao.  

the amount of rage filled enthusiasts who clown on you for making one bad play when they made 20 in one match alone, and house politics of houses from all over hating on new players for joining a house they don't like, effectively making said players leave the game.  Drama that was four seasons back, still a problem today.  I can go on etc etc.  its a pathetic.  

5: Chain-dart and scimitar removes the need for light armor characters in general.  all you see is mauls or poleaxes or longswords.  that is the meta currently and it takes away the fun unless you play these classes.  so don't even think about playing light armor unless you have a solid group that you know you can count on to save you or protect you.",1569877158,1692181436,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

I think I can no longer play this game. There aren't too many things wrong with the game that would cause me to not want to play, but there is one huge problem that plagues this game and is making me stop playing once again.

Not enough people know how to play. You will waste your time playing a siege match just to have about half of your players basically doing nothing, in a game where even one or two AFK's can make a big difference in being able to successfully defend or attack. I took a break a while ago as this was way too common. I had about two weeks of attempting to enjoy a match before I finally gave up for a while. Came back to enjoy it for a couple of weeks, and then T5 unlocks and it is INSTANTLY back to how it was before. 

The game itself is great. When you have hard fought battles, it is an absolute blast. That just doesn't happen anymore. You will watch, especially as a solo player, a slightly organized enemy team absolutely overwhelm everyone since they outnumber everyone. People don't listen to any communication, as you can ping in every match and it seems no one can see it or the minimap. Granted there can be a language barrier as you will match with people from all around the world (Depending on the version they are playing) As there are three different versions of the game that do not get to play together, and are balanced differently.

A thing to take note for anyone who still wants to try the game after this review, it is one of the worst times to start out right now. The slight P2W classes, which aren't that hard to unlock and improve skills on now, are so strong at this moment that you will probably not want to grind them out as everyone you go up against will have it maxed out with some of the best gear they can get.

The game itself is beautiful and there is nothing like it. Completely unique and there will never be another game like this. The problem that will kill this game is that there aren't enough players that know what they are doing. The ones that do are usually in full groups and are put all on the same team.

So, sadly, that is a problem that I don't think can be fixed. They can balance the game to their absolute best, but there aren't enough knowledgeable players to fill up matches. It is only the whales that are keeping it alive currently, and the cross-over event is most likely their last attempt at getting as many people in as possible. Even if successful, the target audience is mostly in the Asia version of the game.

Recent reviews are mixed, which is the lowest I have seen this game reach, and I only see it going further down during this season. I wish the game the best, and I hope to see it flourish soon, but I'm going to jump ship while I'm still only waist deep in water.",1617509880,1679964466,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game mechanics are fun, the matchmaking is good early on, and the open map PVP is a spicy feature. The main thing I would point out however is that early on not being apart of a guild/clan is not an issue. However, once you start to level up and the competition pool gets tougher, you will quickly realize that without a team you will have no chance. Relying on random people to cover your flank and deploy the right units to counter the enemy will leave you battlefield in-effective 90% of the time.

Battle wise, from territory wars, to matchmade battles, the game offers sonething for both types of players, hardcore or otherwise.

I don't play via Steam, I play through the My.com launcher, which is terrible by the way. The game has changed quite a lot since then. However, the one thing that has not changed are the devs and their ability to listen to their player-base.

So I want to love this game. But it's simply impossible. Whether it's the fact the developers are stuck in a loop of releasing new units that are progressively more powerful than the last. Pushing players to spend money to unlock them. Basically paying to win.

Lets' start with the launcher. The launcher is terrible. Not only does it download only through peer to peer (torrent), but the launcher no matter your CPU, will use up 100% of your PC resources to download any updates. And My.com is a Russian company. Meaning they collect all your personal information as well for the Russian government.

Then there's the poorly done mechanics and skills. It is entirely possible to perma stun players depending on the weapon you use. Which makes certain weapons never used because they have either no stun abilities or no ability to prevent or break out of stuns. And since the game is slowly dying they match players from all across the world. So you are very likely to be stuck constantly in games with people from across the world. Causing immense amounts of desync and lag from those players. Resulting in you performing an ability on a player only for it not to register on their end and they just stun lock you to death. And don't even think about dodging, it doesn't avoid anything.

There's also the issue of match making. The game does not create balanced teams. It simply doesn't. You will find yourself matched up against players that have hundreds if not thousands of levels on you. They have all the best units, best gear, best weapons. You will be outmatched by them because the match maker prioritizes players by their battlepass level and not gear score or skill score.

You also have issues with AI units attacking you through walls. It's most prevalent with ranged units. They some times don't register you're behind a wall and tell the server they have line of sight of you. Resulting in you being 100% hidden but still taking ranged damage.

At least you can skip the tutorials, really the only positive.

But thanks for the free $1000 in premium currency they've given to all the alpha/beta players hoping they'd come back to this dumpster fire.

I heard a lot complaints about this game being p2w, but I like the gameplay so I dip into the game anyway. Yes, I did ran into the same problem as anyone else. I join a guild (or a house, as they call it in this game), get myself into a fief war in open world, and get absolutely destroyed. I met endgame players (most, if not all, of whom are technical noobs that can only flail their weapons and spam keyboard) that would kill me in 2 stray hits and take almost no damage despite getting stun locked by me 23/7. The units that I brought, even though only one tier away from the final units tier, evaporate from a single cavalry charge every time, even the pikemen. As this point, it seem like p2w is the only possible explanation for these phenomenons?

Undeterred, and mostly because I already expected this to happen, I decided to look up how I got rekt. To my surprise, the answers are way too simple. Stats scale by level (by a large margin) and cap at level 100. So if me, a lvl 40 newb, fight a lvl 100+ players I wouldn't stand a chance scratching their armor. Endgame gears, the best of the best gears, I expected to be locked behind either a monetary wall or a huge grind fest. I spent a whole days trying to find where to grind for endgame gears. But it turns out the weapon progression system is very simplified. Your craft gears at the starting safe town, without leaving for the open world to get ganked by endgame players, and that's it. There is a chance you will get end game legendary grade gears from the crafting, and they are end game gears. All the materials are practically free and the core materials drop from most game mode. The game gives you a bunch of mats at the beginning so you can theoretically reroll your account until your start with full legendary set, tho i don't recommend it appears there is not much difference between elite gears (which drop very frequently from crafting) and legendary gears. All you really need to do is get to level 100 to kill people.

That being said, there is a very poor communication between the game and the players. The game didn't tell me any of this. Players can only fight AI before they reach level 100, even though it says pvp, the AI are well masked with random-looking name so most thought they are fighting actual people. So when they finally get to fight actual pvp and experience sudden spike in difficulty, I can imagine that many people would quit the game for it.

This game is very fun though. I have no complain whatsoever gameplay wise. Tho do beware of toxicity. There are like 5%, maybe even less, of people who ever downloaded this game to actually get to the end game to begin with, so there bound to be a lot of elitist-wannabe.",1652381414,1652381414,True,0,1,0.447671025991439819,0,True,False,False

- Great Siege Battles
- fairly quick to jump in and get involved
- Unit point cap helps you stay relevant in battles even if you just have more lower skilled units
- Nice variations of weapons/skills that mix up the game play.
- Open world features if you wish to dive in to the game even further. 

Notes : The Siege and instant matches are amazing but the open world features can take some time to get used to, especially if you are looking for players to join you to do rebel camps in the area.

-DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME-

While Conqueror's Blade has excellent combat, fun Pvp and offers some unique gameplay options the customer service staff apparently has no problems stealing your money. By this I mean if you pay for anything in the My.Com Marketplace, Pre-Order packages or even packages on steam and their system fails to grant it to you which apparently happens regularly there is a good chance their support team will ignore any proof of purchase you have and claim you don't have it despite the fact that you may even provide screenshot proof of payment. This has happened to both myself and 2 other friends.

The support staff is absolutely awful. We provided proof of payment and screenshots and they closed our tickets instead of handling the problem. They effectively scammed us. We put in multiple tickets.

In reality, it is a few hundred hours.


THE GOOD THE BAD THE UGLY 
Note: I had to buy the game from the Conquerors Blade website and  get a Steam refund - read on to find out why.

GOOD:
This is probably one of the most unique games I have ever played. It is a combination of games such as Mount and Blade, Warhammer Total War, Albion, and others, except better.
Basically, it is a MMORPG with both strategic and tactical elements.
You start off just like in a MMORPG, looking at your character with all the usual features.
You also start off doing quests in the city you start off in after selecting a region as well after the tutorial which is very good.
Where things get exciting, is that as you do the usual MMORPG things with your character you begin to realize the quests have a very specific reasons to do them and the game is clear to point them out.
You earn XP, gear, bronze, silver, rewards, honor, i.e. a whole bunch of stuff you will need for various things such as not only upgrading your character in gear, skills , and stats but also to create your army units, their weapons, even their armor and skills etc etc.
You will start with AI battles, then Field Battles, then Siege Battles, then Expeditions etc etc all in a very heavy populated game with each player having several units in each battle. This makes for huge epic battles with on average 15 players and hundreds of their soldiers in a beautiful setting of citys, landscapes, and forts etc etc.
Even on low settin gs for my 10 year old PC the game looks and runs great.
There are Houses/Guilds that players can create and join and form Alliances.
There are even terrortory wars.
in all, this is a fun yet challenging game that will hold your interest and immersion.
Also, that is just half the game, the other half is leaving your city and traveling wherever you want or need to go and the view will zoom in and out to your hearts content.
Trade, War, Economy, Unit creation and management Strategy and Tactics, RPG, MMORPG, epic scale battles, Sieges, etc etc etc it is all there.
Here is the rest of the GOOD:

Great Tutorial and very intuitive game play.
Good default graphics.
Game runs on my 9 year old i7 PC (no upgrades) very well with many players etc
Vast open world.
Fair response from Developers in Forum.
Can click on names in quest text to automatically path find and move to your quest NPCs
Large units
Cool attire


BAD:
Pricing and buying communications are poor, if you buy the Explorer or Adventurer pack on Steam and your upgrade pack from the CB website and then try to get the discount price for an upgrade (price difference) as advertised on the CB website you will be charged FULL PRICE.
Only way to get the discount is to buy both your packs from the CB website.
Not sure if buying both from Steam gives a discount.
Also, if you purchase the game on Steam you still have to use the GameCenter.My.com site UI, and you won't be able to play unless you login at least once on the games website before trying to play your Steam version.

UGLY:
The game is designed with a carrot stick approach; its fun, but you will chase the carrot while being tempted to spend real money for Sovereigns.
The game is to a degree P2W, so when you realize what aspects of the game are, you will start spending more money.


CONCLUSION:
Play with friends and form or join a House. . There is so much to learn about the game it will keep you all busy. Form a House and have fun.",1559253803,1612434194,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

- Unbalanced units and classes
- MY.COM
- Constantly telling you to spend money with they cannot even fix there game
- Constant disregard for the issues in the game
- Events not working properly
- ELEPHANT MOUNT. Something that was promised in the beta then told us were not getting it even though people bought it

- Horrible customer support. Not once have I gotten anything from them even if I bought it, showed proof and I get told sorry we cannot do anything for you.
- 20 tick rate servers. Units firing and the bullets going through them. Cavalry rushes going through units. Etc.

-------------

2) Matchmaking balance needs work

4) The company always comes first - oh and then maybe the community?
5) No room for negative comments in regard to the game handling or NA support (Non-existent)

Short Review:
I'd suggest if you are coming into this game - Be prepared to grind. This is a grind game to its core with little forgiveness for failure. Fun game with great rewards however content becomes quite lack luster after months of grinding like any MMO game. I suggest pacing yourself if you wish to truly enjoy this game.

Think Dynasty Warriors mixed with Mount & Blade, then the fact that your fighting actual people, rather than AI.

Battles are intense and require strategy and actual thought... cleverness is rewarded with impact in battles and sometimes victory. Duels can be interesting, does require you to have an understanding on what your skills and character can and can't do.

There IS a kind of pay to win... but that is subject to personal thought... you can buy ""silver coins"" which is the trading currency between players and the auction house (so someone who buys packs to get silver can buy better gear than someone who doesn't, much faster) but eh, gear doesn't make a HUGE difference anyway. Armours and weapons that can be bought with premium currency are all COSMETIC and have no effect (except some of them look pretty cool).

Overall, the game is interesting and will keep you entertained for a while (maybe until you get bored of the grind). There are ""houses"" which are basically clans that can establish giant nut-cup alliances and make territory wars to fight over resources and cities... clans also get rewarded for owning territory (though I can't tell you about the rewards at the current date... in beta though, the rewards were inadequate)

The siege battles are stunning in how well they work. The balance of units is pretty good, and the game is fun. I overall like the game, though there are some flaws.

Here are the downsides: The game does have power creep. The new season 3 units are a little too overpowered. Just give the pavise crossbows reload times. Meanwhile, the game does seem to require money to pass certain points. It also massively favors the people who have played a while. Tier 5 troops outstripe everything else to a massive degree, and when you get to the level where you can unlock them it can be hard to gain honor because everyone else has them.

Having said that...
The armor repair system sucks- You can repair, but durability goes down. You then have to recondition the item costing more resources in a already deprived financial mess.
Your lost troops must be  replenished  with kits- some kits you just cannot make, because of the complexity- availability of the materials. This results in  lowered  effectiveness of the troops.

The game is SOMEWHAT pay to win. The best gear takes a long time to collect the silver needed to buy, UNLESS you buy items to sell in the AH- 

During battles, STUNS run rampant- pure bs when it comes to certain classes. A tank should be permitted to be just that- a damage soaking character that relies on others  to kill the opponents. In this game , like I said- stuns run wild. You get stunned at the same time you wish to use a skill, you lose that skill for the duration of the stun PLUS the time it takes to get off cool down. This equals an UNFAIR tactical advantage to someone with better internet and or comp.

The present map is rapidly boiling down to several power house alliances. This creates a who cares about this game attitude . The map needs to be enlarged. More area to conquer would breathe new life into the game.
Each alliance should get (1) one piece of land they can never lose. This would permit the alliance to collect coin and resources,. This would encourage players to play- to stay,

In open world, there are entirely too many aggressive rebels scouring the land for easy coin. You get done with one battle and get chased down for a second. Sure  you can give them 300- 1500 bronze, but after several encounters, the loss of bronze begins to sting.

My favorite class is Long sword and shield- the ONLY healing class at the moment. The game devs FORGOT to award the healers at the end of the battles. You heal troops ( not always your own) you get NOTHING for doing so. In a multitude of games and in many genres, the healers get their due rewards- THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE.

As I said in the opening lines- this game is fun- it could be better- it needs to change.
Giving it a thumbs down as the frustration level outweighs the fun factor.

Although, it is too early to give proper review, I think Conquerors blade does deserve chance. 
Surely, there are bugs, crashes, server instability, but it just launched recentely. There are balancing and matchmaking issues also, but you cant say that game isnt fun. Some concepts like action house macro user abusers need serious attention (buying off stuff like skill books so you will never see them on market, because other macro users will instantly buy them, etc.). 
Overall, I like the combat, although the economy is too punishing for you making mistakes, especially, in expeditions and in iron mode (which is not that much rewarding to be worth it). 


My biggest concern is actually, economical side of things. Biggest clans and alliances just reapes too much and forbides to harvest resouorces to others while other clans might overprice shitty resource deposites. This increases their progress too much and punishes non-clan or worse clan and actually caps their  capabilities too much. 

Would I recommend it - yes, even in its current state. To be honest, there are almost no games left like this in the market also and people becoming angry with the buying sovereigns and packs (which I do agree is a pain in the ..., but it works despite ppl saying it doesnt - it just needs seperate manual almost, lol ) and adding them into your character and other screwups.

That being said you will need to out smart and out move your enemy.

Politics on this game are huge so if you are into that then you will fit right into any ""house/clan"" 

This game does not have any ""pay to win"" aspects to it, the only things that people might consider ""pay to win"" is some garbage stater units that people only get for the 10% XP boost other then that they are pretty useless so you don't have to worry about that

To be honest with you the only reason this game is not super popular right now is because the owners are awful at advertising the game, other then a few YouTube videos a year ago the game has not seen much publicity

- Great game
- Tactical 
- Free to play

The combat in this game is just... Bad.  I will say, it is somewhat improved since I last played. People no longer move after I knock them down. However, I still find there is a massive problem with hits connecting. Getting hit by an enemy who isn't in your range also seems to be a massive problem. The server which I use, says my ping is 57. These should not be issues I am having. I have great internet speeds.

The game also runs rather poorly in my opinion, and the graphics aren't the greatest. People say it looks better than Tiger Knights, but I beg to differ. Tiger Knights looked great at extreme graphics. The difference, is that this game doesn't have massive boosts in the graphics depending on what setting you are on, where as Tiger Knights lowest settings looked like trash, so people with ancient computers could still play. ALso, people say this game runs better. I have a new and better computer than the one I once had, and I never had issues playing Tiger Knights on my old Computer.  I do have problems playing this game though. It just randomly lags at times. 

The combat in this game isn't creative. Not even remotely good infact. A good 90% of the skill comes from moving out of combat and doing a running charge, followed up by certain abilities.  The Balance is horrible. And most importantly, it just isn't fun to play. Your units feel like garbage. Often you'll find that units are either to weak, or very annoying when you get stuck in them. It does feel slightly improved from what it used to be, but they don't feel as impactful as they did in Tiger Knights. Also, if you want to properly command your units you have to use them for ages. Which kind of ruins the purpose. I much prefer Tiger Knight's approach, where you could order your troops with every ability they had, and you upgraded them over time with gear. The current system just makes them feel like crap, because by the time they are useful, you've probably moved on to the upgraded version, if not before hand. 


All in all, this is a poor man's Tiger Knights. The one upgraded aspect was the open world. Unfortunately I hear lots of bad things about changes mad to the open world aspect of the game.  I really wanted to like this game, but it isn't even a good game on it's own. I can't really recommend anyone spending money on this trash.


Edit: Oh, and I forgot to mention. They added bots to the matchmaking, which completely ruin the game. Some of the worst AI I've ever seen.",1558418899,1570498030,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Core experience and enjoyment for me is around the collection of Units into your army, leveling them up to make them stronger, while customizing them with different talents. I would say it's much like Pokemon in that collection sense + multiplayer mount and blade. 

I think that any who is interested in this game should give it a go especially since it's free to play. No harm in trying it out.
____________

Now why is it that I'm posting this as a negative review even after sticking to the game for 700+ hrs?
That is because of decisions from both publisher and developers are having a negative impact on both the community and the game. While in a public post the developers based in SEA have acknowledged the poor reviews of the game and are working towards improvements, what they are doing is contradictory to what is being said.

Brief history -
Game is being developed by developers based in SEA region for Asian / Chinese gaming community.

Previously EU/NA had a custom version of the base client licensed to my.com to be published in mentioned regions with the intention of having it bespoke to our gaming culture, less grind and appropriate prices for store items, no P2W. However this proved to be too hard to manage for the small developer team and the decision was made to unify with the Asian client. 

While this has caused the game to be more up to date, it has brought with it the negative following: 

- More than x5 the grind time as was previous to our version. EG: 1 middle tier unit takes anywhere from 3 weeks to over a month + of dedicated channeling to get to maximum level.

- Even lower drop rates for epic gear (feels like 1% - 0.05% chance, have not had a purple drop now for over a month).
 
- Premium units that are almost as good as regular units that give you more rewards as well, like a small premium similar to World of Tanks priced at €30-40+, cosmetic costumes are north of €20.

- Storage limited to 1 page of space. Pay €10 to increase storage by 1/20 the space.

----

As the build is now unified the development of this game can only be targeted towards one audience, and it looks as though that will be towards the Asian/Chinese values of gaming and not EU/NA values. I expect store prices to increase, base values of a F2P player to be decreased and locked behind a paywall such as the storage fiasco, and the game to just get harder to achieve things, more grind. 

________________________________

Secondly is the handling of the game publication in EU/NA regions by my.com. 

Compared to the build in SEA that received updates on a weekly to even daily basis, my.com has decided for whatever reason though most speculate it's laziness to only allow updates through once a month. This means that the community often has to live through infuriating bugs and such for a long period before they are resolved and the game feels as though it's just limping to survive until it's next update. 

My.com have also proven to be incompetent in many ways such as barebones / flat out wrong patch notes and terrible communications. EG: There will be downtime today in 1 hour but doesn't happen until 3 hours later etc. The team and support do not play their own game they are publishing and have zero ideas on issues many players have.
There have been instances that players have banned for ""false reports."" For example one player got banned after getting a hate report; for Friendly Fire which is not possible with equipment being used but the support team wouldn't know this since they don't know anything about the game. 
Another is being told by support that certain items are ingame but have a low drop chance, yet when communication is opened with a SEA dev we are told that are not actually implemented yet causing players to waste time/effort trying to acquire items that are not actually ingame yet.

Because of the way My.com has handled the game on EU/NA much of the community has grown to hate them, and instead of them trying to improve the relationship with the community they have instead taken the approach of radio silent. Community Managers have effectively disappeared and there no communication as was before in the early days of release. 

We as players in EU/NA have no influence to change development to be better towards our gaming culture. No communication from publishers and developers cater towards Asian where this is less ethics to get more money. We have to live the game as designed for these audiences. As a long time player the game has gone downhill since the start and I do not see any good future going forward. Expect this to turn into one of those games saddled with ever increasing microtransactions going forward that we all know too well.

If you want to unlock anything good you need premium which is used even when you don't play the game. How do you get premium? Pay. They changed things that didn't need to be changed. Before you could buy basic materials for copper. Now you have to buy everything with silver but yet if you want to sell them it wants to sell it for copper and at an insulting price might i add. This game is honestly like a slap in the face at about every turn. They changed so much and made everything such a grind that if you don't pay into it you're going to get mad. Also like to add this because i just found this out. If you want to but something for copper but maybe don't have enough but you do have some silver and want to use that the exchange rate is exactly the same. So if you want to spend 4k copper on something but don't have enough so use silver it will cost 4k silver. WHO TF MADE THIS ECONOMY. It's insane how superior the betas versions of this game were to what we have now. People will come on here and say it'll all lies you can earn it all in game and yea that's true at a stupid slow rate. The most you will get for rewards is 1-5 of whatever crafting item you might need when the odds are if you're over 50 you need hundreds of them so have fun with that. And yea you can earn silver but without premium you earn a lot less.

They managed to break their walking simulator because it takes longer to load the map than it takes for rebels to attack you... and they can do it while you're stuck in the loading screen, so if you get caught by rebels you're allowed to move only once you've killed all groups around you.

K so on to the actual game review anyways:
Conquerers blade is a combat orientated MMORPG with a lot of mount and blade qaulities but does not come close to the glory of MnB, 


+Siege battles are amazing, ranged combat is awesome first thought it was hitmarker garbage but the projectiles actually move and exist. Love siege equiptment operation, hwacha cannon grapeshot. All very well done same with longbow and gun.

+Siege battles very well done, you can tell your troop to interact with items and climb ladders and stuff like that.

+Ranged Characters seem like fun but also seem really broken due to kiting and everyone having the same movement speed.


+The first bit of the game REALLY sucks, but it gets progressively better. Barely any skills, weapon locked to 1 weapon at beggining with no option to switch if you pick a bad one 

-The resource gathering system is stupid, large houses easily get acess to better units because you can literally turn off resource sharing, what happens when 1 house conquers the a whole region and tells the neutrals to get bent?

-TW is region locked meaning multiple houses have multiple accounts across the 4 regions and the big ones already gobbled everything up with the last tribes clinging tot heir last settlement fighting someone x10 their size with 10x the resources.

-The combat feels really meh, all weapons follow the same combo scheme (all have 1 unique attack pattern to each weapon) and the only way to make yourself attack differently is by using skills so basically goes like this:
attack till run out of combo which puts you in basically a stunned animation, if you end up getting hit first use skill to not get stun locked into a combo. After you finish combo you use a skill so you can use combo again without the after combo delay, rinse repeat. I suppose you can also sprint attack to get 1 extra hit in. The only part i really enjoy is hitting from behind does extra damage. Also depending on which weapon you use you will literally stand still while swinging moving slightly forwards because the animation forces you to. Combat feels mechanical and like you are just inputing keys instead of dynamic. Ima try my best: Hit hit hit hit 8 second cooldown skill hit hit hit hit 16 second cooldown skill unless you get hit then you use the 20 second cooldown skill. Get where im going?

-Magically get hit from 60 feet away roll further away still get hit, is it a nodachi bug?

-Blocking seems pointless, forces enemy to use a skill to break your block or it doesnt work at all. Can use it to buy time till your allies get there i guess or to get skill to cooldown but it takes a full second to activate, so even if you block mid attack it doesnt register unless you are blocking before they swung which is beyond stupid.

-Free to play pay to win: you can unlock everything (besides cosmetics) by playing but will have an easier time if you spend money. Theres stable expansions, extra slots for unit(very important because there is gathering units). Exp boosts. Preimium boost +30% ticket = +60% extra exp. Argueable you still have to play the game but on base effeciency if i play 100 matches theres someone out there that has got 130 simply from modifiers if not more. Vault keys are also very pay to win, if you subscribe you get like 15 vault keys a week. Every vault i have opened has had a shitload of items and 2.5k-3k in silver.


-Fighting people that are friends = impossible, one guy can just take shield hold block meanwhile the other guy attacks right through his friend, yeah realistic fucking spear that goes through your friend, sure be nice to have that kind of mystic gear back in the day. Same with arrow boy. Should atleast stop the projectile if you shoot your friend. You can literally stand inside of eachother

-Theres not really anything for cav, you can tell your men to charge but you yourself have no skills on horseback maybe i should try different weapon? I tried glaive and it had a circular sweeping attack on horse. Spear had charge. Guess it would be OP but i feel horse has low hp maybe i have poop horse.

-poor matchmaking, why am i getting matched with people lvl 100? Low player base maybe so maybe not their fault

-Auction house search bar doesnt do a damn thing, cant arrange according to name price or anything, very poorly implemented. Infested with bots cant buy a damn thing.

-Territory battles are only during scheduled times so if you  have a job during these hours you miss out on one of the biggest features of the game.

-The stat system is complete trash, you can do 80% damage to someone and some douche come and KS your kill.

-The launcher plays videos after you launch the game. WTF. No wonder peoples complain their game runs like shit you got shitty launcher thats probably drawing most of the resources.

-Crashes midgame straight to desktop with no error report or anything. Try to join back in ""security check failed"". Finally get in my troops are depleted and any siege i used during battle is wasted yet i dont get fuck all for rewards. Thanks!

-They keep saying they post their times and schedules in obvious places. One would be your discord, you have no channel in there. On your website you literally have to go to artcile 165 or some shit just to get a schedule. Like your not even trying and you say you are? Literal piece of shit.

-Make friends or have friends, game is unplayable solo. Being in a house with an alliance doesnt seem to help unless you land into a house that cares. Basically use you to do fief quests so they dont have to spend requestion tokens. Gives good amount of honour(exp) and a rare kit, not the greatest reward.

-Cant change armour mid battle. Means if you wanna play archer you are going to be archer whole time (male). Annoying on siege when you lose ground.

Now for some good, the game looks really nice if your PC can run it on max settings, and even on Medium settings (like i run on) it still looks pretty nice, the RPG aspect gives it a nice flavour and allows you to add your own bonuses to your teammates in your group or even house (if you made or are a part of a house) and even to an Alliance (if you ever get that far) I still have quite a lot to learn but the 24 some odd hours (at the time i'm writing this) i have learned a lot and figured out where i shine and where i don't shine, where i can win a fight, and where i could win a fight, and where i would utterly get creamed. this game has a learning curb and i do recommend it to people who want to have fun with there friends, but it's learning curb can be a turnoff for some or even many. but overall, this game is fun, can be very entertaining, has its issues but i mean come on, it's a beta (at the time i am writing this) meaning this game isn't finished yet, there are even atleat 2-3 different soldiers that are there, but not yet in game (again at the time i am writing this) I recommend and give it a solid 7.8/10 especially with friends and a good 7/10 without friends.

I did, but I learned that other Regions would open up during Open Beta, so I chose to wait. This was a good decision.

Game has a ton of potential, but I'll go through the pros and cons.

Pros -

Combat feels great and enjoyable, and significantly satisfying to fight other players.
Most weapons are relatively balanced - they all have strengths and weaknesses and it really feels like some things are more-or-less skill based.
Even low tier troops can feel marginally impactful against higher tier troops.
World Map is pretty expansive, and territory wars are very cool and fun to engage in.
Battles themselves are incredibly fun - massive fights between armies that don't take too long either - max I've ever been in was about 20 minutes, typically never longer than 10-15.
F2P, without much in the way of P2W Elements

Cons -
Troops are 'locked' to certain regions, making them significantly more expensive in other regions that are not available to them. This is a downside because the Eastern Regions (Maoyang and Liugeng(SP)) have access to virtually everything, while the Western Regions of Osteria and Ungverija don't even have half the same units - this is exceptionally irritating because the absolute best Melee Units in the game are not available to Osteria and Ungverija.

Lots of small Quality of Life things that aren't implemented, but should be - such as Trading, being able to directly invite your friends to your House, the crafting system needs to be overhauled and a few other minor things that are irritating, but not gamebreaking.

Servers are unstable and have frequent spikes of lag and difficulty in gameplay, sometimes resulting in your particular round of Battle crashing and giving you a leaver penalty for ten minutes.

Upon reaching level 30, you are now part of the High Level Bracket. This means you can and will be put up against higher level individuals who have better gear and better troops than you. You will be at a disadvantage - however, in my experience, this will not be too much of a detriment to your team. You can still be useful and helpful in many cases, but it can be pretty demoralizing.

Smaller Clans can have difficulty in 'breaking out' in more active Regions - there's a metric cockton of large clans in bigger regions, and more forming in the smaller Regions. Gaining Prestige is slow and difficult - rightfully so - but the issue comes down to the fact that you will be facing larger, stronger, more experienced players and this can be pretty difficult in many cases, but doable if your House is good.

Houses and Alliances cannot have spaces in their names. Why? This is dumb. Change it.

Marketplace is crazy stupid and people use Bots to buy up the skill pages, which are a requirement for Ultimates, which are almost key on many Weapons to make them function at higher levels. Trading needs to be implemented for the game to survive, 100%

South American Servers need to be made to properly separate NA from SA. Frankly, SA players are frustrating to play against because of their typically extreme lag and poor behavior. SA players are notorious trolls for a reason. Quarantine them to their own server. 

-- Verdict?

It's free, fuckin' see for yourself. I like the game and I think it has a ton of potential. I'm optimistic for the future, even if that optimism is slowly waning. I'm eager to see the game to grow and I desperately hope the Devs won't abandon it after they made a quick buck.

To address Pay-To-Win Claims, I'm not sure where people are getting that as it doesn't really seem pay to win? I'm on Premium because of my Explorer's Pack, but my F2P friends are able to keep up. I'm ahead of them just because I play more+a 30% XP boost, but it isn't making the game any easier for me really at all.

Hope to see y'all out there - look for Victorious on NA, in the Ungverija Region! I'm always around and usually friendly, and I answer questions a lot!",1560065431,1562222595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[*]Gameplay: 7/10 Ok, gameplay. If you like PvP/PvE, exp gain is normally limited to your first 10 matches of the day. Fair bit of grinding required to promote units, gets really bad if you want to craft advanced units since each unit requires a set of items and depending how large of a squad it is, it can take a long while to gather everything.
[*]Graphics: 6/10 Not terrible, but nothing to write home about.
[*]Sound: 7/10 Decent for what it is
[*]Community: 0/0 Unsure as I have had no interaction with me.
[*]Overall: 6/10 It's got a great concept for a game, but in the long run, I don't really believe it has what it takes to stay afloat for longer than maybe a year or more, especially with players from NA. Game is more a niche, especially where it is trying to make itself feel like an MMO version of Dynasty Warriors and really fails at it.

My biggest gripe in the melee combat, compared to games like mount and blade, age of chivalry, for honor, or mordhau, this game is just a lazy sequence of ""use abilities and hope nothing blocks your dodge"". There is no directional attacking, blocking is not really useful because you can do some anime level dodging by double tapping a directional key, and to top it all off using your regular attack is really just for the units running around not for other players, for them you use abilities and then back off till your abilities are recharged because regular attacks are too slow and too weak to be useful. And regarding dodging don't rely on that unless your in a duel because LITERALLY ANYTHING behind/beside you when you dodge and your character just rolls on the ground without actually moving, and if its an enemy soldier you roll into then you become stuck and can't move in any direction until that trooper dies.

The games market is also a moronically designed system, considering that every MMORPG ever has a market that works I don't understand how my.com actually messed this up. Items listed have a 5 hour delay before they can be purchased because ""it makes the economy stronger"". They mostly claim it makes it stronger becuase it means more stuff in on the market screen but really it just provides a false visual inflation of available goods.
Also on the market there is price fixing. As in the #1 way to ruin a real life economy is implemented in a video game, most notable in this are skill pages (an item you need a LOT of to unlock the best abilities) these are price capped at 10,000 silver which is basically free and means that whenever skill pages are about to pass the 5 hour mark on the market people all stand around furiously clicking on the page hoping to be the one to buy it. TBH if there was no price cap these things would be going for upwards of 200,000 silver but Communist Chinese devs don't like capitalism.

Unit controls are bland and uninteresting M&B Warband has more in depth controls than this and it came out 9 years ago.
The UI in general is terrible (which i'll give a pass for because the game is still in beta)

Regarding ""BuT tHe GaMe Is In EaRlY aCcEsS""

- Game is announced beta phase but will never wipe on release (confirmed by devs) meaning this is indeed the release.

- Anything paid for with real money is bound to a single character, effectively cucking even the people who spent 100€ on the big support pack to support the game, as they opened a new EUW server requiring a new character to play on.

- The auction house is pure cancer, you have to wait 5 hours after an item is put up for sale to actually be purchasable and the game will only tell you ""<1h"" during the last hour, making people use bots instead of wasting their lives refreshing a page... The prices are also ridiculous and most items have a predefined price range, meaning the economy is really just up to the devs and not the players.

- The equipement has a durability gauge and everytime you use one in battle, it degrades. So you repair it of course, but for every point of durability repaired there is a percentage taken off the MAX DURABILITY! The equipement bloody destroys itself slowly as you use it, making the things all the more ephemeral BUT the prices for a single good piece is still well over 20 level 60 expeditions of farm, during which you've lost over a quarter of your gear's durability anyway.

- The random loot drops are VERY scarce and RANDOM... I've dropped more items and skill pages outside of what I use than otherwise. You can also get bound pages for weapons you can't even equip, such as dual blades pages for a male character. Bound. It sells for 1k bronze while a single game nets you at LEAST 3 times that if you lose and performed poorly.

- The game's been out for over a month now and there still are enormous server lags and a downtime, expected or not, every single day. This is pure incompetence.

The game is at its peak in sieges and territory battles, but is a chore if you don't have organized people to play with. Find a House and join it ASAP, and you'll have a much better time. Combat is fun, moves feel satisfying and it's great when players come together and use their forces as a team.

Hero versus hero there are some serious imbalances right now: Longsword & Shield is pretty unkillable if played right 1v1 and are strong in teamfights as well. There are some super strong weapon specs -- but also some very weak ones. Overall they need a balance pass.

Territory Wars are awesome when it works -- the devs are still working out the kinks. Owning a fief is awesome and warring to expand your territory is rewarding and fun. Field battles in the open world in general are great and probably where the game shines the most: ganking people loaded down with resources and stealing them almost never gets old.

Probably the weakest parts of the game are the gear crafting system, which boils down for most people to buying gear from a vendor and salvaging it for the parts you need to make better gear. The Auction House is also a mess, with a 5h wait to post items, and bots overrunning the whole thing anyway.

This game has engaging tactical desicions and diverse classes. Sadly this game is also dealing with questionable design decisions.

Plusses:
Diverse Unit rosters
Good battles
Diverse maps

Minusses:
No ingame player to player trading
locking ultimate skills behind grind
Unlocking ultimate is random and unlocks even occur for classes not choses so the grind takes even longer.
while it allows for multiple classes to be used its not viable as you cannot reliably switch profiles
Unbalanced siege maps

This game shows so much promis, unfortunately there are some questionable gameplay decisions which turns people away from this game
problem 1:
locking ultimate skills behind a grinding mechanism (which results in very unbalanced matchmaking when you have the ultimate and you face someone without ultimate). 
Problem 2:
In this game one can learn all classes on a single character, however there is currently no system in place which allows you to reliably set skillpoints depending on which class is selected at the moment, as such using another weapon is not viable since you will not have any points in the stats needed.
Now combine problem 1+2 for number 3:
When you get a ""page"" to unlock a ultimate skill it is random which one you get, you can get pages for classes you are not interested to play as. As such people are currently switching to a class they are not enjoying because its the only class they have the ultimate unlocked for, and their choses class still has its ultimate locked.

Furthermore there have been many setbacks during this OBT in which people lost items or even territory on the world map and little to no compensation is given, during times of trouble the wars continued even though people could not log in to defend their own land and still no compensation for those affected (very happy i was unaffected).

There is definitely still some lag, but the notorious ""connection lost"" issue has been mostly resolved and only occurs occasionally.

I have decent faith that with continued updates this game will be great.

With all that said, the overall combat and gameplay is really solid, but when you approach the game think of the fights kind of like early level laning phase in League of Legends. Minions can kill you if you're surrounded enough and take a bad fight on another Hero.

Also, the game is balanced around those fights as a whole, so don't expect 1v1s to be perfectly balanced. Some Heroes are made for that (like dual blades) while others  (like Nodachi) are minion blenders that can wave clear insanely well.

Overall, the game is pretty good and looking to get even better, but at its upper echelons will be about strategy and good troop usage while piloting your hero well at the same time.",1559697853,1560577979,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

If you want to fight tier 4+ when you are tier 1.. this game is for you.
If you want to go around the map getting needed resources at 500% tax from the bigger houses, this game is for you.
If you want to sit there and wait 5 hours to get an item since there is no player trading, this game is for you.

This game has potential, but it will not work in a western type game structure using asian game mechanics.

Edit:
-After about 100 hours, the unit differences are still in, you will fight against higher level units 30+, which still  hurts.
-The resources are still a problem, it depends on the alliance/house what they set the tax, some will keep it high others low, it is all over the place.
-There are scripts/botters that run to acquire the pages you need for your ultimate (on any class). These people buy up all of the pages, good luck even getting one ultimate (I am at 75+ and I don't have enough pages for 1 ult). 

For the most part this game is ok since it is free, but man a lot of little things that are upsetting. I can't recommend in it's current state for other people, however I'll continue to play it.

Edit 14 June 2019

I have changed my recommendation, you can see my frustration up top. Yes some of these things are still there:
- You will fight higher level players, all players stats stop at 60, higher levels mean they have played longer and will likely bring in higher tiered units, which is fine since most players dont bring in the highest tier since it costs a lot.
- The skillbooks, still a problem, still don't have my ultimate, but i've learned to live with that.
- My biggest gripe is the time, CHANGE THE IRONMAD MODES TO SOMETIME THAT ISN'T 1030PM EASTERN PLEASE!!!!. It is so late....

Game is a bit grindy when it comes to leveling up your units but don't be scared of those high level people (level 60+) because after level 60 you gain't nothing from leveling up besides the number in front of your name. Also, reaching level 60 can be done within a week of moderate gameplay so please ignore all the people who complain. Sure there is cashshop but it's NOT paytowin. Premium accounts give you 30% bonus match rewards but that doesn't mean much since your reward is based on match performance and a good free to play player can easily catch up with a ""premium"". So far, this is one of the best Free to play games in the market and it feels pretty balanced. Politics are very important aspect of the game so I suggest joining a good house/alliance because that's what actually dictates the economy, not the cash shop as most of the people think just because it's a F2P title. So far Devs are doing a great job, they are communicating with players and most of them are down-to-earth people which are open to any suggestion about their game and I hope it stays that way and they take this game far.

Edit: Sadly, because of the state the servers are currently in (EU west at least) I am changing my review to negative. You simply can not fix the issue by doing a server restart which means nothing, You guys need to get stronger servers that can handle this amount of players. Ever since the game has gone free to play, the game started to lag in every battle making it impossible to play or somewhat playable if you can ""improvise"". As soon as the servers get upgraded, I'll change my review back to positive.

Second edit: They are working on new servers and hopefully we will all have pleasant ingame experience.

- You can now get infini-combo'd by melee and the ranged weapons are awful in comparison to the melee weapons.

- And the game is a unrighteous hellhole for players as you'll constantly be thrown into battles with people higher level(s) than you.

You login and create your character, note that some class are gender locked so take note of the different classes for both male and female before you choose. If you dislike your class you can reset your points for free at lvl 20 from a quest reward, use 100 skill points to unlock another class and your good to go, no need to re-roll a character.

Now in combat you have your main character or ""hero"" that you control directly, this character has a skill-tree, levels and gear. You also have a unit to control, basic move here, follow me, attack but you can also unlock unit abilities such as formations and attacks (like shield walls and charges). You have a ""leadership"" level and each unit requires an amount of leadership, scaling up depending on how good that unit is. You can only have 1 unit out at a time in arenas however you can resupply with the others you bring in with you on respawn or at resupply areas. All in all the combat is a nice mix of RTS and moba.

The confusing part of the game is the open world. The majority of your time spent (at least initially) is in towns running quests teaching you the various vendors and gameplay mechanics. The game has an auto-run feature so pressing alt unlocks your mouse and clicking on a NPC name in a quest will auto-run to that NPC's location in town, which is handy. The game encourages you initally to first level up fighting NPC arena, then PvP arena so if your looking to be a crafter/trader in the open world expect to have to learn to fight.

Speaking of fighting and the open world. When you finally head into the world map, its much more unforgiving than the arena, you need to resupply with food, the more units you bring the more food they consume but the more ""labour"" you can get done, which is needed to harvest. Also, your a target in the open world, people can and will attack you. At lvl 12 I was roaming around cutting the various tree nodes down when I got ganked by 8 players all ranging from lvl 20 - lvl 40, I was easily defeated and lost some of my resources as a result. The game does very little to prepare you for the open world and basically throws you into the deep end when that area of the game is concerned.

I like the games arena's and expeditions, often getting a 15 v 15 capture the points strategy battle. I'm a little confused by the cap on exp and rewards after 10 battles and removal of any rewards after 30 battles, I could see many people perfering to just play the battle grounds and feel like this was just a means to force people into other content to progress, but I will see where this leads me.

Overall:
Would I recommend this game? For free, hell yes. Its like playing total war online with a warcraft 3 hero, a fun multiplayer game that has a lot of content and is easy to play yet has its areas for both tactical and twitch gameplay. Some people will complain about one class being more powerful than another, in reality I think they are better suited to different playstyles and gameplay feels quite balanced. The cash shop sells keys for loot boxes you sometimes find at the end of a game but these keys can be unlocked via the weekly quests at a decent rate, premium gives you a 30% boost to exp so not game breaking in my opinion then the rest is mainly cosmetics. So far, I've enjoyed my time in Conquer's Blade, my only wish is that the open world content was better explained but at only lvl 27 as of writing this, maybe that is something I will unlock at a future level point.

TLDR; Give it a shot, its arena pvp and expedition pve is a lot of fun, especially with friends you can co-ordinate with.

First things first servers are not very stable when you try to do some PvP matches (this game is mostly about PvP) there is a chance that a whole Siege Battle just Freezes and while you still can chat you wont see any movements of the enemy and after some time you will be kicked AND get a penality for leaving the match ! 
Fight with Players or Bots are Sluggish at best, you cant just simply dodge if some attacks just fail to show up properly.
World chat needs a SPEAKING-Trumpet ... IN AN MMO that has a focus on Team/Guild/Alliance play PvP so to search a group you need a Trumpet ...

Their idea of 'fixing' a connection issue is to turn off all non-microsoft processes which didn't work.

I also must mention that i am going in on a little bias as i have had little to no issues with the game. Only issue i had was with my anti virus. I am on NA and everythig runs smooth except a few humps in the HUGE battles where the whole match is clumped in one spot. I am writing this at the time where the EU servers are down because of a fire. 

I must say that I love this game. there are definitely pros and cons to the game. But I do find this as a great replacement for Tiger Knight.

Unlike Tiger knight and mount and blade where the controls are “stiff” or “clunky” where everyone is similare. CB feels very romance of the three kingdoms as heros jump around and fight each other while surrounded by units. So as it does mimic M&B and TK, the combat system for the player is vastly different as it is more smooth and has abilities for each weapon. 

Pros: 1. I do get the mount and blade vibe with the world map and the units fighting.

2. the combat is more action packed between hero vs hero compared to tiger knight and M&B.

3. You can learn all the weapons (for your characters gender) skills for said weapons and unlock all the units. The only restrictions are the skill points when you level upand the leadership points when you level up (i hear there is a cap but i havent hit max lvl 60 so dunno if true or not. probably true)

3. your house (clan, guild, ect) can own territory and fight to capture places on tuesdays and saturdays so the world map changes hands.

4. dont have to worry about the expansive tech tree that tiger knight had which was based off of world of tanks, war thunder and ect. this leads to faster progression (can be con or pro depending on players pref)

5. there is a great balance between heros and units. heros are ment to duel each other and units fight units. but that doesnt stop both from helping each other as they rely on each other to win battles.

6. can help you get a mount and blade multiplayer fix while you wait for bannerlord.

cons

1. 3 game modes currently (4 counting territory war)

2. out of all the classes there are two that are of course the best out there right now (all games have that issue)

3. no extensive tech tree for units like TK, WoT or WT (this can be a con or a pro depending on players pref) cant really gear up your guys. there is unit customization but it is attire and if you a certain path when you level them up. can say the tech upgrade is the units level up tree all depends how you look at it

4. CB does not mimic M&B combat like i said in the description at the top.",1559755834,1559755834,True,0,0,0.472727268934249878,0,True,False,False

Let me explain.  Their systems they have in place for paid for stuff...IS GARBAGE. They tell you you can get these amazing packs for pre-order, but wait, only one char can take advantage of it, so they set up a system so you could buy it multiple times......WHY, why would you submit your customers to this crap? Oh but wait you can upgrade to a higher pack,BUT, you cant send it to your char that already has the lower pack...WHAT???

Then the unit progression is full of upgrades and deep progression. So i have to say I'm not surprised to see the reviews are ""mixed""

In conclusion, if you don't plan on spending a dime, then this game can be a fun getaway.

Conqueror's Blade is not for everyone. The combat gets a little getting used to as it is wonky, but nothing that you cant get used to in a few hours. 
This game is what I would have expected the refined version of Mount and Blade warfare to be and has a lot going for it. Seeing all the possibilities of customization and so many different weapon styles that you can master, you can make the fights feel the way you want a siege to feel.

From what iv e read from other review, it s appears their is balance class probleme but, community manager say they will work month after month on that !



Graphique isn't exeptional, but it s completly normal due to lot unit amount on the map.




After, i put a very big ""step back"" as free to play game, im experienced guy at my.com, around all their game, pass from warface too skyforge, it s an editor who have the right line to make cash shop as i call them: ""pay to go faster""


I have visited the shop, and conqueror blade will take the same direction than the skyforge shop as
""to upgrade that you need to play 1 entire week"" but if you want, you can spend 15$ and get this now"".


And from my skyforge experience, a game i have played a lot, and purshasing the 99$ pack claiming amazing offer, best deal, blablabla, and you check 3 month after another pack better than the 1st claimed at the release.


And this time, iv e played tight, i just pick the 12$ pack, and when i will be more deep in the game progression, i will check if it s worth or not to put again money.




So to finish exept if you win lot of money, or you like collectors edition, why not pick up the hight price pack, but be ready in upcoming futur in your progression, to spend the same money amount to progresse cosy.
But in what conscern me,  i win normal amount of money, and will never purshase hightest price pack from my.com, i prefer spend 15$ per month along the years as pick up vip status


I just say what i have meet with skyforge, and i expect the same with conqueror blade, but i hope not.

Guaranteed access to Closed Beta Testing => Thats a lie

I bough the game on Steam. Did not want to work. I tried to download through the my.com page. Did not work. ""Server is unavailable"" when pressing the Play button.

Here is the story and the solution my humble steam mates! :)

The solution was to login to my.com account using my steam account. See the link:
https://steamcommunity.com/games/905370/announcements/detail/1771508274890836190

After this step it still did not want to work, so I uninstalled everywhere (for the 3. time) + uninstalled gamecenter + cleaned registry (for the 2. time) + Restarted the PC.

Not sure about the order of the next 2 items:
?) -> I started the game again from Steam, it was showing that I still have the game installed, so I removed it from the bundled my.com launcher again.

?) -> Once the bundled my.com launcher was arguing about: Authentication failed, please start from steam. So  I started from steam

Then I downloaded the whole thing again through steam, and when I pressed ""Play"" it started to work

Conqueror's blade is a great game with potential. It's similar to some games like mount and blade and dynasty warriors with it's own twist. The game has flaws obviously, still in beta which is kind of hard to tell what that means in this industry now. I'll take it as the previous definition and say they are moving along with the community working on major issues at a fair pace. 

However aside from the obvious. When you dont receive any of the issues like lag, and disconnecting, the game is really fun. They have done a good job in terms of balancing units to heroes, making you feel like a champion but Also understanding you dont win battles alone.

The game modes field battles and sieges are nice quick games to give you ideas of what you will be expecting out in the open world. 

TEAMWORK and COMMUNICATION are the biggest keys in this game. Skill, ""OP"" classes all come second. Skill is obviously next and the classes that people want nerfed, need to learn to play the game.

The balancing isn't perfect but as a player the need to understand stats, skills and movement are probably a big factor in some of these complaints. 

The open world is vast and teaches the player about conservation, planning routes to make long journeys possible and gearing up in the unfortunate event of an encounter while travelling. Choosing speed over power or making a decision to just push your troops to near starvation, it's all there in the world.

In the end the issues do not outweigh the positives and with more polish and community support it will iron out and the gameplay will become smoother.",1559310786,1559310786,True,10,1,0.572923839092254639,2,True,False,False

I change my recommendation, don't spend a dime, if you don't have a top tier computer, connection, and live in europe/asia then you will likely not be able to even play at all.

Not going to mention all the launch issues for this as I really don't feel like typing up a book. Some classes have the ability to stun lock for 10 seconds straight. Some classes always have priority over any other class and can't be stunned. Some classes are just absolutely useless and die in 3 hits while others are so tanky you can't kill them unless 3 people gang up. Spears are a highly broken mount weapon as all you need to do is run back and forth hitting for high damage while no one other than ranged heroes can hit you.

Onto the units, shield walls are absolutely broken. There is no counter as the shields keep them safe from ranged units and enemy players can move freely through their troops so they just sit inside and hit anyone that gets too close while still being safe. Cavalry are absolutely useless, they are tanky but can't even go toe to toe with basic swordsmen. 

If they ever fix the balancing issues then I'll consider playing again but with as many issues as there are, it won't be anytime soon.

Update: If you buy one of the packs, it only applies to one character. Same with the cash shop, spend $30 on a cosmetic armor and it's bound to the character you bought it on. Not only that but so is the cash shop currency. Thought you could buy some boosters for your second character? Think again, all the currency you bought is bound to your first character.

So I have been waiting to post a review until the end of all the CBTs. As of this review it will cover the game experience for me for the past few tests.


- The game delivers a unique combination of For Honor, Albion Online, and Dynasty Warrior. That I truly love.
- The game combat system to me seem very smooth and one of the best PVP style medieval game I have ever tried.
- The game is very vast and open, there are so many things you have to do, to be able to do something. You have to have bronze or silver to be able to buy stuff for your units, then you need to go out and gather resources to create your own gear, and you have to play and get Honor to unlock new units, and you have to play and gather mastery points for your class to be able to unlock better skills, and finally you have to level up to even be able to unlock most of these things. I love that.
- The game is so addictive if you enjoy arena style games where there are 7v7 and more, PvP games that let you play matched games is so fun in my book.
- The devs of the games are very responsive, and have responded to many of my questions in timely manners.
- The game has a clan wars and heavy group fights to it, which makes it so much fun playing with your friends. 
- The game makes your better at play this type of game, you have to learn how to use your units and class at the same time, and forced and punishes you for mistakes, you always have to be smart and avoid being out of position or the Daul Blades will get to you.
- The game will be FREE at release so there is a plus and no harm in trying it. 


So all in all, I think this is best type of game for me and I would recommend to anyone that like these types of game, to me it’s a perfect game. The fact it will be free is all I wanted to in this game, now all my friends can join me.",1558617546,1558628113,True,10,0,0.554880380630493164,0,True,False,False

This game is awesome! It combines many of the elements from other army commanding games with a fluid combo system while controlling your own warlord in real time. The complexities of both fighting while actively controlling your units as part of a larger army bring both depth and great replay value to every siege/battle.

Lack of descriptions on items, how to do things etc (Spent ages trying to figure out how to attack bandits. There was nothing mentioned about it and it kept saying I couldn't move there)

Too much sound going on when you're in the open map.

Bots having massive amounts of ways to stun players. If you had two bots on you, you were stunned locked in place(Even if you dodge out).

Also another thing that bothers me is the 7 day head start. A week of playing non-stop and you can completely own the game. Make a group with people who have the head start? The map is already yours and good luck to anyone trying to take castles from you. I would reduce it down to 1-3 days or the same as the cheaper pack.

How about if people purchase a founders pack, they get given some codes which can be given to friends? Codes could include:

The deciding factor for me was being able to manually play your hero alongside your armies units similarly to a lot of MMO's on the market today (even though Three Kingdoms looks far more polished.) Tactics are a huge factor in both games in terms of unit formation and movement but in Conqueror's Blade you can champion your personal avatar as well as choose your preferred weapon and of course choose between various cosmetic accoutrements- standard fare for your run of the mill MMO. So I decided to pre order a Conqueror's Pack.

The game is immersive and very in-depth- I was fortunate to play most of the Final CBT and OBT weekend. The unlocking, building, and training your units involve a lot of work as well as purchasing supplies, gathering resources etc. If your looking for a handout theme park MMO this is not it.
The graphics are mediocre at best and being a 3d artist myself I can't help but notice the animation clipping with some of the character attire. I find that these don't detract from the gameplay at all. 

My only gripe with the game thus far is with the dual dagger class in PVP encounters. For a game that is based on tactical warfare- that requires logistical considerations and resource management; I am absolutely dumbfounded as to why the devs created a stealth class thats female gender locked and has almost no counterplay against it other than to outnumber and overwhelm it. This sticks out like a sore thumb and needs to be addressed. 

I sincerely hope the above doesn't create a 'flavor of the month' weapon meta that forces everyone to have to play one or two weapon classes to be viable in PVP. Otherwise I'll just shelf this and purchase Three Kingdoms.

905370,50280112,76561198041476571,0,74,5817,0,642,1593304579,"A game that takes the concept of Mount & Blade and Tiger Knight and makes improvements. I must applaud the developers for taking a swing at a game for a niche audience and, thus far, making a cash shop with very little pay 2 win. Of course, exp boosters count as pay 2 win in my book. For those that don't count freemium subscriptions or exp boosters you can buy, then this might be the cash shop for you; Good cosmetics for yourself or your mounts. 

As above, I'll be detailing what I've seen from the cash shop in the game. So far, it is incomplete, but the majority in the shop did not immediately raise any red flags. Costumes and mount cosmetics with a lack of stats from what I've seen. On the more p2w side, there are exp boosts and a premium subscription which is to be expected from a F2P game. At least, I believe it to be F2P. Please note that I purchased a founder's pack and so I get access to the game in its early stages as well as additional items players normally have to earn in-game. The cash shop during these tests is currently missing or has features that are locked, but none appear to be or sound immediately harmful to the game as of yet. The Freemium sub also boosts exp and battle rewards as one would expect, but I have not actually looked at any other details or bothered to pay for one as the game is still in its testing phases. I will update this section all the way through release.

With the cash shop aside, let me now go into progression, tutorial, localization, and fun-factor. As I mentioned in the paragraphs above, this game is mostly a niche game. I am unsure how many people that aren't Total war fans, or Mount & Blade fanatics would actually play this game for an extended period of time. Let me just say, however, that I had only started to enjoy my time with it before the servers went down from this recent test coming to an end and that I am quite sad.

 The game does an excellent job with the tutorial teaching you how to use and place artillery and siege equipment, how to command your units, and it even offers the ability to test every weapon out at the start of the game via the class training tutorial quest. I must also mention that, should you start a new character, you can skip tutorial missions instead of going through each one. So far, all the information is also written down in a way that makes things easy to pick up and understand with few errors or confusing structure. The tool tips for your abilities are all excellent and they are accompanied by a brief loop of every ability in action. This leads to little issue understanding what the move does and how it will function. As you continue through the tutorial, you will eventually be dropped into the world in a starting area of your choosing. From there, you may enter the starting town you chose, and continue to take on quests, main and side quests, to pave your road to success. Additionally, this will also have you go and unlock and recruit units to slowly build up your barracks so that you can join the battles. Every level threshold, 1, 15, 20, 30, etc, a new mode becomes unlocked. The game also allows you to band together with your friends in a 'House' to claim territory and even has wandering AI warbands that you can go out and attack. The game is full of a surprising amount of features at its current state, and I'm excited to see it release in the near future.

The one issue I did have for it was the lack of options. I would have enjoyed more 'medium' settings instead of having either a 'high' or 'low' setting when customizing my graphics. I also wanted a 'motion blur' and 'bloom' selection to turn off the odd blurry effects I tend to get from time to time. Also, better optimization would be wonderful. I hardly dropped bellow 60fps, but I did suffer some frame rate drops and on my specs... that's just unacceptable. Especially when I lowered the graphics a bit to eliminate shadows and foliage. A bit more polish is needed here, but the game does run well and appears stable enough from my end. Hopefully, they spend time on smoothing these kinks out.

Overall, I enjoyed my experience in the game and I'm hoping a new test phase or open beta launch comes soon. There isn't quite another game like this besides Mount & Blade, and Tiger Knight was a huge disappointment. I'm currently looking forward to it and the new units they're adding in. I 100% recommend checking out this game. While I understand not everyone has the time to do so, this game is worth a try if you're into Mount & Blade until Mount & Blade 2 comes out.",1556014043,1556014043,True,3,0,0.52702707052230835,0,True,False,False

After a day of course. The game was fun to play and I was able to experience going into siege with other players but that was like a one time thing. Seems this game doesnt cater to much people as there isnt that many people other than hardcore guilds and players who think they can solo and be badass by themselves. The game punishes solo players as they want those soloers to join a house but most of the time they'll leave the game because they DONT want to join a house. 

When you do join a house you actually have allot more features to do; When a house captures a fief the resources on the map can give resources at a lower cost. Also you can fight bandits on the world map but you need a group of 3 or more to beat some and you require items to actually engage in those battles, keep in mind you have to invest allot to actually get the item. You can go further out to other fiefs because of the fiefs your alliance or house captures. When you capture a fief you get no food upkeep in your own territory so you dont have to worry about going back to refill on food. 

If you want this game for the PvE. You'll be stuck in the first city you're in cause you really cant go out far because of the food time limit. You cant even get food from neutral cities. (Unless someone tells me they did, lets fight)

I recommend to get into a house or alliance. If you dont have the solo mentality that is XD. Enjoy the fun and play wild. A 5 man team isnt much to an alliance of 150+ members. I understand the you solo/small group players have pride but you really wont be able to unlock that end game content unless you merge with higher stronger houses. If you dont, enjoy defending your city and the shit talking in the game. 

Other than that if this game does actually get more population. That will fix this games issue. Their first hurdle was a fail and I compare this game to Tiger Knight Empires. Very similar case and hopefully they find something to remedy this. Plus they stated it will be free when it comes out? So why not try it out?

A lot of those negative reviews are bullshit.
It's counting  your download time as playtime ist in fact a problem of STEAM, not of this game, since steam recognizes this game as running as soon as the LAUNCHER is running. Get it directly, steam won't count it, thou you won't have that lousy refund policy either - decide if you want to play or not, or just f*cking wait until its released.

You can't play? Well, check the news. This game is NOT YET released, so most of the past time were always only CLOSED BETA TESTS, not open to anyone. And those CBT phases are limited, like in ANY other game too. That's new for you? Then you never took part in CBTs, i guess.

Bugs? Well, bugs and imbalance are part of CBTs, so deal with it or wait for the release.

Actually, a lot of those negative reviews have been about those topics.

About the game:
It's actually kinda fun, playing Mount&Blade online, but not just the battles, but everything else, too. Someone compared it to Mount&Blade and For Honor, and I agree with that - the battles remind one of For Honor, even though its still different, since you do (or well, some probably don't, lol) command your troups, thou you're playing a hero with unique skills.

Lets get one thing straight, 

This is an obvious company that does not take feedback from the community.

I paid $100 to play this game, hoping it would be the one that I would put countless hours into. I was wrong. Upon paying for it, I couldn't play it for about a month. Was pretty pissed about that. So, on my quest to find answers I wound up in the discord to ask when the game would be playable. The only response I got was ""soon""

And that went on for another month. 

Myself and several others were frustrated, as at that point the only thing the devs would do/say is that there is a sale coming soon, and to buy the game then even though IT STILL WAS NOT PLAYABLE.

I've been a moderator and Server admin in several gaming communities, and this community I would like to say has high spirit and hopes, but I feel as if this game is nothing but a cash grab for the devs/con artist of my.com. 

I did play very few hours of the game to find a clunky mess, and then SEVERAL server shutdowns because the devs couldn't get their shit straight. Good luck being able to play at all at the exclusive closed beta test, because the NA servers are barely up and running.",1555687505,1555687505,False,11,4,0.465647697448730469,0,True,False,False

From what I experienced, the servers could not handle the load of people who wanted to play, but during times when people were not on in high numbers the servers worked fairly well.  I put a good 30 hours into it during the open beta and closed beta time frame.  The limited PVE i played is good.   

My concerns:
That the castle development will be limited to those in massive guilds.  Would be nice if you could edit an off map castle that can be attacked by bandits or PVE armies. 
That you will be only limited to one army even when  someone on your team disconnected making more armies on the other team.  Overrun by numbers.  Even making it so that an AI took over would make it more fair.

What I liked:
Being a platoon leader and commanding troops
Only being able to get a unit if you have the resources to construct the unit.
The combat which includes PVP, raiding castles, and rectifying the bandit problem.
Resource gathering

Based on what I've played so far the actual game-play is fun, the over-world map and territory taking is neat as it plays out similarly to Mount and Blade, there is resource gathering, crafting, and the process of buying/crafting kits for soldiers to make whole units. Game performance seems consistent even in the thick of fighting with a couple dozen heroes and their units running around in big groups. Some heroes are unbalanced to a degree (Looking at you dual blades) but the trick to ruining their fun is just run around with your unit and watch as they stab a dual blades character to death in seconds. The Matches themselves are fun, as you control a hero with a unit of unfortunate soldiers willing to follow you. Managing them and fighting can be tricky at first but the system is simple and easy to learn. Don't just shove your guys in make sure to think of how you can best use them and try to reinforce others.

As this is a Beta review I'll for sure mention that there have been server issues and during the territory war I participated in, several territory fights were bugged but many more were not. At times the ques can be annoying however I have only waited a few minutes longer than the estimated time and been fine. Other people have been unluckier and some even complain about waiting for hours which doesn't match my experience at all but there it is.  As this is a Beta I expect issues like this to be ironed out and I can't speak from prior experience because this was my first weekend with the game.

Quite shady trick to make sure people can't get they money back. Ofc when servers came online with the test period I logged in since I couldn't get my money back. - 
For me the game is not worth to buy for 15£. For sure its own of its kind but not a big deal at all. Bunch of npcs running around the player and the unrealistic skill animations of commanders ""players"" are terrible for me. Flashing, shining, flying, standing against cannons, its just a joke far from realistic look and feeling as far as it can be. More like a cartoon style. I seen videos about it before I bought I just wanted to give a shot myself to see with my own eyes. 
Big disappointment for me both the steam service with my faked 4.5 ingame time which is about 30 minute in real and the game itself.
I seen developers reply on other comments they terribly sorry about loosing our money and they are sure steam service will refund us... Well I contacted steam service and they WON'T.!

Its is a pretty nice mix of playing your warlord and controlling your troops in combat, when working together with your troops you can tear other players and units apart.  When you have no troops you are basically a sitting duck just waiting for an assassin to find you.  

I have also found that with some practice you can get good at landing your abilities and auto attacks and that will help you tremendously vs other players.

Current:    5.5/10

Understandable problems (its a Beta after all):
- graphic bugs
- gameplay bugs
- no balanced matchmaking (hopefully only cause of the lower testing playerbase)
- unit and class imbalancement

Things that seem to work as intended but ruin the fun:
- no AFK punishment (including throwing everyone back into queue if someone leaves the unit selection)
- choke attacks with super retarded animations / the whole choke system (dont get me wrong im not against a system like that in general but how it is made is by far not optimal in my opinion)
- appearantly hackers (didnt see any myself)
- the defender spawn in sieges (you can literally spawn inside of an enemy unit with your own)
- shield hitboxes (its a bit weird if the arrow would visually bypass the shield easily but still gets blocked)
- parts of the unit AI (weird pathing, ignoring enemies sometimes, etc....)
- parts of the unit fleeing system (some units may attack while running, while others just die if you attack them)
- the PC resource saving system which lowers the complexity of unit animations when they are far away from you
(sometimes ""far away"" seems to be less than the archer range)
...

Positives:
- the overall concept with mostly working 15vs15 battles
- you can do stuff while waiting for your match
- the tutorials prepare you for the game as good as Player vs Bot could possibly do
- the crafting system is not too complex (im mentioning that because I know games where you literally need a whole dictionary to understand how the crafting works)
- servers have been stable and nearly 100% lagfree
- graphics are fine considering the circumstances of having to handle around 1000 soldiers at the same time
...

General ideas:
- an archer range and ammunition stat for information would be great
- probably a movement speed stat for everything including player characters
- AND PLEASE: Either remove the worthless trash basic sentence that most NPCs say to you OR change it up :/

Most likely problem in the future:

i understand it is in cbt but perhaps they should implement match making levels  for example lvl 8-15 16-25 -26 35 something like that just so it can make it more fun for new comers that are still learning the game",1550240280,1550240280,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Solo players my find the game lacking but for organised players there is tons of potential. Territory wars are very competitive and rewarding. There is still tons of work that is needed and I hope more pve/casual content is added but overall this game has huge potential and I eagerly await the open beta phase.,1550207962,1550207962,True,75,2,0.721262037754058838,0,True,False,False

Ok outside of the pain in rear end process to get the game running its a great title and worth the pains. I wanted to try this thinking it would scratch my need a new Warband like game itch but was very disappointed on that front. However the game has filled the dark void that Kingdom Under Fire filled back in the day.  It is damn fun and only really took about 20ish mins to get the tutorial down and figure out how to play.  You can see some of the future  business model when trying to join a mp  game. You'll see in the top part of the screen you have a number of ""deployments"" you can do at 100% exp after which that % will drop and it will reset the following day at a set time (0700 currently). Im assuming that this be their incentive for you spend money and i have say i really like this model so long as if any others are planed that the don't unbalance the game. Once again ill revise my review to reflect any future findings. Im kicking myself for not trying these types of games sooner.",1550111027,1550165361,True,6,0,0.48931160569190979,0,True,False,False
