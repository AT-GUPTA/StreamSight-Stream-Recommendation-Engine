Overall, this is a very good sequel to the first game, the change in perspective is a bit jarring at first and does make some things work less well (its harder to see enemies that are about to call in reinforcements, for example) but overall it makes the game more atmospheric and makes orbital strikes easier to target and feel immediately more relevant.

Probably the biggest issue it has now is that the balance seems very poor - Automatons are much tougher than Terminids and some guns and stratagems appear to be total trash, while others are almost compulsory to take (especially on certain missions or difficulty levels). While there are quite a few things to unlock in theory, the process is very grindy and it's disappointing to find that most of the options available to you are actually pointless.

The game uses a kernel level rootkit anti-cheat, just to protect a microtransaction cosmetics store in a PvE game. Talk about pathetic.

Weeks after launch and the game still has bugs, like not letting certain players spawn back in, your third person camera being knocked to orbit by explosions, models being stuck in places.

Matchmaking is still atrocious, even on the days it works. There are a lot of maps where people deploy SOS beacons, then nobody can join them. 200k players online, and not finding a single match? Must be a user mistake.

Solo play gives less rewards than group play.

Helldivers 2 carries the spirit of the first game very well,

There are notable gameplay changes and some factors have made the game easier ( enemies don't go ham and spawn endlessly or on the entire map, but there are at times random counterattacks on your squad )

The limited amount of weapons and lack of upgrades for said weapons might make you sad at first , but I hope more weapons and stratagems will be introduced in future DLC

But I am finding both the bugs and cyrborgs interesting to fight.

The only negative pet peeve might be the occasional random crash, rare disconnect from a lobby, nonsensical ragdolling ( the extraction shuttle got hit with a drop pod and was launched across the map, we couldn't get on and that was funny) , and the occasional chinese hacker

One night when I was 12 years old, I had awoken from a horrific nightmare around 2am. It was so terrifying that I had to leave my bedroom and go sit in an armchair in my family’s living room. I did this to console myself and reinforce that the nightmare wasn’t real. As I began to calm down, slow my breathing and wipe away the single tear from my face, a cockroach came out from under the armchair and tickled the back of my right ankle. I jumped from the armchair some 50 feet across the living room. Reality then became my living nightmare! Since then, I have had an irrational fear of cockroaches.

A few years later the movie Wall-E had come to theaters. I enjoyed the move so much that I ran out to the local toy store and spent all my money on the Wall-E robot. I rushed it home and immediately unboxed it. I was so excited; it was my first RC toy. It was then that I discovered the controller it came with would only allow the toy to go forwards and turn to the right. It could not go backwards.  You had to turn it right 180 degrees and then go forward to return it to where it to where came from. To make a left you had to turn it to the right 270 degrees. You also could not have it go forward and right at the same time, you had to stop the robot to make the right turn. You also had to move the arms manually! I was devastated! 

So, for me….

This war…

IS PERSONAL!

I became a Helldiver, to squish bugs and hammer robots with democracy!

Edit: Have tried every method my friend has sent to me to try and fix it but since this is a ""Always online game"" those fixes just don't work, at all, and nothing can fix it, I've reached out to the support team, but I'm thinking that there is no fix to this problem as many other users are coming up on the same problem and haven't gotten an answer to fix it, So I will probably end up refunding a second time since my friends thought they were so smart, and have been proven wrong with each attempt at fixing this game for me.

P.S. Next time don't add a Skip button to the most important part of your game to get it to work.

Locate the ""user_settings.config"" file 
And Delete it. (I recommend also deleting any files in the saves folder as well, since there shouldn't be anything there if you couldn't get into the game.) 
If you were having the same problem as me, good luck, hope you get it working as well.

Edit 3: Can't join any lobby, Tried for 80 minutes just getting into friends games. (It just doesn't work.)
I'm about done with Arrowhead Games. Waste of $80 CAD until THEY fix the issue, give this game a solid F.

Edit 4: Than you BubleWoot on Youtube for showing how to fix said problem I was having, you need to Turn off IPV6, this makes the multiplayer function. Can Now Play online.",1707454128,1708861869,True,0,0,0.355792015790939331,0,True,False,False

Yes it is decent to kill time with friends, but decent is pretty much all I can say about the game. Graphics are nice but the combat itself with mouse/keyboard doesn't feel very responsive. The mini map and how it works, you can tell this was a console game ported to PC and it lacks a few of those PC features to make it really a nice user experience.

Content wise, I don't really see what drives people to play this over and over. It doesn't feel very rewarding to keep on playing similar mission after similar mission.

The first is how the game is currently, which is superb. I liked the first game quite a bit but got into too late in it's life cycle to appreciate the grand scale. This game lets me rectify that mistake, and appreciate that the studio still has the talent and quality that made Magicka 1 one of my favorite games of all time to just play and introduce friends to. It's repetitive, enemy types are somewhat varied, and maps are randomly generated. I still love it, I'm still going to keep playing it, and I've already gotten what I feel is my money's worth out of this purchase. There's no predatory monetization, the battlepass is not FOMO or time limited, and the premium currency can be farmed and earned rather easily with no expenditure but time and effort on your part.

This is, ideally, how a live service game should function. Which leads to the second part; my future view of this game is going to depend on how quick and how substantial new toys and things to fight are added in. From the time of this review at the end of February I've heard rumors of monthly updates, which would be a very brisk pace. If this comes true, then I will be singing this games praise for some time to come.

If not, then I can still atleast recommend it as an easily enjoyable third person shooter with extremely based and redpilled and ultra democratic stuff in it.

Save yourself the frustration, and give this game a chance later when it is fixed. Don't believe the blind hype you see from fanboys and social media.

Wait a few weeks for the issues to get patched because right now the devs are sweeping server issues under the rug. This is not a good look for a new game. If they were going to knowingly release Helldivers 2 without the server space, they should have limited keys and at the least slapped an Early Access tab on it.

An actual quote from the creative director - ""If you have no cash, get it later. While we made a really fun game it’s worth waiting until the servers can support the capacity. I mean, as a CEO I of course want the game to be as profitable as possible, but if you spent your last $ and got stuck in server queues I’d be [heartbroken].""

PROS:
+ Really intense, immersive, explosive, and hilarious gameplay
+ Literally the Halo ODST sequel/spin-off game we never got from 343, BUT DESERVE.
+ Game is hilarious to play with friends (EXPECT LOTS OF TEAM KILLING)
+ Great variety of weapons, stratagems (including airstrikes, nukes, power weapons, orbital lasers, etc), and variety of alien bugs/robots to use them on.
+ Feels like a beautiful homage to other classic scifi series like Halo, Warhammer 40k, Terminator, and especially Starship Troopers
+ A huge amount of attention to detail (both visually and with gameplay)
+ Incredible music
+ Lots of replay value between the progression and the various planets/missions to play on
+ The live war map is a cool way to not only make every match feel impactful as you can track every planet & how liberated it is, but also help make the replay value borderline addicting and adds more of a live narrative to the game with new planets and events popping up every day (THIS IS HOW YOU DO A LIVE SERVICE)
+ Game does have both a free and paid battle pass, but not only is the pass not linear about what you unlock first, but you can earn in-game credits and everything from the pass by just playing the game and at a reasonable rate that won't make you feel pressured to spend anything (THIS IS HOW YOU DO A BATTLE PASS)
+ Arrowhead have already been updating and patching the game at a consistent rate and have been very transparent and informative about the game since launch. (THIS IS HOW YOU INTERACT WITH YOUR COMMUNITY)
+ Game feels worthy of full price, but is only $40
+ MANAGED DEMOCRACY APPROVED!!!

CONS:
- Servers have had issue with max capacity and players not being able to log in. The devs have been vocal about fixing this, and honestly, they have made many great steps on making the issue less frequent. Game is a rare case of suffering from success as they didn't expect it to be a massive mainstream hit and have even said, ""Hold off on buying until the issues are fix"" which is really cool of them. While I've personally noticed the issues not present anymore, you might still run into this so warning about that.
- Occasional bugs and crashes
- While the armor you unlock is badass, there's no way to change the colors like in games like halo. So if you want to mix and match helmets with different body armor, just know it might not look the best.
- Not super informed about this (and honestly not that concerned either), but it's worth noting this game apparently uses a certain anti-cheat program some weren't happy about. If that seems like something you're concerned about, I'd look into it, but honestly, I haven't had any issues so it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.",1708809314,1708858713,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Finish mission, game crashes while waiting for the transport. Take time to really look at stuff online, go through a ton of fixes, installed process lasso, and tested each ""fix."" Coming up on two hours applied the dx11 fix and it -seems- like that did it? Then I kind of thought about it: if this doesn't work? I'll feel like I -need- to figure out what's going on to get my money's worth out of it. Not that $40 is a lot, but on the principal that if I give you money for a game? I should be able to play it. It's just such a shame, the game seems fun but I'm just so tired of messing with shit like this. I considered just trying it and if it wasn't working just waiting for an update, but who knows when / if that'll happen (the game industry isn't exactly a beacon of trust these days)?

Still a few issues, it's basically the tail-end of an early access game, approaching release-version polish within the next few months.
There are microtransactions and battlepasses, which I'd normally dislike, BUT in this game the battlepasses never expire, so they don't make you feel like you are forced to play out of FOMO, they are just another way to fund the development of the game long term without feeling parasitic or inhumane. The game doesn't make you feel pressured at all. Additionally, the real money currency can be earned in game, and you can buy the premium battlepass with that currency.
So I think, considering the reasonable entry price of the game, they have an overall good attitude towards monetisation for a live service game, for now at least.

Graphics are great, very much latest gen AAA level quality. Animations and physics are great, combat feels physical and visceral. Premise is simple but there is a lot of depth on offer, which makes a nice change from e.g. Ubisoft and Bethesda games where there is a broad and complex premise, but absolutely no depth on offer.

Most importantly, it's a lot of fun, and having nine difficulty levels built into level selection instead of a game menu, makes changing the difficulty feel like an essential part of progress, instead of something you do simply when you aren't good enough or after you start finding things too easy. The whole recipe just works astoundingly well. Rock solid game, and it deserves all the popularity it has. Well done developers.",1708348829,1708857323,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the aspects I appreciate the most is its non-pay-to-win model, which is centered around cosmetics. It's rewarding to know that all the cool items are earned through gameplay rather than bought. Plus, I love the variety of stratagems, planets, weapons, and cosmetics available. The balance between the free and paid battle passes is also well done, with the free pass offering just as much value, if not more, than the paid one. Overall, it's a great game that keeps me coming back for more.   

Having a group of friends to play this game with adds a lot to the experience. Sometimes it can be challenging to find other players to join through public.

when it works, its like having an angel come down from heaven and give you the best head of your life
when it doesnt, its like having an angel come down from heaven and right hook you with brass knuckles on

so many issues are present, whether its the fact it takes 35 real life minutes to get into the main menu, or the piss poor optimization, or the bug that prevents you from respawning, or the bug where you dont get your primary weapon, or the game punishing you for both moving too much and staying still too long at the same time, the gameplay faults of scientist extraction missions being so poorly designed that its just not even fun and the elimination missions taking a grand total of 13 seconds to complete.

at the same time, having 3 friends battle through hell alongside you is something that has been replicated in many games, but none of which have done it as good as HELLDIVERS 2. this game is the definition of ""better with friends"" because if you dont have friends to play it with you might want to consider drinking tar and eating cinderblocks because youll get a very similar experience from doing either of those. however if you do have friends this game can be some of the most fun shit anyone can ever play. this is not worth the money yet, but it definitely will be once they fix the fucking issues that make me want to shove caltrops up my urethra.

Grind for top tear loot or never get the edge you want to merk like the pros who had the time to grind. Hell divers difficulty is the best, pure chaos.

STILL GETTING OCCASIONAL CRASHES. There was a dude with a question mark support weapon that made me crash, and returning from games or joining games results in random crashes as well.

CAREER STATS ARE NON EXISTENT BROKEN, ONLY SHOWS MISSIONS COMPLETED/FAILED

WHEN YOU'RE NOT THE HOST DON'T LOOK AT THE MAP WHILE THE HOST IS OR IT WILL CRASH THE GAME CURRENTLY.

HELL DIVERS CANT JUMP UP ONTO ANYTHING, WTF, I OFTEN GET STUCK ON LEDGES AND ROCKS THAT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUMP OVER, WHERES THE VAULT FORWARD OVER OBSTACLES?

Seems the game really starts to shine once you hit lvl 20 and are able to unlock the better gear like the rail gun, and shield backpack. Currently enjoying learning how different guns and ordinance is better suited for different missions and enemies. Gun and movement is tight and responsive, the rag doll physics do seem to be smoking crack at times and makes no sense, luckily being flung 50-60 feet doesn't result in a fall damage death like falling often does. matchmaking is good, seems to be random people but i can get in a full squad. The players themselves are weird, some people don't seem to understand materials are shared regardless of who extracts them, and I've had people team kill me just to try and steal materials, when they don't know its all for everyone at the end anyways. Helldivers should put up an announcement that this is not for democracy type brotherhood behaviour. The weak spots for each enemy keeps is fresh and the battles very dynamic. Its funny knowing that if you were able to run 1.5X faster you would never have to worry about combat, so really, the stamina bar is GOD in this game. without stamina, your dead. Premium items ARE TERRIBLE, in the shop, like who cares about an armour that barely does anything. yuk, glad its not weapons or pay to play monetisation, but it's still pointless and unwelcome and unwanted.

********************************

I played the first game quite a bit so was quite keen to play this when I saw it was coming, but then I saw the camera angle was changing and thought I'd rather watch a review after launch and decide then if I still want it. 

It looked amazing and the reviews were great as well, so I thought I'd buy it for my wife and I to play together. Today was the first time we played it and have to say, it's been so disappointing. 

Right out the door, I had to attempt the tutorial 3 times because the portion that teaches you about crouching kept spawning too low, so it looked like you needed to prone to get past it, but were unable to. It worked for my wife, which is the only reason I knew it was spawning too low. After Alt+F4'ing a couple of times, it finally spawned at the right height for me and I was able to go ahead with the tutorial. 

Half way through it, the game crashes. My wife's was fine so I thought it must be my PC. I checked and there were driver updates available so I went ahead and did them. Got back in the game and guess what, the crouching section of the tutorial had spawned too low again. Alt+F4 and try again and it works, I manage to get through the whole tutorial. 

Get into the game and try invite my wife to my session. ""No friends online"" yet hers says that I am a friend and online... Decide to join her game instead, no big deal. A bit of a bumpy start but now we're in the game and playing, all of the above has taken just over an hour and we have not played anything other than the tutorial yet. 

We get into our first mission, and get about half way through before her game crashes. Okay, so not just my PC. I tell her to check for drivers, surprise, she has the same updates available as I did. She does them and gets back in the game. We finish the mission and start the next one. Another crash from my game. 

We try multiple times and keep taking turns with the game crashing, do some research and see that many people are having the same issue. One guy says ""Try running as admin from the game files and in windows 8 compatibility mode"" so I try it. Drastically increases the stability of the game, we manage to play 2 full games without an interruption. 

Third game however, I get kicked because of network problems... I reconnect and try again. Seems we were just lucky earlier because we continued having multiple crashes each again after that without being able to complete a single mission. We keep just reconnecting to each other to continue the mission. 

We decide to take a break and try again later. 

3 hours later, we try again but now ""Servers are at capacity, try again later"" - We tried many times and were unable to get in. It's actually quite disgusting and has made me not want to play the game at all. Takes all the excitement out of it. I am the first of my friends to try this game, and I will be the last. I will wait a week or so and try again, and then change my review if the problems are resolved. If not, I will try get a refund.

Let me paint you a picture: You, your friends, and a galaxy that desperately needs some democracy. Sounds noble, right? Enter ""Helldivers 2,"" the game that takes that noble picture, throws it into a blender, and serves it to you with a side of chaos and a sprinkling of betrayal.

This game is the digital equivalent of ""trust fall"" exercise gone horribly wrong. One minute you're a well-oiled machine of galactic liberation, the next you're screaming at your friend because they just dropped a tank on your head. Again. You start off with high hopes of strategic gameplay, only for it to devolve into a circus of misfires, friendly fire, and the kind of chaos that makes you question your friendships.

Playing ""Helldivers 2"" is like participating in a comedy of errors, but with guns. And bugs. Lots of bugs. The kind that laugh in the face of your carefully laid plans and feast on the chaos that ensues when your buddy accidentally calls an airstrike on the team’s position instead of the enemy's.

The game's brilliance lies in its ability to seamlessly blend intense action with moments of pure, unadulterated pandemonium. One second you're heroically defending a position, the next you're accidentally gunning down your teammate because they ran in front of your bullet stream like some kind of adrenaline-junkie squirrel.

And let's talk about the ""strategems."" Oh, the strategems. These are supposed to be tactical game-changers. Instead, they often change the game by how spectacularly they backfire, turning would-be victories into slapstick tragedies. You haven't lived until you've seen a teammate frantically try to outrun their own misplaced orbital strike.

In conclusion, ""Helldivers 2"" is a masterclass in controlled chaos. It's a game that will have you laughing one moment and facepalming the next. If you love the thrill of battle, the agony of defeat, and the sweet, sweet taste of chaos, then congratulations, you're in the right place. Just remember, in ""Helldivers 2,"" trust is a commodity as scarce as your chances of a smooth mission. Strap in, it's going to be a bumpy ride.

It had a kinda rough launch with server capacity issues but Arrowhead has worked relentlessly to fix the problem and so far have been successful at it. Arrowhead has gone against the industry standard of live service games by making the real money currency earnable in game and at fair price points for the people who would rather just buy it. Their battlepass costs around 10 dollars when almost any other game I've played that has implemented the battle pass system usually charges $20+. The gameplay loop is a lot of fun especially if you have friends to play the game with.

I decided to try the game again and as of 2/25 it is stable for the 7900xtx. Played several matches over the course of 5 hours without a single crash.

The gameplay is rock solid. The firefights are fantastic. The missions have variety. This is the Starship troopers game you've always wanted. This is the kind of 'live service' game that does it right - nothing is predatory, everything that is fun can be unlocked without paying premiums. 

There are plenty of people to see more positives from. Read them and get the game!

----

Original 

If you own a 7900xtx or other AMD products, I recommend you avoid this game until the issues are fixed.

I had a blast when I was able to play. First crash was at the end of the training. Had to skip it.

Every mission I played included a crash that wiped the progress. This was a driver error, which crashed multiple applications on my desktop.

Common fixes I found on steam and Reddit include setting to full screen and taking off vsync. This causes a black screen on launch, and server issues to boot meaning it is completely unplayable.

---

I will update if it gets better, but I've elected to refund. With games like this, if it isn't fixed soon, by the time it is friends will be less likely to want to play, therefore limiting the fun factor by a severe margin.",1708206115,1708852407,True,0,0,0.485391825437545776,3,True,False,False

2/25/2024 Game is finally playable without crashing. Still having issues with joining friends at times. Things to try if you get crashing. 1. Use DDU to uninstall GPU drivers and reinstall newest drivers.  2. Launch steam as admin. 3. Launch game as admin. 4. Force game to use DX12 in launch parameters.

As such they force us, not to protect ourselves, not even to protect OUR democracy, but to protect THE democracy. 

They hate our way of life. They hate our freedom. They hate our vote. We come in, bringing democracy through the Fist of Benevolence, and what do they do, they resist, they rebel, they challenge the very essence of our democratic principles. But in the face of such defiance, we stand united, unwavering in our commitment to uphold democracy, not just for ourselves, but for all those who yearn for the embrace of democracy. With every death, we reaffirm our democratic duty to defend the rights and freedoms that define democracy. We do not waver in our resolve, for we understand that democracy is not merely a privilege but a sacred trust, bestowed upon us by the sacrifices of those who came before. And so, with unwavering determination, we march forward, champions of democracy, guardians of our sacred way of life, knowing that our cause is just, our mission noble, and our legacy everlasting.

So this is a (re)review :

HellDivers 2 is packed with new features compared to its predecessor. It makes the game more dynamic, more entertaining, harder and yet accessible on lower difficulties. The fact that you can buy everything you want without having to make any kind of microtransaction is also a positive feature.

I have noticed, however, that the locations on the maps are copied and pasted from one map to the next. Whenever you find a hideout, for example the one that requires two players to open, it always shows up with the same configuration, a house at the top, you know that the bugs will appear during the activation, there's a dead body in the entrance, a forklift in front of the door. 

I'd like to suggest a report setting to report players who come to your session just to troll... the other day I was soloying a mission, an i&é""à came to my mission just to kill me and then leave...

Arrowhead spent almost every other day patching the servers to increase stability and capacity.

The concept: You and up to a squad of 4 people go down to a planet (map) and complete objectives. Then after completing the main objectives, you call for a dropship to extract/rescue you.

The core of what sets this game apart from others are two things:
1. Stratagems - you can request support from your cruiser up in high orbit. This can be in the form of requesting an orbital barrage, eagle airstrike, sentry guns, or equipment. Calling down support needs you to input a set of commands (Up, Right, Down, Down, Right for example for a cluster bomb). Part of the challenge is performing a calldown during a hectic fight.
2. The atmosphere - if you've ever dreamed of being in Starship Troopers versus a wave of bugs, Imperial Guard in Warhammer 40k against impossible odds, Stormtrooper in the Clone Wars saga versus the bots, or the last Resistance versus Skynet, this is the game. No game makes you feel so powerful yet so weak. But when you get a mission done on Helldive with the timer running out, being chased by 5 bile titans as your team is doing laps waiting for extract, fighting down until your ammo is out and you're screaming for more cluster bombs - you'll realize this game is gold.

Other things
1. Friendly Fire - is always on. Given you can call for massive AOE, have access to high explosives and weapons, part of the challenge in a hectic fight is trigger discipline and communication.
2. The movement - you can crouch, slide, dive, and go prone. This sounds basic but when combined with friendly fire avoidance, this becomes key in not getting shot by your teammates trying to shoot that hostile right next to you. You also take less damage when prone.
3. The enemies - right now there are 2 factions that you fight against, bugs and bots. Fighting against bugs feel like playing a totally different game when fighting bots. The game is expected to add 2 more factions.

Finally, the music is great, from the moment you drop down from high orbit to the final extraction theme, it adds a lot into the game.

TLDR: Buy the game. With friends. Get a mic. Have fun.",1708850755,1708850755,True,4,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Give them time to fix their game. [/b] For the price, it's a fun time and addicting gameloop. You and a group of 3 others are expendable, tasked to completing your operation or die trying. No p2w weapons, expensive skins, or battlepass to be seen here. There's sort of a ""battlepass"" system, but it's more progressive of things you can purchase with in-game currency. You can even earn real currency through normal gamplay without needing to be frugal about what you can spend your money on. I managed to buy multiple things from the Superstore and still made enough SuperCredits to buy the premium pass with less grinding than GTAO. The satire is great and very similar to Starship Troopers as you destroy robots and bugs. Still, the game is rough in areas, which could be irritating and adding more difficulty to the game than is was intended.
The list below are some negatives of the present bugs and normal gameplay.

[h3]Negatives[/h3]
[list]
    [*] Annihilator Tanks makes zero audio when they're not shooting. I've accidentally run head first into them many times when they're not aggressive and just idling around in the tree line. No engine or tread noises? Weird.
    [*] Both Terminids and Automaton patrols are super frequent even when you've destroyed their outpost.
    [* ]Both Terminids and Automaton patrols literally spawn in your face or within 50m. Even multiple spawn, seemingly heading in your direction. How convenient for them.
    [*] Both Terminids and Automatons are inconsistent on when you call-in Stratagems in their area. They'll either not care about their impending doom, or will immediately call reinforcements which is another issue.
    [*] Both Terminids and Automatons call reinforcements too quickly and too frequently leading to multiple encounters which is a wasting your time and resources. Been multiple occasions where we were shooting one that is about to call-in reinforcements for them to only tank shots or been completely hidden and signal anyway.
    [*] Sometimes unable to pick up samples and other items that you have dropped from death or just naturally spawned in the mission.
    [*] Some times the extraction will glitch out and you won't be able to get in.
    [*] Damn enemy explosives are so strong. They're way too accurate and the knockback from the explosion is insane. They can shoot your cover and fling you away from it. You'll be hit way more by rockets than bullets.
    [*] Armor is currently bugged. Light, Medium, and Heavy doesn't change your defense. It only affects your speed.
    [*] Calling a hellbomb on a Detector Tower is impossible. The Stratagem ball bounces and rolls away from the tower and lands too far.
    [*] If you're near one of your team mates and they get spotted, you also get spotted even if they never got line of sight on you.
    [*] Absolutely can't control your pod sometimes when you have some braindead player throw you on a Bile Titan. Which doesn't kill them either.
    [*] It seems only certain operations are only available on certain difficulties. Bummer you have to experience a different operation on a different difficulty, but makes sense to have a specific operation to destroy a Hulk/Tank/Bile Titan on lower difficulties.
    [*] Some guns could use a buff because the Breaker Shotgun, and SMG are just way too good to not use.
[/list]

Mainly the core issues are the patrols and them calling reinforcements. It's just way too much, way too often. It gets ridiculous how fast it takes for one to call reinforcements, and have it snowball into a ""random"" patrol spawning behind you, getting engaged from behind now, have another patrol come out of nowhere, to have them call reinforcements, to repeat the cycle constantly. The best strategy is running away, and even running away, they'll spawn around you so frequently. It also makes no sense why enemies spawn on a point of interest you've cleared already.

It does seem like a lot of negatives with hardly any positives to show for, but the game is really excellent in what it does. From cooperating with your team, using certain stratagems to compliment or cover each other, how you strategize with your team on how to tackle situations, sound design, and atmosphere. It's simple fun with not difficult mechanics (apart from sprinting into things makes you automantle by accident, please add into settings).",1708850493,1708850493,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As of now, I believe the devs have stated the servers can now support somewhere in the ballpark of 700,000 people. Now, if you are afraid of not being able to play the game still then absolutely wait to purchase the game. But I have not had any server problems in the past week or so of playing. 

This game is very good. I'd argue it is better than a lot of the mainstream triple A games. It doesn't have 4K cut scenes everywhere, or a bunch of pseudo-choices for you to make like a lot of mainline games these days, but it has something a lot of other games seemingly forget to include. *FUN*. The game is very fun, and baring a few glitches here and there, I haven't had many issues with it. The glitches I did experience are honestly ones I see in games that charge you 80 dollars out the gate anyway, and the devs had their priorities set on server issues rather than bugfixing, so I expect now that the servers are better that they'll focus more on glitch fixing.

There are microtransactions in this game, which may turn people off. But so far I haven't found anything that you couldn't get by just playing the game normally. I am a tad concerned about there being only four items at a time in the shop, however, as that may prove problematic if they add new content to the store, where stuff you want may take forever to cycle back into the shop.

There are a few balancing issues, certain weapons and stratagems are simply leagues ahead of the other options, you'll find on the higher difficulties people all start gravitating towards the same options. So, I do hope the devs buff some of the other weapons or offer options to upgrade them to become better.

Really, those are the only real downsides I have with the game. It is genuinely fun. And can be really challenging at times. You can really cater your playstyle quite easily. If you want some relaxing fun just mowing down hordes of enemies, Trivial and Easy difficulty are perfect for that. If you want some decent challenge and situations where you have to think on the fly or die- then medium challenging and hard are quite good for that too. If you want to (suffer)/challenge yourself and put your skills to the test, there are the other difficulties after that.

And die a lot you will. A little titbit for anyone buying this game- it isn't meant to be a game you go flawless through a mission. If you do- that's great! But a lot of the times, you won't, especially if you go on higher difficulties. And that's okay. If someone accidentally kills you because a bug kicked their grenade back towards the frontlines, that's fine. If you accidentally forget you have your grenade launcher equipped and not your assault rifle and decide the front door of that building looked better with your freedom blood all over it- that's fine too. Get suddenly jump scared by an invisible enemy because you were trying to help your friend not get trampled by a charging super-sized bug? That's fine too, it happens. That's why you have so many lives. It is much more fun to play this game when you let go of any perceived need to have perfect runs. The worst that happens is you drop your special weapon and samples, but any good teammate will pick your samples and drop you close enough to collect your weapon. (Assuming it is safe to drop you there)
(Loot is all shared, no need to worry about things getting 'stolen')

The game has a lot to offer, I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes horde shooters or any fans of Starship Troopers. And if you're curious, I suggest buying it and playing it for an hour and a half. You could always refund it if you didn't enjoy it, but I think an hour and a half is plenty of time to figure out if you like this game or not.

Matchmaking errors, mid-match disconnects, bugs, exploits, lower level players queuing for hard+ difficulties. At some point we can't keep falling back on excuses like ""it's a small dev team"" or ""be patient, the developers didn't expect this game to be so popular."" After 2 weeks of daily errors, Helldivers 2 seemingly have stable servers. 

2/23/24 Edit: I was kicked from numerous games today either mid-match or at extraction. If I had more invested in HD2 I might have been irritated, but this behavior is pathetic. Pathetic that players are removing people from the game, and pathetic the developers are enabling this immature conduct. ""Host your own game."" Sure, if I host I won't be kicked, but then my lobbies constantly fill with lower level players. It's a lose-lose situation. I'm not a stickler for meta loadouts. There are some good early stratagems available to everyone, but I'm just not all that interested in using 5+ reinforcement stratagems in the first 5 minutes because our level 7 can't avoid or damage the Charger. 

Although the gameplay is enticing, I’ve encountered some challenges/issues that have negatively impacted my gameplay experience.

1. Progression. The XP leveling system was very slow before they added bonus gains. Players collect warbonds and samples during missions to upgrade ship modules and unlock more available stratagems. Ship module upgrades are heavily priced between 60-100 common samples per upgrade, with higher upgrade tiers requiring rarer samples. 

2. No weapon leveling/customization. When you unlock a new weapon there is no further customization you can do to further improve that weapon. You can’t change magazine size, ammunition type, stock…nothing. However, you can choose various optical scopes, firing rate, and a flashlight option (which is completely useless even in these dark wastelands) after loading into a mission. 

3. No saved loadouts. You manually select which stratagems you intend to use each and every mission.

4. Mobility. Aside from lunging, sliding, running, and the jetpack, player mobility in HD2 is atrocious. This doesn’t even include all of the environmental hazards, enemy collision, or obstacles to slow or impede player movement. 

5. Enemies are bullet sponges. Most Chargers take between 1-2 Recoilless rockets or several unsafe railgun shots. These support stratagems ultimately require two players unless you want to kneel for 10 seconds to load 1 round and completely expose yourself. I’ve found Bile Titans to be a nuisance. it’s that one unlucky player who has to aggro the boss while everyone tries to strategically time their stratagem strikes to land directly on it. Every YT video out there is the martyr who nuked themselves along with the boss.

6. Matchmaking. “Failed to join game lobby.” This game is scaled for 4 players, so leave your matchmaking open unless you’re a team of 4 players. Other posts have mentioned griefers and being kicked mid-way through missions. I've been kicked prior to extraction and disconnected from network errors multiple times. I have also witnessed another player repeatedly team kill another until they left the mission. Just like all online games, disconnects are expected, but giving hosts full power to remove someone without reason - causing the kicked player to lose everything is baffling. Samples, XP, and currency should be awarded in-game when completing objectives, not after extracting. 

7. Bugs. There haven't been too many bugs as of the recent patches aside from getting stuck in the terrain. The cryopod bug has to be the most irritating bug for me. If you load into an open mission at the same time as another, you will be locked from entering the ship and remain in the cryopod loading area. You must wait for the host to enter the launch pod to being the mission, otherwise you’re stuck. 

8. Samples. Either I'm matching with players who haven't figured out how expensive ship module costs are, or the developers didn't stress the importance of collecting samples enough in the tutorial. At my current difficulty there are usually about 45 available common and rare samples combined, but our team never extracts with more than 15 samples. This warrants a crucial change: 1. Increase the number of samples in each pick up, ex. 3-5 samples per icon, or 2. Reduce the number of samples required per upgrade. 

9. Replayability. The gameplay loop is monotonous - Launch one of the 10 or so missions, destroy enemies and complete secondary objectives, find hidden samples/medals/credits, and extract. Aside from a community event and a daily mission, I don't see much of a grind aside from the battlepass, unlocking stratagems, and improving your ship. There is no player progression/proficiency, weapon tracking, or bounty system (aside from the daily objective). 

Negativity aside, the explosions are phenomenal and the weapons feel fantastic. They have a certain weight to them. I want to do so much more than just eliminate my enemies and collect weird mushrooms and ores. I want additional currencies and materials to grind for crafting and/or upgrading. I'd like to see weapons or armor with set bonuses that are earned through player achievement, not just cosmetics gained using super credits. What if enemies themselves dropped resources or materials that we might utilize to further our ship development? Maybe instead of carrying everything to the main extraction, could we unlock smaller extraction pods designed for mid-mission resource extraction? 

Helldivers 2 feels like something teetering between a Destiny Vanguard Strike and a Raid. Every objective can be solved by annihilating your foes or by making use of the D-pad. It's not a horrible experience, but it doesn't deserve the overwhelming praise it's currently receiving. ",1707797566,1708848769,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can't deny the $40 price tag is a little high for what's here but given how enjoyable the experience has been I don't mind. A bit of the modern monetization is here with battle pass progression but unlike the usual ones you can't pay to progress it and while there's a premium track you can very easy unlock it without ever paying a cent. Game does need some mixing up in terms of the sandbox since after a certain difficulty level there's a clear loadout you should be running, not because it's the best one but because it's simply the only one that's viable; hoping the developers can work on that in the future because it's fun getting to experiment with loadouts but you have to stay in the lower difficulties if you want to do so.

As for *my* main critiques, some of the stratagems and most of the weapons feel a bit weak. There's definitely a clear meta loadout for missions at difficulty 8 and 9.

[*]Being kicked causes all the missions on the map to fail to connect.
[*]An extraction terminal failed to process the request, and locked up in the completed state w/o starting the extraction. This forced everyone to kill themselves to proceed.
[*]Sometimes the game will think you have no weapons, despite [b]holding three weapons[/b], forcing you to either die or find a dropped weapon to force the game to register that you are holding a weapon.
[*]Infinite loading screens, forcing you to Alt+F4.
[*]The game will sometimes rip control from you while diving and force you to spawn in a specific spot. This wouldn't be bad except for the fact that it can spawn you inside of walls, instantly killing you.
[*]The game crashed on exiting to desktop.
[*]Joining a mission in progress (or with quickplay) is 100% random with the difficulty. Despite having difficulty 5 selected, I've ended up in difficulty 2-4 before for no apparent reason.
[*]If you shoot down a dropship before it releases its bots, the bots just spawn on the ground (ALIVE) and are unaffected by a giant ship crashing down on them.

[*]Stratagens will fail to deploy and disappear, despite not being near a radar jammer (as in there's no jammer on the map).
[*]Stratagen beacons will pass right through enemies instead of sticking to them.

However aside from some server issues that we all know about, there are a few issues that I am unable to write off or dismiss:
Your helldiver:
Stims: 
I don't know if people have it rigged a certain way, but no matter what bind I have my stim or reload on, when I REALLY need it, it seems to not register at the WORST times, but i'll see uploads of people actively getting shot or beaten in a mosh pit of bugs and stimming, how?
The Pod: 
Does not steer at times, others I can steer it a bit but other times it just refuses to alter direction at all even a little bit.
Weapons: 
In particular the upgraded variant of your initial assault rifle, which states ""Medium armor penetration"" DOES NOT penetrate medium armor and seems to be sabotaged by the reduced damage stat.
The Railgun has safe and unsafe mode but the only difference is unsafe causes the weapon to explode in your hand, but no power difference if you manage to fire before it explodes.
The Spear should prioritize the largest target in its crosshairs, so many times I or my compatriots have tried to fire on a bile titan only for it to somehow lock onto a nearby Rusher, which was not the intended target
Movement: 
Will vault when I am sprinting over reasonable obstacles, however seems to struggle on some inclines that are basically 2 steps on a staircase. In addition sometimes when diving will refuse to get up unless dive key is hit again, but will sometimes remember sprint input and stand up from prone to run as ordered.
Strategems:
The Railcannon strike will sometimes deviate from ""target the largest enemy closest to the beacon"" and pick a target at random despite there being something like a tank or hulk near it, it will target a chainsaw mech instead

Now for enemies
Automatons:
Cannon Turret texture will sometimes show a destroyed turret until you get blasted from behind. Dropping a 500KG AND a carpet bomb at times does not destroy it either.
Rocket Troopers are locked on to you regardless of difficulty whether Easy or Helldive, they will snipe you with a rocket mid-dive or will break off from squad and hide on their own, waiting until after firefights to fire at you.
Reinforcement rate is somewhat broken starting at challenging, 1 flare seems to summon at least 6 dropships that will clip into each other and drop a whole ton of bots on one spot.
Hulks are somehow able, despite weighing possibly hundreds of tons, able to keep pace with you while running without stamina and with stamina, still manage to gain on you little by little, how?

Terminids
Honestly my only gripe is the rusher and bile titan
Rusher can spawn in groups of 4 on challenging and higher and seem to go over obstacles that they should headbutt into and stop for a moment. They're also capable of hairpin turns, which with their size should either be impossible or break their legs. When blasting with a recoiless rifle, they will slide forward a great distance, ending up right next to you or just behind you somehow.
The Bile Titan has very little pause with its vomit attack and spams it relentlessly and with incredible range that slightly sweeps after its intended target

Having said ALL of that, I do love this game and I really hope they iron out everything they need to, i'm still playing and doing my part.",1708847318,1708847318,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

OLD REVIEW:
Played tutorial, enjoyed it, then had to log off. Came back and relaunched game and spent several minutes getting 'Servers at capacity errors'. Could not Escape out and had to ALT & TAB and close game from Steam. Rebooted, retried, same result for several more minutes. Other attempts gave 'Failed to create lobby', and also had to be closed from Steam. 

At that point I had 45 minutes game time, of which I played maybe 15. Steam does not allow refunds after 2 hours, so I'm afraid I'll have to pass for now.

My main problem is that game crashes or server disconnects mid session. Today, I played about 5 sessions and none made to the end because of those problems and also due to a bug that does not get me back into the game with reinforcement beacon, I had this about total of 5 times, where other players are revived but I stay dead even though reinforcement count is remained. I probably wasted about total of 10 hours because most of these problems happened late in sessions.

It is pain even though I own the game, I can't progress on events and daily missions because it's only half playable, I know devs are working hard to fix these issues but I doubt I will get compensation for this. I will likely stop playing until actual patches come up and the game is stable enough. I'm pretty unhappy about the loss of progress over this, I recommend people to wait for a month or so.

Edit: 2/16~2/17 much more stable after today's patch, no crash but connection remains bad, few bugs
2/17 today's patch completely ruined the matchmaking, you can only play solo which is one of worst gaming experience in case of this title, no progress viable
2/23 most problems of crashes, disconnection and matchmaking became stable after the patch, limiting number of player is kind of bullsht but understandable since there are no other temporal solution for server size issue, I'm not certain if they're willing to increase the server size, almost recommendable

It had somewhat disastrous of an experience;

1. The game conflicts with bluetooth headphones, launching the game muted all audio outside the game. It seems the issue is with bluetooth headphones that have headset feature. 
2. I have a mid to high end PC, but the game appears to be so poorly optimized that even at medium settings I was only getting 65-80 FPS, and this doesn't seem to be warranted as the game doesn't even appear very high fidelity. In other intensive games, like Cyberpunk (an extreme example) I get 90-100 frames. In Assassin's creed Odyssey I get 150 FPS on average. Optimization seems to be a big issue.
3. The animations are extremely clunky and feel cheap, when moving and turning the animations skip around and the player appears to ""float"" on the ground at times.
4. The game completely froze my PC twice, within a short period of time, maybe 30 mins while I was messing around with settings trying to get better FPS. This is pretty sad considering the specs I have and the hype for this game.
5. For the first 20 minutes I was trying to play the game the servers were full. How can this be for such a highly marketed game? Maybe use some of your insane marketing budget to actually operate a sufficient number of servers...

All in all bad experience, not necessarily related to gameplay, but from a tech standpoint the game was a let down. Hopefully it gets better with patches, I may give it another go if the crashing and optimization get better.

I can recommend you give the game a try. It's not going to be a game for everyone. It's a difficult game which mostly requires you to learn and get better to progress to higher difficulties. As you level you will unlock tools that might make the journey easier, but there are a few unlocked at level 20 which are game changing. 

The game is definitely meant to be played at the hardest difficulties. Don't be scared to bump up the difficulty, you will have a blast even if you get completely destroyed. It's all about the feeling of being wildly outnumbered, running and shooting for your life.

I've been able to successfully play it a few times, but that always without fail gets interrupted by server issues. I have no idea how you get a company like Sony to publish this and the servers are this bad those guys have like unlimited money. I completely understand them not expecting the volume of players on a sequel to what is by comparison a dead game, but for the issues to still persist to this degree after the amount of time it has been out is just bonkers. They also somehow launched this game without an AFK timer so people until recently were just able to sit in the game AFK which would exacerbate the problem of not being able to play the game. Not that anyone cares, but I'll obviously change this review when and if they fix these issues but at the moment I'd say wait or buy something else.

Right up top, I want to mention the monetization. The game has a battle pass, a rotating store, and microtransactions for in-game currency. The return on what you can get for your dollars is not very good, but not nearly as bad as I've seen in other games. Ten bucks will get you the battle pass, or a couple good armors from the store, which can actually be very helpful. To its credit, they do give you some premium currency as you progress through the levels, and you can earn a potentially infinite amount of it from in-game tasks; you can actually get by without needing to spend any extra money, at all, with minimal grinding. Really, the microtransactions feel extremely unnecessary, and are actually not that predatory. Still, I would much rather the game just NOT have them. I have a bad taste in my mouth for any game that uses a fucking battle pass, and even if this game is a not-that-bad implementation of one, it still has one, and it's worse off for it. I'd much rather they just charge more up front, or a flat fee for a DLC, than manipulative bullshit like they and every other game nowadays have.

Getting into the gameplay, server issues aside, the game is actually a ton of fun. One note, DO NOT expect to play this game solo. It is not at all balanced for single- or even duo-play. It's at its best when you've got a full squad of 4, and it does not do much to tweak the balance down if you've got less than that. But, if you can get a group together, or don't mind playing with randos, it can be a legit great time. 

There's not many games out there that can give you the same feeling of being hopelessly outnumbered, but also of having the firepower to fight your way through it. The impacts and explosions are visceral and a lot of work was put into making them PUNCH with each orbital strike or nuclear impact. The deaths (most of the time) feel like they're your fault, rather than the game being cheesy and unfair. There's a good amount of depth to the mechanics, and there's enough variety to keep you playing for a good while.

There are some things that feel like they're misbalanced, but it's hard to tell if they're intentional because the options you start with are cheap and shitty, or if they just have a few things that need to be nerfed. In particular, once you get the Autocannon at level 10, you can pretty much kill anything. It's a shame, though, since there are a pretty spicy selection of weapons available, but most of them simply do not live up to the same standard, and are not worth taking. Why take a heavy sniper when the autocannon can do all the same stuff, better, for longer?

There are currently two factions, the bugs depicted on all the marketing, and the Automatons. Both factions play extremely differently, and jumping back and forth is almost like playing a different game; a very nice balance for more variety. That said, each faction has only a handful of mission types that you will do with them. Blow up a bug nest, then extract. Help survivors load up into an escape pod while defending them from robots, then extract. Blow up some bug eggs, and a bunch of nests, then extract. It's all enough to keep you playing for a while, but already things can start to feel same-y, only ~20 hours in.

Oh, and one last thing I'll note, the game is AWFUL at tutorializing. There have been multiple times I've dropped into a new mission type, and stood around for 10 minutes not knowing how to progress the mission. The game does not give you very clear instructions on some objectives, and unless you know what you're supposed to do, it can be fucking frustrating to sit there with no progress while getting hammered by wave after wave of enemies. And even when you do know what you need to do, if you're not on voice with your squad, some objectives can be absolutely frustrating to coordinate.

All in all, a very solid, fun game. If it didn't have microtransactions and a damn battle pass, it would be one of my new favorites, but alas, at least it's one of the less frustratingly-monetized games to come out in a long time. If you've got some friends, pick it up, and have some fun (and try not to kill each other!).",1708378317,1708843544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Phenomenal game! We are still experiencing occasional crashes, but overall a much better experience! It's a blast playing with friends(also easier). Difficult when playing alone, so I'd recommend convincing some friends to dive with you. Just expect some friendly fire and hilarious deaths while blowing up some bugs

Previous Review:
Phenomenal game WHEN it's playable. Right now and the past few days, it's just been unplayable. I haven't been able to get in a game with friends. Either we have a black screen, stuck at server capacity screen,  half of us are playing while the other ones are having issues, or crashing during a mission. 

Once these issues are fixed, I'd highly recommend it - currently one of my favorites games for sure. Just don't expect to be playing right away if you buy it. I'll update my review once the game is playable again.",1708285903,1708842485,True,0,0,0.501058340072631836,0,True,False,False

I'm talking about non-stop co-op excitement that's been missing from the gaming scene for ages. Arrowhead Game Studios? Yeah, they've outdone themselves with this sparkling gem. Okay, okay, so there were a few hiccups with the servers in the beginning, but come on, that's ancient history now. This game? It's like a shining beacon of gaming brilliance. And get this—you don't have to buddy up if you're not feeling it. Going solo is a whole other ball game, and let me tell you, it's a thrill ride.

Now, am I singing the praises of these devs? You bet I am. If you're reading this, do yourself a solid and check out some gameplay vids. Trust me, you'll be itching to jump in yourself. And when you do, don't hesitate to grab a copy because this is one ride you won't want to miss. Get ready to immerse yourself in heart-pounding adventures that'll make you feel like you're smack dab in the middle of Starship Troopers and Terminator, all rolled into one.

So, what's the holdup, Helldiver? Super Earth's calling, and it needs heroes like you—stat! Suit up, lock and load, and get ready to unleash some serious whoop-ass on those alien invaders. The fate of the Super Earth is in your hands, Helldiver!",1708841712,1708841712,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

- Reasonably priced
- Amazing Co-op experience
- Replayability is high thanks to random generated missions. 
- Gameplay from guns to Stratagems all feels beautiful. 
- Despite the lack of servers they suffered from for a while. Actual connection to said severs is good enough that playing internationally doesn't seem to cause that much of a hindrance. So great for the OCE base connecting to places like America

And the Live Service? This is one of the very select few games I am entirely okay with it.
- You can find premium currency in missions just by exploring
- There is Free Passes that reward some pretty dope items as well as more Premium currency.
- The Medals to unlock things are easy to both find and earn.

It took a bit but the devs have finally ironed out the major issues with unlocks and server space.

It's a very fun game full of insanely cinematic and tense moments. It feels very satisfying playing, especially when you have a full squad with you and your buds clearing all the objectives on the map.

There are still issues here and there, so far armor hasn't been fixed yet, and there are glitches that make your gun's disappear in a mission. But hey the fact we can get into the game now without hours of waiting is great.

The perspective change, changes everything. In short, it makes games less cooperative compared to the last game. Even if you fix the server and optimization, there are a lot of questionable things that make me wonder ""Do they even play their own game?""

 Good thing:
- Punchy weapons
- Cool Music
- Pretty landscape

Bad:
- With third person perspective, they seem to want emphasize more on each individual helldivers. There are now injuries, health packs, to help your helldiver survive longer. But it's not long enough that most enemies can instakill you. Back in HD1, reinforcement were infinite, the only thing stopping is the cooldown. Now, they are limited, but they still didn't balance thing toward it. Aka, your health is really low.
- Enemies spawn are unbalanced and it feels like they designed it with a top down perspective in mind. Now that 80% of borgs and 70% of bugs have armor, the game wants you to shoot at weakpoint of the enemies. But it's impossible with how little they are and how flinchy you are when shot, and also the fact that there are 3000 enemies behind you. The bots are much worse compared to the bugs, since their headshot hitbox is just so tiny.
- Resupply is now shared, but to compensate they want you to explore the maps to find more. It's an okay incentives, but there should be at least two resup with how people in this game like to play solo...
- Now that the camera isn't tethered, the most efficient way is to actually split up. That and to grind for the super credit. For those who say that the grind is ""Not that bad"", it is not true. The grind is super slow, both normal progression and super credit
- Even normal progression felt really slow compared to HD1, everything takes around 3-5x longer. The super credit one (for those who plan to play the full content with just the base) are rng. You will first need to find a point of interest, hope that point of interest spawn super credit instead of: medals, weapons, ammo, samples. So not only you need to hope you find that point of interest, you need to hope that it spawns super credit. Oh and you only get around 20 SC per spot, each mission at most might have 3 (higher diff seems to be more likely). So yeah, I expect around 30-40 hours of grind to unlock the next warbond for free. 
- Balancing is all over the place, they didnt learn from HD1 at all. 95% of lodout is useless in higher difficulty, everyone only wants to play railgun. It's boring and not fun.
- Patrols are indistinguishable  compared to normal enemies
- Your radar is weak, so you will get caught by something
- Very bad optimization, low setting is impossible to play

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also HELLDIVER 2'S nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike HELLDIVERS 2 truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in HELLDIVERS 2's existential catchphrase ""HELLDIVERS 2,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Duck Duck Zeus's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂

And yes, by the way, i DO have a HELLDIVERS 2 tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

however, it is (due to being an indi game and early on in it's life time) quite buggy, making it sort of frustrating to play sometimes. I have not doubt that once this game is through the teething stage it will be much smoother and more polished but until then it is what it is.

Edit: Recent patches have alleviated much of the issues. No, giving an always online game a bad review because they didn't plan to have their game which they designed to be scalable for whatever success they may have isn't wrong. Anything else is basically agreeing with the Triple A mega studios are the only ones that can deliver a seamless experience and seeming they were able to handle the ""issue is on the back end"" pretty well I'm going to log this under self made problem with simpler than they'd like to admit solutions. 

As for the game it's a blast. Don't get to attached to surviving as it's the mission that matters soldier!

This iteration of Helldivers is still engaging when it works but you'll notice some performance issues here or there. With that being said, many players have experienced several issues that continue to persist.

Issues:
1) Game Guard failed to connect (I've had to attempt to launch the game a couple of times before I have a successful connection)
2) Black screen. In the instance that Game Guard does connect, sometimes a black screen is met with no audio. There doesn't seem to be a consistent solution to this issue that occurs and we'll likely have to wait for a patch to fix it.
3) Random crashes (This just occurred a few minutes before I started typing up this review. I was in a group of four and loading into a mission but the game crashed and I was prompted to write an error report to PlayStation Studios)

Conclusion:
The game is fun when it does work but at its current state, it's best to let Arrowhead continue patching up the issues that keep hindering this game. I am puzzled as to how much testing was conducted prior to the launch as the issues that occurred at launch has had some patches.

I purchased the game and requested a refund after the first two mentioned issues just prevented me from playing the game back on Feb 20th. But after I saw some patch notes stating fixes to Game Guard connection and the Black screen, I decided to trust Arrowhead and re-purchase the game again and try it out. Hopefully, Arrowhead gets things resolved and we'll get a consistent and functioning game. But with things as they are now for the game, understand that the game is buggy and will be buggy until things are patched up.

Hopefully six months from now things will be stable and by then you'll catch the game on the summer sale.",1708838450,1708838496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I like it so far I'm hoping they do good on the updates and fixes. Not a fan of the Micro transactions never will be. Any game where you pay for the game should not have ANY micro transactions. if it's free to play I understand gotta earn money but not when you pay for the game. The game itself is fun and honestly hilarious. Movement to me seems pretty good just sometimes feels like it twitches when turning. Really immersive on the whole when you get hit you FEEL it which I personally like. I got gunned down by my own sentry turret which made me laugh pretty good. Also blew up a teammate with an orbital strike... and an air strike... and maybe Steve ( my turret ) might have blown one of his arms off...  I threw it and they kind of just kept going toward it :l not sure why but eh for democracy right? and that bug used him as a perfect shield smart bugs lol. 

Really needs a Host migration rather than kicking the whole team if the host leaves/dc's. Also needs to fill in the teams more often between missions if some leave. Kind of sucks when someone joins lands it's a bad land, they die once and then leave. Had a mission where we were done and going to evac and the host quit so lost us all of that time. :l just don't like feeling like I'm playing for nothing cause someone bails. Still like the game and have alot of fun and it's still early so hopefully this gets addressed soon.

Switched to No since I haven't been able to play it. Servers need to get fixed. Let me in for a while but on higher difficulty the ""anti tank"" lock on would not function properly. Also the spawn rate for tanks/Heavy is honestly a bit high for the extract personnel missions ( especially if the ""anti tank"" weapons aren't functioning ). Had a few matches where it wouldn't let certain players respawn. Just sucks when you're trying to use the main anti tank weapon and it doesn't function where the spawn for tanks is very high.

HELLDIVERS 2 does an even better job compared to its predecessor at making you feel like you are part in an actual galactic war on two different fronts.

The atmosphere starts as soon as you launch the game and you will be dragged right into the fight for Super Earth.

Arrowhead keeps the whole community up to date on their Discord with a High Command Dispatch Channel and the newest major orders that everyone can follow for more rewards, what planets have been liberated or have fallen and what stratagem is sometimes available by the gamemaster. 

They also have been pushing updates out almost daily now, fixing the server issues and increased the player cap, while also squishing a lot of them bugs (pun intended).

The gunplay feels great. All the weapons feel punchy, sound amazing and shooting off different body parts and the armor of the different enemy types feels perfect. 
HELLDIVERS 2 also looks stunning, explosions look cinematic as hell.

Fighting the Termites feels completely different compared to fighting the Automatons too. The first one feels like you are playing Starship Troopers with your friends, while the second faction feels like fighting against robots from the movie Terminator.

With how active Arrowhead is, how passionate they appear to be and how this game has huge potential to keep expanding as the galactic map has at least a hundred different planets that will probably become available to play on at some point, HELLDIVERS 2 has to be one if not the best game to come out in the last two years.

Speaking of huge potential, the first game actually had three factions. So I would not be surprised if the Illuminites show up at the bottom of the galactic map or if they would even add a fourth factions to fight against at the top.

All in all, I highly recommend everyone who is even remotely into shooters to check this game out or try it for less than 2 hours to then refund it, if they do not like it.

The gameplay, much like the delicate dance of the Bar-ba-loots in the Truffula forest, is a synchronized symphony of strategy and cooperation. The cooperative multiplayer aspect is a true testament to the power of teamwork, a lesson we can all learn from nature.

The graphics, reminiscent of the vibrant colors of a Tufted Mazurka flower, are a feast for the eyes. The lush environments and intricate details transport players to a world where the stakes are high, much like the precious balance of ecosystems in our own reality.

Now, the weapons! Just as I guard the last Truffula seed with determination, Helldivers 2 provides an arsenal that ignites the spirit of justice. The variety of weapons feels as diverse as the flora and fauna in the Once-ler's untouched Thneedville.

And let us not forget the overarching theme of freedom, echoing the Lorax's plea to speak for the trees. Helldivers 2 embodies the spirit of liberation, reminding players that each battle fought is a step towards reclaiming the world from the oppressive forces, much like our fight against deforestation.

I must say, this game has stolen my heart, and I find myself, much like the Lorax, spending countless hours immersed in its beauty and excitement. It's a virtual journey that resonates with the call to protect our environment, making it not just a game, but a meaningful experience that will leave a lasting impact on players.

A unique method for calling in tactical support and making players both feel invincible and hopelessly outmached, seamlessly transitioning between these feelings throughout the course of a match.

Should be the standard for what live service should mean; something that's used to support gameplay and make the players actions involved in the game. 

Awe-inspiring conflict, wartime horror, and farcical comedy all come together in a game that displays its inspirations with pride and will hopefully change how we look at the way online games and third person shooters going forward.

As of 2/19/2024, there are server issues due to an overwhelming number of concurrent players, leading to long wait times to launch the game. Devs have been transparent and incredibly swift with expanding capacity and improving stability since launch, and have earned my confidence that this will not be a permanent issue.

As of 2/24/24 the sever issues mentioned above have been largely fixed; player capacity has been increased and measures have been introduced to keep up stability during times of high player count.

You heard right, no 100€ DLC Packs like Destiny 2, what you buy, you get.

Gunplay is statisfying, for a Thirdperson/Firstperson game (change perspective while aiming) both perspective views handle the weapon great, and i see me often switch from tps to fps.

Helldivers 2 is what i expected Destiny 2 to be, wich im glad i bought this game, instead being a poor sucker who wasted their life with Midstiny 2.

The game, set in a satirical and dystopian future, tasks players with working together to combat a variety of alien threats, emphasizing teamwork, strategy, and precision.

The visuals in ""Helldivers 2"" have received a significant upgrade, with more detailed environments and character models, making the chaotic battles even more immersive. The game's sound design is equally impressive, with an engaging soundtrack and sound effects that perfectly complement the on-screen action.

One of the game's strengths is its depth of gameplay. With a wide array of weapons, perks, and stratagems, players can tailor their characters to suit their playstyle or the needs of their team. This level of customization adds to the game's replayability, encouraging players to experiment with different combinations to overcome the increasingly challenging missions.

The cooperative play is where ""Helldivers 2"" truly shines. The game requires players to communicate and coordinate their actions carefully, as friendly fire is always on, adding an extra layer of tension and strategy to the missions. This can lead to exhilarating moments of triumph and, occasionally, hilarious mishaps when things don't go as planned.

However, the game is not without its faults. The difficulty can sometimes feel unforgiving, especially for newer players or those venturing into missions solo. While this steep learning curve can be rewarding, it might deter less experienced players. Additionally, the matchmaking system could be improved to facilitate smoother connections and a more streamlined experience when joining games in progress.

In conclusion, ""Helldivers 2"" is a worthy successor that takes everything great about the original and amplifies it. Its challenging gameplay, deep customization options, and focus on cooperative play make it a must-play for fans of the series and newcomers alike. While it may not be for everyone due to its high difficulty level, those who embrace its challenges will find a deeply rewarding and fun experience.",1708833273,1708833273,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game is some of the most fun I've had with a coop shooter in a long time however to act like their isn't major flaws is absurd. For starters this game is full of bugs, the game has only been out for two weeks however a large amount of bugs reported have yet to be patched and while most of these are harmless and sometimes funny, a few of them create major flaws with the game play and can be incredibly frustrating like having an airstrike get called on top of you because the game decided to spawn that instead of the supply pack you called for. I have also managed to fall under the map twice however those could be excused as one off things. Another thing that should be noted is that the progression in the game can be slow as outside of strategems, unlocking everything else can be grindy and slow due to samples being somewhat hard to keep and maintain with how often you die in this game and only obtaining low amounts of medals for completing missions making unlocking weapons, boosts, and armour slow to unlock. Weapon balancing is also non-existent as running a grenade launcher with supply pack outclasses every other primary and support having next to no downsides, having one weapon being op would be fine if the other weapons were still viable right? Well good like finding a useful one as all primary weapons do too little damage and don't have enough ammo for multiple enemies and all support weapons are incredibly gimmicky, don't have enough ammo or are just flat out useless. Performance is fine however the game could definitely be running better and this is clearly a result of a lackluster pc port, for context my pc is more powerful than a ps5 and is averaging lower fps than it. I can excuse the game for it as their usually is lots of explosions and enemies rendered on screen at once however this is something you should consider. These are all issues I'm sure will get fixed in later updates however that doesn't excuse the condition of the game now.",1708833171,1708833171,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Requests to developers! 

1.) Airstrikes are too weak. :( Simple.
2.) Siege or defense missions with more enemies, but maybe a gunship or those mechs you've got coming?
3.)Ballistic shield should not be a orbital drop/support call, otherwise it's NEVER more useful than anything else. The jump pack is also absolutely pathetic and can barely be used. Why does it use stamina?

At no point in me saying there should not be any flags in the game is it ""trans-phobic"" this is an opinion and the game is just about ""battling to win an intergalactic struggle to rid the galaxy of the rising alien threats.""
So why was it so wrong of me to have a different opinion when the game has no relevancy to any group in society. 

I would like to add i am not at all trans-phobic, i simply do not care about any of these groups in society. I don't need to support them if i don't want to, I personally see it as if i am not being Disrespectful or discriminating LGBTQIA+ then i shouldn't have to be drowned in Fascism. Its not clear to me why i have to support it and why its forced upon me to have pride in any of theses groups but all i said was an opinion and its unfair i'm not allowed one but you are.

Although this game is very fun this is not how anybody should be treated for having a ""opinion"" and then been slaughtered online for it. I would like you to know i am a christian and i am not at all bothered about there not being anything to support my religion or any religion in fact. 

Why can't we all just get along and play games without Fascism.

There is no BS, no paying for power, no paying for shortcuts to max level, no RNG, no dumb crap about unlocking characters in battlepasses.  You don't have to worry about FOMO, you don't have to worry about lootboxes of any kind.  Everything that modern games do, with MTX shops, this game doesn't do.  You don't have to spend a dime beyond paying for the game itself.  You have a chance to get all currencies in missions, so long as you're even a little bit observant, you can get the premium currency totally without spending a dime.  

As for gameplay, it is superb.  Difficulty is balanced around having four people in your team. That means, you're going to have a very, very rough time if you want to play solo, even though you could theoretically do so if you're that good, it is unlikely for the average player, so while there are some speed bumps towards finding matches from time to time, that's only due to it being a brand new game with new game hiccups.  Overall, its a relieving form of challenging, its not artificially difficult, no more than any other four player horde shooter ever has been, at least.

There's a very solid game loop.  Some objectives and missions are much easier than others, some are more difficult, some can be soloed, most require at least some thought to approach if you're on your own, or backup to ensure that you're not caught exposed on your own.  Enemy variety is very respectable, every enemy has their own unique set of pros and cons, and there's plenty of ways to deal with them with the available tools.  That's key to making a fun game that has a long life span in my humble view, its specifically oriented towards letting people find their own approaches and gameplay preference and style.  If you like to hold down the fort with heavy BRRT guns, there's an option for that.  If you prefer being the sneaky stealthy playstyle, that's very well supported.  

As far as I'm concerned, this game has the potential to go hard over a long, long time.  The explosion of players alone is evidence that its a beloved, extremely appealing game.  I've sunk 50 hours in at time of this review, and I can easily see myself putting in ten times that over the next few months alone, maybe even more.  I love PVE horde shooters, and this game has a very positive experience and its community is very knowledgeable and welcoming.  That's a recipe for success.

Its well worth the buy.  Take your time learning the mechanics, once you have them learned, you'll do extremely well for yourself.  Have fun, and lets spread some Democracy!",1708831796,1708831796,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The PlayStation network linked to your Steam account is NOT REQUIRED TO PLAY ON PC!!!  I tried linking my accounts (like a good little monkey).  The setup process to create a PlayStation account could have been better just for the validation process.  At one point, I became super frustrated and was ready to quit and get a refund (but obviously, I did not).

TUTORIAL NOTES:

* The tutorial ends when you get launched up to your ship.
* Follow directions and use the indicated keyboard keys, such as [tab], for the mini-map hold-toggle (yeah, a hold-toggle is annoying, but I'm unsure if there's a way to change/modify it). 
* You can rebind the keys AFTER; do not be tempted to rebind before boarding your ship.
* There is no jump function; you can vault over objects with the [space-bar] or just run/sprint [shift] at them. 
* Make sure to stand in the right spot; for example, when planting the flag on the platform, do not walk off the platform's edge when saluting the flag.
* You must use the number keys to switch weapons instead of the mouse wheel - Is there a way to change/modify it? 

SOLO ONLINE VS COOP: 

The game is really designed for cooperative play.  It's possible to solo play in the sense of ""matchmaking"" with a few random players that you do not know.  I have not come across unfriendly of selfish players (hoping it stays that way too).

I'll review the game more as I play through.",1708107223,1708831533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

They have put out multiple ""fixes"" that weren't properly tested and just break even more. My 3 hours of playtime is 90% waiting for something to work. Too bad I cannot refund it now. Seriously, just wait.

Helldivers is a third person shooter set in a dystopian future where players, as elite soldiers, fight bugs and robots to protect Super Earth. Its fast-paced, strategic gameplay emphasizes teamwork, offering a variety of weapons and dynamic missions. Challenging but rewarding, Helldivers is a must-play for fans of cooperative shooters.

If you are waiting for this game to go on sale, it needs to be at the top of your wishlist. If you think that the $40 price tag IS the sale-nope. This game costs less than almost every AAA game that has come out this year, and (IMO) it blows them all out of the water.

The gameplay loop is incredibly tight. You shoot bugs/bots-either they explode into tiny pieces, or you do-then you run to the next objective and do it all over again. You COULD optimise the shit our of every part of the game, but unlike other games, that is the WORST way to play Helldivers 2. This game puts fun above all else, and is the only live service model that I've seen today that is not: 1. Incredibly predatory with Micro transactions 2. Drip feeding content to try and string you along 3. Lock everything behind a gigantic grind so that you'll be maxing out your playtime just to get a passable loadout.

You become a orbital drop shock trooper known as a hell diver! Massive explosion, huge hordes of bugs(who escaped from our farms where we harvest them for oil) and anti freedom bots. 

The game is very simple.
Drop in, do objectives (S&D/Capture/Evac/Extract)
Collect samples well doing said mission (Samples are shared so it doesnt matter who extracts them!)
Also earn Eagles and Super Credits(cash shop currency) by hitting up Point of Interests in the game, you very well can buy the premium pass with out buying the 60/70$ version of the game.

Can you run Solo? YES! though once you hit tier 7-9 it will dif become a lot harder to do it soloable but dif not impossible (well unless its the event Defend missions where you gotta evac peeps)

Weapon wise! theres 2 type of weapons Primary and Support.

Primary weapons you unlock with eagles in the semi battlepass. Eagles are earned from completing missions and finding them in missions so dif hit up those point of interest! 

Support weapons are ones you call in and generally have small to very long cooldowns. from machine guns all the to a railgun/Javelin missiles (its called SPEAR)

Surprise surprise, it dropped concurrent player counts by 25% the first day lol. There are still some balance issues, and they need to add player advancement options for levels 21-50 beyond just titles, but it's nothing game breaking any more.

------------------------------

TL;DR - If you buy it now you'll just be paying to wait in a queue and then get constant disconnects. Wait for them to fix it first, rather than paying for the privilege of stress testing.

The game is amazingly fun, when you can play it. That last is key, because despite selling over a million copies their system can't handle even 400k concurrent players. The issue has been going on for over a week, and results in a multitude of game play issues. For example, so far my gaming group and I have frequently experienced:

- Disconnects resulting in loss of all progress in a mission because rewards aren't given until completion. This has happened during the reporting after a mission. And on top of it, you get stuck back in the logon queue.
- Character freezing for 30 seconds on looting anything, only able to turn the camera
- No loot or xp after a successfully completed mission
- Inability to unlock any upgrades or purchase anything with medals - When holding down the Confirm button it finishes, then goes grey and nothing happens
- Random deaths from cause ""unknown""
- Escort missions on easy difficulty that drop 100+ robots on you in under 2 minutes.
- ""Quick play"" that doesn't actually work. The best people can recommend on reddit is ""spam it and hope for the best"", whatever the hell that means.
- The game completely locking up when the host leaves, causing you to have to ALT-F4 it.
- The logon server not actually queuing people, and instead letting them in randomly. For example, I've been able to connect multiple times while someone sitting a room away was waiting for over an hour.

When this game first launched it was nearly impossible to consistently get into any missions. Disconnects, crashes, log in failures, and servers being overloaded were preventing anyone and everyone from playing. It wasn't ideal, especially on the weekends. However, after weeks of nonstop work, Arrowhead Game Studios has finally got this game in a stable and working state. It truly is incredible how much effort they have put in since launch to get this game going. On paper, praising a developer for getting their game actually working post-launch is kind of sad, but I cannot stress how insane of a launch this game had compared to their previous game. 

When the original Helldivers launched on Steam after being a Playstation exclusive it had an all-time peak player count of 6,691 players. As of writing, in the past 24 hours Helldivers 2 has had an all-time peak player count of 458,709 players. That is insane. That's a 6755% increase between the two games. To say Helldivers 2 is a success would be an understatement. This might be the Game of the Year and I say that without a hint of sarcasm. However, with that success came the server issues where no one could play. Nobody, not even Arrowhead Game Studios saw this coming. So the fact they got this game's server capacity upgraded and fixed a deluge of connectivity issues in such a short time is incredible. I had set my original review to Not Recommend because at one point I couldn't even play the game during the weekend. That isn't fun and I wouldn't recommend that experience (or lack thereof) to anyone, but I knew they would turn things around and I am very glad to they did.

As for the game itself, it's incredible. Truly a unique and exciting experience. The gun play is fantastic. The enemies are brutal and varied. The SFX for explosions and fire elevate the combat to cinematic events. The community is wonderful, especially when it comes to in-game events. There are micro-transactions, but this might be the first game I've seen in a long long time where micro-transactions are actually micro. A set of armor costs like $2 and you can earn the in-game currency by playing missions and finding it on the maps. It takes a while, but you can also accrue enough to even buy the premium gear. There is a bit of toxicity and griefing in the game due to there being friendly fire. Game hosts can also kick anyone at anytime for any reason and I have myself been booted from games while waiting for extraction at the end, so I didn't get any rewards for the mission. I'm sure the developer will work on alleviating some of these issues, but for now all you can do is just block players and move on.

In conclusion, this game is another win for the right side of history. For Super Earth!

1. I'll do a 40 minute mission in a random lobby, then the host will kill me and kick me 10 seconds before the extraction ship arrives.  I'll load back into my own ship with ZERO rewards having wasted 40 minutes of my time for some jackoff to get a chuckle.

2. Level 6 cadets making really high difficulty lobbies and only loading out with machine guns.  I have to sort through so many of these before I find a group that has anti armor stuff.  When I do find a game that's not all cadets, the situation in 1 happens half the time.

These wouldn't be as big of an issue if you could just block people, but the feature to see who you've recently played with doesn't work half the time and when it does, you have to memorize the names of the people in the game because it won't tell you which ""Recently played"" people were in your last game.

""Just play with friends!""  I shouldn't have to exclusively play with friends or alone to have a good experience with a game that's been designed and balanced around group play.",1708828671,1708828671,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a test that you pass or a quest that you fail. A race against time. Fun and battle always lock together. But the game is also something else. It's a journey; a passport to new worlds, maybe even an odyssey. A look, a feel, an exploration, close your focus and open your mind. Yes, the journey requires the right ticket, and that ticket is an online connection to the damn server that might not let you go in because it's saturated!!

 They've expanded server's capacity, so let's hope they can hold up the influx of players right now. That being said, there's a couple things I don't like, comparing it with the previous game:

[list]
[*] They nerfed the Jump Pack, now it has a cooldown and doesn't require fuel. This means you have to wait about 15 seconds per jump, while you could jump as soon as you wanted as long as you had fuel on the previous game; also, with the changes on gameplay, the Jump Pack lacks the same maneuverability it used to have (like jumping a charger, which can be done, but it's not as reliable as before).

[*] The armament selection is disappointing, and we're not getting crazy stuff like the Justice that punched through enemies, the Suppressor which was a rifle with actual explosive bullets (as in, it does AoE damage and you can kill yourself with it, ""Explosives"" in this game only deall more damage to squishy parts, and you can shoot at the floor on your feet and get no damage, cause there's no proper explosion), or the ever hated Trident (Laser Shotgun). I hope we get something good as things goes on, cause right now most of the guns are lacking power, and the Breaker is ruling supreme. The Scorcher is in the game too, but I have yet to see if it does AoE damage as in the previous game, and also burns anyone caught in the area.

[*] Armors now have an effect on you instead of being just cosmetics, so you better pay attention to what you're wearing, or you might start running slow cause your armor is heavy, or taking more damage cause it's light (but you move faster), amongst other effects they might have.

[*] We are lacking A LOT of firepower, and the counterplay for tanks was shifted from ""Blow it with an orbital strike, a nuke or anything strong enough"" to ""Blow it's armor with the Railgun, and pray you do enough damage on the squishy parts to kill it"". You can still blow them with a stratagem, but there's like 2 that will do so efficiently, and they have heavy cooldowns (about 2 minutes, which means you're on your own against the rest of the tanks that might spawn, or survived your strike).

[*] Progression is locked into a Battle Pass, and while it is not as awful as every other garbage pass, it might be annoying for many players because that's how you unlock weapons. For instance, to get the Scythe (laser rifle) you need about 160 medals spent, and then like 30 for the gun itself (you get about 10 per full mission, so it's not as bad as it might seem).

[*] Guns are not upgradeable, your only choice is to grind the battle pass and try an alternative version of it (Say... Liberator Penetrator, an alternative version of the first gun you get in game), and as I said before, a lot of these guns feel underwhelming (hopefully they will buff them, instead of being lazy and nerfing the breaker).

[*] Samples are split on 3 ranks, which means you can't just take it easy and grind away on low levels (as in the first game) to arm yourself for higher challenges.
[/list]

 Keep in mind that while the game has a battle pass and a ""premium store"" that only sells skins, you can get the premium currency by just playing and exploring around (I think you get like 10 super credits per cache found on a mission).

 Overall, the game has a lot of potential, and I hope it doesn't disappoint. I also hope they give me my Shredder back and unnerf the jump pack, I WANT MY NUKE GOD DAMMIT!!.",1708474843,1708827362,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

You feel the cooling waters of the creek dance over your Hell Diver armor. You take 2.4 seconds, as allowed by Super Earth high command, to glance up into the night sky. You see the violet moon with stars littering the sky. Your short peace is interrupted by a binary language echoing in the nearby trees. You feel a cold sweat run down your nose are you try to pinpoint where the noise is coming from. It surrounds you like deaths cold embrace. Then you see it, an Automaton assembly plant with a patrol coming out of it. 

You slowly rise from the creek that gave you but a moment of peace and wade through the water towards the patrol. Your ears begin to ring as your finger holds down the trigger of your SG-225 Breaker. You can't help but to grin as oil and bolts dance into the night sky and your bullets shred through alloy of an unknown origin.

Then you hear it, ""Requesting air support"". You glance towards your left and see a fellow Hell Diver, a brother in arms, throwing down 500kg of pure liber-tea onto the assembly plant. You stand together, both saluting the most awesome display of firepower either of you have ever seen. Oil, metal and fire sting your Hell Diver suit like a tsunami from Hell. You feel none of that though, for the only thing you feel is sweet democracy coursing through your veins. 

Glorious Victory.

You return to orbit, suits covered in oil and scorch marks. A good start to the day. The ships TV turns on, you eagerly await a new tip from General Brasch himself... but wait, something is different this time.

It was never really more than a cult classic at best, but I think it had a good niche that it hit.  Top-down coop shooters like Helldivers and Magicka were what I knew Arrowhead for, anyway.  My friends reassured me that Helldivers 2 would be impossible to mess up.  If they treated it like Risk of Rain 2 and ported the formula directly over to 3D, it would be an amazing game.

After 50 hours and counting in the game, I am glad to say that Helldivers 2 is an amazing return to form for Helldivers and the gaming industry as a whole.  It truly is Helldivers 1 in 3D, with an amazing setting, fun tools, and two unique enemy factions that really package two games into one.  Even as a live service game, the monetization and content are incredibly fair.  All content can be unlocked forever in the future, with a few exceptions (e.g. the preorder bonus), with the premium currency being reasonably collectable in game.  The currencies that are the most important cannot even be bought.  It really puts AAA companies to shame.

The company, developers, and CEO have been incredibly transparent during the process, and I commend them for iterating so quickly on the game.  It was successful beyond their wildest dreams, and I am glad that it was!  There are still some minor stability issues, but they are much better than at launch, and I do not struggle to have an enjoyable experience in the game.    This is the biggest game I can think of that is so respectful of the player, that makes the player want to play the game, and for only 40 dollars.

[list]
    [*][b]Totally worth the price.[/b]
    [*]For the first 20 hours you are having so much fun.
    [*]Best current co-op game I know about.
    [*]Being clueless about enemy weaknesses makes for a fun adventure. You can learn these by yourself slowly with trial and error to increase the fun times.
[/list]

Some issues:
[list]
    [*]No melee weapons. Where's my chainsaw and laser sword?
    [*]The fun starts to fade after ~30 hours, especially as a solo.
    [*]Server issues made some of my friends lose interest. No friends, less fun to be had.
    [*]Gets maybe a bit too repetitive after a few weeks once you know all the enemies.
    [*]To be able to play higher difficulties you must play 3 missions that can take 40 mins each. Getting this done with the crashes and server issues turned out surprisingly time consuming with crashes/server issues ruining the progress before you get all the three missions done.
    [*]Automaton hostage missions are some of the worst missions in game at higher difficulties due to the base layouts. Both layouts have their own issues.
    [*]Character build options are meaningless outside stratagems and weapons.
    [*]Armor does not even work yet properly, which is weird. You just gimp yourself by selecting anything but the scout option with more speed and stamina.
    [*]The gameplay on higher difficulties rarely supports any other than ""kite kite kite"" style of gameplay. The lack of quiet moments is an issue when the mission can last for 40 mins.
    [*]Stratagem scrambling gets old real fast.
    [*]Team work weapons just suck compared to Railgun since it allows you to kite and shoot. Team mate reloading your weapon means you have two immobile helldivers.
    [*]Cosmetic options/rewards are a bit dull to my liking.
    [*]You'll only turn out to use 1 out of 10 the wide stratagem options, which is a shame.
    [*]Higher difficulties are less fun in how they actually play out, but you feel like gimping yourself on rewards when playing on lower difficulties. You can't really go out styling in difficulty 9 which makes it less fun and more of a grind.
[/list]

Even with a big list of issues, I can easily recommend the game due to the initial happy fun times. If you don't like crashes and server issues, wait a few months. The fun will only vanish by playing too much yourself.",1708826728,1708826728,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The Live Service elements are implemented in a really clever way, with updates and new maps coming in the form of an ever changing warfront and while there are technically microtransactions in that players can choose to purchase premium currency for additional cosmetics, that's only necessary if you're impatient - absolutely everything, premium currency included, can be EARNED through regular play, and at none too slow a pace either. After one session in the game, I'd racked up enough 'premium' currency to buy quite a few of the cash shop items. Players can also earn a fairly substantial series of gameplay unlocks, including new weapons, new combat stratagems (powerful abilities your Helldiver can request in battle like Orbital Strikes) and new gear with a range of perks that help fine tune your character to your preferred playstyle.

It is worth mentioning that the game has a few minor bugs that can cause getting stuck or falling through the map, but these are infrequent and won't spoil overall enjoyment. Also worth a mention is that while quickplay allows for matching with randoms, even middling and up difficulties are pretty punishing and would probably be best enjoyed with friends.

I will be leaving the old review as testament to how truly hellish logging in was after the game's login count surged.

As for the gameplay, its solid.  There is a desperate need for a balance pass on all the weapons though, as the Breaker is basically the end-all-be-all right now and no other weapon really has even close to its capability to do what a firearm should: kill bugs!.  As for Support weapons, I'd say those need a balance pass too as the Railgun is also an end-all-be-all weapon that nearly invalidates all prior support weapons in all functions but a few (ie, shooting down dropships).  I'm hoping that after all this login nonsense is full sorted they can take a look at player metrics and make it so that we dont have one super-meta build.
All in all, as someone who played Helldivers 1 for too many hours, its a nice difference but I really cant wait to see the EXO-44 Stomper suit and I hope we get some of the other vehicles as well as a weapons balance pass..

As of 19Feb2024, logging in is the next closest thing to impossible.  If you are lucky to make it past the *INCREDIBLY* long black screen of nothingness and get to see the intro, you are then greeted with ""Servers at Capacity. Please try again later.""

This is coming off a double xp weekend where the devs admitted to having to cap active players at 450,000 concurrent (total from both steam and PS5).  Many are just AFKing in their ships when not playing since the game doesnt have an inactivity forced logout system. 

The discord has posts saying the devs are aware and working on patches this week to help but the first isnt even available until tomorrow and its not a silver bullet patch, but an incremental start.  Now, I'm now expert in programming, just do assembly stuff and PLC stuff, but given that it has been like this through the last week, I would have figured they'd have been working on a set of fixes since 12Feb and not just started working on them like they said on 17Feb...

-The game play is appealing from the beginning because you are equipped with plenty of firepower to take care of the bugs on your first few missions. Then as you start to progress and challenge yourself more it evolves into highly intense game play that relies on teamwork to successfully complete objectives. 
-At first I feared that playing this game without friends would be unenjoyable; however, my experience with the random matchmaking and community has been fantastic. The PvE style has seem to prevented a lot of toxicity that can ruin a community. 
-The progression of stratagems and other equipment feels very rewarding as you unlock new weapons/armor/stratagems after every couple of missions. 
-The humor/lore of the game is over the top and a perfect tool for keeping things light in a game that can at times feel overwhelming.

I played 50 Hours, Half of the time is just waiting

Only influencers can, that's interesting.

WELL dramas have been had. started out doing the tutorial no dramas. start to do my part against those pesky clankers drop to planet game crashes. no dramas my drivers are probably out of date so i update them jump back into the game next mission i get 2 steps in game crashes, huh strange right jump online to find some fixes. try everything they suggest. run as administrator dont use a controller run in compatability mode delete the anti cheat so reinstalls next log in turn off certain setting still crashes send reports every time just hard crashes to desktop 65 minutes of game play (15 minutes of actual play time) and 5 hours hours of head scratching and reasearch on how to fix issue.

Now, in order:

BUGS

Connection bug in co-op when you spawn.
Mobs stand still when they spawn until you hit them.
Co-op doesn't always work.
SUGGESTIONS

Customization.
More explosions and destruction.
Boat customization.
Vehicles for interaction (mechs, tanks, etc.).
Traps for mobs.
Diversify mobs (like Terminators) because they are all the same.
Where are the caves?!
Where are the megabosses?
Bunkers that need defending, fortresses.
Where are the swords?
Where epic music for fight ?!

На даний момент сировато, але грати можна, механіки ігрові доволі примітивні, немає техніки зовсім, костюми одноманітні і по суті мало що дають, короче поле непахане, це вам не батлфронт

А тепер по порядку;

БАГУЛІ
1. Баг підключення в кооп, коли ти зявляешься
2. Моби купою стоять коли зявляються, поки їх не пнеш
3. КООП не завжди працює


ПРОПОЗИЦІЇ
1. Кастомізацію
2. Більше вибухів і руйнувань
3. Кастомізацію човна
4. Техніку для взаемодіх ( мехів, танків, тощо )
5. Пастки для мобів
6. Потрібно урізноманітнити мобів ( термінаторів наприклад ) їх, бо вони всі однакові
7. Де печери ?!
8. Де мегабоси ?
9. Бункери які потрібно обороняти, фортеці
10. Де мечі ?

What I would like to see is the battlefield pre-seeded with ammo and weapons.  Maybe that would take away from the game and make it like every other shooter, but it would be better than having four players wandering around the map with their d*ck in their hand waiting for resupply to cool down.  And having one player gallivanting around and giving his all while waiting for reinforcements to cool-down is just as bad.

I can see the appeal of the game on the other points, but this just rubs me wrong.",1708822832,1708822832,True,0,0,0,0,True,True,False

First server issues, missions not giving xp or rewards LOL (They gave 50% xp bonus when people cant even log in or complete missions POGGERS), disconnects from server consistently in game, now every time i load up its just a black screen i reinstalled twice nice game. 2-3 patches saying they ""fixed"" servers blah blah. doubt they even did anything but write out the note and send it for the normies to get the bad press away. There is no BALANCE in game. All the armors give the exact amount of hitpoints weather its light or heavy so you might as well run light with the best passive ability you have. all the weapons feel god awful/ waste of money compared to to the BREAKER SHOTGUN which as a primary does more dmg then a SUPPORT/HEAVY weapon. There is loads of stratagems to choose from but players are only gonna bring in 3-4 same ones every game (Railgun, shield gen backpack, 500kg, plus 1). The jetpack is so garbage you can use it twice during a 10min mission and it doesnt even take you that far LMAO.  dont even need a tier list. Give it a month when the hype dies down and there is only under 100k-50k playerbase. this game is extremely grindy so most players will likely drop it under 200hrs. 60-100 common samples just for tier 1 upgrades LOL. There is a paid battlepass where you can only get weapons and armor from giving out more money oh and it probably takes 1k medals or more to even get half the items on the pass on there and half of them are useless nerf guns so good luck. hopefully in a month this is more fleshed out game with balanced weapons that all have a use an dont feel useless and actually armor values that are implemented in the game.

TLDR: GOOD GAME, BAD SERVERS, UNBALANCED.

Edit: The developers never gave up and day by day they patched the servers making them working. Great visuals, amazing immersive game play. Armor and weapons still unbalanced when writing this.

It's a lot of fun and I do recommend you play it if you like this sort of game and especially if you have 3 other friends who do as well because the time I have gotten to play it's amazing, but I'd say hold off until after people give up on the game and it brings the player base down to something that will allow you to play even if the wait is like 30 mins.

**update**. Changing recommendation. 

Don't misunderstand, this is a fun game and the devs have done a good job creating something fresh and exciting. 

But at the moment this game has way too many teething issues that need to get sorted by the devs. Higher server cap is a must! 

Fixing game crashes needs to be addressed as well as way too many disconnects. 

Players are getting stuck when grabbing anything from containers, and unable to claim an item when using credits, samples etc - apparently a, 'server at max cap', issue. There should've been more foresight on the devs part! 

When the game works - it works. But I can't give this a recommended until the devs address the aforementioned issues.

** Last update**

The developers have appeared to fix the server cap issue and any issues related to the game crashing among others. Invariably this game has suffered at launch due to its own success and I'd rather see that than something simply half baked to screw the consumer while profiting the investors.

Shooting is satisfying and there's a nice number of weapons, the soundtrack is fantastic, and enemies don't feel unfair to fight against. 
My only critiques are probably more personal nitpicks that I'd like to see changed. For starters the music needs more tracks as it's just a bit too repetitive. I won't deny that its a real banger of a soundtrack, and the composer should be fucking proud, but hearing the same music over and over, yeah, needs a bit more variety there.  
Speaking of variety, I feel there aren't enough enemy types at the moment. So far its only the bug aliens, and the mechanoids. Would be nice to have a couple more factions or races to fight against. I know in the first game there were only 3, and given this sequel has a much higher budget I'd love to see a much bigger number this time around. 
It had an extremely rocky start though, with servers being ""at capacity"", and people unable to play until just recently because of it (and by recently I mean like, until 2 days ago). So the negative reviews are more than deserved on that front.  
Overall though, a really fun game that I'd say is now worth $40. I've had tons of fun with it so far. Highly recommended ",1708304300,1708821199,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is simply amazing the most fun I have had in a multi-player games in years. PVE with 4 man squads bringing democracy to insectiods and robots regardless of if they want it or not.

There is a solid variety of missions and as you increase the difficult settings you will get more missions and multi-mission groups with increased medals(used to unlock new gear) with each mission in a series that you complete. This can be anything from destroying enemy bases, to turning on supply pumps, launching an ICBM, taking out enemy elites etc... Missions can also have modifiers from simply to day vs. night, heavy fog, and jamming beacons. 

There is a lot of customization from your armor, to your weapons, and stratagems. Stratagems are orbital support from your ship. Calling down advanced weapons, or calling in air strikes or orbital bombardment, or reinforcements if a squad-mate dies. 

Where this game shines is in the combat and the pressure it puts on you and the squad. Enemies can call in reinforcements. Running into a random patrol or trying to take out an enemy base an result in multiple waves of reinforcements coming in from different directions including various tiers of elites that cannot be taken out with standard weapons easily. Frantically calling in air support or orbital strikes while running/dodging away from enemy attacks is amazing chaos.

With being able call in reinforcements to bring dead squad mates back into the fight death you are never out of the action for to long. 

I also want to mention on high/ultra settings the game looks great. Planets are distinctly different, lots of terrain variety. The effects of air strikes, and explosions and enemy attacks make it look like a cinematic war film at times.

The servers seem to have been fixed. The devs released 2 patches over the past few days. One of them increased the capacity, and the other added an afk kick system. (Which is hilarious, because I think a good portion of the capacity issue was caused by people leaving the game running for hours to “reserve their slot” after they finally did connect) But since these patches, I haven't experienced a single issue connecting to the game. And I've been playing during peak time.
The other issue people seem to have with the game is the “nprotect” anti-cheat. Admittedly, I don’t know much about the software, So I’ll keep this brief. The software has no noticeable impact on game performance or the operation of your PC. Feel however you may about the actual effectiveness of anti-cheat, but the borderline conspiracy theories about “kernel level hijacking,” “data stealing”, and whatnot seem overly paranoid and unfounded. It’s just anti-cheat, chill. Chances are you play several other games with similar software running in the background. It’s kinda lame, but it is what it is.

Onto the game itself, it’s awesome. The progression is steady. Everything feels viable (at least in certain scenarios) from weapons, artillery, gadgets, and more. And it’s easy to find a playstyle that suits you and synergizes with your team. Progression is also steady; there’s always something exciting that you’re “Just a few more credits/medals” away from unlocking.

The game is surprisingly immersive. I love the way most of the UI comes from your ship, rather than a boring list of menus. And the ODST drop sequence when starting a mission never stops feeling bad@ss. It also creates a really funny parody of…a certain country’s military and the community larping is awesome.

Gameplay is intense, and the action is non-stop. Most things (like interacting with objectives, calling in support, and reviving teammates) require this Konami code-style sequence of directional inputs, which should be super annoying; but there’s nothing like being pinned down and surrounded by gunshots and explosions while you keep frantically f*cking up the command to call in an airstrike. There are also several difficulty options ranging from too easy, to manageable, to an unrelenting onslaught of totally unfair bullsh*t. The great thing about it is that you can play on whatever difficulty you’re comfortable with, without feeling like you’re missing out or being punished for it.

And finally, the devs actually nail monetization. It technically has a “battle pass” system, but it does 2 things really well. It doesn’t expire, meaning you’re not pressured into playing the game like a full-time job just to unlock everything. And the “premium battle pass” can actually be unlocked without having to spend a dime, since the free version will give you enough currency to purchase it by the end. There’s still a rotating “Fortnite store” of cosmetics, which I’m not a fan of, but the $1 to $2 asking price for most items is leagues better than paying $15 to $20 for color swatches in most other AAA titles.

Well, that’s about it. Take the complaints about servers and nprotect with a massive grain of salt. If you’ve seen gameplay and you think you’ll like it, you probably will. So as the subreddit would say, join the fight for freedom, and liberty, and honor, and democracy, and stuff. (Also, I really want those 12k credits. So if you could help us kill the robots, that would be great!)",1708820020,1708820020,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing for a while now and i can say i have became addicted to this game. Yes, it's got a lot of negative reviews because it had a rocky launch, but we are getting there. The developers already proved that they are working hard to fix the issues the divers are having. 

For example in the past 2 days i have not experienced the servers at full capacity anymore. And to be honest, they probably didn't expect such a success at the beginning either, so let's not be harsh there.

IF YOU WANT TO BUY THE GAME BUT YOU ARE SCEPTICAL BECAUSE OF THE ANTI - CHEAT

Dude, just buy it. In eastern Europe growing up everybody played Metin2 for example, and they had a very similar anti-cheat if not the same one. Nobody ever ""hacked"" me or anything, and nobody will now. Do you think that the developers will let that happen when they became so successful and also rick a lawsuit? No.

Gameplay its amazing, the CHAOS makes the whole experience. You are always on the go, running and gunning, fighting alongside your comrades and ""Doing your part"". There is plenty of content to begin with and even tho you got the same main objectives in a kind of mission, it will always run different. The new content will come, we just need to be patient.

My long-term concern for the game is that as the hype dies down, less people will play, and it'll be difficult to find groups.  I guess the one thing I would say negatively about the gameplay is that I feel like I run out of ammo way too frequently, so the game feels more like just trying to train mobs away so I can complete the objectives, instead of full on killing.

Good:
- visual and sound design; game looks amazing, style is rather consistent, music and sound effects are great.
- gunplay; guns feel amazing, sound amazing and produce nice feedback, gory and meaty. Also some of the weapons can be operated in pairs, which is a super cool mechanic.
- gameplay loop; it's mindless fun, shooting enemies and then producing epic explosions sending parts of enemies flying feels really great, and there isn't anything this good on the market.
Questionable:
- UI/UX; sometimes you're not given any information regarding values, like you don't know how much damage stratagems deal, ammo reserves of weapons, etc. Also, you can't leave the squad, only quit the game(?). No reconnect feature for 2024 game is also rather weird, especially since sessions are often 20m+, and losing progress feels bad.
- content; while game was just recently released, it's not an early access title, but amount of enemie types is around 20, for both factions summarised, for example, and some of them are just bigger versions. Not a ton of weapons either, and not many possibilities for a deep buildcrafting. Foundation is definitely there, though, so we'll see how it goes.
Bad:
- servers; while I can sympathize with developers, who did not expect this level of success, current (25.02.24) state is kinda bad - often can not connect to friends or just random games, disconnects, overall weird behavior.
- balance; most of the weapons are not worth taking at all, as well as stratagems. This is caused partially by a weird decision to throw more tanky and armored enemies at players on higher difficulties, instead of more balanced composition and bigger numbers, thus requiring a very specific set of weapons be present at all times, or just dedicating a player for enemy distraction, which breaks game flow significantly. And the difference in performance is so huge it's unclear how developers could miss it, unless nobody checked it, and that possibility raises many more questions.
- bugs; there are some perofrmance issues with AMD hardware, crashes, also at least one system doesn't work at all.",1708049671,1708819370,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I will update this review down the line if they fix things, but I cannot recommend this game currently. 
It's absolutely amazing! It's fun, it runs pretty well, the sounds and music queues are on point, the Starship Troopers vibes are immaculate...

But I've been unable to play this game for about 2/3rds of the time I've owned it. 

The servers are down. Or they're up, but limiting capacity to ""other people can play, but not you, unless you're willing to wait an hour in queue"". Or the game technically works, servers are up, you can get in, but matchmaking is broken. 

It's a great game. But it's a great game, that I paid money for, that I just straight up cannot play despite desperately wanting to.

They left me dammit, We were at the extract but the damn thing took 4 minutes... they said it'd take two, and this abomination of steel had emerged from the horizon line. Soon after our gaze was met by a pillar of fire, untold carnage... i watched the fire spread through our once confident line, we had nothing to compete with the colossus. we all spread in different directions but I knew we had to make that ship... We gathered in the nearby forest and made a plan, the ship had 48 seconds left, we ran and I split to the left of my team, held a flare high and looked at the abomination... I promised them they'd get home.

I watched the ship leave certain my story was to be left to a plaque on an obelisk or a museum, but I was wrong, I was left to the horrors of this place, and never knew there was no choice but to overcome them. I looked at the flare in my hands and heard Hellfighters by Sabaton tune into my comms. The flare grew brighter. I ran towards the cliff and leaped towards the colossus straddling it's back. it's whirring blades of tyranny and fires of subjugation flared towards me but I was unmoved. I ripped the console open and shoved the flare into the circuitry of the machine and watched the lights of the horror thrash and obey my democracy. I leaped off the machine and watched the blast that followed signaling to the automatons they were to be fated to the glory of MY DEMOCRACY! as the blades and metal paneling unraveled itself and the metal demon was felled I left my mark, my words of terror to be written into the code of these bots for millennia.

I played the first Helldivers quite a bit and absolutely loved it, so I was excited when the second one was confirmed. Unfortunately, if what you are expecting is a fully faithful sequel, you will be disappointed. This does NOT, however, mean that the game is bad.

From the time of writing, an entire faction is gone, stratagems and weapons cannot be individually upgraded, there are no vehicles, and the game is no longer top-down, which was enough to make me feel alienated for a while until I got used to the changes.

Teamwork is both more important than the first game, and much harder to achieve in the sequel now that the team is no longer physically forced to stick together like in the first game (due to the top-down gameplay), while also having limited revives.

 From experience in difficulties ranging from 5-9, this has had both positive and negative effects on the individual players, based on their skill level. Experienced players and/or coordinated teams can split up and make missions more efficient, while less experienced or non-communicating teams can and will suffer from a lack of teamwork and being split up, causing them to deplete their reinforcements quickly.

Despite all this, Helldivers 2 was a truly enjoyable experience to me, despite feeling like I was playing an entirely different game, rather than a sequel. If you were holding off on buying it due to launch issues, I'd say you should give it a go now, and see if you like it.",1707513014,1708817588,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

theyre only saying its good bc its popular and theyre making content
for real human people that arent streamers, this game just does not want you to have fun

seriously i hate this game more than anything else on steam and i rly thought i was gonna like it. i was like you once

i was 100% sure i would love it bc it do be like starship troopers
everyone knows Blasting Bugs to Bits w ur Bros is the Best
and this one is fun for a bit if u mess around w friends
but this game is POISONOUS, its:

like the 2nd movie 
(the unfunny cringe one)
the anticheat is a virus
(my computer SUCKed after installing this. 
slideshow youtube videos, browser and gpu driver timeouts and crashes in games, couldnt use vlc, stutters and freezing in other games. 
instantly fixed after uninstalling)

game still crashes every 10 mins
kinda pay 2 win and feels like a free game 
except there arent any fun hi stim slot machines to play
lobbies are all poisoned bc u can't connect to 90% of them
if you host a lobby then no one else can join bc they cant connect either
servers are always full and there isnt a queue so u might be able to play if you wait 20 minutes, but maybe not
movement sucks
game looks and feels 15 years old
like fr it has that mass effect 2/3 ship lobby thing, except this time its this weird little b list coop game youre trying to play on your ps3 but you have closed nat type so you cant join anyone

the way you get good at the game is by using these killstreak things that are on a cooldown. so u just use those instead of your gun bc theyre better and you dont need to worry about aiming
almost everything that kills you is some cheesy scripted shit that you would see in the battlefield 2042 trailer
now your |wicked sick railgun| has a FIVE HUNDRED SECOND cooldown???
and u cant kill armoured enemies with ur default pea shooter
(armoured stuff is 90% of what will kill u in high difficulties)
and these die instantly to your railgun or 110kg eagle bomb, but you cant use them now bc theyre on cooldown


rock paper scissors ahhh
game is so damn CHEESY
its just so so much worse than ppl make it look

Edit:
I was kinda mad when i wrote this review, have to adjust it a bit:
1. The low variety of enemies I mentioned before is not an issue, since you get a variety of missions to choose from. 
2. The exploration aspect during the mission is amazing

HOWEVER for the Studio to recognise the problems and being incredibly clear in communicating that they are trying to resolve them by updating the community nearly daily and to release this super addictive and a ""back in the old days"" type of gaming, which I can only imagine me n my friends reminiscing about in 10 years or so like we do with halo or CoD. All of this AND has a reasonably balanced pricing, this game feels like a diamond a dozen in a toxic money hungry market that wants money first then maybe the game will be fun later on......maybe and Hell-divers 2 proves the opposite. If you make your game fun first then I will happily pay for more and just like this review, will recommend it to everyone",1708816838,1708816838,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I just tested the game shortly playing the tutorial,  because I don't want to start it now, still busy with complete some other games upfront.

[h1] Review Bombing[/h1]
From my perspective so far everything was running quite smooth for me (my specs are at the end of this review) at least in tutorial. In normal missions from time to time I had some crashes (which I was able to avoid after changing graphics settings). For me it seems like the early adopters had some issues because of server connections. But what a suprise, this game immedately was 2nd place in most played games because 50.000 people tried to play it. The game dev's reacted as fast as possible and did already bring a patch which should solve major issues + had an open communication on their discord server + x (twitter) about it. I don't get why people complain about the anti cheat, I mean you can read it up front or refund if you don't like, why they have to review bomb because of anti cheat... I don't get it.
From my perspective the gaming community is not very nice to the dev's, don't be so though and give them a chance. If you would have any clue about software development and golives (especially when 50.000 people want play instant after release) maybe the most people would judge in a different way. Also some others complain about the controls are just made for controllers ans with mouse it doesn't feels natuarl, I doesn't agree. I played a lot of shooters in my life, Counterstrike, Battlefield, The finals... and for me it doesn't seems like anything about the controls is anoying... I'm still loving the way you can call stratagems, for me this is a outstanding feature of this game!

[h1] Game Review[/h1]
About the game, of course I completed Helldivers 100%, I expected to have a kind of a third person shooter just a bit converted from the original. Don't get me wrong I can recommend Helldivers to everybody I had a lot of fun and the fact you were able to have couch coop made it perfect for playing it together with my girlfriend and other friends.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/394510/HELLDIVERS_Dive_Harder_Edition/
This game doesn't has local coop but I don't mind, come on it's a third person shooter, I wouldn't play it on one screen even if it would be possible!
But boy oh boy, what I saw it was more than just changing the perspective of Helldivers 2. I was impressed by new beautiful graphics and also the new content, but more to come. For me it seems like the game sometimes crashed in moments of heavy workload for GPU. After playing Tutorial I tried some missions and had some crashes, but after adjusting graphic settings (disable anti aliasing, v-synch and just turn one graphic settings from utlra to high) no crash occured so far...
After some patches, the game is now stable and I don't have any crashes anymore...
I would love to play it with ultra settings, but it's also looks nice and fun is not restricted by playing on high, it would be good to have a Patch for this asap. 

About the story, already during the first intro cut scene I had to smile several times, come on this is awesome. The first tutorial mission you have to earn you cape and prove you worth to be a helldiver - awesome!

About achievements, reading through it, it feels like they didn't do the same mistake and added any grindy achievements. I played 20 hours and have already the most, there is just one achievement missing which can be hard I guess... but let's see after I tried. So 100% is absolute doable even without any teammates.

Overall the first teaser gaming session I had already made me looking forward to start with this game and invest a lot of more time into it. I don't regred buying the super citizen edition because I already have the feeling developers will care about this game  and there is a lot of potential in it!

[*] We have to use 3rd party sources to share our [b]""Friend Codes""[/b] online.. hahaha.. it doesnt even let you do it within the game.. its a pretty bad setup for grouping, unless you want a blind pick then ""Quick play"" is there for you.. you can play with a brand new guy that just unlocked the Mortar.. or the other guy who isnt new but you didnt do what he wanted when he wanted so you get kicked at the extraction point, or use Discord.. because having a lobby we can see within the game would be crazy? who wants efficiency, who wants to be immersed.. or who wants to think that we have spacetravel and all this technology but we gota get on Discord and give out barcode to a different lobby..  the game has alot of short sighted mechanics.
[*] Cant even copy-paste the code the game gives.

[*] The ""Recent People"" you have played with doesnt let you join on them, you have to add them to friends first.
[*] The ""Recent People"" you have played with is not in any kind of order, its random organized.
[*] Cross-play is broken sometimes, you cannot join a PC friend if their game host is on PS5.
[*] Lazer body guard will kill your team mates.
[*] There is not much diversity with weapons and armor, the bad ones are bad.
[*] Everytime i play with Americans i need to mute people because of all the racism and abuse.

[*] You cannot paint your gear.
[*] The progression of gear seems weak early game, compared to stuff late game, with only a handful of good choices.
[*] You cannot upgrade low level stuff to be equal to high level stuff, so a clear meta is created, meaning no underdog mechanics or pack instincts for variety.
[*] You cannot change how equipment works, it will always do the same thing it always does without being capable of modifications for cool hybrid equipment.
[*] The ""Ready-Up"" window where you pick 4 things, is tiny, you have to scroll down all the time.[*] The ""Ready-Up"" window has no loadout presets.
[*] Its hard to see the Ship-Galactic-War visually progress and change.
[*] No Visual indicator for squad leader.
[*] Cannot request friends from squad, only from recently played.
[*] Some large bugs have no movement sound, they only have sound when they attack.
[*] Tutorial tips are places in poor default spots, like the person who made them doesnt realise they are over the top of great visuals, instead of word wrapped in the top right-hand corner.
[*] You cannot see the Lobby for ""Quick play"".
[*] Using ""Quick play"" does not queue you for missions of the difficulty you have set.
[*] There is no indicator that someone requested friends, only online friends, you have to go to the social window and open the friend requests for it to update and show you if you have a request.
[*] Strategem shop doesnt show the keys to call them down, you have to be in a match to see them.
[*] There is no ""Rejoin Squad"" option, so when the game kicks you, you had better have someone in the group on your friends list, because the ""recent players"" has no option to join.
[*] If you get kicked from a game, the 30minutes you played is wasted, you get nothing, the game rewards nothing and shafts you with options to get back to the team.
[*] The ""friend codes"" is a dumb way of grouping.
[*] Mortar Sentry is the Grim Reaper of sentry's. it doesnt even have a contrail to see where to avoid, its just boom dead friendly.

[*] [b]There doesnt seem to be a thing for players to do once they have done all the leveling and achievements, the game dies of shortsightedness.[/b]

This is day 2 of trying to get in. I'm keeping the faith though, hopefully eventually I can get in and see what the hype is about. For now though 2.2 hours of waiting to load in.

I've added another 2 hours of critical experience in the error server is full screen. I will admit I found this more exciting than the black screen yesterday. 4.2 hours in. This has become it's own fun mini game.

I made it in! for a glorious 1 minute and 30 seconds roughly I was able to start my basic training! I made it to the live rounds and right after I dusted myself off after successfully belly crawling for democracy, I crashed. Back to waiting on the server. To be continued!

Made it in, did 90% of a mission before crashing! Progress baby!

Alright, so I've got to go into several missions now! On problem is the game crashes every single time before I can finish so still level 2! Still can't figure out why I'm crashing, and no post seem to give much insight. It isn't a harware issue. I'm running about as high in terms of specs as you can GTX 4090 etc. Dunno. Would be nice to finish some missions.

Well the crashing continues. At this point 9 hours it says played. I completed 1 mission successfully and 10 missions crashed. Other wise just the same ole' waiting for a server spot. It rocks waiting 2 hours and getting in and then crashing 4 mins later. 

We did it boys! Actually have been able to get some missions done! It still crashes every few missions but what can you do. It doesn't smell good.....but smells better than it used too.",1708476297,1708816081,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, in its current state, the best recommendation I can give is to wait or to buy at your own risk. The game is unpolished, the matchmaking is broken, there're some game-breaking bugs to top things off as well. It's extremely not okay for the game to crash after you've spent 30 minutes in a session and have 30 seconds left to wait for the extraction.

Moreover, trying to play together with friends can be a nightmare, lobbies are somewhat counter-intuitive and every so often you just can't join your friends for no apparent reason at all. If you're not playing as a full group it can become a major issue as well, because some times the game would fill your group in a matter of seconds, but other times no one would join you at all. Considering massive number of players this game has, one can only assume that it's the problem with the matchmaking itself and not the lack of potential helldivers to jump into your mission. The game also doesn't allow you to reconnect to your last game session after a crash, unless you play with friends.

Not to mention the game has an extremely intrusive anti-cheat system for an entirely PvE-based game and yeah if you're not ready to just swallow this fact up - that's something to be wary of.

To sum things up, I love this game dearly, it's one of the most exciting gaming experiences I've had in a while along with such games as Baldur's Gate 3 or The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. But it's extremely frustrating to play it at the moment and if you're not ready to stress yourself out - I can only suggest waiting until the game is polished enough.

This whole game is bad ass, tons of enemies on screen, tons of explosions, you can mow down entire jungles with Manged Democracy. Hilarious and fun community, but the game has solo play and is friendly to solo players looking for squads. 
It's not often you buy a game and you just get the whole game. You can purchase a premium battle pass, but if you progress the standard battle pass included with the game, you can acquire enough currency to get the premium one as an ""endgame"" option. Even though you can purchase premium currency, I never feel like the game is trying to nickle and dime me before I even get to playing, like many other modern games.

THIS is truly gaming at its finest, where everyone all around is just having a good ass time. I sincerely hope that the devs can keep the game on the right track and give it long term life. 

This is my final message from Malevelon Creek. I've learned that hell isn't a fiery pit. It's a humid cesspool, with trees that speak binary.

I know some people are going to disregard this review (and some of the fanboys are going to get snarky) because I don't have my 100-hour-playtime merit badge before dropping a negative review.  (Or some other arbitrary amount of time: ""you need to play for 10 hours""  "" you need to play 50 missions"" ""you need to reach level 15"", etc.)  That's just the point though,  instead of keeping this game to play, I went outside and mowed my grass for three hours; mowing grass was a more interesting use of my time.

Negatives:
1. Missions all felt the same.
2. Lot's of load time and filler screens between actual missions (I'm sure it wasn't half the time, but I felt like I was spending more time not killing things and watching some kind of loading screen)
3. No indication of what leveling up was doing i.e. was I progressing leveling up or is this just a skill based arcade shooter (I could look this up, but by this point I knew I was going to bail because the missions were boring).
Positives:
1. cool setting
2. game style was nice with a lot of character
3. gritty feel to the violence and taking damage 

I was really excited to try this out given all the glowing reviews I keep seeing and lots of you-tubers praising it.  I went through the the training tutorial and was ready to mow down some bugs or machines.  Played my first mission and it was just kind of ""meh"".  Its always a little confusing, a little chaotic the first few minutes of a new game.  
Got into a second mission and it was okay.  I shot things shooting at me, my squad blew up their objectives and we evac'd...after evac, went through some xp and mission goals accomplished screens that took too long. I leveled up but wasn't really sure what that meant;  didn't seem to affect anything (I wasn't  a little tougher to kill, my accuracy or damage didn't go up a fraction of a percent...).
Third mission more of the same, got the feeling I was in loading or menu screens (i.e. the mission selection screens) quite a bit of the time.  Fourth mission, more of the same.  I was level 3 or 4 but the game didn't indicate if that affected my character attributes/abilities or what it was tracking. Fifth mission, killed a few bugs, got killed, was rez'd, killed a few bugs, got killed, was rez'd.  I'm thinking to myself, this isn't very fun, it's kinda boring, and I've played five missions that have all basically been the same thing.  
If you love it, great!  It just wasn't for me.  I'm going to go back and finish mowing my yard....",1708815786,1708815786,False,0,1,0.434782594442367554,0,True,False,False

[b]tldr: Server capacity is actually fixed now[/b]

[h3]First post: Can't play,""Servers at capacity""[/h3]
Also if Steam has a hiccup you can't even access the in game terminals let alone play solo missions. It's a great game despite the balance issues it has [i](most items are sidegrades or downgrades to what you start with or just pointless)[/i] but the devs have let it down with all the overhead. Also their discord is closed.

[h3]Update 1: Fumbling[/h3]
So the devs have responded... not by fixing the server capacity issue but by giving out an XP reward to the few players who can actually get into the game. A pretty low blow for those who can't even play after hours of waiting. 

Making this worse is that the game has no AFK timer and people are just staying logged in overnight to avoid getting locked out.

[h3]Update 2: Getting worse[/h3]
Now the game just black screens and doesn't launch.

[h3]Update 3: Fixed?[/h3]
So for the time being they seem to have fixed the game and I can even play it, but we'll see. My expectations have been substantially lowered.

[h3]Update 4: Nope[/h3]
Surprise surprise, they've only partially fixed the problem and it's still a lottery system rather than a queue to get into game.

[h3]Update 5: Seems fixed this time[/h3]
What more can I say, seems the the server limit and connection problems are finally fixed. So now that we can actually get into the game we just need balanced weapons and functioning armor...",1708226980,1708815766,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

And I find that the entire game is absolute trash. Tried my hand at a Trivial (easiest) difficulty mission against Automatons (because no one plays them, apparently, so you get missions to play them). I got absolutely swarmed and wrecked. The entire balance team needs to be replaced - the spawn rate for these cyborgs MUST be reduced by at LEAST 50%. Then I jumped into some Easy difficulty bug missions, had some fun running around finding stuff and killing bugs, but eventually would find myself surrounded or jumped on. Goddam bugs keep spawning right behind you, where there is absolutely no reason for them to be, when you're being rushed from the front. In that mound of frustration, I hit against the primary issue with this game (when you can actually play it, that is): the controls and responsiveness of the game is absolute trash. You can't smoothly move from target to target, trying to switch between weapons can animation-lock you into reloading something you didn't know was empty, the character movement is WAY too slow to avoid attacks, everything is clunky as all hell! The only advice I can give is make absolutely sure you're prepared for an attack before you get attacked, and be ready to die a LOT and lose missions (and all your progress for the past half hour) because you died too much. 

Now, maybe my problems arise from using a controller instead of mouse and keyboard. Maybe my problems arise from not having a high enough rank to have all the fancy toys and whatnot unlocked (which shows that whatever team handles balancing equipment vs enemies needs to be fired, because you shouldn't have to play the game to be able to play the game). Maybe I'm just bad. No mater what the reason is, I'm heavily frustrated by a GAME I'm playing to RELAX. I hate this game. Don't buy in unless you want frustration for no good goddam reason. 

Initial review, pre-pop-cap increase update: First time I launched the game, had a black screen for about 20 mintues, then finally saw some PSA BS, then watched a loading page for about 30 minutes of constantly saying the server was full. Gave up, restarted, relaunched, waited another 30-ish minutes, finally got in. And then the tutorial was bugged, and I couldn't low crawl through the first obstacle, despite being full-prone. Actually got stuck on the obstacle after about 3 minutes of trying everything, and resorted to the Return to Ship option, which meant I wouldn't be able to run the tutorial, but what the heck, I had friends lucky enough to get experience and could walk me through stuff. And then the game crashes when I try and access a mission on the map. An hour wasted, to crash on trying to launch a mission. 

Wait 1-3 months, and try it then. Maybe they'll have the bugs and server capacity issues fixed. Looks like a bomb game, just too bad I can't play it.",1708225797,1708815449,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Attention, brave citizens of SUPER EARTH. It's time to question the safety of your family and wonder why you haven't enlisted sooner!

 HELLDIVERS 2, a rollercoaster of bug-bot-squashing patriotism.

Due to some login limit shenanigans. The first week was like trying to infiltrate a bug-hole without a grenade . But fear not, because once you breach the black screens and ‘Error. Login limit reached.’, you're in for a wild ride of SUPER proportions. Bugs and glitches might get you down (looking at you, disappearing super samples), but remember, a true HELLDIVER fights through these hiccups!

For the modest fee of $40 and the occasional in-team shouting match, you can proudly join the ranks of those fighting for FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY and LIBERTY. Because nothing says love for your family like enlisting to protect them from extraterrestrial threats.

Starting in HELLDIVERS 2 is like being thrown into the deep end of a pool filled with giant bugs and walking toasters armed with rocket launchers. The tutorial mission? More like a crash course in ‘good enough.’ With a 22% combat effectiveness upon enlistment, you'll quickly find out that survival isn't guaranteed, but it sure is hilarious.

Prepare to face swarms of insect-like creatures where even the tiniest ones pack a punch that could make truck-kun jealous. And don't get me started on the legions of death robots with a knack for rocket accuracy.

Teaming up with fellow warriors is surprisingly smooth. Within moments, you'll be shoulder-to-shoulder with other confused recruits, forming trauma bonds that can only be forged in the fires of interstellar warfare. Sure, there's the occasional Guard Dog Rover that might mistake you for the enemy or an orbital barrage tossed WAAAAY too close, but what's a little friendly fire between super earth's finest?

The universe map changes with the flow of the entire playerbase, when you win, you liberate, when you lose.. Well hopefully your family won't blame you too much. Venturing into higher difficulties is like a mental marathon relying on nothing but you and your teams strategic brilliance.. or blind screaming. The sense of accomplishment when you emerge victorious is enough to make you sing the national anthem with tears in your eyes.

Even after unlocking all the gear and stratagems it won't satiate your hunger for justice; it'll only intensify your desire to dive back into the fray.

HELLDIVERS 2 scratches that itch from back when online games were simple, run-shoot, run-scream, run-away!  it's a nostalgic journey into the chaos of camaraderie and explosive patriotism. Enlist today, because the universe needs a hero, and that hero is you!

Overall I certainly recommend this game to other players!

I changed my review. It's absolutely bizarre that the game is still experiencing server issues. I haven't been able to play for 3 weeks because they haven't fixed it. It's always the same excuse: ""We weren't expecting that number of players"". 

At first, hearing this was understandable, but the delay in resolving this effectively is RIDICULOUS.

1. The complaints in a lot of the negative reviews are a bit overblown, to be honest. The first complaint is (naturally) smoothness and how the game runs. The game is a little beefy and guzzles resources sometimes, but on relatively modern hardware it is completely manageable 99.99% of the time with small frame stutters every now and again, and that's when I push my computer to the limit by cranking up all of the settings and playing one of the free-roam missions that spawn large hordes at long distances. On medium or high settings, most gaming rigs should be able to run this just fine with limited or no issues. 

However, AMD GPUs (7000 series in particular) can have some trouble running the game and this can be a problem for AMD users. Contrary to the beliefs some negative reviewers, this is the result of an AMD issue, NOT of a Helldivers issue. AMD has released an update for their GPUs which has fixed the problem for most players. Even still, the Helldivers developers have communicated that they are testing on AMD hardware just to make sure. Some have complained about AMD processors as well. As an AMD CPU user, I can say that I have experienced zero issues running the game smoothly when using settings appropriate for my computer's capabilities.

2. The second issue I see in the negative reviews is server issues and trouble getting into matches. The issues surrounding getting logged in have almost entirely been fixed, so people experiencing issues getting into the game in the first place are most likely experiencing issues on their end of the equation. Even if they aren't, on the rare case I've received an error, I have gotten in on my second try. This has only happened to me once since the server issues were patched a few days ago.

It's also true that getting into a matchmaking match can sometimes return a ""failed to join"" message. However, this is an issue that takes about two seconds to fix. The reason it happens is because you are attempting to join a match at the same time as other people who have clicked on the same match as you. There are a lot of people playing the game and most of them don't want to host their own lobbies, so there are more people joining than hosting and that means all you have to do to fix the problem most of the time is select another match. 

Every time I've had the issue it has taken all of five seconds to get into a match afterwards. Hosting a match has some similar issues in that people might not join on your game immediately after you throw your SOS beacon or open up your lobby to the public. This is because there is a natural buffer of about a minute or two between tossing your beacon and your game appearing on the world map. On top of that buffer, you are competing with a lot of other matches for players who might not be interested in joining a single person in an in-progress match. If you want people to join your game, select a mission and wait about 1-2 minutes in your destroyer and your lobby will fill almost immediately after it hits the world map.

3. The third issue I've heard about in other reviews is that the controls are clunky. This criticism strikes me primarily as an issue of not understanding the control scheme of the game rather than an issue with the control scheme itself. Your character's weapon will fire its rounds directly from the front of your barrel (barrel-point aiming) and those rounds will take a small amount of time to travel. This means you'll have to make sure your barrel is lined up before you fire or else you'll miss or graze your target instead of getting a solid, clean hit. I'm not typically one who goes crazy about ""realism"" in games, so I'll leave that out of the discussion and instead say that this mechanic makes shooting very satisfying once you get the hang of using the true crosshair, and lends some necessary weight and punch to the process of aiming and shooting. The gunplay is fantastic after you get used to barrel-point aiming, and the ability to know where your weapon will shoot at all times is actually rather helpful.

Other control issues include movement and inputs ""not working."" What I believe is happening for those players is that they are being hit by an enemy while attempting to use a stim (healing item), reload, prime a grenade, et cetera. You will be in constant contact with enemy units that will harass you from the time you land to the time you extract. When those enemies hit you, your character's action will be interrupted and you will have some damage recoil applied to your aim. That means that you may have to restart the process of reloading or stimming, and if you're frightened or overwhelmed by what's happening in front of you you might not notice that your character's arm/leg animations stopped playing when you got hit. You might not even register that you got hit in the first place. That means you will have to get VERY used to registering when you take damage and you will have to develop the skill to react to that damage appropriately. After the first couple of hours of gameplay, the feeling that ""inputs aren't working"" goes away entirely because you learn how to time things correctly. It's just like any other challenging game mechanic.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that I've gone over some of the issues above and why they aren't extreme enough to give this game a negative review in my opinion, let's talk about a couple of positives.

1. The game's play-cycle is addictive and just arcade enough to be massive fun. The premise is so ridiculous and the gameplay so serious that it's almost comical how into your role you can get while you're being assaulted by about a thousand bugs/automatons at once. You land, secure critical objectives, destroy enemy outposts, and then fight your way to extraction where you have a final standoff with whichever enemy you're fighting before taking off in a VTOL that shoots 20mm rounds from its nose turret. The entire time, you're legging it through combat with hordes of your chosen enemy variety and managing your ammunition and healing items, and sometimes those of your partner/group as well. This makes surviving from the beginning to the end of a mission challenging, but dying isn't annoying because you have an allowance of respawns that makes sure you aren't stuck watching your squad struggle with one person less than normal just because you made an oopsie. In some missions, the amount of respawns you have will seem generous. In others, it will seem like it's just short of enough. If you pay attention for the first couple of hours of gameplay, you won't ever experience a situation where the number of respawns makes the mission feel impossible. It's all about balancing resources and avoiding taking (too much) damage until the right time.

2. The community is one of the smarter ones I've seen in a cooperative game. After the first 10 level ups, you can assume that a player has a *decent* idea of what to do when they drop into your game (or you drop into theirs), and at around that time you'll notice that most players will start dropping intelligent markers on the map that suggest where to go next, sharing supplies with one another, picking weapons and support equipment that complements other teammates' gear, doing friendly emotes in the lobbies, and in general being good models for online player behavior. I have dropped into a couple of games where players ran off and got themselves killed at the squad's expense or teamkilled one another by accident far too often, but these are the exception.

These two things are qualities that Helldivers 2 has uniquely made its own. Just the two of them make the game worth it. Just pick up the base version of the game and try it out!",1708814299,1708814299,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game HAD a rough start, mainly from being so popular, but the Developers have been on top of the ball since the beginning with patching, working around the clock, and communicating to the community with it showing positive results.

NOW this game has made it super easy to team up and find others. Servers have been smooth and matchmaking has been working wonderfully fast for me since the recent patches. No wait times. No hang ups. Just finding other Helldivers that want to send out a ""hot cup of liber-tea!""

There are micro-transactions in the game but EVERYTHING can be earned in the matches, including the premium currency. All players equally get a part of the shared pickups.
The micro-transactions are so low key and not in your face, that I respect them for doing it this way.

Top notch visuals with enemies that show satisfying damage and weakness. Explosions deform the land and leave big craters. Weather changes beautifully. Your character gets muddy and covered in oil/goo appropriately. You can see your ship and the support they send out. The way your cape waves. The detail in crazy sometimes.

Fantastic and detailed sounds. From distant booms, to the empty *plink* noise of your clip.

The music is super on point and knows exactly when to play the right tones.

The weapons and aiming system is a good punchy feel, from the light single handed weapons to the heavy shoulder mounted cannon.

Movement and running around feels satisfying. Diving away from big booms feels heroic and exciting.

The seriousness of your person yelling at a giant crab/bug that it'll never change your way of life... brilliant! 

The minigame they built in to call down support and other goodies during missions is another smart move!

Servers are at capacity. 
Unable to join session. 
Random server drops. 
Missions completed receiving no rewards. 
Crashes mid mission. 
Infinite loading screenS; yes, PLURAL.

Strap in, because this game is like if Starship Troopers and your most chaotic laser tag match had a baby, and that baby was raised by a drill sergeant with a sick sense of humour.

You drop into alien worlds hotter than a car seat in the Florida sun, and you're tasked with spreading some good old-fashioned 'democratic' freedom - one bullet at a time. And by 'democratic freedom,' I mean you're unleashing more lead than a pencil factory and causing more explosions than a Michael Bay film festival.

The enemies are about as welcoming as a hornet's nest at a picnic. You've got everything from giant bugs that want to make you their lunch, to cybernetically-enhanced freaks who didn't get the memo that the war's supposed to be fun. And your weapons? They're the kind that make you cackle with glee as you turn aliens into a fine mist.

But here's where it gets good: the friendly fire. Oh, yes, you can absolutely obliterate your buddies by mistake (or not... I don't judge). It turns every mission into a suspenseful game of 'try not to accidentally commit war crimes against your own team.'

And when you're not accidentally taking out your squad, you're calling down supply drops that have a penchant for squashing anyone not paying attention. It's like the game is playing a cosmic joke, and the punchline is always some poor sap getting turned into a pancake.

Helldivers 2 doesn't just up the ante; it steals the whole damn casino. It's a chaotic, co-op masterpiece that's as hilarious as it is hardcore. It gets a chef's kiss from me. Perfect score for making me laugh while I cry in a fetal position, trying not to get stomped by my own supply pod... again.",1708812983,1708812983,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

tldr; servers are better but optimization on AMD Graphics is still awful

The recent updates have made the game a lot easier to actually get on and play, so great job devs! However, I still can't recommend this game to anyone with an AMD GPU (for reference I am on a 7900XTX). The game constantly crashes, I went through some reddit nerd's checklist of things to download and change to make the game stop crashing, it worked for a few days, then the game updated and the game started crashing again. I'm so tired of this, because the game is incredibly fun when it works, but if it doesn't work consistently and I constantly lose hours of progress because the game isn't optimized for team red then I can't recommend this game. Unfortunate.

tldr: the gameplay is probably fun if the game works

On weekends the servers are at capacity. If you can make it through the queue, progression may or may not work for you. I have multiple friends who are higher levels than me who have not unlocked higher difficulties to play on. On top of that, this game constantly crashes my graphics drivers even after updating to the latest version (hardware is an AMD 7900XTX), making every mission a waste of time and a much larger time sink than it needs to be.

This game needs much more polish before it's worth buying.",1708365391,1708812694,False,1,0,0.501466274261474609,0,True,False,False

This game is VERY fun. I really enjoy the gun-play along with the Stretegems that you can use to call in an orbital strike on enemies (or friends ;] oopsies) makes you feel like an absolute BAD-ASS when calling it in. Customization is also very present in the game so you can mix up your character to better fit your play-style.

The different 'Conditions' on planets along with the different enemies and main objectives, side objectives, and pickup weapons along with the loot that you can find helps the replay value and gives you a reason to explore. (The environments are beautiful btw) I also like that you can change the difficulty so if you're playing solo or you just want a more 'casual' time with the game, you can. (Might not seem like a big deal, but I like that the option is there to make things challenging/easier for you if you want)

The only issues I could address are some disconnection/crashes that could happen while playing (they're patching a lot of them tho, along with increasing server capacity so you can actually play the game!)
Apart from that, especially for the price the game is absolutely worth getting!

I play with friends, so I know it is happening to all of us, not just me, and we dont kick each other. It happens every now and then, and it is quiet annoying.

First, the game sometimes doesn't boot up and stays in a black screen either for about two minutes of until I shut it down, whichever comes first. None of the online help and tricks is working to fix it.

Second, and the worst of the two, I currently have 8.1 hours on record. I only played 3 hours or so out of that. The rest is me leaving it on to see if I can get into the game because servers are down or reached full capacity.

Helldivers 2 exceeds expectations on every front. The evolution from Helldivers 1, a top-down shooter, to a third person shooter was an excellent choice to appeal to a massive audience.

Gameplay is a frenetic dance of strategy and chaos. The addition of new enemy types, environments, and mission objectives keeps every engagement feeling fresh and unpredictable. Whether you're battling hordes of bugs on a hostile alien planet or engaging in intense firefights against automatons, each mission is a pulse-pounding thrill ride. What sets Helldivers 2 above other PvE horde shooters is the emphasis on teamwork and coordination. Coordinating airstrikes, calling in reinforcements, and reviving fallen squad members require constant communication and collaboration. There's a sense of camaraderie that develops between you and your squad as you overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to complete missions.

Visually, Helldivers 2 is equally impressive as the alien worlds are beautifully realized, with stunning environmental effects and dynamic lighting adding to the immersion. At this time, the game is missing PC upscaling techniques like DLSS, FSR, and XeSS that would further help performance.

Helldivers 2 does include in-game currency and microtransactions, however Arrowhead Games have designed their Warbond system as cosmetic only. You can find their in-game currency naturally throughout each mission, and this means that you don't have to spend real money to purchase armor and helmets from the super store.

As with many co-op focused games, it suffers when you have less than a full squad or running with a group of random strangers. I can sympathize (its a hard problem to solve.)

There's a lot of great things about this game. The action is hard hitting and visceral. Guns and stratagems feel awesome and powerful when you're using them. Progression is pretty standard but is a compelling driver to keep playing.

My biggest gripe, and one that ruins a lot of games for me is enemy spawning. They often seem to come out of nowhere, from behind, (or, conveniently, from whatever spot your team did NOT cover with a sentry.) Often they just seem to spawn in a never ending flow with no clear indication of where the next group of enemies is coming from. The entire spawning system for enemies feels cheap and gamey and for me can really spike the frustration meter.

There are mechanics at work here that are not immediately apparent. Stealth tactics are apparently a thing, but it's not easy to discern when you're employing them effectively. The game makes you really want to shoot every enemy you encounter, but the more I play the more I realize this is a sure path to being overwhelmed.

The servers are often full and it can be difficult to get into a game. I've had the most luck joining a friends game straight from my Steam friends list. I have to imagine they are working hard to remedy this. Having a game that so many people want to play that it overwhelms your servers is a good problem to have for a dev, so long as you fix the issue fast before people throw up their hands in frustration and move on.

-------------------------

Update: The servers seem to be working just fine now. I have been able to get into the game over the last few days without any waiting at all.

The game itself is a lot of fun and I do recommend it already, but it also has some issues. Some of which are hopefully quick fixes. Others probably not so much.

The good is pretty much everywhere at this point so I won't dwell on it too much. The coop is well done and performs smoothly. The gameplay loops are engaging without being tedious. Progression is based on resources that don't have much of an overlap so you can save for a new gun for example without compromising how quickly you can unlock a new turret or whatever. Teamplay is encouraged heavily, but not to the point where having a random on the team without a mic is going to ruin anything.

Basically, go check out some gameplay. Seeing it in action will tell you more than I can here.

The negatives though seem to be fairly glossed over by the weird LARP filled hype surrounding the game at the moment. And some of them are pretty nasty.

First and foremost, the stats listed in the game for various things are wrong. The devs have acknowledged that the player armor is bugged (heavy protects as well as light), but I haven't seen anything about weapons. And they seem to be just as screwed. The armor penetration stat for example seems to have little to nothing to do with how well a round can actually penetrate enemy armor. Damage is another stat that needs a pass.

Speaking of passes, everything in this game is in desperate need of a balance pass. As it stands right now the best weapon in terms of stopping power and ammo efficiency is the fourth primary players unlock. But yet absolutely nothing else comes anywhere close. And it's the same with strategems as well. Some are just wildly better or worse than the others.

On a much lower level of priority, the anticheat needs to detect macros. I'm not suggesting banning the players that use them, it is a PvE game after all, but put them in their own pool for quickplay. Players that chase the meta as a skill crutch are one thing, we've all been there at some point, but those who ""min-max"" so hard that they need a third party tool to remove entire gameplay elements are on a whole different level and can/should be relegated to playing with only their peers.",1708402011,1708810419,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 24.02.2024:

>> Online is working without issues now (at least for the last 2 days)

>> I've erned enough of the premium currency to unlock the battle pass, which is a clear sign, that against my initial thoughts, you don't need to put in extra money to get things out of that pass as well

>> Performance in general enhanced a bit, this is coming especially handy for Steam Deck players, since the game now runs in a acceptable frame rate & quality. Battey drain is huge though. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update 09.02.2024:

>> Online Matchmaking is now functional!

>> Today, I successfully played the game on the Steam Deck using GE Proton 8.25 (although an update to 8.30 is recommended, as it should work the same way).

In-game settings optimized: set everything to mid, shadows to low, and activated performance mode.
= Achieved 35 - 40 fps in the Tutorial at full TDP, but it's essential to consider the potential impact on battery life.

>> The only thing I will miss is that there are no tanks, mechs or anything like this in the game right now. I would include something which is only operational for at least two people (like the tank in H1).

>> There is no longer any reason not to recommend the game, except for the questionable inclusion of a Premium Battle Pass in a paid game.

>> More details about the Battle Pass:
There are two ""Tiers"":
-> Free Tier: Accessible to everyone, offering new cosmetics and weapons.
-> Paid Tier: Requires real currency and provides different/additional cosmetics and weapons.

The free pass offers significantly more content to unlock compared to the paid version. However, there is a possibility that the weapons in the paid pass might be stronger, potentially leading to a ""Pay2Win"" scenario. This aspect needs ongoing evaluation.

Players can earn currency to unlock the premium battle pass by playing and unlocking items in the free one. Despite unlocking all currency packages, it remains insufficient to purchase the premium pass (you receive 750 and need 1000). Nevertheless, the system may allow players to achieve this in ""Season 2"" if the mechanics remain unchanged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initial game feedback from 08.02.2024:

The game could definitely benefit from some weapon customization such as expanded ammo reserves, more dmg, better accuracy, explosive rounds, etc all attached to the weapon itself. So you can take any weapon that may start off kind of meh and turn it into a killing machine. (Not an automaton those things can rust as scrap heaps.)

In conclusion here though. The game is great. Punching your friends off the extract terminal to be the one to call it down is hilariously good fun.

First thing's first - This is more of a neutral review than a negative one. But it's not something I can recommend for this price tag. Go mod a certain 2010s-era game until you're happy, or buy it only on sale.

Disclaimer: I've not played the first Helldiver and don't plan to.

This game has [b] a lot [/b] of technical issues. We'll get to that soon.

[u] The positives! [/u]
- Some of the best gore mechanics in a shooter game. Bugs and robots alike blow apart and die in a visceral and violent manner that puts every other game to shame.

- Gunplay system that works well, simulating weapon sway and recoil in an intuitive manner without exaggerating either. Different weapons have different turn speeds, so you can't swing around a full sized MG and flickshot three bugs.

- Fun setting that encourages teamwork and cooperation.

- Solid ragdoll system and diving system. Diving is like dodging, but leaves you prone afterwards. This feels well-designed, as it's a quick way to remove a player from the enemy's reach, or move the player behind cover.

- Fun objective system. Unlike most games that forces you to do some tedious work, most of the objectives are done by operating a panel, similar to Alien Swarm, but you use the Konami code instead. It's fun when you get the hang of it.

- A solid weapon ""setting"" system. You can set your sniper scope for different ranges, or your machine gun for different fire rates. It stands out because not many games allow you to do this.

[u] The Negatives. There's a lot. [/u]

- Unlocking items is done by earning Medals. Which is earned by playing the game. Unlocking requires you to spend it on a battle pass. (It's free). The grind that comes with it is atrocious, exacerbated by a page system. For example, ""page 3 items"" cannot be unlocked until you spend about 40 medals elsewhere. The numbers get ludicrous the further you get.

- Extremely poor readability. This is a long one, so bear with me.

Good games typically teach you how the game works without any hand-holding. For example, Killing Floor features Fleshpounds that have glowy chests that acts as an alternative headshot point. This game does not even try to hint where the weakpoints are. Sometimes, you have to shoot a bug in the face. Sometimes, it's under its body. Other times, the weakpoints are stored in the [strike] balls [/strike] butt.

Games such as Deep Rock Galactic, Left 4 Dead 2, World War Z often indicate weakpoints either by using the familiar shape of a humanoid, a glowy body part, or visible material differences.

Pop quiz! Hitmarkers in most games come in different colors for different purposes, such as hits, kills, armored hits, and so on. What practical difference does a RED or WHITE hitmarker in Helldivers 2 make? None. Red hitmarkers do not mean kills. White hitmarkers don't, either.

There are way too many small problems in the core gameplay that stacks up, but it's tolerable if you don't care, don't mind, or have a full team.

Smol, quick list of 'things the games won't help you understand'
Weakpoints, Audio / Visual Cues, How-to-juke-enemy-that-is-constantly-in-your-face-because-you're-solo.

- Bullet sponge enemies. Crit spots exist, but the game doesn't try to teach you anything. Hitmarkers aren't very illuminating.

- Shoddy weapon balancing. There's barely any reason to use any other weapon once you unlock the automatic shotgun. At this time of writing, marksman weapons do not pierce medium armor, meaning they aren't much better than assault rifles. The pump action shotgun has insufficient ammo for its damage output compared to the autoshotgun. The SMG feels better than the rifle in every way. It almost makes the ""weapon settings"" moot, unfortunately. It'd be nice to see every weapon get buffed to match the autoshotgun.

- Horrendous difficulty without a full team. Enemies will swarm you endlessly unless you have a full team. Diving doesn't help when you have 18 bugs surrounding you, and you can't use your support items (called stratagems) while moving.

- Melee is weak. Weak enough that I forget it exists.

[b] Technical Issues [/b]
- Depending on time of day, you'll be unable to play the game because the servers are drowning in players. Yep. As if the ""Always Online"" system isn't bad enough, there's a chance the servers are ""at capacity"".

- Black Screen on Startup. This happens alarmingly often.

- Crashes. They happen semi frequently. This can render 5-30 minutes of intense and rewarding gameplay into a really bad case of blueballing.

- A lot of bugs. Ranging from ""terminals don't work properly"" to ""player cannot respawn even when a reinforcement stratagem is thrown down"" to ""primary weapon is missing mid-game.""

- nProtect Anticheat. I'm not too well versed with it, but it needs to be said that this is a tremendously invasive anticheat. Words like ""Rootkit"" will start being thrown around. Why would a coop game need such an anticheat? Even competitive games don't go this far. It's overkill for little to no benefit other than ""less cheaters"". It's not CS2 or Escape From Tarkov, cheaters aren't going to damage this game that badly.",1708460159,1708808845,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Game ran decently well for me despite not dl'ing most up-to-date drivers for my gfx card. No crashes and played the tutorial + 2 missions. Got a consistent 80+ fps at Ultra/1440P even with lots of enemies and explosions but I would've been disappointed if that wasn't the case. 

That being said, I don't like the anti-cheat so will be refunding and waiting until they find a different solution. NProtect has had exploits in the past (https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2005-0295/) and is probably the cheapest and most ""suspect"" of the big K-level anti-cheat systems (nProtect, EAC, Riot's solution). Kernel level anti-cheat is a big no-no for me and I had wished Arrowhead would've used a solution held in higher regard.

Server issues continue to be a consistent issue. Mission rewards  have been broken since 2/10 and the ability to matchmake and play with friends has been spotty since launch. They have paused joining the official discord servers due to the influx of new players. Also, despite the anti-cheat, there have been cheaters with infinite ammo, infinite samples, etc since launch. 

Edit 2/24/24:

I'm changing my review to recommended as most of the issues have been fixed: server issues, mission rewards, matchmaking, crashes, etc. I'm still not a fan of the third-rate anticheat but it hasn't stopped me from playing the game and really enjoying it. I just want to highlight the issues/concerns there so folks can make an educated decision for themselves.

In between some of the patches the game ran just fine for me, and I had tons of fun. But then the dark times, literally, as when I boot up the game, it just sits at a blank screen. If I'm lucky I can get to the title screen where it sat for over 2 hours last night. And if I'm the luckiest, I can get logged in to be disappointed that the galactic war stats don't load, system stats won't load, and match making is broken. I don't understand why the previous patch wasn't rolled back, but here we are. 

However: The game is fun and awesome to play when you actually can play, with some minor issues like at times, models just stretch for no reason.

There's a ton that goes in to understanding this game and that makes it some much better. From customizing your hell diver gear trying to stand out and unlocking weapons and equipment. All the way to naming your ship and upgrading your home defenses. My first game in with my best friend I was absolutely hooked. Just imagine destroying the Galaxy of robots while fighting termites at the same time with your boy. As far as the environment goes there's so many different planets and I mean so so many different planets that the environments are all different and that just makes it really immersive and honestly really cool.

Servers- At first the servers were having some issues, sometimes you will get kicked out of games but but now it definitely seems like they're putting the work in to fix all that. It is understandable though to have some disconnections because this is such a popular game an it is brand new so it's good to give the developers time to get everything in the works.

In other words, when a AAA company *USED* to make a game for the sake of making a proper game, rather than a tax write off or a political statement.

HellDivers 2 hasn't done any piece of the falsified advertisement that Ubisoft titles have because, thankfully, Arrowhead Studios appears to have a CEO that is not as literally in-bred as the one running companies EA and Ubisoft.


HellDivers 2 is a third-person, first-person hybrid shooter where the players are THE ((Totally over-glorified suicide unit)) ""Super Earth's Greatest military specialist unit"" 

It has a lot of very tiny graphical details that surprise me, but would take to long to talk about (Capes float on water, clothing gets covered in grime, boots imprint into things)

But the game-play is a very solid, partially challenging, arcade like SOCOM shooter, or can be if you sneak around the missions rather than literally kill the first thing that moves.

Missions range from Defense and Offense, and all of them are timed. The players get an array of weapons and cosmetics which can be unlocked using Tokens received at the end of missions and going through a Battle-pass like system. There are two systems

One is premium and paid for (I think like eight bucks? Don't quote me on that, it's 1000 SC in game) and the other is free. The weapons in the Premium pass are actually well balanced to the ones you get in the free pass.
The Liberator Explosive adds stagger against some enemies, while the Liberator default add better precision damage and higher capacity, for example.

Alongside guns, the players have strategic call-downs that can be entered by playing Dance Dance Revolution.

These call-downs range from specialty weapons, to fortifications, to drones, to Turrets, to bombardments and even a F16-like fighter craft that can do everything but send you a thermos full of coffee (But I bet they would and could if you could ask nicely)

There are two enemy factions

Bugs

Robots.

There are constant issues with matchmaking that prevent you from ever playing with others or cause the game to crash when you try to quick play.  There are other weird bugs like the flamethrower burning yourself if you try to use it while walking forward or objective markers randomly moving around. 

All that being said the gameplay itself is also quite clunky.  Your character doesn't respond to your controls right away like one would expect from any FPS.  This is by design though but it ends up feeling really clunky as you can't aim properly just due to how the game works.

I think I ""fixed"" the crashes by limiting the FPS. I can go as high as 70 FPS, played a few matches without a crash so far. Still going to leave as a negative because obviously nobody should have to limit any of the settings to get a game to work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Crash simulator.

I guess I'm the minority, but I've spent more time restarting from crashes and researching a fix then actual game time.

When I first launched the game, it insta crashed due to the anti-piracy software, I had to restart the PC. Then, the tutorial level glitched out so you couldn't even fish it. After another restart the tutorial level was passable. Now the game just crashes during a mission whenever it feels like it and no ""fix"" really helps, so far.

As of this writing there is a significant bug with their in-game FPS limiter, which will drive many systems' CPUs to overheat. Disabling this and using the FPS limiter in your GPU software will greatly reduce crashes.

Keep note- this is my personal opinion, I'm not some game critique, not some salesmen- hell this is the only game I EVER made a SERIOUS review on in such a state, if at all!

The good.
First of all- I absolutely LOVE the amount of effort that went into the character movement- while currently a little wonky, Just that satisfying feeling of dodging and shooting- It hits that Cinematic vibe- Like you're in an action movie, EVERY damn session! The music, the effects- the explosions, Every mission feels.. Different then the last one, with it's own share of hard moments- and easy moments, Some moments where a random idea to hit that broken down hellbomb netted me a good 20 bugs!, Or struggling as the last man alive on the escape platform, Broken arm and bleeding chest- Blocked by my DRIPPY AS HELL armor as im fending off enemies with my revolver- My last weapon, each shot mattered- With no reinforces avaliable as my squadmates were rooting for me, and I did it- Barely, with one HP, but I did!, and it felt AMAZING! Like I was some legendary war hero- Before I accidentaly shot the floor with an autocannon and became the dunce of the group. Even SOLO im having fun running low difficulty missions- taking whatever loadout I want, From the godlike breaker- to the regular assault rifle, and a whole SLEW of stratagems to tackle whatever playstyle I currently wish to take- I even made an Electroboom inspired loadout - Tesla tower, Arc thrower, Incindiary breaker, and flame grenades, I call it the Shortcircuit! And it's a whole lotta fun! Even if you can teamkill at any given moment- I still manage to do it just fine! But enough of my ramblings, Now to the less pleasant part.

The bads - As of currently, the current player limit hit 700k, But people are just so.. Ugh, Impatiant!, I get it- you bought a game that looked cool, or a friend reccomended- or maybe you are a long time veteran of Helldivers one, which had --- A 7K PLAYERBASE ISH ---, People refuse to understand that game development and fixes take a bit of TIME to dish out- and that under such pressure, It's so DIFFICULT, Hell- the discord server looked like a clown fiesta in the first few days, People raging left and right- the game getting review bombed- and still, I get your anger, it has a justified place- You want to get what you paid for, But keep in mind- the developers planned, for BEST CASE SCENARIO- 250k players, and no more. instead- on the first week, we have nearly half a million people wanting to log on to play this BANGER of a game, Coupled with many errors that suddenly popped up- be it because the servers were frying in the background, or from issues that were not discovered just yet- Like some error codes for the PS, or.. the fact that chargers sometimes just enjoy climbing vertically on walls instead of slamming into them. amongst a few game-breaking bugs that straight up crash you- and the horrendous login errors that sometimes require you to restart your router, and give you so much ANNOYENCE- I beg of you, if you see this review, and you posted a negative one- Think about it again in a good month or two, Let the game become more stable once more because there is PLENTY of stuff to fix- and the devs are well aware, With- or without people running around screaming their heads off like headless commander bugs. unlike a lot of other devs- they honestly had a pretty solid argument- atleast for the connection issues. and giving this godlike game- yes, GODLIKE- (In my view, again, personal opinio) a NEGATIVE review because you don't have the patiance to wait a bit for the devs to fix some issues- in this game which is just.. so much FUN? That's on you chief. Just make sure to change your review in a month, maybe few- after many stuff is fixed- and added to this glorious game.

And please- take everything I said with a grain of salt, I don't mean to invoke the wrath of some professional game critiques, or people who had REALLY bad experiences with the game and nearly barely played, This is just my personal very detailed opinion on this game, Which I honestly LOVE. really, REALLY love!.
