Every enemy is a bullet sponge, every gun doesn't have enough ammo to kill an enemy in a single clip, there are a million guns which is slightly less than a million more than there needs to be, many of the guns you'll find have stats like ""Clip size 7, consumes 3 rounds per shot, reload speed 5 seconds."" Oh wow I get to reload for 5 seconds after shooting 3 times which often isn't enough to kill a single enemy because the guns are also stupidly inaccurate. Aside from that, this is a looter shooter, so why is inventory limited to like, 8 things? Basically this is an inventory management game with an emphasis on searching loot boxes for ammo and money which features the occasional fire fight.

Not only are the characters, story line, art style, and much more within this very detailed game extremely compelling, and in my opinion, crafted with what feels like so much passion for the game, I also find that playing this game over the years, from different consoles to 100% achievements on Steam, to the many DLCs, and still today working towards my OP levels, has not only helped me to improve my gaming, shooting, and aiming skills in other games, but has helped me have a wonderful time playing as well. This game is not easy in my opinion, there are some frustrating parts for sure, and it can feel like it is testing my patience often, but overcoming those struggles almost feels like a part of the Borderlands 2 world itself to me, in a beautiful and rewarding yet sometimes painful way! 

Borderlands 2 to me feels like a timeless classic that awakens nostalgia in many players who remember playing it their first time, and still seems to have new players wanting to try it today, which I find such a beautiful thing to see as well. 
I am so grateful to be one of these players and highly recommend it! 

If you are someone who enjoys this type of game, it is one of the greatest created of it's kind in my opinion as far as looter/shooter style story games go. 
I feel that for sure not everyone would feel the same, but I definitely consider it worth a shot if you are curious! You might just find another or a new favourite game of all time! 
Happy gaming to you and thank you for reading my review if you did!

This isn't very fun even with someone else to suffer by your side. 

There are a lot of things in this game that straight up troll you and it's honestly really annoying than it is amusing or anything of that nature. There are many things that you have to consult the dogsh*t wiki for, fandom has gotten so bad that you can't even read half the wiki because it gets covered up by an ad you can't get rid of. There's shields that instantly down you if you take damage. There's guns that decrease your overall defense. There's enemies that if you shoot them with anything other than melee or explosives, get instantly downed if your max hp is relatively low for the class you are playing as. 

There is a lot of RNG involved for grinding for gear that quite honestly is really boring to grind for the way you're supposed to do it. There are a lot of challenges that are waiting around for a small window of time and if you miss you have to wait around some more. There are a lot of encounters that is a lot of meandering and waiting around to the point where me and my friend are doing other stuff waiting for this window of opportunity to present itself.

There are a lot of Arena based quests where if one person dies the other doesn't have much of an ability to provide cover fire from the penalty box. 
Certain arenas have a very fair sightline while others straight up disallow you from interfereing. 
There's bs one hit kills with environmental obstacles. 
There's needlessly rare and obscure collectables that are really annoying to figure out.
There's a lot of inconsistency with spawns for enemies as well as targeting priority for certain enemies.
Splash damage having inconsistent reach, pulling out calculators to figure out if the dpb for the new shotgun you found is worth the ammo cost for how much damage it deals, visual bugs that make the game harder, and other overall nonsense which seems to change what flavor of nonsense you get served up at any given moment.

There are a lot of memorable moments.
But after new game+++ this shit gets old. Even I get annoyed from picking up the voice recordings for the 258th time to annoy my friend who's tired of hearing them. Moxxie won't give me her gun half the time. The mods this community has created to streamline the gameplay has improved the game signficantly allowing us to skip cutscenes and increase our inventory storage. 

But I honestly think locking progression behind DLCs is f*cking stupid.
20 dollars for a f*ckass old game dlc. I'm not looking forward to having to make new characters to get the character specific acheivements. 
F*ckass game tbh. 

The artstyle is genuinely the best part of this game. 
But the game is old and hasn't been updated to better match newer hardware.
The latest entry in the series is a f*cking disgrace.

It's hailed as the pinnacle of looter shooters for good reason. My tip? Take your time on the first playthrough. The game is brimming with crucial story dialogues that unveil the narrative's depth. Miss them, and you risk missing out on the game's essence. Yet, fear not if you prefer a casual approach; you can still enjoy the gameplay, albeit with a foggy understanding of the missions' context.

Replayability is where Borderlands 2 shines brightest. With its wealth of side quests, exhilarating boss battles, and expansive areas to explore, there's always something new to discover. The gunplay is impeccable, and while the vast array of weapons might seem daunting initially, mastering their nuances becomes second nature with practice.

The game's DLCs are a treasure trove of content, with each offering a substantial extension to the main storyline. From sprawling expansions that add hours to your playtime to bite-sized headhunters packed with secrets and unique weapons, there's no shortage of fresh experiences to dive into.

What's more, Borderlands 2 runs smoothly on even modest hardware, making it accessible to a wide audience. Its enduring popularity is a testament to its enduring appeal, with fans still creating videos, mods, and other content to this day. Trust me, this is one game you don't want to miss out on.

There is an issue with the game starting in offline and going online causing the game to get stuck in an endless loop trying to connect to the servers that has been around ever since they did their thing with Epic like 4 years ago. Has yet to be fixed. 
While the person at 2k customer support who I was talking with was very nice, I highly doubt anything is gonna be done about this considering its been around for so long and countless reddit threads, steam discussions and possibly bug reports exist about it.

Worst thing about all this is that this only affects *some* people. So the game working is completely up to chance, Its like they finally figured out that the gambling aspect from loot drops is the most fun thing about this game so they made it so that you can gamble before even playing. 

Is it gonna work? Is it gonna be unplayable? Who can possibly know for certain? Only way to find out is to buy the game.",1579189538,1707620852,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The screen transitions to showing Kennedy in black and white, sitting at a table with Fidel Castro.

John F. Kennedy: I said, 'are certain to miss the future'!

Fidel Castro: [laughs] Coño... I missed that.

Robert McNamara walks into the room towards Castro.

Robert McNamara: Prime Minister Castro, this missile crisis was the last straw. We almost blew ourselves up. Now we invited you here today...

John F. Kennedy: In good faith!

Robert McNamara: ... in good faith, to sort this thing out.

Robert walks back towards John F. Kennedy.

Fidel Castro: (nae naeing on the table) And why is he here? He lost!

Nixon is shown sitting left of them at the table, annoyed at Castro's remark.

John F. Kennedy: As I always say, forgive your enemies, but remember their names. Now gentlemen, as I like to think, in the long history of the world, that there are only a few generations...

Noises are heard in the background.

Richard Nixon: (looking frantic and ducking) Sounds like someone breaking in...

John F. Kennedy: Just the storm, Dick. Sit down.

Zombies appear smashing a window on the other side of it, making noises and breaking through.

Richard Nixon: Oh my God!

Robert McNamara: It appears the Pentagon has been breached.

John F. Kennedy: Zombies. Gentlemen, at times like these our capacity to retaliate must be and has to be massive, to deter all forms of aggression.

Kennedy walks over to the wall behind him and hits a button, which makes the wall flip around to show an armory of weapons.

John F. Kennedy: Gentlemen, lock and load!

The screen turns black.

Fidel Castro: Viva la Revolution.

Screen then shows the four of them coming out of the armory. (Left to right) McNamara with a Stakeout with Grip, Kennedy with a China Lake, Castro with a Bowie Knife and a Python and Nixon with two HS-10s.

Robert McNamera: Any last words, Mr. President?

Richard Nixon: Yes Jack, any superlative words of inspiration for our humble troops?

John F. Kennedy: Do not pray for easy lives, my friends. Pray to be stronger men.

An action packed laugh fest with amazing characters, a perfect villain, heartbreaking moments, and guns! Guns! AND MORE GUNS! 4 main character classes with skill trees to match your playstyle, (two more if you buy the DLC yes every DLC is worth it). It's fun alone, but even better with friends. Heck get the whole crew with up to 4 players. Smash, Slice, Shoot, and Loot your way across the wild amazing planet of ~Pandora~. Home to an assortment of crazy creatures, endless baddies, robots, and don't forget everyone's favorite Psychos <3. 

While my Steam time might say 70.5 hours, let me assure you, I've spent far longer in the Borderlands. Owning this game on almost every platform. Easily dumping hours beyond count into this amazing game. And if the base game ain't enough for ya and you crave more Borderlands, get the DLC's every one is packed with hours of content and exciting new things to explore. Personal favorites being Assault on Dragon Keep and Commander Lilith's Fight for Sanctuary. 

Borderlands 2 gets tuned up to 11/10 for me cause this game is a masterpiece and should easily be in anyone's collection. I couldn't recommend this game enough.

The sheer amount of Depth and Replay-ability in the game makes it worth any amount of money, Handsome Jack is an incredibly well written and charismatic antagonist and CARRIES any conversation or scene he's in. The gun-play, unique gun rolls, and action skill trees allow for tons of replay value and unique builds.

I will pay Gearbox thousands of dollars to never bring Handsome Jack back every again, 10/10.",1591911915,1706734424,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

 It really has it all; 
- Super engaging gameplay loop, the skill trees give you tons of freedom with how you wanna play
- Actual good story and writing (which cannot be said for it's younger brother Borderlands 3)
- Fantastic art style and awesome music 
- Very diverse sets of locations each one more unique then the last one. One moment you're walking around a bunch of icebergs and then the next you're gunning down bandits in a wild west type of town.


Forget Borderlands 3 or Destiny THIS is how you do a kickass lootershooter.

As a steam deck user whom docks the deck.  There is a glaring issue with the game using multiple screens. While playing the game of borderlands 2 the game itself randomly swaps away from the screen your game is on to any other content that is open. For example say you have chrome open running music or what ever in the background. While playing the game, you end up losing control of your character not able to press buttons. But whats really going on is, that the desktop mode is flipping between the game and what ever is ran in the background. thus you lose your life trying to swap back via alt tabing screens.

The gameplay is fast-paced, punchy, and challenging without being punishing. Generally it plays just as well in single-player as in multiplayer; some character specialties are clearly more suited for multiplayer, but you can always choose a different skillset that works better for playing alone. The only downside is that the writing feels incredibly dated. It's a competent story with generally good dialogue, but it's a very 2010 kind of game - lots of ""quirkiness"" in that lolrandom style that feels a bit cringeworthy now. The main villain is the kind of sarcastic quippy jerk that felt really fresh when the game came out and has been done way beyond death by now.

For BL fans: This is the best game in the series. It's a little bit better in every way than 1, and it's basically the same gameplay as 3 and the Pre-Sequel without being as self-referential or self-impressed.",1705276298,1705276298,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[h1] TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ [/h1]
[b]BUY THE GAME WHEN IT IS ON SALE! IT'S WORTH IT![/b]
You are a character hunting a vault (Hence the name, Vault Hunter). However, there is an antagonist named Handsome Jack and he wants to kill you and have the vault for himself. You tried stopping him in a train but you've been tricked with explosives and the whole train blows up, leaving you unconscious. [b]No more explaining the story.[/b]

When playing the game, the main purpose is to shoot enemies and loot weapons, ammo, health, and shields. There are almost a million weapons to choose from but they all have level requirements. The more you play the game, the higher your level will be. Making your character stronger and being able to use higher leveled weapons. There is a thing called a Skill Tree and it is really important for you. The story is amazing and once you beaten the game, you can always replay it with higher difficulties each time you beat the game. Your character level will not reset when playing higher difficulties. If you pick a another character, then it will reset your levels.

[h2] Price: 8/10 [/h2]
The game itself costs $19.99 USD. If you wanna save money, just get it when it's on sale. The DLCs are AMAZING and you MUST to get them if you want to level up more. You can get them from the season pass or buying a bundle. Buy it when it is on sale, you will not regret it.

[h2] Gameplay: 10/10 [/h2]
Borderlands 2 is a shoot and loot First Person Shooter game. You can choose different characters that has unique abilities when playing them. The more you play the game, the higher your character level will be. Making you stronger and unlocking stronger weapons. There are Rifles, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, Pistols, Snipers, and of course Rocket Launchers. Borderlands 2 have 6 colored weapons. Ranging from:

[h3]White = Common[/h3]
[h3]Green = Uncommon[/h3]
[h3]Blue = Rare[/h3]
[h3]Purple = Epic[/h3]
[h3]Orange = Legendary[/h3]
[h3]Pink = Eridium-Technology (E-Tech)[/h3]

[h2] What is E-Tech?[/h2]
According to the Borderlands Fandom Wiki, ""[i]E-tech weapons, or Eridium technology weapons, are a type of experimental weapon. They usually use multiple rounds of ammunition per shot. They have low projectile velocity, cannot score critical hits, has high damage and elemental effect chance.[/i]"" Are E-Tech weapons better than legendary weapons? Not really. A level 50 E-Tech weapon can be better than a level 30 Legendary weapon. It really depends on the weapon type, damage, and level requirement.

There's are also shields in the game. All shields have different abilities but most of them can be understandable if you read the description of it.

And last but not least, there are elemental effects. Effects like Shock, Fire, Slag, Corrosive, and Explosive. I'm not gonna explain it because an NPC named Marcus will teach you how they work in the game.

OH, I FORGOT ABOUT THE SKILL TREE! OOPS!
[h2]Skill Tree[/h2]
The skill tree is a [b]NECESSITY[/b] in Borderlands 2. Each character has different skills and can be spent however you like. You need to play the game a lot in order for you to have more skill points. If you want to have the best setup for your character, just watch YouTube videos for your specific character.

[h2] Lore: 10/10 [/h2]
The lore is straight forward. You are character hunting a vault (Hence the name, Vault Hunter). Your plan is to stop an antagonist named Handsome Jack from unlocking the vault. You tried finding him in his train but you've been tricked with explosives and the whole train blows up, leaving you unconscious. When gaining consciousness, you'll meet ClapTrap/CL4P-TP (Warning: ClapTrap is annoying). I don't want to explain the whole story to you because I'll spoil it. It's best to play the game and learn for yourself. Or, you can watch a whole YouTube video about it.

[h2] Graphic: 7/10 [/h2]
This game is old and it has good graphics. There's literally no further explanation for the graphics, it's good.

[h2] PC Requirements: 9/10 [/h2]
Not only can you play Borderlands 2 on Windows. [b]You can play the game on Mac and Linux[/b] You don't need the latest GPU and CPU for this game. You can probably run Borderlands 2 on a medium budget pc and have medium or high video settings. 

[h2] Entertainment: 10/10 [/h2]
Borderlands 2 is a REALLY FUN GAME! You can replay the game so many times, the DLCs are amazing to play, each character is fun to play, and you can invite 3 of your friends to join you! You might get tired and bored from playing the game a lot by yourself. But with friends, it will probably be an amazing or chaotic experience to have.

[h2] Is it worth it?: YES IT IS [/h2]

Let me go through some of the things that I actually do like:
-The Quest system has been tweaked slightly for quality of life. Some quests you can turn in immediately after completion by bringing up the Quest Log. For the ones you have to turn-in manually, Sanctuary is usually the place to go - so there's a central hub that's not too large for you to do a mass completion lap. Not the best... Still would rather be able to turn in all completed quests from the Log itself, but whatever. It's an improvement.
-Speaking of improvements, gotta give credit where credit is due - the Enemies! Enemy A.I. has been overhauled in this game. They're smarter, use their weapons more effectively, and actually move and dodge your attacks when you ADS or shoot at them. A much needed upgrade from ""stand still and get shot in head"". That's about it. I appreciate the A.I. tweak. Thank you.
Aaaand the bad stuff - the game itself. Core gameplay is still terrible - offering zero replay-ability. You can't skip dialogue you have no intention of hearing, you can't skip cutscenes, and while the most of the game is fairly linear with a central hub it still takes forever to get to places with areas being blocked off by invisible walls, jump physics being somehow worse now than BL1 and Halo 1 combined, and map layout generally being awful forcing you to slog your way through a snake-like path to get where you want to go.
The main antagonist, Handsome Jack, is not likable, funny, or a third redeeming quality. He's annoying, stupid, and talks too much. This does not make me want to hunt him down and defeat him because he's evil, it makes we want to kill him so I can get the game over with faster and so he'll shut the hell up. I like seeing the protagonists from BL1 come into play, but hot frickin' damn are they a bunch of annoying mentally challenged warts on the ugly ass of Pandora. Their personalities are so badly written it makes marvel characters seem likable. Shooting feels a little better, but the guns suck now. ARs are completely ruined with half of them being trash and the other half unusable. SMGs are still the God tier guns like in every game. Enemy balance is back and forth. Your level (like BL1) is way too dependent on difficulty. If you're one level below, you deal 90% less damage, but if you level up one level higher, you OHKO everything with a sniper headshot. It's disgustingly bad game design like this that makes me wonder if their QA team spoke English.
Anyway, TL;DR - Game is bad but slightly better than the first. 2/10. Don't play this unless you hate yourself.",1705139998,1705139998,False,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

It only lets you see one quest at a time so you can't really plan out an effective route, you just kinda go. You might be in an area where quest objectives are for a different quest, but because it's not ""selected"", you don't even see them on your map.

Once you get past all of that, this game is a ton of fun and the DLCs make it definitely worth it to buy the GOTY edition. The combat is pretty fun because of all the different weapon types.",1704656995,1704656995,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense.

Borderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts.

Well, gunplay is interesting, after completing the story there available hundreds of hours of grind, story itself is interesting and Jack is one of the best villains in games - both charismatic and furyprovoking, many DLC's, part of which have fun stories (Tiny Tuna's is really good one, for example).

If you do not care about story and only care about gameplay - better chose BL3 or BL:The Pre-Sequel, thought this one still holds the test of time.
If you care about story - skip BL3 like it never existed and play TPS and BL2 (and check best rated DLC's to them).

Game is played like classic Diablo, btw - at first you run through first difficulty, then at second and most fun and unlocks are on third (but need to buy Ultimate Vault Hunter DLC, its cheap).
Difficulty spike here is bad - in BL3 or TPS is better. First difficulty is somewhat challenging, as you lack unlocks and legendaries, second difficulty is cake walk and everyone is too easy (with some elite mobs being bullet sponges for no reason), and then on third difficulty challenge is again pretty good one. OP levels balanced poorly too, because after around OP5 - everything oneshots, so you need shield and health regen (health to get the ""can't be oneshoted if 51+% hp hidden mechanics, so you have 2 hits before dying and not 1), but if you like risky style of play - it is fun (I am on OP10).

Multiplayer is also fun to play, especially if someone will take Maya as healer/resurector (still not the Chaos Claptrap in TPS creates during healing) and others go different classes too.

Also, IMPORTANT: buy game only as part of Handsome Collection or Pandora's Box, or you will not get a bunch of content (previously it was sold separately, now it sold only as part of those collections). Collections often have huge discounts and they include all games with all DLC's of franchise.

Being 11+ years old, Borderlands 2 holds up very well for simple reasons — timeless visual style, fantastic writing and carefully crafted gameplay loop. The story by itself never gets old... But there are also at least 4 classes to play, tons of missions, locations, characters, and hundreds of weapons. With all DLCs there is enough content to play for 200+ hours.

Compared to Borderlands 1, developers improved every aspect and multiplied all the best parts of the original game by ten. Variety of loot is immeasurable and characters have many playstyles and skills. The world of Borderlands is not just empty deserts now, and even those were brought to life — every bandit camp has small story, secret chest or just some fun detail from bandit life. The lore about Eridians, Vaults and greedy corporations really starts to shine here (and peaks in Borderlands 3). And all of that expanded even more in great DLCs (one of which became its own franchise as Tiny Tina's Wonderlands).

Definitely recommended at least to try for every gamer.",1632269975,1704338718,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Great sequel to an amazing game.

I loved Borderlands 2 and had a great time with this amazing sequel. The humor, silly atmosphere and new features created a fresh new experience for me.

In Borderlands 2, the story continues from the first game. There is a new vault, discovered by our main villain, Handsome Jack. You start as one of the four new Vault Hunters, employed by Handsome Jack himself. Like the bastard he is, he betrays you and blows up the train you are traveling on, leaving you for dead. You are found by Claptrap, who takes you to safety. You travel to Sanctuary, a protected city with bandits, ex-Crimson Raiders and other adventures, who resist Handsome Jack's monopoly and power of the planet Pandora.

You learn that the new Vault Key is being transported via train and you, your buddies Roland, Mordecai, Brick and Lilith (from the first game) make plans to intercept and raid the train. You stop the train but instead of the Vault key, a big ass robot comes out and ambushes you. You defeat him and eventually discover that Angel (the entity that guided you through the first game) is a Siren and actually Jack’s daughter. He is using her Siren powers to charge up the Vault Key. She begs you to end her existence to stop Jack and after an successful attack on Jack’s main facility, you grant her wish, ending her life support. Handsome Jack is furious and launches a full scale assault on Sanctuary, almost destroying it. Lilith uses her bling bling witch Siren powers to teleport the whole freaking city to a different location, saving the day. Lilith is captured however, and Jack is using her instead of Angel to charge up the Vault Key.

The Vault Hunters eventually learn the location of the new vault and prepare to stop Jack, who is already close upon opening it. They fight their way there, confront Handsome Jack and defeat him. They fail to prevent the Vault from being opened and the Vault Warrior is unleashed. In this final fight, the Vault Hunters make short work of him, saving the planet. The game ends with a cliffhanger, revealing multiple other Vaults in the galaxy as shown by Lilith in the aftermath with Jack. This created the opportunity for multiple other sequels and/or prequels.

I really liked Handsome Jack. He is one of the best villains that I encountered in a videogame. His personality, voice acting, dark humor and overall presentation is just perfect. His comments, actions and threats to your characters were hilarious and I laughed more than I ever thought possible.

The graphics are upgraded from the previous game and are still in the Cell Shading format. For Borderlands games, this works perfectly and gives the game its charm. The animations and effects are a lot better compared to the first game and I think this game had some more color and depth in it.

In terms of sound, Borderlands 2 improved greatly from its predecessor. The sound effects are spot on and the new dubstep soundtracks are great. But the best improvement is the voice acting. It is funny, crystal clear and overall, I can only praise it.

The movement, controls and mechanics are improved with various GUI tweaks, better menus and improved control of inventory management. The mechanics work fluently and in terms of gunplay, I have nothing to complain. It is fast paced, accurate and overall, just great.

Borderlands 2 also introduced a million new weapons, new brands, new types of guns and a lot more variation in enemies and biomes. Classic weapons and enemies are also present like Skags and Rakks, which all have more variants now.

I still think the best part of this game is the humor. Every mission, every encounter, everything is one big joke. Names of bosses, many times, refer to pop culture icons and certain missions are just hilarious and stupid. It is just as good (if not better) than the first Borderlands game.

The only big downside with Borderlands 2, is the introduction of loot boxes, in which you need to buy Golden Keys, so you can use your hard earned, real life money to get a chance of a legendary gun, giving you an paid edge over other players in case of duels. Borderlands 2 is a product of its time, in which this “genius” idea was introduced in many games, including Shadow of Mordor, Star Wars Battlefront and many more.

Another small issue, for me at least, is the ridiculous amount of DLC that the game offers. It is almost as bad as The Sims. DLC on it’s own is not bad, and the DLC campaigns where all fun to play, but besides extra missions and campaigns, millions of skins, Upgrade pack 1, Upgrade Pack 2, soundtracks, animations, unorganized bundles of diverse skins and content (but not all), and Season Passes are added, and it is a complete mess. I never had/have the feeling that I could experience the full game because “I am always missing something”. I also completely lost the chronological order of DLC, what is playable content and what is just a soundtrack or a new skin.

Lastly, some boss encounters are ridiculously hard. So hard in fact, that you can only complete them with friends or random people. I did not like the “forced co-op” aspect of the game in which you can get stuck on your progress (mainly raid bosses) because you do not have the friends or people to complete it.

In the end, the main game was a lot of fun and my completed DLC’s so far, were enjoyable enough.

Purely based on the main game alone, I would definitely recommend this awesome game.",1704220703,1704220703,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died.

Absolutely fantastic story, brilliant characters, great dialogues, amazing humour, and a killer musical score. The attention to detail is mind-blowing, especially considering the massive amount of content. Some DLCs are hardly ""DLCs"", more like whole games on their own right. Gameplay can become repetitive, especially if farming for equipment isn't your thing, but even so, the game allows you to play it at your own pace most of the time, which I find to be the ace up its sleeve. This is not to say there is no challenge, but sometimes you want to bring mayhem while others you just want to fire it up just so you can enjoy its vistas and chill. Did I mention great atmosphere too? Even though it's not open world, some maps are big enough to titilate the explorer type players. Not to mention the countless challenges, some of which do need some serious effort to be put in exploration. Also, even with it being a tad repetitive at times as I mentioned, it still keeps your interest as your character progresses too, turning gradually into a one man army. I've been playing mostly Slavador, the damage in high levels is insane, especially with the right combination of skills and gear. I guess it's similar for most characters, if not all. One thing that has struck me is that when you max out, the game has a strange feeling, since you don't need to either collect money or kill for XP. Even so it doesn't lose its interest and it continues to be fun as hell. Overall it's the game I've played the most in at least a decade, maybe in my life. 11/10, seriously. It's great when the team knows what they're doing and are in the mood for making something extraordinary.",1703813666,1703813666,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game was developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K Games in 2012. The game’s story takes place on the planet Pandora, where the player assumes the role of a Vault Hunter who is on a mission to find a new vault and defeat the villainous Handsome Jack.

According to IGN, Borderlands 2 is an “overall superior game” that improves on almost every major game system from its predecessor. The game’s hook is the loot, which includes guns, ammo, character skins, grenade mods, and class mods. The hunt for loot becomes intoxicating because of the tiny rush you get each time a rare colored item spills out of a chest or is dropped by a recently slain enemy. Every firefight and intense boss battle becomes all the more rewarding, because, though you might die a few times and want to crush something near you in real life, it suddenly feels like everything is going to be OK when you’re blasting away enemies with a newly looted gun.

Common Sense Media also praised the game for its fast and frenetic gameplay, unique visuals, and multiple modes (drop-in/drop-out, side-by-side, or online co-op). The sequel offers many more missions and challenges than its predecessor, exceptional writing, and memorable characters and enemies.

Overall, Borderlands 2 is a fun and engaging game that is worth playing. It has a great story, excellent gameplay mechanics, and a ton of replay value. If you’re a fan of first-person shooters or action RPGs, then you should definitely give Borderlands 2 a try!",1703739950,1703739950,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

However, I already know for sure that I will dump several hundred (potentially less if the story starts to get kind of aimless or boring) in Borderlands 2, when I've never even touched another game in the franchise.  In fact I've heard anything but terrible things about Borderlands for years, the original game was kind of mediocre looking and I didn't see the appeal at all.  Nowadays most people are familiar with ""looter shooters"" as in its pretending to be a first-person shooter, but its really an EXP grinder with magical, colorful and elemental damage imbued weapons to traipse over endlessly till you're blue in the face or dead, likely from not eating in the past week as you tirelessly play Borderlands 2.  

I'm not saying its bad, its got the formula down pat, but everything else so far has been pretty below my usual bar.  Loads of glitches, getting stuck in walls, accidentally jumping into things that get me stuck in a wall, a stupid progression system that insta-respawns enemies if its in a quest related area, and oh yeah how could I forget- its Diablo 2.  Yes, I love Diablo 2.   Thanks Gearbox, but that doesn't mean I thought Diablo 2 needed a comic relief character every few minutes to remind me I'm alive and playing a videogame.  The writing is pretty terrible, not so unfathomably terrible that you can't laugh at it, but you usually are laughing because you realize someone actually got paid to write some of the lines that genuinly superb voice actors ended up delivering.  Other things are just themes, or characters or stuff that I have no reference point for since I never played the original.

So is Clap trap supposed to be funny?  Is he our gateway in the ""Border-verse"" if you will?  Because he's all over the original title, but strangely after the tutorial area he is relegated to quest giver character.  So what is the point of him being in every title then?  The humor just doesn't appeal to me, and I'm not fond of any of the characters that I've met throughout my couple of playthroughs.  Handsome Jack is irritatingly smug, and you'd think it would give you some motivation to go after that antagonist, but instead its like the opposite where you just want to mute his voice most of the time he pops up on your radio.  I've restarted a couple of times once I got more of the mechanics down and honestly I don't know how people can play this on a loop without getting bored of that first 2 hours or so.  I would say that a lot of that early game is tedious, where unless you know exactly what you're doing, then you'll need to do all these side-quests that usually involve going to location A or B and killing everything there.  I'm not even sure how unique this type of Action RPG gameplay was for 2010-2012-ish.

The DLC is highway robbery, and I feel like I keep getting ripped off.  I bought the original game on sale, but it strangely hid the ""more dlc bundle for a couple more bucks"" from me until I accidentally clicked on an in-game menu that actually took me to the store page for that particular DLC.  What a joke and kind of insulting that they think I'll spend money for a couple of crappy missions or some cosmetic changes to my characters that I can't even see while playing unless I'm in a menu.  The interface is also disgustingly infected with some kind of horrid console-itis disease.  Its truly not a great interface, nor is it intuitive to go into a separate menu to give my character ""bad ass"" points for random things like extra damage or extra health, or better accuracy when everything is gear-based to begin with.  Those lists of things that give you more points just go on and on.  Some people have joked that this game was literally designed for addicts, but I'm sort of inclined to agree at this point.  I feel like I lost money on this product, but also I just wasn't really that familiar with the series so far.

a true front runner in the looter shooter genre, borderlands 2 revolutionizes the genre with interesting classes, fun and unique gear, impeccable side content and one of the most i interesting villains in modern gaming. the main campaign is a fun rider, never taking itself too seriously unless it matters. the soundtrack is outstanding, with the wind-shear waste background music still being something i listen to now. the DLCs are hit and miss, however the Tiny Tinas DLC being one of if not the greatest piece of borderlands content to date. i recommended this to everyone i can, as it is truly a sight to behold. 

i would totally advise anyone who has this to play through at least the normal mode with every character to enjoy all styles of playing the game has to offer, and to buy all content Borderlands 2 has as it really enhances the experience. and for those who like to mod, this game has a fascinating modding community and a welfare of enjoyable content creators like Joltzdude and K6 just to name the popular ones :)

Could it be the bewitching allure of the cell-shaded art style, so pleasing to the eye? Or perchance the astounding abundance of over a 'Bazillion' guns, the likes of which doth leave one's head spinning in delight? Ah, who truly knows, who can fathom the depths of such enchantment? 

Amongst the series, Borderlands 2 reigns paramount in my heart, and the valiant Gaige, the fairest of Vault hunters, holds a special place therein.

Also notice that the individual DLC's have been delisted from this page, they want you to buy the overly expensive season pass or a new version of the game if you are missing a single DLC. 

Only buy this game or any other Gearbox/2K title if you are a sucker. If you respect yourself even in the slightest then go buy a looter shooter that is made by a team that actually cares. RoboQuest, Gunfire Reborn, and Crab Champions are a few you should check out instead.

Gearbox, 2K, go f**k yourselves you greedy pigs.

Edit: I contacted gearbox about the fact that they have false advertising on their UVHUP2 DLC and that they should at least grandfather people who purchased this into the new DLC so they can access the content they paid for. Gearbox support directed me to a discord channel saying that was the place to ""express my concern and feedback"".

RPG Loaders excluded.

I decided to go back and run a fresh character through for a bit of nostalgia. Most of my experience was positive. BUT I think the difficulty hike immediately after the Bunker and for the remainder of the game started to exhaust me. Could be a skill issue, could be that I didn't itemize well, could be that Gunzerker just isn't a great solo option for NG, but it felt pretty abysmal to hit FFYL a couple dozen times between boss missions and not drop once during the boss itself. That amount of down up down up cycling pushed me to just get to the end asap. I could tell they wanted the player to do side content to over level the quest's recommended level, but that urge to do side content should be organic, not coerced. 

However, that's my only gripe. The comedy still lands, missions are still bonkers, and the loot is still fun to tinker with.

Personally, for me, an absolutely repulsive game. I was curious to see what was up with the story, what was so grand about this creation. That's how it was hyped to me by my friends.
But in reality my eyes were raped by the design in the very first minutes, and personally my immature, weak and groaning perception does not allow playing games with such visuals.
It's probably a masterpiece, the script is probably good, it's almost certainly got superb gameplay and blablabla... But the bloodshot eyes are too uncomfortable an aspect for this kind of gaming.

The good: Every character, every quest, hell, even every gun is unique and  worth experiencing. It's one of the few games that made me laugh consistently through each of the many playthroughs (I beat the game with every class) Its the game that hooked me on looter games because of how satisfying it is to try new guns in this game. And all of the DLC feels like real expansions to the game with the same level of love the base game got but you do not need any DLC to love and enjoy this game. Most of my time played was before it all even came out years ago.

""Borderlands 2"" is an action-packed first-person shooter that excels in delivering a wild and humorous ride through the unpredictable world of Pandora. With its unique blend of frenetic combat, irreverent humor, and engaging looter-shooter mechanics, it stands as a standout title in the genre.

The game's narrative is driven by witty humor, memorable characters, and a compelling storyline. Players assume the role of Vault Hunters tasked with stopping the tyrannical Handsome Jack from taking over Pandora. The charismatic and eccentric characters, along with the clever writing, create a captivating world filled with quirky personalities and unexpected twists.

Gameplay-wise, ""Borderlands 2"" shines with its addictive looter-shooter mechanics. The game offers a vast array of weapons with randomly generated stats, encouraging experimentation and creating a sense of excitement in discovering new gear. The skill trees for each character class provide depth and variety, allowing players to tailor their playstyle and abilities.

Visually, the game adopts a cel-shaded art style that adds to its unique and vibrant aesthetic. The colorful and detailed environments, coupled with a diverse range of enemies and bosses, contribute to an immersive experience.

The cooperative multiplayer aspect is a highlight of ""Borderlands 2."" Playing with friends enhances the chaotic and fun-filled experience, allowing for cooperative gameplay, shared loot, and chaotic battles against enemies.

However, while the game excels in various aspects, some players might find the humor and storytelling style polarizing. Additionally, the repetitive nature of missions and side quests, especially in the late game, might lead to a feeling of monotony for some players.

Overall, ""Borderlands 2"" is a fantastic game that I highly recommend, especially to fans of action-packed shooters and looter games. Its engaging storyline, humorous dialogue, addictive loot system, and cooperative multiplayer make it a must-play for those seeking a chaotic and entertaining gaming experience. Despite potential repetitive elements, the game's strengths in gameplay variety, character development, and humor overshadow any minor drawbacks, making it an absolute recommendation for FPS enthusiasts.",1702449749,1702449749,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The storyline stands out as one of the best, featuring a memorable villain in the realm of video games. However, despite these merits, I hesitate to recommend the game. The issue lies in its constant connection requirement to a server, even in offline mode. The server's stability is questionable, with random disconnections that can abruptly kick you out of your current game session, causing you to lose around 20 minutes of progress without warning. If you're willing to accept the risk of encountering this disconnect issue, give the game a try—perhaps you'll have better luck than I did.

I'm running on a GTX1650 laptop and I can run max graphics settings with 100+fps. The game play is even better. I initially clicked play just to check out the game for a bit but accidentally lost 6 hours of my life to CL4P TRAP's NONSTOP BULLLS*** and also the uniqueness, beauty of Pandora. 

Everything about this game has so much character and personality. I was literally hooked from the cutscene near the start. They really put so much effort into making the experience immersive. Basically after the intro, you are guided by an NPC throughout the journey, they actually play quite an important despite funny role in the story. The way CL4PTRAP interacts with the player from start to end makes the experience even more so immersive. You can really tell that the devs REALLY love what they're doing. 

I am currently 6.5 hours in but I'm already hooked. Everything feels so lively which is what I believe makes it feel so real. I was also thoroughly immersed in being a Vault Hunter, and didn't even realize it gets better than this until I discovered multiplayer. Joined a session with a rando and had so much fun blasting enemies around and stealing each others loot. 

There is almost nothing to complain about this game, its very forgiving despite its challenging game play, there are a multitude of weapons, and all of em are so unique and intriguing to find and unlock. There's even a very unique element system, where some weapons come with element damage bonuses. And to defeat certain enemies, you'd have to combo different elements, which means you'd have to bring multiple weapons of different elements, but also different weapon types so that you deal enough damage. The enemies, to me, are ACTUALLY TOUGH and you actually have to keep your brain awake unlike many other RPG games where you just shut off your brain and let your character do the work for you. 

Overall this was an easy 69/10 for me. Way better than what I initally expected. It's a shame knowing how much the rest of the world is missing out on. I do personally play Warframe. But they are both relatively really great games with their own personality. Just to point out, as a fellow Tenno, I advise that you REALLY give this game a try. It might just climb up your Looter-Shooter tier list. <3",1701945003,1701945003,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How i found out about the game

i was about 8-9 years old when my brother came in the living room where i was and turned on our playstation 3 and started playing borderlands 2. when i first saw it i wasint interested. but my brother asked me to play it and i said yes just to try it out. and it was very fun. when i came home from school i rushed home and waited for my brother so we could play together on borderlands 2. 

what i think of the game

the game is amazing and i only have about 250+ hours on borderlands 2 (on my steam account) it doesint change the fact that i love this game. the characters are fantastic, the storyline is wonderful, the pve is excellent and the special raid bosses are very fun to play against.

[b] Old children's game that is a waste of time for the average person. [/b] 
 
 
 
This game is a comedy-action first-person looter shooter with sluggish movement, boring action, and bad combat. It features forgettable characters running around killing forgettable enemies with hundreds of forgettable guns. Although the game touts 17 million different guns, these differences hardly have any distinguishing features or characteristics, making them tedious and repetitive to farm. The main story is also lackluster, with a predictable plot and full of cliches.
The surface-level character design makes it difficult to get attached to any of the characters, as they are either gimmicky or simply a woman. No joke the female characters in the game are so uninspired and bland, with no real personality traits whatsoever to the point that them just being women is the only noticeable thing about them (not like the male characters are any better). The game is a number simulator with little to no difficulty in gameplay, making it geared towards children, and it basically is a children's game in every other way too.
It only got to where it is because of its goofy and wacky characters that are so lmao out loud epic funny relatable: ""Somebody open me up and put out the fire in my belly... Put it out with knives and bullets and strangling, or I will eat your nephews..."". This is awful. 2013 humor and nostalgia I guess is why people still defend it to this day. Despite the numerous quality of life improvements available through mods, the game is ultimately a chore to play.",1627611143,1701315308,False,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

It's super fun and it  can be replayed multiple times with the same character, which is a great addition as you dont lose the loot you've gained and you get to stick to a character you have grown fond of. Overall I definitely recommend if you want an over the top adventure with great playable characters and non-playable characters. This game never fails to make me laugh through every play through and trust me I have replayed this game  many times. One of my favourites to this day.

PROS: 

+ Gorgeous vista's with fun graphics.
+ Fun gameplay and a plethora of weapons with different characters to choose from.
+ Kinda funny game too. I used to hate Claptrap at first glance but I grew to like him.
+ Great and smooth port.

CONS:

- Personally, I put the game down about 6 hours in. It was just too grindy. Enemies took way too much damage, the game is foremostly designed for co-op play.

Overall, I recommend only if you have a posse and you all plan to play the same game. I don't really recommend it for single player gameplay though. The game is just not designed with that in mind, but it is still a good game.",1700913764,1700913764,True,4,1,0.520270287990570068,0,True,False,False

Ingredients:

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup granulated sugar
1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
2 eggs
1 tsp vanilla extract
1/2 cup buttermilk
1 cup brewed cherries
1 cup heavy cream
1/2 cup powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
Chocolate shavings, for decoration (optional)

Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour three 8-inch round cake pans.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
In a separate large bowl, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the buttermilk, and mix until just combined.
Fold in the cherries.
Divide the batter evenly among the prepared pans and smooth the tops.
Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove them from the pans and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
While the cakes are cooling, prepare the whipped cream. In a large bowl, beat the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until stiff peaks form.
To assemble the cake, place one cake layer on a serving plate. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the top, then top with another cake layer. Repeat with the remaining layers, reserving some whipped cream for the top and sides of the cake.
Decorate the top and sides of the cake with the remaining whipped cream and chocolate shavings (if using).
Chill the cake for at least 1 hour before serving.
Enjoy your delicious homemade Black Forest Cake!",1700895249,1700895249,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Guns, oh the guns! It's like Christmas morning every time you open a chest. Exploding, acid-spewing, and occasionally insulting guns – the variety is more extensive than my excuses for being late.

The co-op gameplay is a friendship forge. Nothing says bonding like running over bandits in a hijacked vehicle while debating which gun looks cooler.

At first, it was challenging since levelling up initially seems a bit painful, but that's everywhere in most games (opinion). But once better gear and weapons drop, I am sure you'll have so much fun. 

I would seriously recommend getting the GOTY at first. If you have enjoyed yourself, maxed out, and would continue even more, perhaps it's time to get the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack#2 and move forward in the most adventurous journey. 

Points I would want to stress on:-

· The graphics are just to comical and different than what I have seen. I absolutely love it. 

· The game is hilarious on so many levels

· The game can be played by yourself and with your mates, but then again it isn't always a good idea to play alone cause... Well, playing with someone would give you the upper advantage, help you beat the enemies faster, and you never know when you need help.

· Guns? A lot, yes.

· The achievements are really fun too get. 

· I love the overall story too.

These are most of the things I'd say, but seriously, get it. Don't have second thoughts. Get some friends, get your communication skills up and shoot every mother****in' people in the game.

BL2 expands on the positives of BL1, with a new engine and playground.

here are my personal reasons:

Loot on top of being fun to min/max stat wise, is also fun because each gun and brand behaves differently. It really helps each item feel totally unique in its behavior. A Jakobs rifle is different than a Dahl rifle, even if they have same stats. 

The characters are insanely different in play style and really come in their own by the end of their build.

It will sometimes randomly set you back to online even after you set yourself to offline. Also you need to reset yourself back to offline everytime you start the game or if you have to reload due to a glitch. That happens often. 

Was much better years ago, they totally ruined this.

It can be fun but it is clearly not designed for solo play, which makes some scenarios and fights almost impossible, despite you being seriously overlevelled and everything else being super easy. Often due to random invisble walls that get you stuck or make it impossible to hit enemies, while you get randomly hit due to animations not being shown properly.

Have tried two of the DLC and must say they both were very meh, kind of having f un collecting stuff but the enemies were more like annoying bugs you swat away. None of the bosses were even remotely difficult (not even when the level was slightly above mine). Except the post story bosses, which are invicible unless you have kept some weapons and prepare your homework by studying online guides. Not enjoyable.

The other DLC, was really crap, especially at the end, some quirky characters but mostly running around swatting flies as the enemies were not scaled and went down so fast it wasn't even funny. But the end, was so lame, your ""frenemy"" just disappears, you get literelly no treause. Just a completely empty treasure room. Hopped down tried to find if there maybe was an entrance to a secret stash and got stuck. The jumping is sometimes is sometimes insanely far and high but a stone block will trap the character.

Honestly if I didn't like working off lists and if getting headshots wasn't so insanely satisfying, I wouldn't bother at all with this buggy mess.

Now that I think about it, the ending of the main campaign was also pretty meh, just way too easy.",1674099817,1700188501,False,0,1,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

sucks

the first 2 hours of the game sucks. choose assassin? good luck trying to beat the first 2 hours of the game by yourself.
why would they give us a character selection if its actually a difficulty slider
suffer for the first 2 hours? games good
first 2 hours leaves a long lasting impression however
you need serious patience for this game
some of the enemies are complete pushovers and some of them literally are invincible
i got stuck on a door for 7 minutes

The gameplay is easy to learn and not to hard to master.
The length is around 60 hrs for a single playthrough if you take your time and try to do the side quests,but that is just my opinion because I do not play a lot of games.
A bit of stuttering is seen but not during the action which is valid considering I do not own a gaming PC

Also,the game is kinda boring for the starting of an hour or two(which is exactly at this point I started to regret buying the game) but after that it catches quite the pace and you would not feel like shutting the game down and just keep on playing.

To sum it all up,if a person is looking to buy something on sale and does not have a powerful PC then this game is worth buying

With its unique blend of first-person shooting, RPG elements, and a vast arsenal of crazy weapons, Borderlands 2 offers a captivating gameplay experience that has won the hearts of gamers worldwide. In this review, I'll delve into the key aspects that make this game a true gem in the genre.

Unforgettable Characters and Storyline:
Borderlands 2 boasts a memorable cast of characters, each with their own distinct personality and quirks. From the charismatic yet villainous Handsome Jack to the lovable and hilarious Claptrap, the game's writing and voice acting bring the world of Pandora to life. The storyline is engaging, filled with humor, twists, and moments of genuine emotion, making it a standout feature that keeps players invested in the game's universe.

Vibrant and Immersive World:
Pandora, the game's setting, is a visually stunning and immersive world filled with diverse environments ranging from barren deserts to lush jungles. The cel-shaded art style provides a unique and vibrant aesthetic that perfectly complements the game's offbeat humor and over-the-top action. Exploring Pandora's vast landscapes and stumbling upon hidden areas and loot-filled chests is a joy in itself.

Endless Arsenal of Insane Weapons:
One of the defining features of Borderlands 2 is its mind-boggling array of weapons. From pistols that shoot rockets to shotguns that set enemies on fire, the game's arsenal is a testament to creative design and sheer absurdity. The randomized weapon generation system ensures that every playthrough offers new and exciting guns to discover, encouraging experimentation and customization of playstyles.

Deep RPG Progression System:
Borderlands 2 seamlessly combines first-person shooting with RPG mechanics, allowing players to level up their characters, unlock new skills, and specialize in different playstyles. The three unique skill trees for each character offer a wide range of abilities, giving players the freedom to tailor their character progression to suit their preferred combat style. The feeling of growth and empowerment as you become more powerful is incredibly satisfying.

Cooperative Multiplayer:
Borderlands 2 shines in its cooperative multiplayer mode, allowing up to four players to team up and tackle the game's challenges together. The seamless drop-in, drop-out functionality and the ability to share loot and revive fallen comrades make for a highly enjoyable and chaotic cooperative experience. Playing with friends and combining different character abilities adds another layer of excitement and strategic depth to the gameplay.

Expansive Content and Replayability:
With a main campaign that offers hours of gameplay and a wealth of side quests, challenges, and DLC expansions, Borderlands 2 has an abundance of content to keep players engaged. The game's replayability is further enhanced by the New Game Plus mode, which allows you to start the game again with your upgraded character, facing tougher enemies and finding even more powerful loot.

Conclusion:
Borderlands 2 is an exceptional shooter-RPG that excels in its memorable characters, engaging storyline, and addictive gameplay. The combination of first-person shooting, RPG progression, and a vast arsenal of wacky weapons creates a unique and thrilling experience. Whether you're exploring the visually stunning world of Pandora alone or teaming up with friends in cooperative multiplayer, Borderlands 2 offers an unforgettable adventure that will keep you entertained for hours on end.

The most striking among these changes is the heightened emphasis on sophomoric humor and an overtly quirky narrative, both of which might be off-putting to players seeking a more mature or nuanced storytelling experience. Furthermore, the limited and uninspired skill tree system, when compared to contemporary game designs, leaves much to be desired and fails to evolve meaningfully from the original title.

In terms of gameplay, Borderlands 2 introduces certain balance issues that undermine the need for player skill. The most glaring example is the disproportionately powerful abilities of specific character classes, allowing them to eliminate foes with a single shot and frequently transition into area-of-effect attacks that obliterate all opposition. This imbalance not only diminishes the need for accuracy but also makes encounters feel overly predictable and lacking in challenge. In the short term, the primary challenge lies in managing ammunition supplies when faced with hordes of regular enemies and occasional tank-like adversaries. This, unfortunately, leads to a sense of repetitiveness, making Borderlands 2 feel like a mindless loot-fueled escapade rather than an engaging gaming experience.

One of the more disappointing aspects of the game is the relentless barrage of fetch quests. Players are persistently tasked with running and gunning through various areas to complete such quests. The narrative and dialogue accompanying these tasks are characterized by a highly idiosyncratic style that might be divisive, with some players finding it quirky and entertaining, while others may perceive it as grating and over-the-top.

Moreover, Borderlands 2 incorporates in-game advertisements for downloadable content and other game extras, forcing players to encounter these ads on the title screen and at certain points when fast-traveling.

Let me preface this by saying; BL2 is an acquired taste and it is NOT for everybody.
When I originally started playing Borderlands a couple of years ago (started wit BL1) I honestly wasn't much of a fan. I had seen some gameplay previously (notably of 2 & 3) and thought that the games [i] looked [/i] interesting and fun but quickly realized that they really weren't for me... the problem is that while the Borderlands community will tell you that especially 2 has a great story and villain, even though the story is like a 4.5/10 and Handsome Jack like an 8.5/10. You have to realize that Borderlands isn't about the story and it never has been either. Borderlands really is about the mindless activity of killing a guy and reloading a map over and over again untill you're happy with what he dropped. I say ""mindless"" because thats what it is. You're not really thinking about what you're doing, you're just doing it untill youre finished. But I still rate this game positively; why is that? As I said, Borderlands is an acquired taste. As long as you recognize that it's just there to kill some [strike] enemies [/strike]  time and get a higher number on a weapon you want you will have a good time. It might take some getting used to and it might seem dull at first but trust me when, when you really haven't got anything better to do and you don't feel like playing another game you will probably have some fun. 8/10",1698664226,1698665462,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Story is nice,doenst take itself seriously, but has some nice drama to it, characters are well written, many side missions and a TON OF LOOT, also you can play in coop. In this game you are playing as 4 new heroes that being - Axton (he has a turret and is more of a army guy), Salvador (Maniac and can dualwield weapons), Maya (Is a siren so she uses magic) and Zer0 (ninja with a cool sword) and two DLC characters (Gaige and Krieg). Villain in this story is name Handsome Jack.  AND DAYUM he is well written. Evil as all hell in his quest to open a vault on Pandora and take control of the guardian of the vault. Our heroes must stop him before he opens the vault. Gameplay is practicly normal - not fast but sometimes slugish. Easter eggs are in this game too and there is many of them. Now side characters - Markus (sell weapons on Pandora and NO REFUNDS! Remember that or he will blow your head off. My second favourite ). Next is Moxxi - in short - sexy b*tch, but she is well written. Next is Hammerlock - a gentleman and second character that appears. Next is Doctor Zed - he is not rly a doctor, but he is the one who heals you and sell you shields that you WILL NEED! Next is my and Mikes favourite character and that is Tiny Tina - she is cute, sounds nice and ofcourse funny as all hell. Mikes favourire, because he screamed when he heard her. And ofcourse there are heroes from the first borderlands - that being Lilith, Brick, Roland and Mordecai with his bird. And ofcourse Claptrap - goofy and annoying but in the end well written. Leveling system is normal - kill = experience. Many enemies from bandits to some army guys that serve Jack. Many bossfights. They say the last boss is dissapointing, but me and my friend say different, we enjoyed the humor and the story so it is well deserved 8/10.",1698185246,1698332152,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

B Tier,
7/10,
3.5 stars,
[/h1]

[b]Worth a Buy?[/b]
- Most definitely, especially if you want to play Co-Op with your friends. Though it would be wise to purchase this during a sale. You can skip the GOTY edition if you'd like because most of the DLC is post-game content and cosmetics. 

[b]Disclaimer[/b]
- This review is based on a single-player experience, not the multiplayer co-op experience, so it does not accurately represent that.

[b]The Good:[/b]
- Blood and gore.
- 12GB install size.
- The art is incredibly distinctive and iconic. It has the feeling of an interactive comic book.
- The game's visuals and aesthetic make it ageless.
- The UI design blends in effectively with the art style.
- When a character makes their initial appearance, a cool intro is played.
- Characters are enjoyable and memorable in a positive way.
- Handsome Jack makes for an excellent antagonist.
- Great voice acting.
- Co-Op for 4 players.
- Solo gaming is still a viable alternative.
- Extremely replayable.
- The skill tree that can be respecced for a fee.
- Contains numerous secrets and easter eggs.
- There are two new game plus+ modes: ""True Vault Hunter Mode"" and ""Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode.""


[b]The Bad:[/b]
- Awful DLC policy.
- Unskippable cutscenes makes replaying very tedious.
- On current PCs, performance can be inconsistent necessitating the use of DXVK.
- The abundance of weapons and equipment in the game can feel overwhelming. As you advance, your equipment will also gradually become obsolete.  
- The limited number of slots and bank space you'll have, as mentioned above, makes this situation worse. Upgrades are a way to increase the amount. It remains too low, however, despite that. If you are a gaming hoarder, you will detest this. 
- The game restricts exploration by putting up invisible boundaries and kill zones.
- Has a terrible, contrived story twist occur during the mission ""Where Angels Fear to Tread (Part 2)"".
- Echo devices, which are voice recordings, are not preserved in the game; instead, they respawn for some reason. 
- Other voicelines can cancel voicelines, which can be annoying. 
- You can't track multiple quests at a time.
- The game occasionally feels repetitive.

[b]The Neutral & Informational:[/b]
- You can bypass the initial start-up videos by typing ""NoStartupMovies"" in the Steam startup settings.
- A lot of extra optional side quests.
- Mostly silent protagonist.
- It might be hit or miss when it comes to quirky dialogue. Though the quirky dialogue isn't as awful as in other games, if you dislike this type of dialogue, you may dislike this game.
- Story writing does not take itself seriously, though it does at times, which can feel inconsistent.
- Is divided into segments in a semi-open world design.
- Has no fall damage, which is great but unrealistic.
- Cutscenes/Cinemamatics are capped at 30fps.
- Because levelling can feel a little slow, character creation is mostly an end-game activity.
- Completing the main story and various side quests took me 32 hours. With the inclusion of new game plus and DLCs, your play time might easily reach the hundreds of hours.

[b]Performance:
Windows 11, 165hz 1080p Monitor, GPU: 8GB RTX 3060Ti, CPU: Intel Core i7-12700F, 16GB DDR4 3200MHz RAM, SSD [/b]
- While easily obtaining 60 frames per second or more, the frame rate and frame time can feel inconsistent. If you want a few more frames, I strongly advise you to set the PhysX setting to low and reduce the view distance. Installing DXVK, which can significantly improve your performance, is also the most important improvement. Here is a guide if you need one. https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Borderlands_2#DXVK


[b]Bugs & Glitches:[/b]
- When you initially start the game or alt-tab, it changes your default desktop resolution and refresh rate to match the game's. 
- The game launcher crashes every time whenever you hover over the news section.
- A crash occurred during the Tiny Tina birthday party mission.
- There was also an infinite loop where the game kept ""creating an online session"".

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
- Since each player won't have the same equipment, the difficulty can vary depending on their gaming experience. As a result, the difficulty can fluctuate depending on the quality of your items. The degree of difficulty was reasonable during my time, and if a mission was too challenging, I would just do several side missions to level up and acquire stronger gear.

[b]Additional Information:[/b]
[b]- That plot moment:[/b] [spoiler]During the mission ""Where Angels Fear to Tread (Part 2)"". A very awful moment occurs in the story writing, which I will now explain. During the final cutscene, Roland is shot through the chest by Handsome Jack, who literally teleports behind him. Roland is then killed by a single bullet. Roland was taken out by a single bullet, despite the fact that everyone was protected by shields and are bullet sponges. Lilith then starts to attack when Jack abruptly strikes her in the neck, implanting a collar that now has control over her. Jack then monologues while your character does absolutely nothing during all of this. Lilith then teleports you away rather than killing you as Jack had commanded. [/spoiler]To develop the plot, this entire sequence felt stupid and forced. 

[b]- Conclusion:[/b] Particularly in terms of the graphics and artistic style, Borderlands 2 has aged incredibly well. Since anything is more enjoyable with friends, the game's inclusion of Co-Op is a great feature. If you truly enjoy looter shooters, this game is for you; however, if you're looking for a serious, story-driven experience, look elsewhere.",1695912830,1698083506,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

While the guns are fun, the lack of an upgrade system is disappointing, and gameplay tends suffer from hit detection issues.

First, let's talk about the characters. You've got Handsome Jack, a villain so charming you'll almost forget he's trying to kill you. He's like the guy at the office who steals your lunch but does it with such panache that you can't even be mad. Then there's Claptrap, the robot with delusions of grandeur. He's like that one friend who's always volunteering to DJ at parties, despite having the musical taste of a kazoo stuck in a blender.

The game's setting, Pandora, is a delightful wasteland where everything is trying to kill you. Seriously, the local wildlife must've watched a few too many action movies because they come at you like they're auditioning for a role in the next Mad Max film. And don't even get me started on the psychos - they're the kind of folks who probably end their love letters with ""Yours psychotically.""

But the real stars of the show are the guns. Borderlands 2 has more guns than you have relatives on Facebook. They come in all shapes, sizes, and flavors - from shotguns that shoot fire to sniper rifles that talk back to you. It's like Santa's workshop, but instead of toys, they make instruments of destruction.

And speaking of destruction, the game's humor is more explosive than a barrel of TNT. The writing is sharp, witty, and as absurd as a clown riding a unicycle through a burning circus. You'll find yourself laughing at the darkest, most inappropriate jokes while casually blowing up bandits and robots. It's a bizarre mix of comedy and carnage that somehow works like a charm.

The quests in Borderlands 2 are like a never-ending parade of absurdity. From collecting pizza ingredients for a psychotic robot to hunting down mutant midgets, you'll wonder if the writers were locked in a room with nothing but caffeine and comic books for inspiration.

If you play co-op with friends, it's even better. The game's chaos level is cranked up to 11, and you'll be fighting over loot like kids in a candy store during a Black Friday sale. Plus, who can resist a friendly duel where you can shoot your buddies in the face while yelling, ""This is what friendship looks like in Pandora!""

In the end, Borderlands 2 is a glorious, chaotic, and hilarious mess of a game. It's like a party where the pinata is filled with grenades, and the cake is a giant explosion. So grab your friends, load up on guns, and get ready for a rollercoaster ride through a world that's as insane as it is side-splittingly funny. Welcome to Pandora, Vault Hunters – you're in for a wild, wacky ride!",1697547017,1697547017,True,21,8,0.694775164127349854,0,True,False,False

Just because the levels are big and tediously drawn out doesn't = ""open world"". 

The story and un-skippable cutscenes are annoying garbage; the forced-path level design is intentionally long and drawn-out to waste time. 

Overall, one of the most highly over-rated games for the low-IQ Brawndo slurping masses who have no idea what an actual open-world game is supposed to be. 
Kudos though to the game's marketing for pulling the wool over the McNugget-chugging sheeple's eyes. Gonna call it an RPG next? lmao

Laughably gimmicky and incredibly boring game. Not even worth the few bucks paid for it or the drive space.

Game is hugely unbalanced, constantly swarms players almost ""Serious Sam"" style but gives you severe mag/ammo cap, inventory cap, you're always emptying whole clips, wasting multiple mags, to down 1 or 2 enemies, while more spawn. ""Out of AmmoLands Poo"" or ""Reloaderland Poo"" is what this poo of game should be called. The reload animations are excruciatingly slow as well. These issues were also found in Duke Nukem Forever. The unfunny, crude, tasteless humor and whole ""always out of ammo, switching weapons, vastly-under-powered weapons"" thing seems inspired by DNF. That game sucked, btw.

Despite obtaining this on a huge sale, it was way overpriced in my opinion.
Games are intended to be fun and rewarding, but none of that is found here. For example, weapons will drop that are above your level, you can't use them as a result of that, but have weaker stats than what you already have. No matter how powerful a weapon is that you obtain, the world ""levels up with you"" but the enemies are always really about 5 levels stronger than the player. The game constantly ambushes the player forcing to fight zerging enemies, bat swarms, monster swarms, ranged enemies, pyro-flamethrower dudes, all at the same time. You'll run out of ammo in no time and barely dent any of them.

That's not fun. That's POS gameplay and design. I also doubt many of the positive reviews, they offer no substance about the actual game ""iT's gReAt! cOoL! So aWeSoME!"", yeah right, I call BS.

The vehicles in the game have crap controls, you have to drive around world with gimmick design not intended for vehicles so have fun smashing into everything like a playing rusty bumper-cars klanging about.

Easy -1/10. I actually found it so unfun, that it was rather insulting.
If the loot is trash then it's not a looter-shooter game but trash-shooter.
If you run out of ammo all the time and have to stand there constantly waiting to reload or changing weapons, then it's a trash-reloader.

Henceforth, this game shall be known as:

Trash-Reloaderland 2: Electric Out-of-Ammo Poo",1681082581,1697501623,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The real birth of the looter shooter genre was here, in addition to a visual style that remains beautiful and stylish all these years later. Not only does it have multiple distinct classes with unique gameplay and personalities, not only does it have like a bazillion guns to hunt and farm for, but it also one of the greatest, or even the greatest villains in video game history, Handsome Jack. Yes, this game has aged, obviously, but it has lost none of its fun and edge and charm, and it is, in my opinion, a true masterpiece. 

Borderlands 2 is the best of all the Borderlands games, and while 3 had the smoothest gameplay and updated visuals, the writing and characters were some of the worst I've ever seen anywhere ever, and then they doubled down on already terrible writing by making every character gay or some bullsh*t, with some of the cringiest ""villains"" I've ever had the displeasure to see. Borderlands 2 though, is as clever and meta and darkly funny as ever, with the basis of the humor being everyone on Pandora is a varying degree of bast*rd. I genuinely laughed out loud on numerous occasions, mostly because of Handsome Jack, but there were a lot of other hilarious lines and missions from other characters too. Speaking of which, the missions were surprisingly interesting and funny, as much as the main story, which is surprising as this is a looter shooter, and missions usually only exist to propel you forward into combat. Not so here, each mission felt like there was purpose in it, and I really did have fun doing them. Except for this game's biggest issue. The Goddam map and UI.

The map and quest markers are my biggest gripe with this otherwise wonderful experience, most of the time I had no idea where to go, whether something was up or down, how far away, and I often ended up on Google looking for the right way. Pretty much all my frustrations in the game stem from this issue, so I just wanted to point that out. 

Other than that though, I had a phenomenal time, with my two favourite classes being Gaige and Krieg, because of both gameplay and personalities. Sadly the characters you play don't really have voiced dialogue, but they do have plenty of voice lines, really letting their personalities shine in the best way. I can't help but grin every time Gaige yells ""Domo Arigato suckaaas"", or makes a comment about which gun to pick up or whatever, and the same goes for Krieg, on top of the incredibly satisfying class mechanics and absolutely crazy builds you can get going. 

The combination of the beautiful world and visual style, varied and layered classes with fantastic gunplay, hilarious characters and writing and perhaps the best villain in a game makes Borderlands 2 a must-recommend for anyone who likes guns, westerns, dark and zany humor, or just good games in general. One of the greatest games ever made.

PS: Get all the DLCs too, they're absolutely phenomenal, and arguably the best content in the game.",1697293215,1697293215,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, it is worth noting the bright and stylish graphics of the game. The fascinating post-apocalyptic world is simply breathtaking, and the detail of the characters and environment creates the feeling of being inside the game universe.

One of the main advantages of Borderlands 2 is its unique weapon system. Tens of thousands of weapon combinations provide virtually endless weapon selection options. Each weapon feels unique, and the arsenal that can be collected is simply breathtaking. You can use either regular firearms or exotic ones from fairy tales. Each weapon has its own characteristics, so you will never get bored throughout the game.

Moreover, Borderlands 2 offers an exciting story and many interesting quests. You have to go on dangerous adventures and fight many enemies. All this is made even more interesting thanks to the wonderful humor and funny dialogues of the characters, who always try to please the player with their jokes.

The game also offers the opportunity to collaborate with friends in multiplayer mode. This makes the gameplay even more fun and interesting, since you can fight together and support each other in battles.

Borderlands 2 is a game that will definitely not leave you indifferent. It skillfully combines different genres and experiences, making you come back to it again and again.

I played the first Borderlands, couch co-op with my uncle and it was a very rewarding experience. It was the first looter-shooter at least that I had heard of at the time. I lean towards RPGs, but I had played quite a bit of Halo, again couch co-op with my uncle. This will make more sense later, but Halo's campaign is still massively enjoyable in single-player.

I enjoyed Borderlands so much that I pre-ordered Borderlands 2 - with a gifted add-on it was $80. I played it maybe 90 minutes the first day and hated it. Never touched it again until recently. I heard time and time again that it was the best of the series so I wondered if I was being unreasonable, or at least why I wasn't able to enjoy it. So I gave it another chance. I played the campaign and got at least to level 50, before dabbling in DLC that frankly could not hold my attention.

Here's what I don't like:

First and foremost they created something called badass rank, which replaced the previous system of gaining small bonuses for a certain gun type, by using that gun type. It no longer matters what gun you use. While I can see why many people would consider this a positive change, I (being of the RPG mindset) did not. I prefer class depth and specialization. 

Secondly, they turned that annoying clap trap up to 11. He was cute in the first game, and this time around I just wanted to blow his head off. 

So that covers what initially turned me off. Then we get to the gameplay, and the mobs are interesting enough. I'd have to assume playing co-op would have helped my experience, but without that, it felt like an almost joyless grind. Every time I got a weapon that dealt decent enough damage, I was met with a difficulty spike within 2 levels that made the gun obsolete. Side quests were just a means to an end. I skipped through most of the zones, just doing quests, the content wasn't very engaging otherwise. 

The story was decent. Handsome Jack is a great villain - that we can agree on. Even the final boss was fun. Though, I didn't really care what happened to anyone outside of the previous vault hunters.

One of the notable improvements is the enhanced A.I., making the gameplay experience feel more dynamic and engaging. The addition of a much-needed minimap and the distinctiveness of various zones further enrich the overall gameplay, setting it apart from its predecessor.

The standout feature of ""Borderlands 2"" is its captivating story. Unlike the first game, which felt a bit lackluster and slow-paced, this sequel delivers a compelling narrative that kept me enthralled from start to finish. The humor and the development of the characters added depth and charm to the entire experience, ensuring there was never a dull moment.

It's quite rare for a sequel to surpass the original, but ""Borderlands 2"" achieves just that. The gameplay is an absolute thrill, offering a perfect blend of madness, addictiveness, and rewarding progression. The story, filled with moments that evoke various emotions, mainly laughter, is truly an impressive feat.

Of course, no game is without its flaws, and ""Borderlands 2"" is no exception. There was a notable performance issue that I encountered initially, despite having a high-end PC. However, the new textures DLC came to the rescue and fixed the problem for me. Despite this, I still had to adjust the settings, such as running the game with PhysX on low and view distance on medium, to optimize performance. Nevertheless, these minor setbacks didn't significantly dampen the overall enjoyment of the game.

For achievement hunters: the game has 75 achievements, with some more challenging than others. It was not an easy task to complete the game. But it is doable and for sure not the hardest out there.

In conclusion, ""Borderlands 2"" is a shining example of a sequel that excels in every way, surpassing its predecessor in both gameplay and storytelling. The game's addictive and rewarding gameplay, combined with its compelling narrative and humorous moments, create an unforgettable experience. While some performance issues may have lingered, the overall package more than makes up for it. If you're a fan of the series or looking for an action-packed, humorous, and thoroughly enjoyable gaming adventure, ""Borderlands 2"" is an absolute must-play.

49520,147423807,76561198023973109,0,11,334,0,334,1696153683,"There are a myriad of things I dislike about this game, however why it is I don't recommend it basically boils down to three main reasons:

1. The overall tone.

If you eat fried chicken all the time, you will be physically unhealthy. Similarly, if you constantly consume depraved media you will be mentally/spiritually unhealthy. I am far from being what you would call a puritan, in fact I do enjoy the first tittle in the series. But whereas the first game depicts decent (on some level) people struggling in a lawless and corrupt universe, the other titles instead seem to revel in, and even celebrate that lawlessness. I understand this is largely a matter of perception, but it sets the game up as needing to redeem itself to me straight off the bat.

2. The difficulty, or lack thereof.

It is unchallenging to the point of monotony. I don't consider myself a great FPS player, but I am well seasoned. It is probably intentionally geared towards, younger, or otherwise less skilled players (there's nothing wrong with that), however the complete lack of any difficulty adjustment, seems like a gross oversight. There are challenges but they are too sparse. 

2.a General combat.
It is often possible to stand in the open before a group enemies and simply take one's time to aim for their heads with a sniper rifle. Their weapons are inaccurate and they do not advance towards the player (I am also left feeling like there is a hidden fudge-factor; it just feels too easy to get headshots). How a combat game with such flawed gameplay is so highly rated, I wonder.

2.b There are no stakes anyway.
You basically don't need to buy anything, as enemies, containers and quest rewards give practically anything you could want, so when the only penalty for dying is a small fee, who cares.

3. Game mechanics that incentivise unnatural play-styles.

A skill that causes the first round in a mag to have bonus damage, another one that gives bonus damage for changing weapons; there are numerous features like this that leave player feeling like they are being sub-optimal unless they do silly things. For me this is the clincher and makes me think the developers didn't take their jobs (or the player) seriously.

Conclusion

If you think pointless sexual references are funny, hate being challenged and love being silly, have I got a game for you. 



At the time of this edit (2/10/23), one person found my review funny, therefore the initial review is here below for posterity.

I say this as a fan of the first game: this is overrated and dumb. It has some of the most retarded mechanics I've ever even heard of, such as, swapping weapons giving bonus damage (WTF). The story is uncompelling as a bowl of dog balls. The president of the planet wants you dead for no convincing reason. The Englishman is stock, one dimensional and can't say lieutenant properly. You have to follow the robot for ages, which the developers even lampshade as annoying, but still make you do anyway. Missions are on rails. Skins that do little more than change the tint still cost money. The vast majority of the combat is a cakewalk for an experienced FPS player but there's no difficulty slider. Guns do silly things that abuse the suspension of disbelief. Enemies are so prolific they don't feel like people. The inventory screen is split up pointlessly into floating panels that you have to change the focus from one to the other for NO REASON AT ALL, and it's something you use a lot. There are a fair amount of sexual references that aren't funny and serve no purpose at all.",1696156126,1696185434,False,0,3,0.384615391492843628,0,True,False,False

My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.",1510365976,1695734940,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game still holds up extremely well, given the fact that it released in 2012. You can truly tell lots of love was put into the creation of this game. I originally played this on the Playstation 3 and luckily this is one of those very few games that works just as well on PC. 

This game's biggest problem is how it handles the level system. Enemies and weapons do not properly scale without mods or DLC, even then enemies still just cap at level 72. As a result, the gameplay can almost feel like that of an MMO, due to the amount of damage certain enemies can tank. You will either be doing too much damage, or not enough damage which can make the late game pretty gruelling and boring ESPECIALLY if you wish to get all of the challenges.

With that being said, there's a reason Borderlands 2 was awarded Game of the Year. It truly is one of the most unique games I have ever played and still rivals current games to this day.",1695677144,1695677144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I only played one run, as Zero. I did over half of the missions, but I'm not sure how much. I had a blast with all the weapons I found. I experimented a lot with the different sniper rifles, and pistols. It seemed the machine guns had little value to me. Other weapons just did a better job. It would've been nice to be able to mod the weapons, but there was always new gear coming at you. The vehicles were fun and easy to use. I actually didn't mind driving with the keyboard. I usually hate it. 

This game runs extremely well. I don't recall having any bugs that were common, if any at all. I had no frame drops. Solid work here.

The story is what it is. If you do any research, you know what you're getting. It's just good fun. Handsome Jack is great in the role. The side characters are funny, and well done. 

The art style is very cool. It's cartoonish in it's use of the heavy lines. It reminds me of 80's Transformers, and the style used in the Devastation game. It's unique, and I appreciated it.

Borderlands 2 is a genre defining title. While the original title laid the foundations of the looter shooter genre, Borderlands 2 surpassed it in just about every way. An absolute classic of the Xbox 360/Playstation 3 era that holds its own better than most even after a decade since release. It goes on sale often so keep an eye out, but it and its dlc are more than worth every penny. I have been playing this game for thousands of hours across generations of platforms since the year it came out and I promise that this is a game that you won’t want to skip.

[h1]Performance/Options - 96/100[/h1]

Borderlands 2 was originally released for Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and PC on September 18, 2012. That is to say as long as your hardware isn’t completely potato, you can run it and you can probably run it well. The game is incredibly stable and very rarely has any issues related to framerate or any other metric. The only real issue tends to stem from Phys-X, which can cause major frame drops depending on the guns used and the areas that you find yourself in. I however find it to be more of a gimmick than anything that gets rid of some features  (can't stand or jump on cloth material) and makes it not worth using anyways. Considering the era of games we are in now where performance is often sacrificed, hopping into BL2 feels like a breath of fresh air that just works on almost any system. Settings are easy to adjust in and out of game and have most of the highly needed options for optimal gaming in 2023.

[h1]Visuals/Audio - 90/100[/h1]

Borderlands 2 employs the cell-shaded comic style. It's become so iconic to the franchise that many compare new games that are also cell shaded to “looking like borderlands''. Overall it's pretty well done, The guns look awesome, the character designs work really well and the world really pops out at you when running through it. However, it should be mentioned that some textures have not aged quite as well and will look fuzzy or out of focus, especially in cutscenes. Audio wise the game does a great job. Music is done by Jesper Kidd, who honestly deserves much more credit for the quality of music he puts out for these games. All the regions have really nice ambience and combat music, and boss fights have a level of epicness/tempo that really makes you smile when duking it out. On the other hand, there are some audio bugs/issues that you will run into on a semi-frequent basis. Thankfully nothing game breaking but it something that will probably pop up once or twice in your first playthrough

[h1]Gameplay - 93/100[/h1]

First off, the basics for Gameplay. Borderlands 2 is a first person, looter shooter with characters who have skill trees and unique actions. 4 characters are available in the base game, with 2 others found in dlc. They are all incredibly unique and offer some really fun play styles that make multiple playthrough necessary to get the full experience of the game. Moment to moment gameplay is spent picking up missions or side missions, running through tons of mobbing enemies and facing off against bosses and minibosses in arenas. Endgame consists of grinding for perfect gear from different bosses/missions/raid bosses (bosses that drop the best loot for a challenging fight). The gear in question is guns that have randomized parts and effects that get crazier and crazier as they increase in rarity. The guns are where each borderlands game shines the most, and 2 is no exception to this. You can find uniques and legendaries that put other looter shooter unique effects to shame. Such as a pistol that shoots a line of 8 micro rockets, an smg that can be thrown as a bouncing betty, and even a shotgun that shoots swords that explode. Seriously, these games go crazy with their loot game. Each character can do 3 playthroughs that scale in level and difficulty, with the final playthrough being repeatable if you want to take a max level character through the story again. 
The Playthroughs are done mostly well. Playthrough 1 (Normal Mode) is an easy story drive experience that teaches you the basics of the game, while you learn to balance leveling and farming for gear with the leveling pace of the game. Playthrough 2 (True Vault Hunter Mode) is where the game really shines and has a lot of special moments as the game was designed for this range of gameplay. More builds, more loot and more options on how to play. Playthrough 3 (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode) has some scaling issues at the absolute top end, but the grind to get there (and if you even just stay away from op5+) is so incredibly recording with some really powerful builds and more loot that you wouldn't have had access to in previous playthroughs. Reaching all the way on each character can be a real challenge but it is absolutely rewarding and provides an experience like no other.
Overall the game and its multiple-playthrough offering of content work really really well to keep you engaged. There's a lot of fun to be had by creating a new character and adding self imposed challenges such as melee only runs or allegiance runs, but even by just playing to make the best character, you will find that the gameplay has a lot to offer. So much so that many of us are starting characters over again just to experience the game over 10 years after it was released. 

[h1]Story - 93/100[/h1]

The Story for Borderlands 2 is fairly simple. The bad guy, Handsome Jack, is trying to take over the planet and wipe you and your friends off the map. He is doing this because he is convinced that he is the hero of everyone's story and that the Borderlands need to be wiped out for him to be able to build his paradise. Oh and he has an army of robots that can be launched from his space station to just about anywhere to fight you. The twists and turns of this game's story are good and everyone plays an interesting role, but there's a reason that Handsome Jack is remembered as one of the best villains in all of gaming. He really steals the show with his twisted, messed up humor that leaves you laughing while also really gunning to take him down. 

[h1]Multiplayer - 95/100[/h1]

Borderlands really embodies the phrase, “Great alone, but even better with friends”. Playing solo has some great perks and makes sprinting through the game a breeze. When you add 1-3 friends to your playthrough however, that is when you get the real chaotic mayhem that this game was always meant to have. Characters have different skills to buff one another, the game scales to have more enemies that are harder to kill to shoot at, and the absolutely hilarious scenarios that you all will find yourselves in increase tenfold. Seriously, if you can get a couple of buddies to go a full playthrough with you, it's one of the best experiences in the game.

[h1]DLC/Pricing - 87/100[/h1]

The DLCs for this game can really vary in quality, but because of the way they are all bundled now, it's absolutely worth it. You have 5 headhunters (short mini DLCs that added a questline a boss that were themed around holidays/seasons), the 2 character packs for characters 5 and 6, the 2 ultimate level packs which added 22 additional levels + 8 op levels, And the real meat and potatoes: the 5 main dlc stories that add new areas, new bosses, new loot and much more gameplay (as well as 8 more levels and 2 more op levels from dlc 5). 
As far as pricing nowadays, there's different bundles that include different options and number of DLCs all from $20-120 To me, Borderlands 2 is worth the full price, but it is one of those games that goes on major sales often, so if you're a little tight on budget or wanna wait for a juicy steam sale, the Handsome collection often drops down to as low as $15. Getting that and DLC 5 on sale will get you all of BL2’s content and Borderlands the Pre Sequel’s Content for under $20",1461622801,1695231250,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Things I like:
-the visuals
-combat is mostly solid
-the characters and story
-variety in play styles

What I didn't like:

-resilience feels the same regardless of level/build/huge stat numbers. What's the point of more shields and health when you can lose them almost instantly?

-deaths can feel cheap; without rhyme or reason. I get the world of Borderlands is psychotic, but it can be very annoying getting torn a new one and not knowing what did what to you.

-None of the wildlife is fun to fight in Borderlands. You may find them to be a general nuisance.

-Some of the weapons can be overly dangerous to the player, particularly the rocket assault rifles from behind cover. You can hit an object's hitbox even if you appear to have the clear shot.

I went back and gave it a second chance and loved the first game in the series. This one is a huge improvement across the board in my opinion. Basically, it is a fun arcade shooter with lots going on. It is a looter shooter so you'll constantly seek out different weapons that randomly generate stats until you get into the late game and can find really great unique weapons that are worth keeping for a long time. There are enough differences between the various weapons and the various character classes that you will always be able to tailor the combat to your preferred style. All in all, it makes for a fun experience if you like this sort of thing.

EDIT: I finally finished it and boy was it good. The story actually surprised me at how good it was. I thought it was a generic story at first but it got a lot deeper when you start to learn more about the villain and why he was doing what he was doing.
The game can be really hard at times especially since I play solo. For the most part, just take your time and learn to use the right gear on the right enemy types but even still, there are times it feels like it wasn't properly balanced or something. In the end, the good more than outweighs the bad so I have to say this is one great game. A huge improvement over the first one in my opinion.

Also, side note, install the high res texture pack from the devs. It is free and looks great. The reviews are super mixed though I think most of them are out of date because I didn't have any issues at all due to the texture pack and I just beat the main story just now with the pack enabled the whole game.

EDIT 2: I would like to mention that it took me 97.5 hours to fully complete the main campaign, all 5 DLC campaigns, all 5 headhunter mini-campaigns and every small side quest possible. I didn't complete the big level 50 quests or the raid bosses (though god knows I tried the latter and failed numerous times) but I absolutely got my money's worth.

Also, of note - I had the HD texture pack installed the entire time. I had 1 single crash during the main campaign and 1 single crash during one of the DLC campaigns. That's 2 crashes total across nearly 100 hours of play and neither were reproducible in the same areas so it definitely was not because of the HD textures. I never encountered a single performance issue either so the game as well as the HD textures were well optimized.

A really fun looter shooter that has so much depth and content to it you'll have lots of fun by yourself. Lots of awesome weapons and the extra characters are all really cool. 

with that being said..

There's only two problems that i have with this game. The first one being the random people that you get matched with are not friendly. Most will kick you at the last second before you can get your loot. There are others that hack the game and cause problems or use hacked weapons that break everything and crash you out. The second problem is the balancing in this game is whack. Basically, if you're not a gunzerker, you won't be able to beat anything on the overpower rank 10 missions. The gunzerker is the only one that has the abilities and the stats to beat the end of game end of game content bosses. All the other characters get hopelessly one shotted in most cases which makes it incredibly rigid and sad that you can't just use the character that you want to use. 

Other than those two issues, this game, along with the dlc is still worth playing to this day. I'd suggest getting the pack that has all the games and dlc's included. Just forget that pre sequel and BL3 exist and you're good to go.",1694733578,1694733578,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Almost 11 years later, this game is still one of the most entertaining looter-shooters on the market. With its quirky, cel-shaded graphics, expansive and engaging open world, and hordes of delightfully challenging enemies, I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have played in a long, long time.

[h1]THE STORY:[/h1]
I don't want to give anything away, but I will say that the story is incredible. So far, I've been laughing myself silly at the impressive humor, and thoroughly engaged in all that the world of Pandora has to offer. I'm excited to see where this game will take me. Most of the story progresses through quests and missions, but it flows smoothly from one quest to the other. It is simple enough where you don't have to go back and redo missions if you haven't played in a while, but complex enough to be interesting and engaging.

[h1]THE WORLD:[/h1]

Pandora is a wasteland, but it still feels alive. Enemies lurk around every corner, and they are diverse enough that you feel like you are walking through a hostile ecosystem. Rakks dive at you from the skies, Skags bite at your heels, and Shock Cacti zap you if you hit them too hard. Borderlands 2 is not just going from quest to quest; you are part of a hostile planet that feels vibrant and deadly.

The quests don't feel repetitive or boring; in fact, quite the opposite, as every new quest and mission you take on gives you something new and different to experience. Everything in this game is well-executed. Borderlands 2 doesn't go wrong at all (at least for me). If you are planning on getting this game, I would pick up an additional DLC or two, as it adds a lot to the experience.

Good luck out there, Vault Hunter. I'll see you in hell.

From the moment I stepped into Pandora, I was greeted with a world teeming with vibrant characters, quirky dialogues, and endless possibilities for mayhem.

The art style, a perfect mix of cel-shading and grit, creates a visual experience that's unlike anything else. The world feels alive with its distinctive design and imaginative landscapes, which kept me engaged and excited to explore every nook and cranny.

What truly sets Borderlands 2 apart is its fantastic co-op gameplay. Teaming up with friends to take on enemies, complete quests, and share the spoils of battle added a layer of camaraderie that few other games provide. The diverse range of playable characters with their unique abilities also keeps each playthrough fresh and exciting.

The sheer amount of guns and gear available in the game is mind-boggling. The excitement of discovering a new weapon or piece of equipment that perfectly suits my playstyle never gets old. The randomized loot system ensures that every playthrough offers a different experience, keeping me engaged for countless hours.

The story, filled with unexpected twists and memorable moments, had me hooked from start to finish. The charismatic villains, led by the iconic Handsome Jack, are a joy to hate.

From a gameplay perspective, it just felt pretty dry and repetitive. Sure, there's a billion guns, but quantity doesn't mean quality and the vast majority of the gunplay is pretty boilerplate. When I did get lucky and found a fun gun, usually a legendary, chances were I'd have to replace it within a couple hours anyway as it became obsolete. Character progression was just fine. Especially in sidequests there's a lot of backtracking and time wasted just running between fast travel points. From a story perspective, I was uninvested and unmotivated. The world didn't really interest me and the areas didn't tickle my fancy. The characters were unlikable and uninteresting, some to a much greater degree, and the writing was annoying to the point where it grated on my nerves.

This game is like a rollercoaster built by a mad scientist armed with rocket launchers and a quirky sense of humor. From psychos who seem to have attended the University of Nutty to guns with more personality than my neighbor's cat, it's a wild ride.

I've spent more time deciding which gun to use than I have on important life decisions. Sorry, life, but choosing between a shotgun that shoots explosive hamburgers and a sniper rifle with a sarcastic AI is just too pressing. And don't even get me started on the grenades – if I ever need to blow up a bad day, I know where to turn.

But let's talk about the characters. They're like a dysfunctional family picnic where your cousin's a talking robot and your uncle's a shotgun-wielding berserker. Handsome Jack is the villain you love to hate, with a face that only a mother could... nope, not even a mother could love that face. And Claptrap? He's like that one friend who's so awkward you can't help but invite him to every party.

The co-op mode is a mixed bag of hilarity and chaos. Working together is essential, unless you find joy in watching your buddies get launched across the map by an exploding barrel. The loot system is like a box of chocolates – you never know if you're gonna get a sweet legendary or a mediocre white pistol that's about as exciting as beige wallpaper.

In short, ""Borderlands 2"" is a carnival of chaos, a symphony of silliness, and a shooter that packs more comedy than a stand-up show by exploding clowns. If you're looking for a game that doesn't take itself seriously and has more explosive barrels than you can shake a stick at, dive into this loony bin of a shooter. Just remember, it's not pandemonium – it's Pandora-monium!",1692395643,1692395643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

○ an advertisement in main menu of the game with Tales from Borderlands (this banner is pretty big, annoying, this isn't free to play game and I not only have Tales from Borderlands, but I have it on 100% achievements, why is it even shown to me?!);
○ and the fact that sometimes you don't get connected to Shift servers, so you can't play.

highly recommend going into this game with friends, while it is enjoyable singleplayer, having even one buddy improves it by so much
characters were better than anything ive seen AAA studios with billions to work with produce in the last decade, and graphics went for style over realism so theyve aged pretty well too

I was introduced to it from a childhood friend of mine, and while most people didn't see the hype and gunplay around it because it was so old, the story alone kept me interested at all times. 

And the grinding. The grinding, while a tedious process, is what makes this a game you can come back to again, and again. You can look for different variations of the rare gun your looking for, different shield and effects for everything, and with there being SIX playable characters, and 2 versions of NG+, this game keeps you occupied at all times. 

Although some of the DLC is weird (story wise) there are some that make it the most memorable experience that you have. Tiny Tinas DND DLC is the bet story i've played so far. 

And while modding this game with a randomized can be tough depending on how many things you have to download, its worth downloading the randomizer so you can shoot grenades out of a gun that defies the laws of physics.

So whenever you can, PLEASE get this game, and play it with friends. It is an amazing story, amazing characters, and truely one of the games to popularize the term ""Looter Shooter.""",1692039293,1692039293,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Eventually it just sort of clicked, and I was no longer forcing myself, I actively wanted to play this game.
I don't have a name for this phenomenon, but its like despite my resistance, the characters found a way to hook themselves enough that I like them all, the gameplay became charming, the monotony even became entirely tolerable because I was just flat out having fun.
So even now, with a max level character, and another approaching soon, I still return because this game is an experience you can't get anywhere else, not even within the same franchise. (except maybe the pre-sequel) Borderlands 3 plays so differently, I play these games for different experiences at this point.

I had more fun playing Borderlands 1, and generally liked the aesthetic of Borderlands 1 more than Borderlands 2. The writing has definitely aged, most of the jokes hold up, but I think the general tone doesn't come across as hilarious as it was when this game came out a decade ago. 

The story gets confused about what tone it wants throughout the game, and the pacing is very heavy on the early game and a bit rushed towards the end. It can't decide whether it wants to be ironic, unironic, absurdist, dead pan; it's honestly pretty bipolar. With that being said, nothing about the writing brings you out of the story except for one or two somewhat frustrating moments, and it is significantly better written than pretty much anything written in the last 5-7 years. 

I also think they could have handled the villain better in the first 2/3rds of the game. No spoilers, but you don't really understand the emotional motivations of the villain until well over half way through the game; it would have been more powerful to have these themes present throughout and foreshadow instead of suddenly springing character development twists that don't fit the tone of the scene, or having the player just listen to audio logs in an empty city, or having certain characters just spell things out for you. 

Because this game doesn't really know what tone it wants, it forces certain cut scenes onto you solely for emotional impact. Like a jump scare but for drama. I felt it was implemented in a cheap way due to the game essentially explaining what will happen before it happens, then expecting some emotional response when, yup, the thing we saw coming happened. (There are a few surprises that are handled well) It's ironic that the writers used foreshadowing in this case but struggled to foreshadow information about the villain that would have made the first half of the game more compelling. After completing the game and playing again, you will notice certain things that coincide with some character development you learn later on, but its inclusion adds nothing to the overall story and could have been left out and changed nothing about the game. 


Anyway, the gun-play is great, and some of the most fun you can have in a shooting game. I think the game achieves the perfect balance of weapon verity and complexity. Just enough to keep you interested but not so much that you are wasting tons of time comparing small stat changes between identical weapons. The guns all operate in different ways and the integrated lore of the different weapons manufacturers is an enjoyable touch. It really caters to all play styles, so you'll be satisfied if you want a specific experience. 

The AI is generally challenging enough and straightforward to learn. Enemies are pretty easy to defeat, and the most fun is mowing through hordes of bad guys while making your way to your next checkpoint. By the end game, and in some of the DLC content, there's a bit of a bullet sponge problem with some enemies and bosses. These fights usually consist of mag dumping the enemy while running backwards, getting hit while trying to avoid a charge attack, reload, mag dump, repeat until enemy is dead. The only real deaths I had were environmental; most of the time death was not due to playing poorly or getting outclassed, but rather lack of map knowledge. I will say this game was pretty easy for me. You level and gain power at a fun rate, but I didn't encounter many difficult areas that I struggled to complete, with the hardest aspects of this game being finding your way around to the marked checkpoint.

In general I think this is a game that most people will enjoy. Even with the shortcomings I outlined in my review, I enjoyed playing this game again and wanted to continue playing while going through the story, even though the story itself wasn't very compelling to me.",1691844662,1691844662,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Handsome Jack is a great villain. Outside of gunzerker and soldier the class design is a lot of fun. Fun story with memorable characters.

Borderlands 2 has cemented itself as a classic in the world of gaming for very good reasons. 

Let’s start with what i liked about the characters, world and story:

While being able to shake things off with humor, the main characters all have their own writing which makes them stand out and the 2 main examples of this are Tiny Tina and of course handsome Jack. Jack is a deranged man who after constant failure declared himself the sole dictator of pandora. His ultimate goal being wiping out the bandits. At the start of the story his character starts out witty and a bit unserious but after holding back his plans so often you are suddenly able to feel his grudge. and while his goals are gruesome and deranged you kind of grow empathy towards him. These are the signs of an amazing villain and he and the story around him alone are worth it to play the game.

NOW WHAT REALLY MAKES ME A FAN OF THIS GAME IS THE GAMEPLAY LOOP.

Borderlands 2, especially after the addition of OP10 heavily plays with the addictive feeling of progression. Leveling up all the Vault Hunters, getting perfect rolls of weapons and shredding raid bosses with them as a result is something that is addictive and fun but feels so rewarding once you got there. Not only that but the many ways you can play characters, for example Zer0 with a melee, sniper or gun build, adds a lot of replayability. Aside from the obvious these elements are made even more fun with the witty characters and bigger variety in locations compared to the first installment in the series. it even one ups Borderlands 3 in this aspect because BL3 shows you 99% of the ingame location throughout it’s story while here there are so many locations left to explore once you are finished. That paired with dedicated drops levels up everything about the game, story and gameplay wise.

The problem is the combat. The guns feel awful to use early and midgame. Sometimes you’ll get a new weapon which does a lot more damage, but feels worse to use due to a lower fire rate and jiggly “stability”. Also, you fight the same 5 enemies over and over…

The main story feels too long for what they’re trying to tell. Jack is [spoiler]super distant, and has no memorable henchmen. His motivations are written into the story, but we don’t see it in Borderlands 2, only in the other (later) games in the franchise.[/spoiler]

Where the game really shines though is its DLC. They’re each a lot more focused on a single storyline, and don’t overstay their comedic welcome. It's here the co-op really shines as well. The DLCs don't take themselves as seriously, so you can laugh together at the fun goofiness. I really liked Captain Scarlett’s Booty (the DLC) and Mr. Torgue’s DLC, but all of them are really solid.

Interestingly, the combat becomes much more interesting starting at the 3rd playthrough (Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode). Enemy variety increases as you fight a mix of lategame and earlygame enemies scaled to level. You must use slag and think about your build path, which lets lategame weapons feel powerful and satisfying to use.

Doubly interestingly, all the weapons you use in the 3rd playthrough and beyond are “named” weapons, which puts into question the legitimacy of the whole looter-shooter concept.

So if you like Borderlands dialogue, you will probably like the game. The combat does get good, but you need to ask yourself if the ~75 hours to get to the 3rd playthough is really worth it.",1691380223,1691381399,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Borderlands 2 is an absolute masterpiece of a game that combines intense action, irreverent humor, and a captivating world that will keep you hooked from start to finish. Gearbox Software has truly outdone themselves with this sequel, delivering a gaming experience that is nothing short of legendary.

From the moment you step foot on the unpredictable and danger-filled planet of Pandora, you're greeted with a visual feast. The cel-shaded art style gives the game a unique and vibrant look that stands the test of time. The environments range from arid deserts to lush jungles, each meticulously designed to create a world that feels alive and brimming with personality.

But what truly sets Borderlands 2 apart is its cast of characters. Handsome Jack, the charismatic yet sadistic villain, steals the show with his witty and darkly humorous dialogue. The playable Vault Hunters each bring their own distinct flair and abilities, offering a diverse range of playstyles to suit any gamer's preferences. The side characters are equally memorable, delivering hilarious quips and heartwarming moments that make you genuinely care about the world around you.

Gameplay is where Borderlands 2 truly shines. The gunplay is tight and satisfying, with an unprecedented variety of procedurally generated firearms that cater to every playstyle imaginable. Whether you're a fan of shotguns that set enemies ablaze or sniper rifles that deliver critical hits from afar, the game ensures that your arsenal remains fresh and exciting throughout.

Co-op play is a blast, with seamless drop-in/drop-out mechanics that make teaming up with friends an absolute joy. The game scales dynamically based on the number of players, ensuring that the challenge remains engaging and rewarding, no matter how many Vault Hunters you've got by your side.

In terms of content, Borderlands 2 is a treasure trove. The main campaign is a wild ride filled with unexpected twists and epic battles, while the plethora of side quests and DLC expansions provide hours upon hours of additional entertainment. Whether you're hunting down unique loot, participating in hilarious mini-games, or engaging in epic boss battles, there's always something exciting to do in Pandora.

And then there's the humor. Borderlands 2 has an unparalleled wit that consistently delivers laughs, whether it's through clever pop culture references, quirky NPC dialogue, or the absurdity of the game's world. It's a rare gem that manages to balance intense action with lighthearted comedy, creating an experience that is as fun as it is engaging.

In conclusion, Borderlands 2 is a must-play title that stands as a shining example of the best that the gaming industry has to offer. With its captivating world, memorable characters, addictive gameplay, and uproarious humor, it's a game that will have you coming back for more long after you've saved Pandora from the clutches of Handsome Jack. So grab your friends, load up your favorite guns, and get ready for an unforgettable adventure through the chaotic and captivating world of Borderlands 2.",1691252303,1691252303,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

Won't take long until you get there, but it's a fun short period of just getting guns that look awesome. After that, you need to look into grip styles, stock styles, a bunch of different styles of each part of the weapon that has hidden stats that is never told to you. It's annoying the first time you find out, but it's alright knowing about it getting in. What the styles do in the end is just make grinding for any weapon feel worthless if you don't get all the meta parts. I would normally say ""It's alright if you don't care,"" but I genuinely can't say that.

I honestly tried my best to enjoy and like this game but I just couldn't. Sadly I did not even finish the the game even though I tried to push myself through it. It was nothing but running and shooting for 18 hours straight witch was my problem with the first game I just quit sooner in that one. The game has basically no story what so ever. It has not improved visually and I feel like I wasted 18 hours of my life trying to push through this game. Well maybe not 18 as I enjoyed the beginning because the repetitiveness hasn't pissed me off yet. Honestly the combat was quite fun and the game had a decent amount of different enemies to keep me interested for some time but again after a while it got really really REALLY repetitive. I am getting repetitive myself so with out further or do this is how I'm going to rate the game.

49520,143070562,76561199117613937,0,35,87,0,66,1692596749,"PART 1 GOAT
Hidden behind A mask of wackiness this game Is A surprisingly good first person shooter. On par with Dooms level of polish. Honestly, was reminded of
playing the six games of Halo on Legendary from Halo: The Master Chief Collection, obvious GOAT.
PART 2 My History
I have A peculiar history with this game. Before Borderland 2 was released My buddies would talk about this game, I was one of the people who was excited
for Its release and played It some time In 2012 when It came out with my buddies on Xbox 360.
This one guy would host the server, me and him completed the entire Borderlands 2 campaign on Xbox 360 twice and once on Xbox One. Each time we
completed the entire campaign, I would lose my save. Me and this guy were total strangers to each other though other than playing the entirety of 
Borderlands 2 together.
PART 3 Issues
When It came out on Xbox 360 there was A weird freezing issue which I experienced which was frustrating. It's 2023, 11 years after Its release and I suffer a 
similar issue on PC. The game tries to connect you to the internet every couple seconds even If you are In offline mode and It freezes the game doing It. 
On Xbox 360 the fix was to unplug your ethernet cable and plug It back In. On PC It's the same for me, cause I don't have good internet. 
Other than that the game Is smooth, even though It's 32 Bit and DX9. I imagine Borderlands 3 from 2019 Is A GOAT from recent times. Also this game doesn't 
like to alt tab which I guess Is A given since It's A 32 Bit and DX9 game.
PART 4 2012
And this game just reminds me of 2012 In general to be honest. Reminds me of watching season 2 of The Walking Dead TV Show and watching commentaries of
Telltales The Walking Dead on youtube too.
PART 5 Inspirations
This game is obviously inspired by Bioshock It adds Its own flavor with absurdist weapon attachments and highly realistic gun animations. But, Its gameplay design Is like that of A shoot em up. Like Halo's missions, you have A set piece to battle on then you move on to the next one while adhering to the games looter shooter mechanics. Doing inventory, buying equipment, reselling items at the store. Definitely inspired by Bioshock and Halo.",1690707393,1690729284,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Lots of action, enemy types, interesting NPCs and a decent story with open world mechanics. Great art style , sweet character costumes, gun skins, variety of guns, items, grenade mods and shield types. Vehicles available to drive around and for combat. Kudos for 2nd wind system.

---------

If i could erase my memory of this game, it would be a regular game for me to play.  If you are looking for a borderlands game to play and are new to the series, I would absolutely skip pre-sequel, part 3, and wonderlands.  If Borderlands 1 ever got a remake with the ability to sprint and all the new cool items, I would play that for sure.

One thing that bugged me when this game released was the removal of the weapon proficiency feature.  In BL2, i felt as if i did not use certain weapon types simply because I didn't need to, or my hero was better with one type.  The weapon proficiency feature forced me to use every weapon class.  really added to the replay ability.  

Please allow us to skip cut scenes after seeing them for the first time.  I don't anticipate gearbox matching the caliber of their old games in new releases.  that being said, follow suit with other game devs and remake/ remaster BL 1 and 2",1690116227,1690116227,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-AAA First person looter shooter

Fit for me:  
-Very poor fit, I don't play this type of game frequently

Pros: 
-Very unique, creative aesthetic 
-Tons of guns w/ different attributes
-Several characters make it easy to pick a character that suits your playstyle
-Playing w/ friends enhances the experience

Cons:
-The open world feels quite empty at times
-I never felt like I was selecting a gun that I liked, just whichever gun had the highest stats
-A lot of repetitive uninteresting enemies early on
-A lot of grinding to upgrade your character and weapons 
-Poor driving mechanics w/ in vehicles
-Walking around to find your next objective can feel very tedious and slow
-Need to put in a lot of hours to enjoy the more interesting, dynamic experience

Thoughts:
-So this game is just not for me.  It's always tough to judge a game 8 years after it was released, especially a beloved franchise like Borderlands.  I was told this game was a hilarious, innovative, fps w/ hundreds of cool guns and boatloads of content.  It's possible that all this is true but I don't have it in me to spend enough time to find out.  Early game there were tons of bullet sponges, lots of wondering around aimlessly, and killing a few random baddies here and there. 

Consensus:
-Bottom Shelf Game (Tier 5 and make up 10% of my reviews).  There are about 150k ppl on steam that absolutely adore this game, so if you like looter shooters, then this is probably worth a try.  I personally didn't enjoy my experience, so I will not be recommending this one.",1596260692,1689815320,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Barely any difference in its clunky gameplay or cringe meme humour.
Absolutely ZERO improvements on overall game design, UI or quality of life when comparing to Borderlands 1.

Playable characters are barely different than those from Borderlands 1 too (beside two DLC characters of course so you know where Gearbox had their priorities).



The good part about this game? 
Well, let's see:

>The dialogue, story, script and villain are so uninspired and generic that its perfectly fits with blandness of Bordelands 1 so if you did enjoy Borderlands 1 then you will surely enjoy Borderlands 2

>The new vehicles are 100 times more fun to use than in Borderlands 1

>New element ""slag"" is a pretty interesting idea, allowing you to do a damage combo with differnet guns

>The final boss fight was 100 times better than final boss fight from Borderlands 1, thats for sure

>DLC's are good. At least some of them. Ok, ok, ok fine - only half of them are ok'ish.....



The bad stuff:

>The other half of DLC's

>Quests, characters and areas are even more boring and dull than in Borderlands 1

>Less unique main quests, more grindy copy pasted sidequests designed for just that one unfunny joke. Every. Single. Time

>99% of boss fights are still uninspired and generic

>Not many new enemy types and way too many crappy reskins 

>Even more cringe jokes

>Clap-trap did rank up from a goofy yet funny mascot into annoying garbage NPC that cannot shut up for even a second. Yay, fun!



Oh, you know the game is bad when your favourite part of Borderlands 2 will end up ""X"" in your inventory so you can easier and way faster clean up all garbage items from it. 

Sadly, developers also obviously rushed this game so much that they didn't even bother to change or improve anything since Borderlands 1. SHAME!

Different characters have different skill trees and things that they are good at. Because of the stylistic animation it still holds up reasonably well on the graphics end, despite the age of the game. Humour and commentary during the game is meant for a mature audience, so that's the only thing I would flag as far as content advisories. That, and the usual level of blood splatter and violence.

For game play, currency covers most things. You can buy health and bullets from vending machines as well as pick them up from monster drops, and you are charged an amount when you are killed and need to respawn. It's annoying to get killed, but so far it hasn't been a major problem. Most ammo is easy to find if you're willing to open containers and do some basic exploring, so I've rarely found myself ammo starved thus far. As you play, you also unlock character customisation options and collect ""badass point"" that allow you to tweak your overall build. For example, higher damage with specific weapons, or better shield recharge rates.

It's fun, and cheeky, and plays well with keyboard and mouse (I can't speak for controller), though the vehicle controls took a little getting used to.",1688263866,1689561159,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead– murdered by my brother-in-law, Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now, and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, he asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded. I... I always thought Hank was a very moral man, and I was particularly vulnerable at the time – something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me in on a ride-along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin, so I agreed. Hank had a partner, a businessman named Gustavo Fring. Hank sold me into servitude to this man. And when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling-out. Things escalated. Fring was able to arrange – uh, I guess... I guess you call it a ""hit"" – on Hank, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured. And I wound up paying his medical bills, which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge. Working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring. The bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA. To keep me in line, he took my children. For three months, he kept them. My wife had no idea of my criminal activities, and was horrified to learn what I had done. I was in hell. I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, and in response, he gave me this. [Walt points to the bruise on his face left by Hank in ""Blood Money.""] I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. All I could think to do was to make this video and hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is",1685898514,1689328916,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Weapons:

What truly sets Borderlands 2 apart is its ""bazillions"" of procedurally generated guns. With a combination of parts, manufacturers, and elemental effects, the game generates an almost endless variety of weaponry. No two guns are exactly the same, keeping the looting experience fresh and exciting throughout your journey.

Tiny Tina DLC:
The visuals in Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep are simply enchanting. The DLC transports players to a vibrant and imaginative land filled with towering castles, mystical forests, and treacherous dungeons. The cel-shaded art style remains true to the Borderlands aesthetic while incorporating a delightful fantasy twist, resulting in a visually stunning and cohesive world that is a joy to explore.

Re-bought it for PC after playing it initially on Xbox 360, still holds up after all these years, every play through has multiple new things to discover and the dialogue never gets old.

Borderlands 2 def became one of my favorites, even after the pre-sequel and Borderlands 3 were released, something about Borderlands 2 is just special.

Coming from a lifelong console gamer, playing Borderlands 2 on mouse and keyboard was a bit challenging, as my usual FPS technique did not apply, but after a bit, I quickly realized how much better is it to game on mouse and keyboard, this has upped my enjoyment of Borderlands 2 even more.

The music gives you an intense feeling while fighting for your life or the most melancholic melodies while feeling utterly alone while exploring the vast wasteland, prob one of the best soundtracks to any game, I tend to listen to the music even when not gaming to re-visit that wasteland feeling when not gaming.

The graphics are simple yet give it that perfect post-apocalyptic look that more games should consider, they fit Borderlands perfectly.

I have spent countless hours just wondering around and staring at the well crafted worlds, or done the opposite and hunted down a single boss multiple times for the potential loot, there are countless ways to go about it.

Highly recommended if you like multiple styles of genres in one game, even after beating it, new enemies will be available to up the replay value even more.",1688535550,1689062914,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Most fun I've had is in True Vault Hunter Mode (NG+, just speed run the story missions and when you start NG+, actually start doing every side mission) and using Gibbed to get to level 50 with a bunch of insane weapons. It's more fun when you're at your peak and the enemies STILL try to put up a fighting chance.

UVHM is a bit much for a casual player like me. You gotta sweat AND put together an entire class to get through any interaction with anything. I'll stick to TVHM tyvm",1689041357,1689041357,True,0,1,0,1,True,False,False

I used to drop it every time I tried it on reaching something like lvl 15 of normal* playthrough before, however one time I decided to finish it I absolutely didn’t regret that I gave it a chance. Now I plan on completing it with every character or at least the most of them. 

Even though the game is not boring playing solo, coop is a way much better approach, if you don’t have friends try to find someone to play with you on discord communities, steam groups, etc…

Information after this sentence may be considered spoiler/gameplay spoiler for someone. Read at your own risk!

If you want to play this game, I’d like you to consider the following:

	1. This is by far the most important thing. Talking about playthrough I used the word normal*. The game lets you complete main storyline 3 times per created character. There is huge number of side quests including DLCs and you will travel the world a lot completing all these (we will come back to this particular moment later in (2.)). So, what’s the catch here you may ask? Well, the first normal* playthrough is just the beginning of the actual game. You complete the main story and then you are able to start a new game using your current character jumping from normal* to True Vault Hunter Mode (TVHM from now on). If you decide to give it a try, your normal* progress in normal world is saved (you will be able to come back here later any time you want), your inventory as well as perks and level is kept aswell (so basically it is NG+). What does the TVHM give you? Briefly, more powerful enemies and bigger chance of getting a rare item. After completing main storyline on TVHM once again you will be rewarded with Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. This is when the REAL game starts. You get even more powerful enemies as well as even bigger chance of getting a rare item. In conclusion, I STRONGLY recommend just speedrunning (not the actual speedrunning but you got me :) ) normal* and TVHM worlds without touching that much of side quests. Again, you will be able to jump on any of the worlds: normal*, TVHM, UVHM and the chances as well as enemies will remain the same as they were before jumping to the next type of world

	2. So, before I said that you will travel a lot and I REALLY meant it. What could help you here? Mods. They also help filling your ammo and healing with 1 button instead of browsing in-game store. It might annoy you. I don’t know any more things I can add here so I will just leave my recommended essential mods list here:
- Better Spawns And Better Travel – allows you to travel from any location that has teleport station it is THE MOST important mod on my opinion. Will save you huge amount of time wasted running around
	- AutoPickup – auto picks up syringes, ammo, money and eridium 
	- Bank And Stash Anywhere – allows you to open bank and stash from anywhere, useful things to not travel to sanctuary when you find a valuable thingy
	 - Bossbar – adds healthbar to important enemies who don’t already have it
	- First Person Driver – nothing to add xd
	- Loot Marker – adds map marker to important loot
	- Loot Notificator – plays a sound when something valuable has dropped and also leaves particles
	- Mission Quickswitcher – I already said that there is a huge number of quests
	- Movement Tech – allows you to double jump. I think that the game should have this possibility. It is not OP but movement feels way better with this one
	- PickupAsTrash – allows you to pickup items and mark them trash instantly and this feature lets you sell them all with one click later
	- PickupMessage – shows a message with the name of item you just picked up. Helpful when you picked up something by accident
	- Unspec Skills – even though the game gives you the ability to pay A TINY amount of money for doing this, it may be annoying to reach the customization station each time. It is just a time saver. Just press right click to get the skillpoint back

3.Buy ALL DLCs. They are great. Just trust me. My personal fav is Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragonkeep but you should also check the others. Some of them are not that big but there are huge ones

Have fun playing, Vault Hunter !

The kind that will give you diabetes if you eat too much.

The franchise basically wrote the book on how to make a mediocre shooter along the lines of the seventh gen. Everything you need is there. An endless grind list of generic objectives, a boring progression system, gameplay that is a carbon copy of Call of Duty mechanics mixed with a very basic randomized rpg loot system of games like Diablo, timid weapons that seem to be made of cardboard and that the despite having a huge variety, ironically they all look the same, almost non-existent level design. And humor... Haha. Lots of decade-old teen humor written by bearded adults.

""Diablo with guns"" called those who had little regard for Diablo and shooters in general.

IT'S ABOUT NUMBERS GOING UP.

That's exactly it. No skill required boys. Just the empty, addictive satisfaction of watching your time evaporate.

And everything is fine. It's a very polished product and the choice to utilize cellshading has made this game age better than any other of its time. If you're looking for an excuse to turn your brain off without learning anything interesting or maybe doing something undemanding while listening to podcasts, or simply have friends with as dubious taste as yours to join you in what is perhaps one of the most canned products of the last decade. Go ahead. It's almost fun.

P.S: And I should warn you that people stupider than me (There aren't many) have complained about Borderlands 3 for some reason. It's the same game, just prettier and the weapons have a bit more impact and genuine variety. It's a better game in every way except... The writing part? Which has always been bad for anyone who has ever come close to a book in their life. The writing and the cartoonish sense of humor was never a high point. It's a brand of ""comedy"" made by people who think Clap Trap having pictures of bikini robots on the wall is funny. So... go play Boderlands 3 instead of this.

P.S.S: The giant staircase joke is good.

What can I say about Borderlands 2 that hasn't already been said, written or drawn on Rule 34... Yeah... Especially nine years after the game has been released and Borderlands 3 has been out for a while as well...

Well, it's the archetype of looter shooters, right? You shoot, you loot, you chuckle at some funny reference, rinse and repeat. Fairly mindless, as the entire FPS genre is, but the difference is this one is actually worth a crap. At least for a little while, it does get repetitive eventually.

The story is pretty good and a decent continuation of the first game and the art style is the signature Borderlands feel which is great. It also includes Tiny Tina so that's a win.

I wasn't a fan of the elemental damage system, it simply doesn't work as well as you would expect, but then again, I played primarily as a Sniper Zero so I mostly just one-shot-crit everything, so it might just have been me. Most of the UI works well, but there are certain parts of it that are simply idiotic. Why isn't there a ""Fill Ammo"" button at the vendor? The ""stash"" interface is also horrific.

Don't even get me started on compatibility. The game version is 1.8.4 on Linux, 1.8.5 on Mac and 2.0.0 on Windows. Now, I generally would laugh at you if you decide to mainstream game on anything that's not Windows, but how can you half-ass a popular game so much that you don't even have the same versions? That means cross-play between PC platforms is all but impossible (there are workarounds, but not for the latest DLC).

There are too many goddamn DLCs and most of them are garbage. The Tiny Tina one would be amazing if it didn't have the worst enemies in skeleton types and the worst ""arena""-type quest. And to be fair, I don't expect that to get any better with future games, considering Gearbox is now partially owned by an umbrella company.

It seems like I bash it a lot, but the main game alone is worth a playthrough and is indeed fun and entertaining. The rest is a questionable money grab, but can be fun, especially if you have someone to play with. But it all comes together in the Handsome Collection for like $10, if not less at this point, which includes the Pre-Sequel, so it's definitely worth a purchase.",1612974138,1688584821,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Interesting enough, the element that a lot of reviews highlight, which is the writing, doesn't gel with my tastes at all. If you consider it to be good writing going through a never-ending stream of jokes where the punchline is always killing or torturing someone, then please guffaw away, but what actually caught my attention was everything else.

It can't be overstated how amazing the artstyle is, and the overall feeling of the world benefits a lot from the comic book aesthetics. There is also an interesting sense of space that is neither one of those endless worlds nor a constrained space, reaching a good balance between both.

The gameplay loop is very tight, and the player always feels compelled to find something to do. Level scaling is not a mechanic I usually appreciate, but here it actually works quite well. Just remember to only accept missions when you are actually going to do them, because the acceptance is what scales the mission, no matter when you complete it.

Combat feels fun and mostly skill-based, weapon variety is of course off the charts, and there is enough reason to both conserve some of your equipment and switch part of it all the time. I guess this kind of synthesizes the main quality of the game: balance.

It is fun enough to run though the campaign multiple times, but what I found to be a blessing on my second run was to simply disable voices and let go of the so-called witty dialogue. The game felt much faster and more interesting to me. Your mileage may vary.",1533985303,1688531931,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've done everything possible up to and including OP 10. All of the DLC. All of the re-runs. Multiple consoles. (almost) Every character played. Here are my thoughts.

It's overwhelmingly positive for a reason. It's super fun to shoot the weapons. The enemies are extremely diverse and fun to listen to burning while purpled up becuase the guns can do that. 87 Bazillion guns to play with. And every class is fun to play and have their place in the game.

The elemental system is well built and makes sense. Fire for flesh; Electric for sheilds; Corrosive for metal; Slag is a debuff.
Every gun has a manufacturer attached, which gives every gun a base set of stats and expected behavoir per Brand.
A more ""hidden"" system are the gun parts, each identifiable and give set buffs and nerfs which make every gun unique.
The classic RPG color rating system (WGBPO) makes every dropped gun's value instantly recognizable at a glance.
Many guns have flavor (red) text which gives them extra unique effects.
Skill tree's are very fun to mess around to drastically affect your gameplay.
Every character has a unique personality and decent enough skills and skill trees.

Every single one of these elements tied together with a great story, plenty of side missions, and arguably the best villain ever to be written in a video game create the all time classic known as Borderlands 2.

It has some wrinkles that show it's age unfortunately. The humor is VERY 2012; modern graphical updates overload the old engine, leading to an unfourtante but livable amount of crashes; the online play is a little unreliable; and some settings outright break the game (physX).

Also the OP level system is pretty bad. It really limits viability of 95% of loadouts and weapons, which grows stale very quickly since you already beat the game 3 times at increasing difficulty to access it. Honestly I only went through it to challenge the Digistruck peak, not to carry over OP 10 guns to base UVHM. it's like carrying level 50 guns to the easiest mode (at least I don't find being outrageously overpowered very fun).

the game has a surprisingly active modding community, and they just keep getting more and more impressive

commander lilith and torgue DLC are both pretty mid. Commander lilith brought the worst change to the game, increasing level cap to 80 and increasing OP cap to OP10 along with fixing some really fun bugs and exploits that just didn't need to be fixed, along with being separate from the handsome collection and only being free for like the first month it came out (now it's like $15). Now it's just a chore to get to max level on a character. But it's still overall a great game.

The best balanced playthrough is definitely TVHM, and my personal favorite Vault Hunter is probably either Maya or Axton, just to steer people in the direction of where I think the most fun can be had. The others are all great though, I just like Maya and Axton the most. They are 10/10 playable characters in a sea of other 8 and 9/10s.",1688099197,1688099287,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(HOT TAKE REVIEW)



1. the story is good haven't dived to deep into it, the villain is memorable and the vault hunters you pick are very well written and have depth 

2. the graphics are iconic not good in a logical sense but still really interesting in a good way

3. lots of guns and stuff to gather/grind for

4. lots of side quest and stuff to do

5. BORDERLANDS 3 IS BETTER IN TERMS OF GAME PLAY (Meaning in borderlands 3 i had way more freedom and more perks to help with taking down hordes of enemies, the story in borderlands 3 is just utter poo-poo the villains are probably the worst in the franchise)

6. borderlands as franchise is iconic but looking at it now, it doesn't hold up well considering all the new stuff being produce and failed to make a standing in the new gaming area (borderlands 3 was mostly hated and tiny tinas wonderland isn't even talked about and not really good at all)

7. its a good game if you get it on sale or get the handsome collection so you get more games for a cheaper price 

=5/10 (still would recommend this, cautiously though, more than half of the franchise is considered mediocre by the majority of the fan base the only good ones in Majority opinion is borderlands 1 and 2. Not speaking for everyone obviously everyone has there own opinion but like rarely you find anyone in the borderlands franchise saying that borderlands 3 or tiny tinas wonderland or pre-sequal is better than borderlands 1 and 2 in terms of story, dlc, characters, game-play combined)",1671178258,1687535394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

A must play of its genre, the most iconic Borderlands game ever produced. 

Handsome Jack is the ultimate videogame villain.

Plays greatly on solo, Plays even better with friends.

DLCs are great

The magic somewhat ends once you hit NG+ (TVHM) as it becomes exponentially harder. NG++ is a total nightmare as the game wants you to abuse ""Slag"" to just kill mobs.

90% of total available builds just don't work on UVHM because player skills don't scale well with the increased difficulty.

You will spend the majority of your UVHM dying in 5 seconds, because everything against you is stupidly overpowered. Having 1Mln health is useless since eveything in the endgame is about stupid big numbers vs other big numbers.

Having to play the same fucking story 3 (three!) times to reach UVHM will kill your soul. Imagine doing that for every character.

Plus... there's no way back from UVHM.",1687184093,1687184093,False,1,0,0.416067153215408325,2,True,False,False

It is the highly acclaimed sequel to the original Borderlands and is widely regarded as one of the best entries in the series.

One of the standout features of Borderlands 2 is its irreverent and humorous tone. The game's writing and dialogue are filled with witty banter, clever pop culture references, and memorable characters. The charismatic and diverse cast, including the villainous Handsome Jack, brings the world of Pandora to life and keeps players engaged throughout the story.

Speaking of the story, Borderlands 2 delivers an entertaining and engaging narrative. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, players embark on a quest for revenge against the tyrannical Handsome Jack, who rules over Pandora with an iron fist. The story is well-paced and filled with twists and turns, accompanied by memorable missions and side quests that offer hours of enjoyable gameplay.

The gameplay in Borderlands 2 is a satisfying blend of first-person shooting and RPG elements. Players choose from four unique character classes, each with their own special abilities and skill trees, allowing for diverse playstyles and customization options. The loot system is a major highlight, with an overwhelming variety of weapons, shields, and mods to discover. The joy of finding powerful gear and experimenting with different combinations adds a layer of addictive excitement to the gameplay.

Borderlands 2 truly shines in its cooperative multiplayer mode. Playing with friends or online partners enhances the experience, as the game scales the difficulty and loot drops accordingly. The cooperative play promotes teamwork, coordination, and the sharing of loot, resulting in memorable and enjoyable gaming sessions.

Visually, Borderlands 2 features a distinct cel-shaded art style that sets it apart from other games. The colorful and vibrant graphics, combined with the detailed environments and character designs, create a visually appealing and immersive world. The accompanying soundtrack complements the gameplay with its energetic and catchy tunes.

One minor criticism is that the game can become slightly repetitive, especially during extended play sessions. Some players may find themselves engaging in similar types of missions and encounters throughout the game, which could lead to a sense of familiarity and predictability.

Despite this minor drawback, Borderlands 2 is a remarkable game that successfully blends humor, action, and RPG elements into a highly entertaining package. Its engaging story, memorable characters, addictive loot system, and cooperative multiplayer make it a must-play title for fans of the genre. Whether you're a seasoned vault hunter or new to the series, Borderlands 2 offers countless hours of chaotic fun and excitement.",1638850546,1686795408,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

not a single line in the game has made me laugh, the ""humor"" is extremely dated and very forced.
i remembered how they removed the word midget from the third game and was thinking about how stupid of a standpoint it is for them to have about not being offensive when, firstly, the entire game is about shooting people, namely in the face. secondly, within about 5 minutes of gameplay there was a crack at overweight people, followed by a remark about a character essentially being autistic. don't get me wrong, i can take a joke (albeit nothing i've mentioned qualifies as one), but if you're only going to remove *one* thing to try and censor your game to be politically correct, then obviously its some cheap shit cop out.
the last thing i find an issue with, which isn't exclusive to this game, is the ai. literally every time i get knocked down there either isn't an enemy close enough for me to actually hit, or the enemy that knocked me down runs away and hides behind something. it essentially feels like the enemy needs to be directl;y in front of you for it to actually work, and even then its still a crapshoot. especially in the first game when you can't. fucking. move.

Borderlands 2, developed by Gearbox Software, is an exhilarating first-person shooter that combines addictive gameplay, a sprawling open world, and a captivating narrative. With its unique blend of humor, diverse characters, and a mind-boggling amount of loot, Borderlands 2 manages to deliver an unforgettable gaming experience.

At the heart of Borderlands 2 lies its loot system, which is nothing short of a treasure trove for players. From guns that spew fire to shields that regenerate health, the game's extensive arsenal caters to every playstyle imaginable. Each weapon feels distinct and boasts its own set of perks, leading to a never-ending hunt for the perfect gear. The sheer satisfaction of stumbling upon a rare piece of equipment or a legendary weapon cannot be overstated, and the game's loot system keeps players hooked for hours on end.

The reward system in Borderlands 2 is equally addictive. Accomplishing quests and defeating enemies grants experience points, leading to skill points that can be allocated across a diverse skill tree for each character. This allows players to tailor their abilities to suit their preferred playstyle, adding depth and strategy to the gameplay. Additionally, the game offers a robust challenge system, encouraging players to complete certain objectives for unique rewards and bonuses. The sense of progression and constant stream of rewards serve as a powerful driving force, ensuring players are always motivated to push further into the game's wild and dangerous world.

One of the standout features of Borderlands 2 is its exceptional storytelling, propelled by the enigmatic and delightfully malevolent antagonist, Handsome Jack. Jack's charismatic personality and sarcastic wit make him a truly memorable villain. His presence looms large throughout the game, and players are constantly driven to stop his reign of terror. The narrative takes unexpected twists and turns, often subverting expectations and showcasing the game's exceptional writing. The supporting cast of characters, each with their own unique quirks and motivations, further enhances the storytelling experience. From the siren Lilith to the eccentric robot Claptrap, the vibrant characters create a tapestry of personalities that keep players engaged in the unfolding drama.

The world of Pandora, where Borderlands 2 takes place, is a post-apocalyptic wasteland filled with bizarre creatures, bandits, and hidden treasures. The game's art style, a blend of cel-shading and gritty realism, brings this desolate world to life in stunning detail. Each area is intricately designed, featuring diverse landscapes and distinct environments. Exploring the vast expanse of Pandora is a true adventure, as players stumble upon hidden caves, abandoned settlements, and breathtaking vistas. The world-building is masterfully executed, making Pandora feel like a living, breathing entity that demands to be explored.

Furthermore, Borderlands 2 boasts a wealth of exceptional downloadable content (DLC), expanding the game even further. From the hauntingly atmospheric ""Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep"" to the wacky and hilarious ""Torgue's Campaign of Carnage,"" each DLC offers a unique and memorable experience. These expansions not only introduce new areas and enemies but also deepen the lore and expand upon the main story, giving players countless hours of additional gameplay.

In conclusion, Borderlands 2 stands as a shining example of a well-crafted, immersive gaming experience. Its addictive loot system, rewarding progression, compelling storytelling, and memorable characters make it an absolute gem in the world of first-person shooters. Whether you're a fan of chaotic gunfights or engrossing narratives, Borderlands 2 delivers on all fronts, cementing its place as a modern classic in the gaming industry.",1607023222,1686667773,True,3,0,0.566929101943969727,1,True,False,False

TLDR-
Borderlands 2 arguably the best all around of the borderlands games offering a really fun casual experience with a lot of content to have fun chilling and playing with friends as well as a more dedicated hardcore experience with plenty of late game content that will put your min maxed build and your personal skills to the test

Characters-
All of the characters are quite varied in their individual playstyle ranging from the straight forward commando who throws down a sabre turret to provide support and defense to give you breathing room to shoot to your hearts content on the other side of the spectrum you have the Gunzerker which very basic on the surface dual wielding two guns of your choice as your knowledge of the game and his skills specifically improve provides arguably some of the most variety in how you play the game such as infinite ammo as well as infinite damage when built correctly

Story-
To be honest none of the borderlands games have much in the ways of good story telling there's some fun moments but you definitely aren't gonna replay the game for the story

Looting-
This game offers a nearly infinite amount of variety when it comes to the loot to be aquired as you play through Borderlands 2 the game obviously isn't the greatest at balance due to the sheer amount of gear to be found it has it's top tier guns that leave everything else in the dust but with raid bosses as an exception pretty much every gun can give you a really fun time playing through the game whether it be for a more casual experience or if you're playing one of the many challenge runs the community has thought up over the years

Repeatability-
While the game is already very long if you include expansions with just one playthrough upon defeating the game once you unlock True Vault Hunter mode which is basically NG+ and beating True Vault Hunter mode unlocks Ultimate Vault Hunter mode which is the final playthrough stage of the game although being quite a bit more difficult than the previous two usually requiring a fair amount of skill in utilizing the game's mechanics if you find that even after that you still want more give a different character a try from the start as each character is very different from the next usually offering an entirely different experience from the previous not to mention there's plenty of personal challenges that the game is very accommodating towards

End Game-
Borderlands 2 in my opinion has the best end game content in the entire franchise as it offers a lot of challenge as well as stuff to do in terms of end game for the start after reaching max level it's in your best interest to find the max level variants of your favorite weapons and gear to prepare you for the challenges ahead after making sure all your gear is put together there are arguably two main challenges in the end game of Borderlands 2 Raid Bosses or The Peak the peak is a long gauntlet that as you playthrough will throw pretty much every enemy you've ever encountered in the game not including dlcs generally speaking you're tasked with running through this gauntlet 10 times each time you defeat the gauntlet you go up one overpowered level which is basically another level on top of your max level stacking up to overpowered level 10 and the gauntlets difficulty for the next run through is increased onto raid bosses typically stand out for their name usually containing ""The Invincible"" for every expansion you get two additional raid bosses to challenge these bosses are generally speaking meant to be fought with a team of four but they are more than possible solo although they will be significantly harder doing so now they are not all created equal in their quality, challenge, or fun fighting some of them can be really fun and rewarding to fight while others are extremely tedious, drawn out, and reward next to nothing (or in the case of Dexiduous literally nothing) for the effort invested in terms of which ones are fun and aren't I can't really say as each person is different in terms of which raids they find fun and/or challenging 

Additional notes-
-The game has a little bit of a modding community there are several overhauls as well as challenge mods to further add replayability and freshness to each playthrough it's unfortunately not as easy to start modding as other games but it's not too bad once you get it down
-This game even after 10 years of existing still has a very active community on both youtube and the game's fan wiki so if you're still unsure watch some people on youtube play through some challenge runs or something they're very entertaining to watch even if you're not a fan of borderlands",1550984248,1686472244,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

-Decent shooting
-A lot of different weapon varients
-A higher budget Borderlands 1
Negative 
-Always online feature in single-player means any server connection issues result in instant disconnection without save
-A lot of useless DLC which will keep dangling missions, items, and way points despite you not owning them.
-A lot of the best weapon drops are gate-kept by twitter (why?)
-So many areas which look explorable just make your character get caught on invisible walls.

If you are not a fan of your single player games connecting to the Internet for no good reason, or if you simply play your games offline for whatever reason, be warned that you will encounter technical difficulties and annoyances with Borderlands 2 on PC (the game will hang up on startup for five minutes, each and every time, while desperately trying to ""call home"" and it won't let you quit the game by normal means once your play session will be over (I kid you not)).

Thanks, Gearbox.

Solo and offline players, you've now been warned.

Edit: I managed to find a workaround that does the job. One has to go out of one's way in order to downgrade one's game's version. Follow this guide: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2014284368

I am also recommending disabling the black outlines (visit the BL2 page on PCGamingWiki) and using ReShade with Lumasharpen cranked up to the max. The game graphics really shine, that way. You can look up how to enable the console and push the FOV beyond 110 aswell (which I still find too narrow, while 120 feels great).

Also use those launch options:
-nostartupmovies -NoController -nolauncher

Then, you can go to NexusMods and find yourself a save editor in order to do whatever you still need the game to do, and voilà, you are all set.",1670596331,1685906378,False,1,0,0.522058844566345215,0,True,False,False

Played mostly with others, which is the only way to play this game.
Fun extra characters.
One of the most enjoyable multiplayer, co-op experiences ever. Played it with 3 of my nephews each week and I really looked forward to each week. It took everything that was good about the original and improved on it, except in the player characters. The original player characters were more memorable in the first game; so much that they were the primary NPCs in this one. The other NPCs were so much more memorable though. Great side quests that hardly ever feel routine and repetitive, even though they are, because the whole game is amusingly repetitive. Grabbing ever better guns is what the game is about and is so much fun. Even the dlc didn't disappoint, and I'm not a big fan of most dlc generally. They had hilarious side missions with really funny characters and scenarios. It holds up really well thanks to the comic book style graphics and some references to pop culture over a long time frame.
     The DLC were fun, some not as much as the main game, but others were better. The assault on dragon's keep, specifically, was arguably the best DLC I've played in any game. 
     I'd reroll a character for this before restarting the first again, which says something, because the first one was so much fun as well. They are just great games to relax to with friends.",1685901762,1685901762,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The update of course also broke the ability to execute mods, and this game is very grindy sans mods. Some people love to fight the same boss 20 times to get a unique gun. I'd rather just get them as I play through the story. I don't recommend this game unless you enjoy grinding bosses for random drops, or if you have the tolerance to reconfigure the moddability everytime an update breaks it.

When loot drops in Diablo 2 you can tell its value just from the item name. Whether it's something that sells for a good amount of gold, or if it's an interesting socketable, or a sick unique. The categories are clear and you quickly develop an instinct that can quickly decide whether a drop is worth your attention from the name or even color alone. Instead in Borderlands it's all just garbage, you have to sift through waves of containers and then contemplate numbers to see if an item may be worth it. It's so boring and tedious guys, holy crap. The combat is okay, I don't mind it, as a matter of fact I don't really mind the rest of the game. The graphics are good too, it's all there and it's decent. The key issue though is this overwhelmingly demoralizing cycle of shooting a few guys and then having to open a million containers with garbage in them, to see if maybe it's worth replacing your generic gun, that you only have equipped because its numbers are high, with another one. There's just no joy in the process, there is an endless sea of uninteresting loot and loot containers.
