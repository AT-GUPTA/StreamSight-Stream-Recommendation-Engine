O' sorrow, I have ended, you see, by respecting you, because I am certain you will never leave me. 

Ah! I realize it: your beauty lies in the force of your being. You are like those who never left the sad fireside corner of my poor black heart.

O my sorrow, you are better than a well-beloved, because I know that on the day of my final agony, you will be there, lying in my sheets, O sorrow, so that you might once again attempt to enter my heart.

It is a very fun card / deck building game and feels very rewarding after learning the mechanics of it. The music for this game is very good and an absolute bop(mili <3). The storyline is also very very good and I would highly suggest reading it instead of skipping through it. Going in blind is the best experience in my opinion. However, if using a guide helps you enjoy the game better then go for it. The game is fairly time consuming but it is worth every drop of time. The endgame does punish you fairly heavily if you don’t read every single tiny thing in an enemy’s passive. The difficulty spike is fairly noticeable however the game is still beatable regardless.

If you haven't or are uninitiated in the world of Project Moon, consider looking into playing Lobotomy Corporation first, or watching a yt video on the story if the gameplay is not to you're liking and come back to LoR.

This is probably one of the best games I've had the pleasure of sinking my teeth into on a story, lore, world building, and gameplay level. It's interesting, not overly grindy, challenging while not being mind-breaking, and gripping with character development with a dark moody storyline that keeps you engaged.

Honestly if you found LoR, you probably don't need me to sell you on this game as niche a community PM fans are. But know that this isn't an easy baby game. You will get walled by difficulty spikes at several points in the game, and if you aren't a fan of reading, deck building, and understanding skills or enemy mechanics then you're going to have a bad bad time playing this game. There are easy-mode mods, and guides out there made by the community, I've borrowed a bit of guides myself when I was more stuck on certain fights. But if difficult games where you're willing to spend an hour browsing through your available cards to build good decks is exciting to you, then this is exactly the type of game worth the time and energy.",1707679367,1707679367,True,2,0,0.52905195951461792,0,True,False,False

Pros:

- I'm a sucker for the setting, plot is excellent and there's a ton of twists that kept me hooked all the way to the end. Characters are fun too.

- Boss battles are fantastic, and there's a fucking lot of them. (Aside from the crying twat)

- Music is incredible, finished the game months ago and still listen to a fair many of the tracks

- Blockma

Cons:

- Grinding is annoying, unless you install the ""nogrind"" mod on steam

- The game's plot is delivered like a visual novel, so there will be lots of reading as it's voiced in Korean and subbed in english. I liked it but if you don't enjoy lots of reading then might not be your cup of tea

- Difficulty spike is vertical, although if you're coming from lob corp then you already know 

- You'd need to play or watch Lobotomy Corp to fully understand who the MC is and setting but you should be fine going in blind as the game explains everything over time. (play lob corp too)

There's a bit of a learning curve at the beginning, as the tutorials are a little sparse and the mechanics a little weird, but it's worth it once you get over the initial hump.

...until about halfway to two-thirds through, when all the big fights go from ""challenging"" to ""hilariously cruel exercises in trial and error."" Many late-game battles have gimmicks that are explained vaguely, if at all, as well as normal RPG stuff like insanely high stats and multiple health bars. I'm told there was one that had eleven phases before they nerfed it. 

It would likely be better if played with a walkthrough open in another tab, but the story is best experienced blind- there are a number of twists and turns, and several of them are actually pretty cool. However, if you DO go in blind, you won't know that, for example, one of the later bosses has a completely undocumented ability that can instantly kill your entire party two turns into its fifth and final phase, forcing you to redo the fight from the beginning unless you do the exact set of actions that prevents it. I cannot stress enough that this is neither a joke nor an exaggeration.

Also install a ""no grind"" mod. There's one on the workshop, if I'm not mistaken. Seriously, the only thing worse than a late-game LoR boss is a late-game LoR boss that you have to fight twice because her special equipment set didn't drop.",1707376012,1707376012,False,31,5,0.563696205615997314,0,True,False,False

Challenging too
It's also a literary masterpiece

There comes a point in every turn based rpg where I just say ""fuck it"" and look up the cutscenes.
Well, I didn't with this one, rather I just used the (very intuitive) workshop modding to give myself a power boost right at the end, only after heavily abusing the guides that Ailith Nix posted on youtube (and still failing 3/4 times)

I cheated then because the ending sequence is absolutely insane. The time, knowledge, and luck required to get through the whole thing blow right past the line of what I can be bothered to perform.

Everything that comes before the CBT (without the C and B) is a lot of fun, genuinely engaging, and makes ample use of power creep, which allows you to hit clip after clip of lucky hits. 
It's the kind of game where you roll a 1-4 on a dice, and the result is 49, for a total of 98 damage and it only gets stronger from there.

Around every corner is an interesting story (cut short by that karen angela) Every character is unique and interesting, from the homeless lads you fight right at the start to the literally on fire woman near the end. The setting, while dramatic and hyperbolic, is interesting and a breeding ground for fan-fiction.

And then there's the music, which every moment it comes on, I just need to take a moment to jam out in my chair. It's phenomenal, and I listen to the soundtrack outside the game pretty often.

Every element of this game builds on top of one another to create a truly unique and beautiful experience.

I didn't realize people were still making games on DirectX 8. What year is it?

The story is fantastic, but the gameplay is not. Just like a real card game, new mechanics get introduced every so often to render pretty much everything you've relied on obsolete. Real card games have the courtesy not to use dice rolls for everything, though; LoR's insistence upon doing so pretty brutally guts any strategies the player can attempt. You could give your entire team the best keypages and decks available to you after finishing one rank, including the General Invitations for that rank, and still get curbstomped by the weakest fight in the next rank just because the enemy gets a few too many perfect rolls to be coincidence. Enemies' Ranged and Mass-Summation Attacks are ridiculously unbalanced, rendering some fights nearly unwinnable, and the tendency of later bosses to have phases that will not let you deplete their health below a certain threshold until the next phase starts is grating.

You're honestly better off just watching a longplay or a cutscene compilation on YouTube than actually playing this game. The story really is excellent, and I highly recommend not missing out on that. At first glance, it might seem to be just another bland anti-corporate dystopian narrative with another bog-standard sprinkling of ""what is human?"" navelgazing thrown in, but it examines those themes [i]and[/i] the aspects of human nature that allowed the City to become the nightmare it is in a way that respects the player's intelligence rather than simply browbeating the player with messaging.

Or you can buy the game anyway and treat each new bit of storyline as your reward for slogging through the latest fight. That's perfectly valid too, but if you go that route, seriously, install a tool to force it into borderless mode. Even taking a screenshot while it's in exclusive-fullscreen causes it to crash.",1706764961,1706764961,False,1,0,0.450677573680877686,0,True,False,False

The things i mentioned are frankly  what the game wants you to do but not how you should actually play the game as in doing you will be stuck for countless hours wondering why you can't get past a certain boss or reception.

A lot of unexplained systems either take a long time to figure out by yourself or reading up a guide on the steam page. I dropped this game when i first got it since the demand of you as the player in order to enjoy this game is greater than any of the souls games which i hold near and dear to my heart. After 2 years i came back and decided to not play as the game intended and just read the very longs guides of the community members as if i was studying for my exams, forgoing any creative ideas i had about the deckbuilding aspect of the game or the passive attribution system and just copy pasted all the best builds for every part of the game and in the end it ended up being more enjoyable than when i first got in blind.

The second and possibly the gravest mistake this game has made is the absolute metric ton of grinding that is required if you are unlucky. The way you get stronger in this game is by defeating opponents and collecting their decks and passives through burning the books dropped by them to use in your own, but it is rng which pages you are gonna get the most important the actually good key pages are usually very rare meaning you might have to replay numerous times the already extremely difficult fights for that point in the game in which you are. But it isn't just that, you can only have a limited amount of a key page or card in your possession at any time depending on it's rarity(and i'm not referring to the amount of copies of a card you can have in your deck) AND in order to grind those pages you have to USE the previous books you earned( which you probably had to grind for an indeterminate amount of times to get their key page in order to get stronger) in order to actually grind for the new stuff. This an endless cycle of pain and exhaustion as you get new books->burn the books to get stronger-> replay the previous however many fights to get the previous books again->fight the new reception and repeat. Thankfully some of this is mitigated by the fact that you can Alt+F4 before losing to keep the books, but if the devs intended for you to abuse this why isn't this the way its handled in the game by default to not lose books on defeat?

Finally i have to give SOME credit to the game for:
1) it's impeccable story, interesting world building and characters with a deep range of flaws and redeemable qualities truly making you believe they are actual humans in this world they live in.
2) they truly unique fighting system it has albeit one which the game forces you to completely cheese out in order to beat the harder fights

All in all the game while it has an excellent story worth experiencing from beginning to end the same can't be said about the rest of the content this game offers and in the end has left feeling as if truly wasted my time and wishing i instead watched the story on youtube and not have to deal with anything else.",1706613896,1706613896,False,1,0,0.466148734092712402,0,True,False,False

 The story, while I was spoiled to the main parts, is amazing. Every character at least has some depth to them, and all of them reveal a bit of the world to you. 
Project Moon's world is well done, and learning about how it works through snippets of the guests' life before they come to the Library, with additional insights from Roland and questions from Angela, works really well, suprisingly.
 The two main characters, Roland and Angela, have beautiful stories behind them (There's a 1 hour video essay on Roland's character, and a 3 hour essay on Angela's, on Youtube, if you're fine with getting spoiled). 
And, last but not least, the gameplay loop is intuitive, developed in a way that makes it difficult, yet fair in the later stages.
Overall, I'd recommend the game if you like a good story, with an equally good, yet difficult game along side it.",1705826213,1705826301,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is a jump in difficulty once you reach the middle. Experimenting with the decks can be fun and some guides can help. But, the gameplay might not be for everyone.

So far, I love the story. While I haven't played Lobotomy Corp yet, I can still follow the plot. It might be better if you play Lobotomy too for more contexts since they are directly related (both settings and characters). Roland is a fun guy, even though he is a bit shady. The thing is... both the story and gameplay is not for the faint heart. The world building can be dark, bloody, and very disturbing.

The game is full-voiced and they are great! Also, the music! I don't think I've ever skip that opening.

The storytelling initially seems strange and disconnected but mostly feels tied up by the end of not necessarily in a logical sense, but very comfortably in an emotional one. A lot of the people who have suffered miserably don't get any sort of positive due or individual closure, but there's a grace in how Project Moon make it feel like less like any sort of flaw and more that tragically beautiful tinge of reality in that our stories are often defined by and may be ended by our worst moments as much as our best. It rides the line of depressing misery porn and meaningful themes extraordinarily well, seeing as I was always kind of worried the City would be a comically evil place after Lobotomy Corporation rather than feeling real (though to some extent it still kind of is).

It also does a great job as a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, to the extent where I would honestly say you're doing yourself a disservice by not being familiar with it first. I don't think you have to play it, but watching all of the cutscenes/VN segments at minimum and maybe a bit of the gameplay to understand what it was like is good context for all of the characters in this game seeing as most of them have already finished their 'development' prior to Ruina's beginning. By that same token, a couple of non-main characters and concepts that show up in Ruina are returning and won't stop to introduce themselves. Still, the game is it's own story and the way the city and library react to one another is an extremely unique and entertaining feeling for a game that gives it a much grander sense of scale compared to Lobotomy Corporation while still remaining small-scale compared to something like the future city management sim Project Moon has teased.

The gameplay is the best part, however. Lob Corp was a game where even if we ignore all the questionable design in favor of the argument ""the mechanics are an effective display of the monotony and torture of what it takes to run a major part of the City and the brutal costs that everyone involved had to endure"", it's still horrifically bug-ridden and lacking in sensical QoL that would not ruin the thematic value.

Ruina feels similar at first, but is the opposite where the punishment is real but not as frustratingly time-wasting as Lob Corp and the gameplay wholly remains fun instead of monotonous... minus grinding, maybe, but at least most grinding shouldn't take THAT long. Instead, the mix of mechanical complexity and thoughtful enemy design makes each encounter unique but also not at all railroad-y in what you're allowed to use to beat it with minor exceptions. Likewise, the progression is extremely engaging and almost addicting in how satisfying it is to see flashy new options, like the fact almost anything the enemies use you can get access to at some point. It leads to this game having enough difficulty for first-time and average players to keep every step feeling engaging and fun, but experienced players able to completely snap it in half with the right setups. And to me, that's basically the ideal state of any game like this.

At most, the game can be just a bit of a time sink, but when you're so dense it's a difficult thing to 'improve' on and it's less of a critique of the game's design and more just a real-world frustration of trying to beat it.",1705370511,1705370524,True,2,0,0.523377180099487305,0,True,False,False

Where many games have you consider one turn and one or two actions from an enemy at a time, Library of Ruina quickly scales to 3-5 actions per enemy, and asks you to rig and predict possibilities of how it will go, in a flux of offense acting as defense and vice versa.

All actions are decided by dice rolls, but they're very rigged dice rolls. Typically in favor of the enemy. However, you get the benefit of foresight, and can see what each enemy plans to do and who they plan to attack (and some of the dice you've got can tip the game in your favor considerably). So you can plan out how to best respond with the options you have available.

What LoR manages to achieve where many games do not, is give you effective options to respond to each and every action, while still putting you in an underdog position that will take serious preparation to overcome. There is a tangible sense of both overall strategy and individual tactics you can consider from turn to turn, and despite the inherent random elements of the game, with good planning you are rarely completely ruined by rng (except when it comes to farming key pages).

Where the game falters however, is achieving that transition from learning to strategizing and playing. Most fundamentally, LoR works as a card game. Knowing aspects like tempo, and how to effectively manage your resources (card advantage isn't really a thing), will become necessary to understand in order to make meaningful progress and strong decks. You will (eventually) effectively control up to 5 players, each with their own individual resource bar, health pool, and unique 9-card deck with unique game plans. But it doesn't stop there. As you progress, you'll unlock more teams of players, which means another 5 players will need their own deck, and their own game plan. The game will rarely ask you to use more than 3 of these teams, but if you plan on fully unlocking every floor, you'll eventually need to plan out decks and strategies for 9 floors. What's more each floor has unique powers unique to them, which can make or break certain deck archetypes, and making heavy use of what they offer is key to winning later fights. That means, at minimum, you'll need 3, 5-deck blocks, uniquely suited to take advantage of the powers of those floors. Though over the course of making those decks, you will have to experiment with other floors, upgrade older decks, and invent new ones, meaning you aren't really making just 15 decks.

There's some nice things about this, no single player must hold one deck at all times, so you can easily transfer one deck and strategy to another. And many cards from early stages (for better or for worse) end up becoming useless in the long run, meaning that you will only be considering a selection of a few at a time. But overall if it sounds like a lot to think about, that's because it is. LoR demands a lot of preparation and thinking before you get into each stage. And for every stage you pass, you will unlock more cards or new powers, which means more options for that floor, and more things to consider.

That said, it's not really possible to give a fullsome recommendation because there is no game that plays quite like LoR, and you don't really get entrenched into the mechanics until you are well past the point of refunding.

Past the difficulty however, the setting is quite original. Taking place in a sci fi future that isn't characterized by technology, but instead otherworldly phenomena that people attempt to control and pass off as technology. People are irreparably changed into monstrosities, killed for petty reasons, or made to do horrific things, but beyond the horror and mentions of gore, there is an underlying optimism at the heart of the actions of the characters in this world, and it implicitly justifies the need for everything to be so difficult. The world has become full of monsters; so we must become them to fight them.",1684125260,1705284921,True,2,0,0.50374448299407959,0,True,False,False

[h1]Pros[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Deck-building is fun
    [*]Combat is fun and complex, really requiring the player to engage with the mechanics
    [*]The game is not afraid to enforce it's own mechanics and rules
    [*]There are still multiple ways to get through each encounter
    [*]The story is broken up into easy to digest bits with a larger narrative
    [*]Worldbuilding was very cool, the type of world that you have both seen and never seen before; an interesting take on a cyberpunk, dystopian world
    [*]Memorable characters, including a ton of memorable side characters
    [*]Great modding community, adding on more hours of fun
[/list]

[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Some of the smaller plotlines feel paced weirdly because of the Reception system
    [*]General Receptions are mentioned about once (maybe twice?) and then never again but you absolutely SHOULD do them especially if you're struggling
    [*]The game is not afraid to enforce it's own mechanics and rules; this is a con if you get upset easily when losing
    [*]There are a couple of fights (by no means the majority) where the mechanics/rules can be easily misunderstood
    [*]Personally, late game I got confused about what parts auto-saved which made me often afraid to close it (I may have forgotten the criteria for autosave from the beginning though)

I absolutely adore every single character in the cast and they all come with their own beloved backstories, even the enemies and mobs! They all have such depth interwoven into them that it makes me swoon as a writer. The animations are top tier for its genre as a card game, and the story is a masterpiece. If not that, then the music! The concept was great and ambitious and by god did it deliver in both expanding the general Project Moon universe and also help entertaining the gamer/viewer. 

It is a grindfest in certain parts, not that I cannot lie. And there is a difficulty vertical spike as all PM games have but the negatives outweigh the positives in my personal opinion. Highly recommend it to everyone and my friends to buy this game, it's a great experience, and has a lot of lessons to teach and ominous warnings.

All in all its a charming game, the characters are likeable even though i myself was really never too interested in them, the designs are very very creative, the music is good, the combat isnt for everyone.

Do i recommend it? i have absolutely no idea, if youre not certain buy it and ask for a refund if you dont like it in its first 2hrs as thats the gameplay thatll follow you throught almost 80hrs, i advise you to do this especially if you came from limbus, also near the end of the game you may feel like you want to look up the best builds and whatnot, DO IT, if you dont do that and are starting to get frustrated itll only get worse.

I've always liked deck builders, so I've kind of been itching to get into this game, and I wasn't disappointed. I very much enjoy the story. Watching the characters converse is really fun, as you watch them bicker a bunch at the beginning as tensions haven't cooled yet from Lob Co. I enjoyed watching them grow and change and form a really wholesome connection in a really depressing and blood filled world. The game play starts off a little slow, and most of the tutorial is a bunch of information being chucked at you, but you can quickly get used to how things work.

That being said, I cannot recommend this game unless you have a great deal of patience for dealing with fights that are either long or have gimmicks to them that can easily throw a wrench into your plans. And later on in the game, you get BOTH. The game starts out manageable, feeling tough but fair, but there will come a point where as, the reviews state endlessly, the difficulty spike ""gets vertical"". I have yet to beat the game so I will not comment on the story, but I will say to either play Lobotomy Corporation or read its story in some fashion, as Library of Ruina is a VERY direct sequel, taking place mere days after the first game.

Highlights of the game I've experienced so far:
-Magical girls being a constant source of trouble for me.
-At LEAST two fights in which you have access to multiple parties of five to fight a singular foe (You will need every hand on deck in those fights)
-Strange and unusual entities who demand you respect their rules, lest they stomp all over your team.
-A collection of varied characters ranging from hardened, merciless criminals to poor souls just trying to scrape out a living in a dystopian setting.
-The librarians are a nice bunch of characters and I personally enjoy seeing their stories and how they interact with each other.
-A story laced with the schemes and plots of multiple characters, leaving you wondering how everything will play out and who will come out on top.
-Lots of customization for the assistant librarians.
-Old people putting up a serious fight.
-red lady pretty and strong

Altogether, since I DO enjoy the core gameplay underneath everything, I would recommend the game, but only to those with the patience to tackle some fights repeatedly until they find a strategy that overcomes the seemingly impossible odds.",1704121234,1704121234,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

My honest opinion of this game lies as one of the best games I have tried, now at the start I thought this game was just another nice looking game with great story and horrible game play. after a hour in I was in love, the theme, style and just the behavior of each encounter made the game feel alive. This game has a lot of reading and if you don't spend time reading it will be not your type of game. The perfect mesh of reading and combat made each fight feel something more to just the simple early fights to harder fights make each activity in-between to feel longer yet foreshadowing of how easy it feels until a sudden power spike will send you back to reality.

At it's core it's a deckbuilding, combat game.  
The combat is sort of along the lines of slay the spire, but with a lot more things to pay attention to.  

In combat you'll have 5 characters in play, up against up to 5 enemies at once.  All with their own passives, abilities, and specials to keep track of.

You have 10 different floors each with 5 characters, and each of those floors have what are essentially special abilities, and those abilities can have synergies with different styles of play and different decks.

Sometimes you might have to have multiple floors set up with decks for certain fights, and in fact in some fights it's a very good idea to have ""back up"" floors for if your main floor dies during a fight.

This makes it so outside of combat you might need to be thinking about how you're going to be building several characters at once.  Potentially up to 20 or even 30 decks if you wanted to fully set up 3 whole floors.  Thankfully you rarely have to do more than that.  there are very few situations in game where you are forced to use a floor that you haven't set up, so you can ignore most of the floors you don't like as far as general use is concerned.

For lore nerds like me you have a great story being told too.  As a sequel to Lobotomy Corp, another great but very weird game, there are a lot of call backs and explanations for some things, as well as going deeper into the world setting.

It's a weird game, no doubt about it.  It's also very fun, and the further you get in to the messed up story, the more you want to know more.",1703817337,1703817337,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Library of Ruina is a masterfully crafted game and a worthy successor to an another well-cherished, ProjectMoon title called Lobotomy Corporation. I highly recommend playing Lobcorp before Ruina as it continues the story right after the true ending of Lobcorp. The beloved sephiroth from the first game makes a return and the dystopian metropolis called The City gets a lot more fleshed out.
LoR isn't really an hard game, you can easily progress through the game by reading the enemy passives and cards thoroughly which is mainly a problem for us ProjectMoon fans since we are either illiterate, aliterate or specifically have pure alexia/alexia sine agraphia. One of the few flaws that I could think of is how overpowered certain combat pages, ego and key pages that you receive are to the point of being able to dominate bosses with ease.
The music and art of this game is simply amazing, each floor's backdrop and music reflecting the personality of the each sephirah is a very good attention to detail from PM.

This game is all about learning. Library of Ruina consistently provides you with new gimmicks and challenges you have to learn and play around, some of the time they can be rather simple, other times they can be very tricky. At first I was honestly overwhelmed by the amount of options I seemed to have, but as time went on I grasped it all very well, I imagine others will do the same.
Library of Ruina is fair most of the time, others may say it's incredibly difficult but I would have to disagree, there are some ridiculous moments (Like Tiphereths abnormality battle, seriously if you get the game delay fighting it as long as you want, there's no rush.) but for the most part with some thinking you'll get through it. 
The main character of this story is incredibly likeable, ESPECIALLY in contrast to the ""main character"" of the previous game, lobotomy corporation. 
Full price was well worth it, I highly encourage anyone who doesn't need constant flashing lights on FPS gunfire to quell their dopamine urge to purchase and play this game.",1703743936,1703743936,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As someone who has played a lot of card battlers in my life (both in game and irl), I have to say that Library of Ruina has to be one of the most polished and fun deckbuilder games I have ever played. Sure there are some combos that makes the game significantly easier (Myongest, Purple tear overcharge, and Yesod to name a few), but the game overall is still very balanced, fun, and challenging. There is a couple difficulty spikes in the game so be ready for that, but most of them can be overcome if you know how the game works and the gimmicks the levels through at you. (I didn't really struggle at any of them until I had deal with the birds). 

In terms of the aspects of the game that doesn't involve gameplay, I have to say that the story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are all likeable and it was always fun seeing the librarians interact with each other, especially the quips between Roland and Angela. The music as well was fantastic all around, some of them may be hit or miss but the majority of the tracks were absolute bangers.

Overall, 10/10 game, one of the best I have ever played. I have now become infected by ProjectMoon brainrot and will now proceed to play Limbus Company.",1703641189,1703641189,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It was easily one of the best opportunities out there to take, thus making it the second Project Moon game available. The game had me at a confusing rate of trying to understand the mechanics used in it at first glance, though I understood what the heck was happening eventually, which helped me rapidly finish the game sooner than expected. (I'm pretty sure it took me 2 weeks + a few days to beat the game fully, not 100% sure.)

I want to say, don't get me started with the lore and cutscenes. Oh man, it's so perfect, and a lot of it is just an add-on from their previous game, ""Lobotomy Corporation"" (fun fact: I've only played it once, so the story line that's tied up in the game was spoiled from finishing Ruina), and it fits so well to the point where the storyline should not have come to an end, but rather keep on continuing. The combat is pretty simple, and I enjoy how it functions. It is very self-explanatory to a degree that anyone can understand by playing the game for the first time. The only issue that's troubling a lot of players come across is making decks with the proper key pages and passives along with them.

I really recommend anyone who sees this or plays it for the first time keep on playing Ruina; it's easily worth the 100+ hours to put into and play afterwards a few times with mods or to grind for every achievement in the game.",1703577562,1703624107,True,0,0,0,3,True,False,False

There are many things that I want to say about the game. Like how the already interesting premise, an SCP library turning people into books to grow its selection, gets progressively more complex as character motivations and events intertwine. Like how the gameplay loop of clearing a section, busting open a new set of cards and deckbuilding all over again never gets old. Like how the difficulty is delicately balanced to feel overwhelming but achievable in the end.
I love this game and was engrossed from start to finish.

Taking the heart shaped glasses off for a second, there are some questionable difficulty spikes here and there, so do have some patience. The community doesn't meme about the difficulty for no reason. Also, this game is a story sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, so expect spoilers for the ending of that game if you had any interest in playing that. Ruina's story is understandable without it, but I very much enjoyed the callbacks for both fanservice and thematic reasons.

Quite a leap of change of game mechanics and genre yet still holds up to be a great game, but do understand, at one point this game will do a 180 on changing difficulties, at one point you'll will be turned into a book. whether by your own mistake, or just low rolling your way to demise, and to explain the gameplay briefly you'll be rolling for your turns who goes first then who attacks or defends higher based on the rolls, there is passives that can be as simple of a permanent increase of point of defense when using a defensive dice, to an certain enemy's lowest speed dice being re-rolled to be Infinite just because fuck you. of course there is more into this but looking at gameplay trailer would make you understand more than my useless words.

The Art... for this to be the squeal of Lobotomy corp, you can see references of the characters you control being chibi-fied yet looks entirely different int he visual novel, from background art of certain battles that takes place, to just the certain scenes that takes place in the story part of the game, it's charming simplicity is something i can enjoy... i would love to comment more on this but i just don't have the words to describe it but when the art style suddenly changes in a battle, just be known you'd be in for a bit of whiplash or just prepare for whats coming

Music, the music is another amazing part of this game. besides the great work of the general ost of listening to story line, the amazing composers of the game or whatever decision it was from anyone who helped made this game, had the idea to change battle themes for each major character that you control, Simply most pieces are bangers to listen to, and just besides the amazing music, they had gotten to work with Mili... not for one song, or two or even three but seven... each with a certain climatic point for it to happen besides the opening song of course, song fits well with each reasoning how the story and fight had gotten to that point and makes you wonder if your really a good guy.

I would love to get more deeper into this, but this review is probably player bias of mine for enjoying this a lot, but even when finishing the game, the community adds more content to this game in the workshop of Library of ruina, this game is something i wish i can get more of my friends into, but i'll take this minuscule chance for the people who read this and take the review with their balance of purchasing this game or not. if you do, i'm just that bit more glad i'd get you to think of buying into this.

Long review: To those of you thinking of playing this game but are concerned about the difficulty, yes the combat really stretches your abilities, but at the same time I went into this with only a basic understanding of the deckbuilding/card battler genre. It's not unfair, as long as you know what you're doing. I finished the game after a good 490 hours, though, so it's still gonna be a big commitment to make. (I procrastinated a ""little"" by rewatching the story bits)

Something I'd recommend you to do is to read up on Lobotomy Corporation's story or watch a video on it (I never played it myself) since LOR is a sequel after all. Out of these two titles, I'd say Library Of Ruina is the fairer in terms of gameplay, since there aren't any rogue-like mechanics and you can have more freedom to experiment.

Well that's that; Library Of Ruina is a certainly a commendable title. There isn't much else to say that hasn't already been said - a powerful story surrounding complicated characters, in a world that's slightly nicer than 1984. The game was a real treat to play - it felt risky to get into but I feel rewarded for having tried it and overcoming all the ordeals.

You'll have a good time if you like the sound of a strategic deck-builder, strong character writing, and/or a non-typical dystopian setting (At least one I've never seen). Even if it's not your kind of game, listen to some of the music tracks because they're fantastic, boss and battle themes especially.

Extra comments:
Ruina's prequel, Lobotomy Corporation, isn't strictly necessary to understand and enjoy the story, but you would miss out on context for returning characters and the setting. That said, LC won't be everyone's thing. There's no harm in looking up the details if that's true for you. 

Related to the above, Ruina's story largely revolves around the development of the two leads. In other words, the cast of side characters in the library don't get too much in the way of their own stories/development. I can hardly call that bad since they had their stories and spotlights in Lobotomy Corp (In hindsight, quite appropriate thematically. If you know, you know). Plenty of interactions between the characters though.

It feels like a lot of care went into the game: a cosmetic system for all your nuggets (team members), music details people smarter than me have gone into, strong and memorable character writing, in-world lore as you collect books for the library, and in-game explanations for game mechanics down to small things like how you get cards and battles/turns being called acts/scenes.

There's a fair amount of reading with the short visual novel sections before/after a battle and various scenes with different characters in the library. It's all well written; I just mention it in case a lot reading isn't to your liking.

Quality of life things, namely an in-game manual available at any time, the ability to rewatch any and all cutscenes, and easily replayable battles.

I initially found navigating the menus to be a little overwhelming at the start since there can be a lot of options/screens to go to and a ""tutorial everything first"" approach. Again, something that quickly becomes familiar as you play around.

The combat system is also little overwhelming at the start. At least, it took me a couple hours to get used to how things worked. It isn't helped by that ""tutorial everything first"" approach. Thankfully, you have that game manual, and the overall mechanics are simple to understand:
Combat is card vs card. A card has different numbers of die (Any mix of three types of damage die and two types of defensive die), and then there are any abilities a specific character has (A buff to defensive die or inflicting a debuff when using a specific damage type for example). The two types of defensive die act slightly different depending on whether its up against an offensive or defensive dice.

Your deck is limited to nine cards, meaning you have to make interesting decisions on what tools to bring and what to specialize in. The restrictiveness is lifted somewhat in a different way by eventually being able to bring five characters to a battle, each with individualized decks.

I was wary of the die based combat coming into it what with the randomness and all. However, there's a surprising number of ways to turn odds in your favor: being freely able to make decks that match well against an opponent, a large number of buffs and debuffs to inflict, a ""targeting system"" that allows you to change who attacks who and whether or not an opponent can defend, and the ability to mix-and-match abilities from all your previously defeated opponents.

The game does become challenging over time but far from impossible (even if it does feel like it sometimes). It just requires some planning and thought out turns. Mindlessly playing cards is a bad idea most of the time, and, arguably, half of a fight is how you outfit your deck/team before a fight.

Boss battles are genuinely deserving of the title and are all kinds of interesting and intimidating.

Not only do you have to build decks of cards for your nuggets, but you also have to balance passives with the team exclusive passives that makes certain strategies fun to play with in combat. Though I'm still sad that burn decks lose viability outside of the early-mid game. 

Also love the music and the art style. Got me to follow the rest of the work from Mili.

I found myself utterly engrossed in the game's fascinating setting and lore, and the literary references sprinkled throughout the game added a layer of depth and intrigue that kept me hooked from start to finish.

One of the standout features of Library of Ruina is undoubtedly its captivating setting. The lore surrounding the Library, the City, and the other corporations is masterfully crafted, with a meticulous attention to detail that creates a world both bizarre and beautiful. Exploring the setting through the visitors of the Library was a journey in itself, filled with surprises, mysteries, and a sense of wonder that few games manage to achieve.

The deck-building system in Library of Ruina is a work of art. The game presents players with a vast array of cards, each with its own unique abilities and synergies. This deck-building gains further depths with the variety of passive effects you can equip your characters with, resulting in some interesting and very broken combinations. Experimenting with different combinations of cards became a joy, as I discovered new strategies and tactics to overcome the challenges presented by the game. My personal favorite is what I call the “American Solution to Problems” deck from early-midgame, which carried me over the initial difficulty spikes.

The combat system in Library of Ruina strikes a perfect balance between difficulty and reward. Battles are challenging, requiring careful planning and execution of strategies. The game demands that players think critically about their card choices, positioning, and resource management. Victory is not handed out easily, but the sense of accomplishment upon overcoming a tough opponent is immensely satisfying. The learning curve is steep, and might even require you to read what your cards, passives, and enemies do (the horror), encouraging players to improve and adapt as they progress through the game. This game does feature several difficulty spikes/casual filters, which will wall you off from progression until you manage to figure out how to beat the fight. There is no shame in looking up a guide, but I would strongly encourage some time spent deck-building and testing before resorting to a guide.   

Furthermore, the visuals and soundtrack of Library of Ruina complement its immersive atmosphere flawlessly. The art style is both stunning and distinct, bringing the characters and the Library itself to life. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, especially the songs by Mili, enhances the overall experience, creating an atmosphere that is both haunting and mesmerizing.

The one issue I have with the game and its progression comes down to the grinding. Books of the enemies you defeat act as a limited box of cards, but you also need to use the books to open up access to new fights, and you need to spend those books for every attempt, so if you’re having a hard time, you might run out of books and need to grind. You can also run into the issue where you don’t have enough copies of a card for all your characters, which also means its back to the mines. 

I would highly recommend going to the Steam Workshop, and installing the mods “BaseMod for Workshop” and “NoGrind”. This will smooth out the experience by remoing the tedium of grinding, and puts the focus back on deck building and trying out decks on fights, as well as enjoying the setting and story Project Moon has written.",1701057792,1701057813,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Library of Ruina is a turn based deckbuilding card game in which you control multiple characters known as librarians in surprisingly well animated combat that really sells the violence of action. Backed by an incredible soundtrack and fantastic sound design the game looks, feels and plays wonderfully. This is a game which I recommend with all my heart.

Combat:
The combat in Ruina is not as simple as playing a card and letting it do it's thing. Every librarian has speed dice which not only determine their order of action, but also dictate their options as well. In Ruina there are two types of attacks ""one sided attacks"" and ""clashes"" clashes are preformed when two characters are targeting each other. In which the dice on each card, or page, will go head to head, with the higher roll winning. If a librarian has a higher speed than the dice they are targeting they can redirect an attack to force a clash. This is an extremely vital mechanic to grasp.  Every card as well costs light to play, think of it as your typical card game energy resource. Lastly in combat characters build up ""emotion"" through certain actions which leads to a refilling of light and an expansion of options as the fight drags on.

Visual design:
Not too dissimilar from darkest dungeon, attacks rather than being fully animated instead are moving stills of the character in action relating to the dice rolled on a page. The character art for each person during the visual novel segments have a wonderfully consistent style, all keeping you immersed in this world. From the rats, to Librarians and even to the monstrosities of the world everything keeps a consistent flow to how they are designed. The many floors of the library have their own theme and each of them is remarkably well done. From the 3 pillars of Malkuth's floor representing her connections to the 3 floors above, to the piles of books in Keter floor increasing as time goes on the detailing  in the game  is remarkably well done.

Music and sound design:
The sound design of Ruina is absolutely incredible. The loud snap to indicate turn shifts, the metallic clangs of ties in clashes and even just the simple sounds of getting hit kept me immersive in Ruina's surprisingly visceral combat. The music of Ruina is incredible. Even ignoring the songs done by Mili they're remarkably well done. Every floor has it's own theme for combat, stretching to 3 different segments as emotion levels go up, the third of which usually being the most climactic to hit. The music only changes when the turn starts so the transition between themes is snappy and not too jarring. The songs done by Mili are also a joy to discover, each of which being remarkable and fitting for the moments you encounter them.

Story:
Ruina's story is one full of twists and turns and nurtures seeds planted in minute one, regardless of if you noticed them. This is a game that benefits from a second play through to pick up on all the little details sprinkled in. Our main characters in Roland and Angela are rather likable. Roland being a wildcard as shown in the opening ""String theocracy"" as he is the  only character in the library not returning from the previous game of Lobotomy Corporation. Angela is a remarkably well written character. Her motives and actions are reasonable given the things that she has experienced, and she grows to be  a genuinely good person with time.


ENORMOUS SPOILERS


Personal thoughts:
The reception of the black silence was easily one of the greatest fights I have ever had the joy to experience in any game I've ever played  and I do not say this lightly. Roland's rage, his sadness, and his grief all compact into this single moment, and the game knows it. Your librarians are confused, Roland's theme is re-contextualized into the present moment, Roland's pain doesn't matter, and so you fight. The longest fight in the game, It's a grueling several phase ordeal. The first being relatively tame it just being himself. The second phase showing Roland's trauma from the smoke war, him manifesting as the thing he saw that day. The third phase he fights alongside his wife, showing the true might of the black silence, being an unrelenting force, the third phase of Roland's theme playing in full force as you desperately reach for an ending, and then click. From energy and rage it all melts away to sadness. Hearing that click and hearing the first moments of ""Gone Angels"" and seeing the text across the screen of ""If  I behead my nightmare, I might be happy for a moment"" is burned into my mind. The exact feeling, my heart dropping, my determination to win melting away all I was left was sadness, and it was remarkable.",1700722926,1700722926,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

The story of The City isn’t served up to you all at once, but strips of it are pared away and unraveled into interlinking vignettes that, as long as you have the stomach for mature themes, will no doubt leave you hungry for the next slice. 

Times are tough, the people are desperate, and with late-stage capitalist megacorps running everything with strict class divides and miles of red-tape-flavored bureaucracy, those tough times are all but by design. After all, if no one can find enough stability to challenge the status quo, no one can threaten the Wings’ iron hold on The City.

And that’s where the titular Library comes in. A beacon of change by its very existence, it draws guests to it like moths to a flame, attracting the poor, the hungry, and the broken with a promise that tomorrow might be different, even if they might find themselves crushed in the pursuit. The powers that be can ill afford to let such a thing stand as the Library grows more and more influential. Much like those who enter the Library, you will be tested as you greet your guests, invited or otherwise.

Make no mistake, Ruina is a challenging game. There will be spikes in difficulty, certain bosses  and gauntlets will be demanding and punishing. On the other hand, the game allows for a multitude of strategies and rewards creative deckbuilding. Once you learn the intricacies of the game’s mechanics, you can assemble teams that make short work of even the most daunting floors. 

The game provides you with the tools to succeed, but it also expects you to make use of them. Rarely will staying static be rewarded. 

You cannot cruise through the game without touching or tweaking your early game builds. You are never done deckbuilding until the very end. While you can certainly take your starter decks far, there will be times when old tactics fall off, or when you’re required to introduce newer, more powerful cards into the equation. 

Ruina isn’t just a game that incentivizes and rewards mastery, it outright demands it. 

With all that said, the soundtrack is what elevates it from any other deckbuilder to an unforgettable experience. 

Sure, each Librarian's floor has an associated set of themes and motifs you’ll quickly become attached to, but when people mention this game’s music, they mean the boss tracks. Many encounters have unique themes that perfectly punctuate the circumstances of the game’s most memorable fights. You’ll find everything from thought provoking lyrics that mirror a character’s shattered mental state, to creepy and quirky ballads that contrast the sheer terror in front of you, to some absolute bops you’ll want to throw right into a playlist when you’re done playing. Honestly, there’s nothing else quite like it, inside or outside of the genre.

If I ever have an emotional breakdown, I just hope Mili is there.

Library of Ruina is the best game I’ll never recommend to my friends, but if you’ve read this far, I’ll recommend it to you.",1700712256,1700712256,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Project Moon's last game, lobotomy corporation, was a facility sim that was downright masochistic in difficulty, and a singular failure on your part could mean hours thrown away trying to fix it by resetting.

In contrast to that, Library of Ruina is more akin to your typical rpg, with your party members called ""librarians"" attacking with a deck of nine cards, each with their own power with their own ranges. Because the winner of clashes are determined by who rolls the higher number, this funnels you to build around increasing your power each fight, and choosing the best build  with the best cards each time. This does come with the downside that power creep is ever present, but that only means that the game forces you to interact with its system. I find the combat system to be very unique, and I never found a battle I couldn't beat without a little ingenuity.

The story in Library of Ruina takes place in the dystopian tech future of ""The City"", a place governed by violence and corporations. The story centers Roland, our titular protagonist, and Angela, an ai trying to achieve freedom from her bindings to her place in ""The Library"". You're tasked with bringing people in the library with the temptation of receiving a physical manifestation of knowledge, only then to kill them and turn them into said manifestation. Each main story ""guest"" you receive have their own snippet of story, with their own character art, backgrounds, and CG's done in an amazing art style, all wrapped up with the fact that the entire game is voiced.

I admit, I quit the game a couple times because I couldn't get into the mechanics at first, but I kept coming back each time until I finished it completely
The development of the characters we already know, the discovery of new ones, the view of the City, almost directly.
Project Moon always make games...unusual games, folding in a few mechanics of the already familiar. And that's what I like about them. 
It's a unique world and unique games, with an amazing story and characters and plot and questions that everyone can relate to in one way or another. 
Excellent visual style and music, and the voice acting can't be conveyed in words. Masterful work of every member of the team.

Game in fight have auto and manual mode, auto is too slow and manual don't wait for us to realize what just happened after clash. What is the point of putting all this info about a fight if you don't let the player read it?
Some fights are made up so that you can beat them up later, so why propose it now? card building pages do not have enough filters and elements. We have basic deck saving, that would be good for one group but when you have many groups this is too little. To win a fight you have to constantly move character cards, build a deck from start, having only this lame save load deck.
Filter lacks the option for finding range cards. card fighting is most of the game, rest is reading story.

Story can be good(I like train story), but it can be exhausting sometimes.

Amazing game to play for like, 30 or 40 min- oh shit its been 3 hours and I haven't even gotten past 3 fights?

Very good game with card and dice mechanics for people that like that. The story is also very rich, but locked behind the difficult content of the later game(Mods can be a very easy workaround).

Why are they talking about a corporation related to lobotomies? And why are there dollar general SCPs(That in a lot of cases are better than most SCPs) in books? Great question. Learn more.

Overcome great challenges such as the classic ""Mass-Summation 29-35 - On Hit Inflict 2 Feeble and Blind next scene"" with your librarians on life support that would make doctors give up. Alternatively, completely devour your entire team to make one ultra librarian that would make even Goku go crying home.

Nothing funny to say about the music, its just actually spectacular.

Have you ever booked a flight? Maybe a hotel? Well now you either book or be booked. After committing definitely not murder, burn the only remaining trace of the person you just not killed to gain more power. Power is all you need in this world after all.

The music is fantastic, both the dynamic floor themes and the exclusive climactic songs made by Mili.

The art direction is really good, each picture and background is pure eye candy.

The story is my favorite part of the entire game. Each story is incredibly messed up, yet [i] somehow [/i] makes it stick. They are quite mind-boggling and fascinating, exploring different ideas such as identity, what it means to be ""human"", guilt, time, love (in practically all the wrong ways), etc.

The battle system is confusing at first, but you eventually get the hang of it as the game progresses.

The abnormality fights range from fun to downright rage-inducing. They are a nice reprieve from all the other encounters, giving a puzzle-like format to their fights. However, some fights overstay their welcome, especially later in the game. This is no more apparent than in the Queen of Hatred fight. This fight was so frustrating to beat, I practically went through all five stages of grief, and almost quit the game entirely. The [i] ONLY [/i] reason I managed to beat the fight was through a bleed build cheese, but the victory didn't feel earned.

The deckbuilding aspect is easily the weakest part of the entire game. It slows the pacing down [b] significantly[/b], makes customizing your librarians extremely tedious, and never encourages much variety in terms of floor choice. It was mainly the reason why I didn't fully beat the game (for reference, I quit when trying to fight the Blue Reverberation Ensemble).

[b] I like this game. I really do. I just can't recommend playing through the entire game, unless some QoL features are introduced to make deckbuilding less of a tedious hassle. If you want to experience some of the stories, music, and art LOR has to offer, I am more than happy to recommend this game. However, if you want to finish this game, this game is a pass, at least for me. [/b]",1694068570,1699923040,True,0,0,0.450928390026092529,0,True,False,False

Lights on
Don't miss a moment
Of this experiment
Oh, the book is strange
Like clockwork orange
Keep your eyes buttered till the end
Which ""you"" are you going to be?
Hmm
Inside the mirror do you see
Someone else in that body?
Dance for me
One and
Two and
Three and
Turn around
Sit like a doggy
Till I finish my read
Cut it off, cut down your loss
All that stubborn loyalty is gonna get you killed
In a world built on convenient theories
For the puppets on TV
There is comfort in the strings
If you're gonna control me
At least make it interesting theatrically
How does it feel to be free?
Hmm
Why don't you try it yourself?
The gate opened on me
So I leaped
Down, down, and down I go
I tell myself I'm a tough girl
Down, down, and down I go
I could never, ever, ever touch the soil
My heart goes right
My head goes left
And end up on your bed
Huh
Sure I'll be your marionette
Here, tug on my thread
Spread me open for dolly pink, snow white artificial beauty
Maybe we're all cold machines
Stuffed in the human skin
With human sins
Sewed up by the gods of city
Cut it out, you've already lost
All that precious bravery is gonna get you hurt
In a world that feeds on the minority
May that self-centered belief lead you to peace
If you're gonna replace me
At least have the audacity to kill me thoroughly
When does it end for me?
Hmm
I think I am done with everything
Now I'm ready to leave
Dragging out
One line
Two lines
Three lines
Connect our hands
When I no longer can live on knowledge alone
You gave me strength
Hopeful curiosity
Maybe there are still happy answers left for my discovery
What's the colour of the electric sheep you see?
And if you love me
Can you love your everything too, for me?

I normally like to finish a game before I review it, but seeing as Library of Ruina has a good 200-or-so hours of content, I decided I would wait until the 10 hour mark and see what I thought then. Library of Ruina is a card and turn based RPG with visual novel elements, and a game that does all three of those things decently well.

The story of Library of Ruina is pretty good. It tell a lot of individual stories that weave together to form a greater narrative, using the mechanic of seeing the library's visitors in their moments before arriving very well. There are a few standout moments, most of the time when the story takes a massive narrative shift and makes you either really care about the visitors and not want to see them fail, even though you know they have to, or make you absolutely horrified at how messed up the world the game takes place in is. Overall, I give the story a 4/5, it's good overall, but I think it could do with better pacing, especially when it comes to the librarians and their stories, which carry over from Lobotomy Corp.

The gameplay is very strategic and extremely fun to plan around, but it feels like the game doesn't really want you to know that. The tutorials are absolutely terrible, and I learned more by just messing around in combat than I did from reading them. The deckbuilding elements are just enough to make the strategist part of my brain start working but not too overwhelming, since decks only consist of 9 cards each. The combat itself is good and actually has a lot of variety, but this is where the problem comes in. If the game wants me to build strong decks and optimize my team to overcome specific challenges, why does it make it so counter-intuitive to figure out what I'm dealing with in a given invitation? Or better yet, at least put a setup screen before the ""librarian trials"" or whatever they're called. 8/10, it's a solid game but it could use a bit more polish on the tutorial side.

The art is fantastic, it somehow isn't just the generic anime artstyle which I do like but it would be nice to see something else for once, and this game delivers. I don't really know how to describe it in technical terms, but the game has a very storybook feel in general. Everything feels polished. 5/5, very well done.

The music is good, very catchy. The vocal tracks are in English, technically, but they're pretty difficult to understand because of how ""engrish"" it all sounds. The singer(s?) very clearly do not have a firm grasp of the english language, which isn't a problem per se, but I honestly would have preferred if the songs were in Korean, even though I know even less Korean than I do Japanese. That isn't to take away from what is arguably the game's strongest point, the soundtrack is great and it sets the tone very well. It could use more battle themes but variety isn't always possible, and Library of Ruina soars with what it has. 5/5.

Final score: 22/25 = 88%. [b]B[/b]. Library of Ruina is a great game that you should play. It isn't terribly expensive and it should be on sale right now for pretty cheap. I highly recommend it.",1698739926,1698740033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You're paying $30 for an interesting story wrapped in a strategy card game. One of the more fun entries into said genre I've played in years. The game-play is tricky and the learning a bit front-loaded, but you should fall into a rhythm where it gets smooth, even the objectively unfair/difficult fights. Just be mindful that if you're loosing a fight repeatedly then you probably need to do something different, as in leave that encounter and try changing something before you come back. RNG is a mechanic, but in my experience RNG is pretty much never the culprit for my losses, and even in worst case scenarios you should be able to win off of preparation and execution alone.

The rhythm of the game is generally encounters wrapped on both sides with story. Before each encounter you get to see who you will be fighting and learn more about the world, and after you fight them you get introspective dialogue that often reveals more about the world. There's enough gameplay to keep the story from getting too monotonous, and vice versa. Just when you're about to get bored of reading dialogue you get to start reading card effects. The game-play loop is addicting. Maybe not for everyone, but if you've ever picked up a card battler before and NOT hated it, then I strongly advise picking this one up, you're unlikely to regret it.

Do note that as of writing this, I have not beaten the game, so I cannot speak for it's entirety, but of the content I have consumed in 30+ hours of playing, I can say I definitely got my $30 worth. From what I've gathered online, there doesn't seem to be any post-game content to speak of, though there is workshop support if you want to remedy that.

the main reason to play this game. literally worth buying just for this. if you have any interest in pmoon lore, get this game right now. if you dont, this game will make you interested in it. amazing characters/voice acting in an interesting (really edgy) setting. this game is solely responsible for 90% of all world building done for the pmoon universe.
if youre coming from limbus and/or havent played any other pmoon games, i highly recommend you play lobotomy corporation, or watch a summary of its story, as although they recap some events, there are many characters and references that are straight from that game. i did the latter (along with some wiki reading) and had a great time.
I LOVE THIS STORY AND THE CHARACTERS SO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MUCH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Music:
so good.

Gameplay:
as someone who generally DOES NOT like deck building games, i was pleasantly surprised here. in addition to building decks, you can also build your characters by giving them various passive effects. the level of customization available feels quite good, and allows for many fun builds, like exodia combos and stacking status effects to infinity. the battle system itself feels deep, and they introduce new mechanics and concepts at a reasonable pace to keep things relatively fresh and exciting.
however, i do have to mention that some fights take a very long time to beat, and considering the fact that you might have to do them more than once if you lose or other things (refer to the next section) some parts might feel like a grind. personally, i never felt it was that bad, but it is a common complaint that is worth noting.

RNG:
There are two parts to this -
1. in order to complete the main story, you will be doing ""receptions"" which are fights that cost ""books"" to start. you get books by completing receptions, and this comprises the main gameplay loop. for instance, reception A drops book A, which allows you to start reception B, which drops book B, and now you can start reception C which needs book A AND book B.
2. you can also burn books, which gets rid of them in return for x amount of cards that are randomly selected from a pool. this means that you potentially might miss a card you want, and will now have to replay the old fight to get more books to try again. this is how you get new cards to build decks and characters.
an important thing to note is that while receptions need books to start, they use up books ONLY if you lose. you are refunded them if you win. due to this, i highly recommend you burn until you have 1 copy of each book and alt f-4 if youre about to lose a reception. this allows you to have the greatest chance to have the cards you want, while also avoiding the start of a disgusting chain of having to replay a bunch of old fights to progress. however, as mentioned earlier, you might need to replay a fight in order to get a card that you missed and still have a copy to progress the story. in my personal experience, i never had to beat a fight more than 2 times to get everything i wanted, and i only needed to do this a handful of times.
you could also just install the NoGrind mod!

The story is really well done, with a lot of worldbuilding that makes it fun to take guesses at the next story beats.

If you're familiar with Lobotomy Corp, the difficulty of Ruina is nowhere near as bad, but the game does expect you to get very familiar with it. It's tough at times, but is rarely ever unfair. 

It can definitely be intimidating however, and often. By the end of the game, Library of Ruina fully expects you to break it in order to succeed. The game starts off gentle, but the difficulty spikes a few times, and the spike is vertical.




Definitely recommend if you have even a passing interest in the story, or deckbuilders in general. 

As far as stories go, Project Moon has created an incredibly unique world of their own which is great fun to read about, my favorite in a long while.

The deckbuilding aspect is also a home run. Solid all around, but the highlight is making a deck that allows you to roll a 100+ on a d20.",1619665691,1698431946,True,3,0,0.522909283638000488,0,True,False,True

Solid tactical card game with quite a few difficulty spikes. I usually spend more time building decks than fighting+losing+reading the story. Storywise, it's hard to talk about as it's a sequel of Lobotomy Corporation and Wonderlab, and a prequel to Distortion Detective, Leviathan and Limbus Company. The world of the city is a breeding ground for dystopian sci-fi horror where everybody fends for themselves and no help comes without a price. You're not here to make things better: The people invited to visited to your library have the choice to fight to the death for books that might help them get out of their situation. No one said it's a situation that leaves you much choice; that's that and this is this. The game has its own arc (starting at the Dawn Office) establishing that the price for help is always too high to pay. In terms of telling you about the world, I think it's the best entry out of the three games, and the one I enjoy the most overall.

If you come from Lobotomy Corporation, it's less repetition, more visual novel (+good voice acting, the sound engineer really deserves a lot of love for making this a so much more polished experience in terms of audio), and ""easier"" in so far that you can prepare more. You will [i]know[/i] which encounters to despise with a burning all-engulfing hatred. But it's a card game and you might prefer the management gameplay loop. LoR definitely had more polish and a bigger budget going into its art and presentation.

If you come from Limbus Company, the fighting system is similar to fighting abnormalities and there is actual deck building and attribute allocation, instead of identities. It's definitely the better gameplay experience and has less padding in the story. 
More customization means more time required to plan, and some LoR abnormalities require you to adapt a very particular play style such as early advantages, stat (de)buffs, or resource retention. Fights are always unfair with an asterisk; your opponents have stronger cards than you, so you have to make up with strategy and better builds. In spite of this only 2 non-abnormality encounters felt like foreknowledge was greatly beneficial. You can play this game and take everything as it comes, without feeling power-gated (cf. Canto III in LimCom).
Only downside is that you may not feel as attached to all the characters, though you might understand a lot of reference of the identities. I won't say it's the better game because a F2P gacha is necessarily something different from a OTP experience.
The game has been on discount 6 times (Jan, Mar, Apr, early and late Jun, Aug) this year and then it costs less than a season pass, so it's definitely worth it if you like LimCom.

If you come from the webnovels, you'll get a good idea what made people work in LC. I can't talk about DD or Leviation yet because I haven't read them. Wonderlab is still available on the archive of the internet.

May you find your book in this place.

A turn based battler where every fight is basically a bossfight, and then the bossfights all feel like superbosses (well I mean some of them are). none of this namby-pamby tRPG ""be the right level and you'll win"" garbage, you have to earn your victories and man some of them come down to the wire. 

Luckily, there's a lot of guides and the like if you get stuck, but the general strategy is to make the most unfair, broken builds you possibly can, and then realize in ~5 fights they will be equal to enemies or underpowered again. The general gameplay loop is close to rougelike: in a fight, killing enemies lets you copy their moves in future fights, meaning that the longer the game goes on, the more powerful cards you encounter and pilfer for yourself. That being said, you can play this game without ever losing. 

Great story in a fascinating universe, amazing music, gorgeous painterly art style, and a huge amount of combat depth, which is greatly appreciated. 
We've got 3 damage types, a large pile of buffs and debuffs with conditional effects, ranged attack, attack, block, dodge, and counter moves, and a very interesting system of character building that lets you do whatever the hell you want to do. Only a couple of moves are locked to specific characters; all the rest can be freely equipped to anyone, so you can customize your play style to your favorite characters or favorite floor's gimmicks.

Playing Lob Corp isn't mandatory, as the protagonist has no knowledge of the events of that game, but it will make plot points and references hit harder. If you bounced off Lob Corp or plain don't want to play it you can start here with minimal issues.
Pros
[list]
[*] Stylish visuals and an absurdly good soundtrack (Including vocal tracks that are both iconic and good enough to listen to outside of the context of the game.
[*] A setting that takes you through one of the coolest and most creative dystopic worlds ever featured in a video game.
[*] Characters that are multifaceted and well written, with the deuteragonists Roland and Angela standing out for their dynamic; making every scene with the two in a joy to read.
[*] Really good voice acting work, it's in Korean but adds a lot to the games tone.
[*] Gameplay that's hard but not frustrating (For the most part). Very unique deck builder with a lot of complexity possible in how characters are built and interact with enemies.
[/list]
Cons
[list]
[*] Erratic difficulty spikes, can sometimes border on frustration. I hate Queen of Hatred and Red Hood so much it's unreal.
[*] a poorly paced last ~15 hours, being a non stop gauntlet of incredibly difficult fights after fights. Can easialy lead to burnout this late in the game.
[*] Occasional glitches, nothing major or game-breaking but you will likely encounter some.
[*] Ineffective tutorial that poorly explains many key mechanics, read a tutorial online and save yourself a few headaches
[*] Grinding for card drops can get tedious, recommend the no grind mod on workshop if you get bored. 
[*] Brainrot
[/list]

Exceptional game that's lived in my head rent free for months, well recommended and well worth base price tag.

Lobotomy Corp. and LoR both suffer from extreme mechanic bloat, poor pacing, frustrating mechanics, pointless grinding, and a complete lack of elegance. It really is a shame, because they're also some of the most interesting and creative games that I've ever played.

[h2]Bloated Mechanics[/h2]
There are so many different ideas, it feels like the game is going all over the place. Both games feel absolutely overwhelming when starting out, unless you spend the time to read everything. Usually, this isn't a problem, but both games introduce many mechanics, often without a proper tutorial. There are many mechanics that are one-offs, or entirely redundant. LoR is especially guilty of this, introducing a new Keyword almost every new invitation in the mid-game, and not adding any useful support pages for existing Keywords. Lobotomy Corp isn't free from this either, as the novelty of adding a new anomaly to your facility wears off after you collect enough boxes to fully understand how to manage them (usually before the day even ends).

[h1]Poor Pacing & Pointless Grinding[/h2]
It's no secret that Project Moon games have poor pacing, with sharp difficulty spikes. Again, this usually isn't an issue with most games. I spent 4 hours learning all of Margit's attack patterns in Elden Ring, because I decided to rush through the game as a low level wretch. Even if it was difficult, beating him was immensely rewarding because I could feel myself getting better as time passed. In both Lobotomy Corp. and LoR, most problems can be solved if you spend enough time on it. If you want to play efficiently, both games get boring very quickly. In Lobotomy Corp, there are multiple situations in which you can hard lock yourself into losing the game and you lose about 2 hours of progress because of it. Not only that, but you really have the option to grind for E.G.O gifts and boxes if you want to unlock everything by the next day. I want to be managing my anomalies, not waiting for drops when I know there's no risk involved. Still, this pales in comparison to LoR's book system. Even after multiple revisions, it's still incredibly grindy. The decision to not have all of the pages unlock once you beat an invitation is absolutely awful from a design perspective. The game is already quite long for an indie title, and adding in grinding heavily takes away from the experience. It only serves to slow the gameplay down, so you're not absolutely overwhelmed by the next new crazy mechanic that's just right around the corner. It gets even worse when we get to the bosses. Boss fights can take up to an hour, and you're rewarded with nowhere near the number of books that you need to actually get all of the useful cards that you want. It's a massive grindy time sink for literally no reason. The [spoiler]Purple Tear[/spoiler] pretty much made me quit LoR because of the amount of time I would need to spend grinding in order to beat the next invitations.

[h1]Frustrating Mechanics & Lack of Elegance[/h1]
This is probably my biggest issue with Project Moon's games. The amount of time you spend not playing the game usually exceeds the amount of time you're actually doing stuff. This is a shame, because the stuff that you would be doing if you were just playing the game is usually quite interesting. Having individual decks for all of the Librarians is interesting, until you realise how much time you just spent creating 15 decks so you can beat the next invitation in LoR (of which I can usually beat first try). To a lesser extent, this is also visible in Lobotomy Corp., as every single agent has their own resistances and you need to pay attention what goes where, depending on the abnormalities they're going to be working. If you want to win, it's a whole bunch of reading, and not a lot of playing.

I just want to say that I really love both games. I love the world, I love the music, I love the ideas in both games, but they have so many issues which make it impossible to recommend them. There are so many roadblocks put in place for you to just not enjoy the game, which wouldn't have a harmful effect on the game if they were removed. You're punished by playing optimally, because it just ends up in optimising all of the fun out of the game. It's a known meme that LoR players don't know how to read, but perhaps they're better off that way - they have less to think about, and would rather think it's all decided by dice rolls.",1691721314,1697062365,False,1,0,0.352580517530441284,0,True,False,False

The combat is surprisingly deep, and only improves the later you get in the game since new strategies are always made available and the pages you get scale in power, constantly switching up the meta.
The story is absolutely fantastic. The characters are developed very well, and even feel like actual humans at times. The worldbuilding is really interesting, and it feels like a real world. The twists are frequent and fantastic.
Other story things, Argalia is built up so well. Every time he appears, at least 15 new questions as to what he is up to are created while only a few are answered. Roland as the exposition character as to what happens in the city is handled really well, which I will not dive further into for spoilers sake.
Overall, despite being over a hundred hours long in a casual playthrough, it left me wanting more, which really says something about the quality of the game since I typically get bored of games that last more than 50 hours.

Also, difficult as heck.

At some point, just get Cheaters Toolkit mod if it gets too difficult. You *will* suddenly hit enemies twice as strong as whatever came before. You *will* have to adjust your deck because it gets obsolete every 5 combats. You *will* spend an hour adjusting deck for extremely specific bossfight. And every combat *will* involve like 15 turns, and each turn is made of 10 clashes which have 3 attacks each, and you have to counter every single one with higher number - thats like 15x10x3 = 450 numbers to crack per combat encounter.

For the most part i managed to brute force my way through the game without thinking to much, somehow managing to first try some of the harder fights without cheesing them (ᴹʸᵒⁿᵍᵉˢᵗ)

The art is amazing voice actors truly fit the characters, just waiting to see if the community adds a mod with english voice acting (Like how it was done in hollow knight) though i heavily doubt it. that'd probably be extremely difficult to make into a mod let alone get voice acting done by fans.



value 100 greater split horizontal isn't real, it cant hurt you

If you want to play the game with a bit more life to its battles i'd reccomend getting the mod: 
Speed dice color 
And if you want ""LOR VFX"" to make attacks flashier and make them no longer depend on the keypage (outfit) of the librarian and instead use the effects of the combat page (attack) with the mentioned flashiness.

Other than those two other mods can wait till you beat the game

The difficulty spike is way too steep. I went from enjoying myself in Urban Legend, to absolutely hating the game come Urban Plague. I like card games, they're fun, but the RNG, and the absolute sponginess of the enemies once you get to Plague and beyond aren't conducive to a fun or enjoyable game.

I really like the setting, it is THE selling point for this game, so I'm using a cheat mod to skip through the ""gameplay"" (as much gameplay as the mechanics of the game allow at this point) and reading the story content without it, and EVEN WITH THE CHEAT MOD I'm struggling. This isn't fun.

• First, for those that care about playing a good video game.
• Second, for those who wonder what all the ""project moon brainrot"" is about.

[h1] The Game [/h1]

Library of Ruina is a well-designed deckbuilder with plenty of quality of life features and a feeling of constant progression.

Stylistically, the game is a slam dunk - graphics and music are both of high quality for an indie game, and the game shows care and effort in many areas. It is a notable improvement on Lobotomy Corporation.

The game is notably challenging but remains fair in spite of its steep challenges. There is very little grinding to be done to obtain enough cards to build competitive decks in the late-game.

I recommend playing it.

Now for the [b]good shit.[/b]

[h1] The Brainrot [/h1]

I fell down the Project Moon rabbit hole on a whim. On the last week of August, I started reading a Lobotomy Corporation let's play by one of the English translators. This is where I absolutely fell in love with the writing and the worldbuilding. Many would identify that game as ""the korean scp game"", but calling it that would be a disservice, so here's what I think represents it better.

[h2] Project Moon's works are about Failure. [/h2]

The entire universe of all three games is set in a end-stage hypercapitalist hellscape where ultraviolence is a normal, daily occurence that people have become completely numb to. Death is expected to happen at any time at the drop of a hat for minor reasons, more inane than the last.

Now, this is not something out of the ordinary, we have plenty of ""world sucks, government is a fuck, 1532478567 dead proles"" kind of media, but Project Moon is really, really good at depicting how that failure of a society effects everyone, from the absolute lowest of the low to people loftily seated at the top.

Yeah, this is probably a critique of Korea. It took me that long to notice because I was too engrossed by how masterfully they make [b]everyone[/b] pathetic (in the literary sense). The interconnection between all the rungs of society and their respective forms of misery, anxiety and fears for the future depict a violently somber picture that just made me want to see more, to peel more of the veil away and try to guess how bad it is, but then there is light, too.

The failure is collective - mindless complacency having spiraled out to the extreme. From growing jaded from the constant murdering to wanting to create change, to fighting others to achieve that change - even if they want change themselves? This is where the narrative truly shines. This isn't a world of grey but a veritable rainbow of dark shades where we find sympathy for most of the villains in a quest for introspection.

The character progression is remarkable. This is the kind of game (like NSO I reviewed previously) which absolutely flays you alive and makes you watch every pulsing vein and flexing sinew. This is the kind of game that burns and melts your soul to refine it into something else. This is the kind of game that makes people start doing art.

Project Moon is very passionate about their art and they want you to experience it without handholding you through the experience. Play or read about Lobcorp. Play or read about this game. Then play Limbus. The mythos of this franchise is something absolutely worth getting into. Seeing people scrape some of the grime away from the City little by little is a message worth hearing, and Project Moon's willingness to reach foreign audiences is what hammers it for me.

The good things about this game are the music and to an extend the story. But that's where the good parts about this game end. Were it a visual novel, this would have been an excellent pickup. However for some reason they also had to test the combat system of their gacha game somewhere and proceeded to think it would be a good idea to stuff it into this game. 

This game is so annoyingly full of RNG that entering the lottery feels like less of a shot in the dark. Here is a list of things that are determined by RNG:
- Speed Dice Values (who can act before whom)
- Enemy targeting (who enemies attack on your side)
- What Cards of the 9 set Cards get pulled (which attacks you are able to play this turn)
- Every individual Combat Dice Roll on those cards (how much damage you deal, block, evade...)
- Which Abnormality Pages you pull (character buffs that you get during battles, they are split into two categories ""happy"" and ""sad"", but even if you fulfil the criteria for a ""sad"" page, you are not guaranteed to get the one you wanted)
- The effects of said abnormality pages (one might say you deal 2-7 extra damage given /abstract condition/, to which I have to say, what the f*ck)
- Certain character passive abilities (e.g. 5% chance to deal 13 extra damage, albeit these aren't too common)
- How many (if any) books you obtain at the end of a fight (lootboxes basically, but also literally required progression items)
- What cards you obtain from said books (you can open said lootboxes, to get more cards to play during battle)
- What keypages (if any) you obtain from said books (basically equipment)
And I think that about sums up the RNG factors, if I am not forgetting anything, which I probably am.

Of these, only Speed Dices and what cards you pull in battle are actually good mechanics. The card pulling randomness is a staple of Deckbuilders, as it makes you adapt to what attack or defend options you have on any given turn. And speed dices can be seen as another layer on top of that. As your characters with higher speed values than the enemy can redirect attacks and therefore change the flow of battle. I have never found myself annoyed by these. 
Enemy targeting can be a bit of a slippery slope, all is fine until of 12 enemy attacks 9 are going towards the same dude.
Individual Combat Dice rolls are easily one of the worst parts of the game. Get ready to roll a 6 on your 8-19 dice and lose against the enemy rolling a 16 on its 8-14 dice. This might sound exaggerated, but it's really not. Often times you will find yourself eating dust during the most important turn of a fight, simply because you got unlucky. There are ways to increase your odds and finding those ways might make you feel good, until you still lose the same important turn. There is nothing fun or clever to be done here, the game is just like this. This gets especially bad in fights that require you to win against multiple enemy rolls (e.g. Knight of Despair, which forces you to win 6 different dice rolls to deal with it [in the intended way]). In my opinion this is an absolutely baffling thing to include, because even if you did create a dogsh*t deck, it will still feel like you just got unlucky to a good chunk of players. Players aren't encouraged to try harder; they are encouraged to simply try more. 
Then you have the abnormality pages during combat. As mentioned before, which ones you get can be influenced, but not guaranteed. Too bad, that these things are absolutely f*cking unbalanced like holy sh*t. So in the game there are 10 floors and on each floor you have 5 characters for a total of 50 different decks that you can build. The Abnormality pages are floor specific. Each floor has 15 different pages. And each floor is stuck with their set. Now what if I told you that on floor 6, you get an abnormality page that gives one character a guaranteed +3 offensive strength each turn after they healed enough of their own health. And multiple other pages on the same floor help with achieving that healing goal. Meanwhile on floor 1 you get an abnormality page that takes away 10% health from 4/5 units, gives that health to the 5th guy and then gives that same guy 3 strength and speed for a /single/ turn. With no other abilities on floor 1 interacting in a meaningful way. That's right; they are absolutely not made equal. A good number of these pages just suck and even more of them are unreliable. Wow, I can deal 2-4 more damage at a 20% chance when I win a dice roll against the enemy, that's count em’, FOUR different RNG rolls in a single thing! Such requirements make these essentially useless. 

And then you have book drops/card drops. Beat enemy and get books, burn books for cards, but not all books, because you need books to go to the new fight and get new books. Except, number of books dropped can be rather low, burning books but didn't get the cards you want? You have to redo the previous fight for more books. Didn't get the book you need to continue? You have to redo the previous fight for more books. Died during the previous fight, trying to get more books? You lost the book you used to do that fight, so now you have to do the previous-previous fight, for the book that you need for the previous fight, for the book that you need for the next fight. It is absolutely laughable that this is a mechanic at all, if you are to play this game at all (which I do not recommend), at least install ""Book Drop Rate Changer [JP/EN]"". It is the very least you can do for yourself.

Finally the game's infamous difficulty. Honestly? The only reason it's ever hard are the limited choices. The very start is easy, then some fights are a big struggle because the enemy is just using straight up better traits that you do not yet possess. Then you get laughing powder on the 4th floor and everything is easy until you get the special page for the 6th floor and the game is even easier (I recommend Netzach + blunt deck -> Netzach + Singleton Deck -> Whatever you feel like + Red Mist).  And the only way the game can think of to impede the player, is to make them use every floor in one of the final fights. That's right, not only are you forced to make worse decks overall, because you only have so many equipment pages, but you also have to use the garbage Abnormality pages on lower floors that are completely useless. And the funniest sh*t? The game only tells you about the fights in intervals (4/3/2/1), meaning you can't even properly prepare anyway. 
The best part about the gameplay is probably the abnormality fights. There are a few that are definitely annoying, but at least they all have clear win conditions and some have very unique approaches that make them fun to figure out. Although the not too great translation can really trouble you here, with unclearly defined rules (e.g. gains Strength next scene actually means this and next scene).

But even outside of battles, the game can be really frustrating. Mainly in its core aspect: Deck Building. The UI is in fact, not good. It's messy and annoying to navigate. Especially annoying: You can filter through cards, but not key cards. Well, you can filter through key cards, in the passive transferring menu, but you can't filter through them by default. Very cool. There is a mod to fix this though. Mods are probably your best bet in general. Get some quality of life mods, get some meme skins for your goons and try to have fun with that. Because the game is not going to make you have fun on its own.

TL;DR: Library of Ruina is a disappointing sequel to Lobotomy Corporation with tedious gameplay gimmicks. People will tell you that you don't need to play L. Corp. to play Ruina, but honestly you should play that game instead and then watch the story to Ruina on youtube. At least L. Corp. is consistent and fun.",1695145911,1695150896,False,4,5,0.459167003631591797,0,True,False,False

Inside the mirror do you see (Ha-ah)
Someone else in that body?

One and
Two and
Three and

My head goes left
And end up on your bed

Spread me open for dolly pink, snow white artificial beauty
Maybe we're all cold machines
Stuffed in the human skin
With human sins
Sewed up by the gods of city

Two lines
Three lines
Connect our hands

QUICK NOTE HERE: If you aren't a fan of reading story, or a fan of strategical, brain-twisting gameplay, this may not be the game for you. This game requires dedication and thought to its systems, as well as reading through pages of dialogue and character development to get the most out of it. That being said, I think this game is incredibly accessible if you give it a chance. 

This game has multiple major keystones that make it so incredible, but I'll only delve into 3-4 here for sake of accessibility.

STORY- This game (and moreso, this company Project Moon) is known for very indepth storytelling, world building, and character development and DAMN this game DOES NOT DISAPPOINT, in fact, I'd say it's this game's strongest quality. It has one of the best stories I've seen in a videogame period. 
The story follows the events of the previous game, Lobotomy Corporation. It takes the reigns from that game and focuses more on the worldbuilding of the City and the main character, Angela, and her coming to terms with reality, as an AI with human emotion. The other main character, Roland, is a fantastic foil to Angela, being someone who has gone through much of life and well, without getting into spoiler territory, has seen some SHIT. They work really well together have a lot of fantastic plot development centered around them and this fantastic, grimdark world they're in.

GAMEPLAY- Now, I will say the gameplay starts off a little slow. It's a standard deckbuilder but in an RPG format. Where this game really gets good is around the midpoint, which adds a very key system which allows Passive Abilities from old equipment to me placed onto new equipment, which allows for immense amounts of build diversity and experimentation. 
This game is INSANELY difficult. Not to the extent Lobotomy Corporation is, but it definitely continues the trend of being very very challenging. However, it's far from unfair. The game has multiple ways to balance the difficulty how you choose to do so, giving the player freedom to challenge themselves as they see fit. A very, very strong part of this game's gameplay is the player experimentation. Find what works for you, and work your team of 5 to play off each other's weaknesses. 

And finally, THE MUSIC- God, where do I start with this one. This is probably my favorite videogame soundtrack of all time. It features vocal tracks from the band Mili, as well as instrumental tracks from Studio EIM, both of which convey deep emotional themes within the music they write. It's incredible. If nothing else, at least browse the soundtrack on YouTube. 


And yeah. That's about what I've got for this review. Go play it. It's absolutely worth your money, and your time.",1694223664,1694223664,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Do you like Difficult games?

Do you like having to strategise?

Do you like great stories?

Do you like incredible music?

Do you like fleshed out character design?

If you answered yes to any of the above, then you're probably going to like Library of Ruina. Library of Ruina throws us back into the dystopian world outlined in Lobotomy Corporation with a twist. We're no longer managing a Corporation, we are now a Deckbuilding Librarian Badass.

That's right, we're a Deckbuilder now and Mr Bones' Wild Ride doesn't stop there, Library of Ruina features a very simple concept for you as a player, invite people from outside the library into the library and turn them into books via a 'Reception' (Kill 'em ded).

Yet despite this simple concept, you're forced to look at the world around you, you'll find characters you care about and feel a pang of guilt as you kill them, you trudge through multiple areas of grey unsure of how you feel whilst sometimes getting immensely satisfied at finding a horrible character to wail on instead.

This new format allows the game to really go into detail, explaining E.G.O., Abnormalities and the world in so much more depth, and the Abnormality conflicts themselves become a phenomenal jump in difficulty, becoming more like puzzles than straight up fights.

Between the charming art-style, great story telling and fun but difficult gameplay, you'd think I'd be stopping there! But no, it also has to be said that Library of Ruina has some of the best music I've played in a game, the songs are great with an ever-increasing sense of urgency as you progress only to be derailed by some unsettlingly calm and beautiful piece. They know what they're doing with composition here, and it really adds to the over all experience of the game.

This game is hard, it will punish you, it will expect you to learn

But it accurately reflects the story it wants to tell.

painfully hard game, but the pain is worth it when you finally kick a reception's ass. Lots of deck building, destroying, and rebuilding. Despite all the pain and suffering this game will put you through(Doesn't start off too bad), it's more than worth it for the story/world and gameplay. If I had to compare this game to anything in terms of the experience I've had with it, then it'd probably be Sekiro; it's a soulsborne comparison, but I'd be lying if I said that the absolute walls here didn't remind me of what Sekiro puts you through - except so much harder. At the same time though, the feeling of mastery you get when you overcome problems in both games can't really be beat. Not at all a feeling exclusive to either game, but it's one that I've felt the most with these 2 games(And Katana Zero - go play it, amazing game made by one dude).

In summary: [b]The gameplay is deep, challenging, and never gets boring. That being said, having to redo difficult fights because of rng or skill issues is very annoying given the length of many fights. The writing is superb and so much of the cast has something to enjoy with their writing. The worldbuilding of the City is fascinating and how it ties into the cast is even better. Art and Music is beyond incredible. The book burning system is really annoying. The difficulty curve is vertical. When is Roland getting his damn sandwich? Library of Ruina is an easy 10/10 and i'm gonna have to heavily consider whether it enters my top 10.[/b]

Game play 10/10
The escalation of difficulty is perfect and the game does not shy away from making tough challenges which require strategising and making use of all the game mechanics. Feel free to take breaks in between tough stages as they can tend to be long and mentally tiring as you plan your moves and try to predict the probabilities.
Story 10/10
Had stages which made me emotionally invested and the combination of the story, solid music and difficulty just amplified them even more and produce some masterpiece moments. I enjoyed the game so much that when I reached the final stage, I decided to put the game on hold for about a year as I didn't want the game to end, and ended up restarting my progress just to have the chance to experience the journey of LOR once again before clearing the final stage and reach the conclusion. Perhaps in the near future, i'll come back to clear the achievements and maybe even the battle symbols. :)

To start this off with, while this game is a sequel, I would say you can jump right into this one just fine, because while the events of Lobotomy Corporation are VERY important and still relevant, the games protagonist is about as relatively clueless as you might be.
It may take a bit for the game to establish what mostly happened in the prior game, but it genuinely does do a good job of catching you up to speed, not to mention that as far as main protagonists go, Roland is a delight.

I can still hesitantly recommend Lobotomy Corporation, but where as this game may take aeons to complete, it's long for a lot of right reasons, L. Corp does a far worse job of respecting your time despite some real interesting mechanics and another worthwhile story.
[spoiler]Not to mention, you get the benefit of seeing transferred/altered mechanics for this gameplay style, which is really cool[/spoiler]
Basically if you think this game looks interesting as is, go for it, still quite good.

Moving on.
[h1]Gameplay is king[/h1]
I'll get into other aspects of what makes this game great as a package later, but if you just care about getting a good game then rest assured you'll get it.

LoR is a deck building game on the surface, but there are two main things that help make it stand out.
RPG progression with stats/upgrades, and roll of the dice.

This whole game relies upon a roll of the dice for literally everything, from determining turn priorities, attack damage/negation, everything you do will be left up to chance... to an extent.
This is where the upgrade system comes in, by besting opponents you can get their stats, cards and traits, which allows you to mix and match the best of everyone you come across, albeit with some slight debuffs and their own catches.

But because of this, you can manipulate the odds in your favour, no matter how daunting.
These fights get hard, but RNG is rarely the reason why you'll fail.

Commenting further on the gameplay,
[h1]The difficulty spike is vertical[/h1]

Is a phrase I saw often, and not without reason. this game gets hard, and there are several tens of hours I could've shaved off if I knew how to handle certain fights better initially.
I would get stuck for hours on individual fights several times, but I never got discouraged, instead I always felt encouraged to create new builds, and see what synergies I could create with different traits.
What also helps is that the game rarely puts you in a brick wall scenario, the game is broken up into chapters, but these chapters have branching storylines which lead to different fights, so you can pick and choose between them in any order you want, until you finish said chapter.

Stating the obvious but going back and dominating a fight that dominated you is immensely satisfying, but what helps is that the game never gave up on being challenging.
Every single time I thought I had a great build going, the game eventually gave me a harder challenge, and told me I didn't know a damn thing.
So this keeps encouraging me to create new and/or better builds, and by the end game you have A LOT of options.

The game has a lot of variety and gimmicks with its combat, and even by the end of the game, it still managed to consistently surprise me, absolutely superb.

[h1]A good read[/h1]

When the game is not in turn-based deck combat [spoiler]or an in-depth deck builder[/spoiler], it's being a visual novel.
The artistry has improved greatly from L. Corp, the style they've gone for looks really great, but what makes it great is the world and its characters, the characters especially are a delight.

The overwhelming majority of major characters return from L. Corp, but the two main characters of Roland and Angela absolutely steal the show.
But to give a comment without spoilers, it's the interactions between everyone that makes them work, all these main characters feel like worthwhile continuations of what was established in L. Corp, and getting a glimpse of the grim, outside world of the city and its inhabitants was very much a treat.

It has been awhile since a game has left me this emotionally invested, but by the end of it, I was far from drained.
I kept joking saying ""it'd be fine if the game went on for another 10 hours after this"", and to my utter shock, it kept doing this, and each time it did I found new bits of value in its narrative.
It's absolutely a ride worth taking, and it will take a long while for me to forget all of this, really great stuff.

[h1]An absolutely golden soundtrack[/h1]
Soundtrack's absolutely golden, there are atleast 10 basic battle themes, and they're all pretty nice, but they also have three phases, and all of these do a really great job of hyping you up for the battle as it goes on, they're also just really catchy.

But even without the standard battle themes, you've got the real catchy jazz/big band kind of style throughout the entire game, and while there are the occasional unique instrumental piece here or there, there's always one way you can tell if an encounter is going to kick your ass, and that'd be [i]when the Mili music kicks in[/i].

[h1]To make some negative comments[/h1]

The extra fights outside of your standard plot based ones, dubbed abnormality suppression, could be chosen a bit more evenly.
Out of all the fights you'll do, these are probably going to rely on luck the most just because of how few people/upgrades you'll have when you're dealing with them, for the most part these are fun/challenging but some can end up a smidge boring and/or frustrating.

The performance aswell could be much better.
While I don't have a problem with it in the same way I did with L. Corp, the game does kind of lag while messing with interfaces.
It still looks great, and there's only one or two real-time mechanics I can think of which are easy enough to manage, but they'd be a lot nicer to mess around with if things were a bit smoother.

While I may have commented on how great the plot and characters were, I will say that some of the more antagonistic forces feel a bit neglected, some are just thrown in to have some rather skin deep thematics, which felt a bit lame.

One last complaint, albeit a more important one.
While I really like how many groups there are and how you can handle situations with their unique pages, I do not like how unevenly upgrades are given out for all these groups.
You max out like half of these groups at the same time, while the others are left neglected until you progress far enough, which will take who knows how long.
These groups may end up fantastic by the end of it, I certainly had my favourites, but catch up mechanics should have been implemented a bit better.

Though honestly that's about it.

[h1]Overall, I absolutely adored this game, truly a gem[/h1]
Despite the long playtime, and probably a good third of that being deckbuilding, this was a superb game from start to finish, probably one of my favourite games, at the very least one of the best I've played in long while.

I [b]highly[/b] recommend trying this out, and I look forward to seeing where they go with this story in Limbus Company, not to mention how they'll handle new gameplay styles.

Game play wise, most of the time its a ""my number is bigger than yours, I win"" type of situation, but this isn't always the case.

If you have played other games by the makers or came here because you already like the game, then you are probably buying it anyway and I hope you enjoy it.

For a new potential players who got a random recommendation from a friend or was navigated here by steam, I don't think this is a good pickup. Obviously some people will like this game but I think most people won't find a lot of enjoyment here. I have a few reasons for this I'll briefly go through.

Sound: First off this is the best part of the game imo. The music tracks are mostly all absolute bangers. Even the music I wouldn't listen to is perfect for the situations and is extremely immersive. The sound design is amazing too with really satisfying feedback from things as obvious as attacks to just noises made from moving your cursor over the menus. Easily my favorite part of the game.

Story: The story has really satisfying moments, great plot twists, and even though I think it failed to really grip me at the beginning, it definitely picked up fast and had a lot of interesting stories to tell. There is an overarching plot but the best part about the story in my opinion are the unique side stories that you see before battles from early-mid game that preface each fight. The main thing holding this aspect of the game back is that you get the most out of the story when you know the story of the previous game. I also think the writing can be a little unclear and while the story is incredible it's not very accessible without outside help/materials.

Visuals: This is pretty good. Not much to say about this since graphics aren't really important in this game. Some attacks look really cool and the characters are well designed enough but in general the art doesn't really stand out or distract from the rest of the game. Sometimes it does confuse messy and gross for just looking lazy is my biggest complaint.

Game:

Now, so far you're probably thinking that based on everything else I've said that the game is really good and that you don't understand why I am not recommending it. The reason is because you can hear the sounds, read the story, and see the visuals all without playing the game and for free on youtube or online. Playing the game is the only element of the game you're really paying for. That said the gameplay, while not horrible, is by far my least favorite part of the game.

Personally I like deckbuilders, I like turn based strategy games, and this game has a lot of really cool and unique gameplay mechanics that not only make the game feel original and interesting, but on paper should really appeal to me. My main issues are that the game doesn't make it very clear how the game works. To it's credit it does explain most things, but it doesn't really teach you in a way that's necessary to deeply understand all the complex mechanics. That doesn't really become an issue until you've made some progress in the game and fights become way more difficult. Also this game has a community but not such a big one that it's easy to find explanations or guides on how these mechanics work. They are there but you must go searching for them.

On top of all this the difficulty in this game doesn't feel very linear. In the beginning of the game I really knew nothing and was breezing past enemies. Eventually I got to some missions that were damn near impossible and it took me reaching out to friends who had already played the game to run me through some things I needed to know. That worked for a while but eventually I got to a point where even after learning every mechanic I still had to look up a guide and how to progress, and I think that's a failing on the part of the game.

Overall I did have parts I enjoyed but they are dwarfed in quantity by my frustrations. I think that you get too little out of purchasing the game to really make buying and playing it worth it.",1691164229,1691164229,False,24,4,0.625968337059020996,0,True,False,False

for now though, its unacceptable to continue buying their products. they caved to demands from misogynists and fired one of their employees for displaying very basic feminist sentiment to try and get the situation under control. 
(The situation is actually shockingly simple. A group of incels were angry at project moon for balance changes that they thought were bad and that one of the characters wasn't wearing ""sexy enough"" attire (her attire being a wetsuit instead of a swimsuit) so they review bombed the game and went to Project Moon's head office, basically harassing them. in any other situation this would've been pretty run-of-the-mill stuff for angry gamer dudes except for some reason, project moon caved.
The employee was fired the next day, having been fired so fast that they couldn't legally issue firing papers yet, those beings sent later.  
The reason that she was fired? she'd previously tweeted that hidden cameras in bathrooms were a bad thing, and if that made her a ""radical feminist"" (read, not radfem as in terf, radfem as in feminist) then she was.
these tweets were deleted prior to her hiring.
she was in no way responsible for the ""offensive lack of fanservice"" but was simply used as a scapegoat by the company.
the behavior utilized by this company does not match the morals they preach and is shameful and disgusting.
Do not support their game. 
do not support them until this is cleared up.

Now regarding the bunch of other reviews as of late and controversy for the company. I feel this post sums it up pretty well. I'll leave it at the end of my comment for those who wish to look deeper into it. 

However i will say context is key. And that I am willing to support them because they were put in a situation where its a no win situation. 

I'm shortening it here, but I encourage many others to look into the issue and form their own opinion. 

Some peeps (or incels as others have put it) got angry over a small drawing detail, lots of death threats and all that. Standard Internet being the Internet. However the breaking point was when peeps go to the building itself to protest on it, and while coupled with death threats, you can see why they made the decision they made. 

Not to say it was right that they caved to these peeps, but it's easy to say what they should and should not do when we aren't the ones at the risk of bodily harm. 

I have left out a fair amount of details though so I encourage yall to look into it before deciding.

[b]Library of Ruina[/b] asks you: Do you know how to play chess?
You know, that game where each piece has a simple way to move?
Well, we aren’t doing that, welcome to the library.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
The game loop revolves around a story told in a Visual Novel style before having to battle whatever opponent comes to the library, obtaining their cards, improving your deck before progressing to the next story section.

[h1]Story[/h1]
I won’t spoil you on the story or it’s setting but it’s quite unique and it paints a world where your imagination can run wild and the strangest events happens regularly but this also mean that some stuff can feel very far-fetched and nonsensical, I’ll give you an example A guilt ridden guy spontaneously combusts in a library before sprouting a wing and being teleported in a circus where he meets a clown that wants to sniff his wrist, blacking out just to hallucinate a skeleton man giving him free* therapy.

Some stuff straight up doesn’t make any sense if you are not aware of the world it takes place in, and sometimes not even knowing is going to save you from going “Huh?”.
But that aside writing is good with some ups and downs, ramping up in a very explosive and spectacular finale.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Gameplay is very… “Intricate”.
You are a guy… with a deck… each card does something.
Understandable.
Cards can be used to attack or defend.
Of course.
Sometimes both.
Sounds fun.
There can be multiple attacks or defenses on a single page.
Okay.
Many cards have additional effects.
Again, variety is fun.
There are types of damage and resistances, plus the two defenses work in different ways.
Uh.
You can choose who to attack based on a dice roll.
I’m not sure I-
Cards also have a cost requirement.
On top of all?
Once you “clash” with an enemy you gain another resource to level up mid fight increasing your main resource.
Once all your characters levelled up you can choose an extra passive out of 3.
Is this necessary?
Also, you have two lifebars, one for HP and one for stun, each having separate resistances.
I don’t think I can keep u-
Not to mention all the passives that your characters have modifying your rolls and other stuff.
I think it’s a bit too mu-
Enemies have all of this too.
That’s a lot to keep in mind.
And both you and your enemy can have up to 5 units on the field, each with their passives.
I’m not even reading at this point.
Not to mention each character can attack multiple times, it’s normal to see 15 attacks each turn being thrown around.
WHAT?
So you have build like 20 decks keeping all of this in mind.
N…o?
And some battles are going to require up to 20 characters on different battlegrounds.
You can stop.
And many of the fights are going to be multi-phase ones requiring up to hours each combat even when the speed is set to maximum.
…

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
So yes, you can see how it’s a BIT to take in…
I would have liked something simpler yet elegant over the magnificent mess this game is, but then again this games goes to extremes to carve itself a niche out of the indie scene, and it really works wonders on that aspect.

I love it a ton and the first half of the game should be heralded as a masterclass of interesting worldbuilding and fair challenge. But that's the first half of the game, and unluckily enough the second half of the game isn't very good

Up until what the game calls ""Star of The City"" a.k.a the halfway point is a game based in a dystopian city with loveable characters and a banging soundtrack, however the gameplay is pretty lacking and most of the time an absolute chore to slog through, but it's bearable because the fights are usually short and you're constantly meeting new foes with little to no repetition, then you get to Star and it all goes downhill from there.

From this point on the game puts more of an emphasis on gameplay rather than story and since the gameplay is already unfun they do so through artificial difficulty, a.k.a absolutely jacking the opponents stats through the roof requiring extreme patience and multiple attempts just to pray to RNJesus that they don't clobber your team 7 rounds in. It is not a casual player's game and requires a fair bit of outside research or someone looking over your shoulder if you're relatively unexperienced in card games. The story also takes a nosedive in the final few chapters as they disregard all character progression just in case one player didn't do the """"""Side"""""""" content which isn't """"""Side"""""" content because you need to do it to progress so it makes no sense why the characters can't just learn.

Dialogue is relatively drawn out and despite the main character stating that she ""hates when people talk in roundabout ways"" she then takes 3 minutes to get to the statement ""City Bad"" after every single fight. I once saw a review that said Project Moon should focus on Visual Novels and not bother with gameplay and I fully agree, This world is fantastic and I adore the city and I really REALLY want more people to enjoy it, I have bought it for friends and I have a damn youtube channel built around the series but there is more harm than good.

With an amazing story that follows up on a great prequel, a fun deckbuilding aspect, and m u l t i p l e difficulty spikes sure to keep you occupied for a long time, Library of Ruina is an unforgettable experience that I definitely recommend to play through. I will cover three aspects I love, and one warning for people looking to try the game. 

1: The story. The story is absolutely amazing in this game, and it builds so much on Project Moon's previous title, Lobotomy Corporation, and expands the world that the games are set in. I found myself super invested into all the characters and the deep backstory of the library and the city.

2: The music and sound design. The music is among the best I've ever heard in video games, and Mili (a band hired to make specific tracks in the game) created some amazing lyrical works for some major fights. It keeps me coming back to the old fights, even though I may be way past that point of the game. The sound design is also superb. When weapons clash, it makes a satisfying ding. When an attack hits an enemy, depending on the type, you might hear a blunt impact or a clean stab. (also the funeral of butterflies' bang bang sound, oh my gosh its so heavenly.)

3. The gameplay (more about the gameplay loop and the progression. Gameplay in general is pretty fun and engaging, but I think theres better.) I really like the progression the game features. This will spoil a little bit, but [spoiler] The combination of switching between normal receptions and abnormality fights is super fun. I also really love the realizations, as it feels like a little mini dungeon with 5 battles in a row, with great music, a good way to build on the story of the library more, and you get some good rewards through abno pages. I also think it was really smart of Project Moon to include abnos from Lobotomy Corporation, but with the gameplay of Library of Ruina. [/spoiler] The main gist is that the game switches between two kinds of encounters, keeping the game fresh. One issue I had with the gameplay, is that sometimes I would be just short of a combat page or key page I needed, and I'd have to fight the encounter all over again just to get one thing. At worst, its a minor annoyance though.

Finally, a warning. This game is HARD. Unreasonably, unfairly, stupidly hard. There are a few encounters in the midgame that might completely turn you away from this game, and my best advice is to either skip it until you are better prepared, or look at some guides on how the fight works. Also, the endgame is really cruel, essentially being one long gauntlet where you cannot obtain any new cards, essentially locking you to the builds you had before, and if you suddenly want to change, well guess you gotta start over. 

Overall, Library of Ruina is a great experience for most, but some may want to skip on this game due to the difficulty, or the sometimes boring gameplay. Enjoy finding your Perfect Book, librarians.",1690059724,1690059724,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Unfortunately a good portion of that enjoyment comes from having played Lobotomy Corporation, which this is a direct sequel to. The story builds on that game's heavily and, while this game does catch the viewer up on the events of that game pretty well, there are certain themes and ideas that will fly over your head if you have not played it.
That being said, I believe the story can stand on its own, and the gameplay is quite fun too. I am not usually a fan of turn based combat but the card based system and how you engage with opponents hooks me. Also the animation makes the heavy hits feel like they hurt.

So far my only big complaint is the way systems are taught. The game teaches you how to play by flashing a giant manual on screen that you can accidentally click out of fairly easily. Said manual doesn't even do a very good job in instructing you how things work either, leaving a lot of things fairly vague. The biggest example of this is mass attacks, a type of attack that comes up later in the game that does not follow the traditional rules of the game.

When I bought it, I seriously did not even know it is a card game. Some might say it is quite a rushed decision, and that would be correct, however it is a decision I will never regret. 

As already mentioned, this as a card game. I think some might loose ineterest right after finding out about that but please bear with me, if you don't like crads, you'll find something else you like here.

I must say, I am someone who did not play Lobotomy Corporation (the prequel to this game) before this so I did not know anything about the characters and the setting of the story. While the story is good from the start, it took me like 10 hours to get HOOKED. That is a long time, longer than some whole games I play. This is and argument people use to make others read One Piece becuase ""IT BECOMES SO GOOD AFTER 500 CHAPETERS"" and I kinda hate that argument, but it is true. One Piece did get good, and story of Library of Ruina sure did get AMAZING. I think this ""problem"" would be ""fixed"" if I did play lob corp before as I would come to this game already with attachement to to world and characters, however as I did not play lob corp before, this game had to make me attached to them from the scratch. When I got into the story, I REALLY got into it. There will be people saying ""We don't talk about Love Town"" and I won't be talking about it since thats spoilers but man, thats when I realized this game is not playing around. 

In simple words, you play as a librarian doing your job, you know... murdering people. You invite citizens of the distopian city the game is set in, with a promise of a book about something they might be interested in. When your guests come, you fight and turn them into more books. This allows for some great world building and also uniqe game progression. Not only you can read books of your guests to learn about how they and other people in the specific part of the city live or think, you can use them to lure in other guests. Some of the people want to retrive books of their close ones, while others want to steal books of there competitors to learn their secrets. When I say the story starts slow, it is because you need to know about the word to actually care, and you don't really know anything at the start (unless you consumed other PM merdia). But when you do more progress, oh boy you suddenly know things. When I revisited some stories after finishing the game, I found them much more interesting even after dissmising them after I saw them for the 1st time. The story telling is simply impeccable. They made me care about every single character to the point I was sad even after winning a fight. 

I mentioned uniqe game progression before, let me develop on that a bit. So if you win a fight, you'll get books that you need to invite more guests. You also need these books to get cards. While this works well, probably my biggest complaint comes from it. After you finish a fight and get your books as reward, you will want to burn those books to get cards and become stronger. But after 1 fight you will sometimes not have all the cards you can get from that enemy (book) so you will want to fight the enemy again to have more of the cards. This still makes sense, if you want all the cards you need to put in some grind. The problem comes because you want to keep books to invite new guests, and if you fail, which is something that will happen in the endgame, you lose the books and will need to go to the previous fight and get the book again (I hope I'm, making sense here). The thing is, fights in endgame can take you over an hour. You might need to do fight 3 times to get all the cards and after that still have to repeat it if you fail the next one. There are some tricks to get more cards but that is something I found out I can't really do in hard fights if I actually want to beat them. But well, if you can't go like this you can always get no grind mod or something.

Now let's talk about gameplay a bit, shell we? It starts kinda complicated and to be honest, if the game needed you to fully understand mechanics right form the start, I probably wouldn't get very far. Good thing is, you can simply play, make some mistakes and still progress becuase while complicated, it starts really easy. This allows for very natural learnig curve without being flustrating by forcing you to repeat levels multiple times until you finally do everything how the game wants you to. Until you reach endgame, it always felt like the exect time I undrestood what I'm doing, the game threw in something new. At the start you simply play cards and well... that's what you do the whole time, but if you find the first few fights repetitive (which I kinda did) do not worry, quickly all the fights will gain their own quirk. This way it never feels actually repetitive after you get through the ""tutorial"", and when you reach endgame, you are prepared for anything that comes at you. OR THAT'S WHAT YOU THING BUT WHAT COMES AT YOU ARE SOME OF THE MOST INSANE BOSSFIGHTS POSSIBLE. While endgame is really difficult, I never got so stuck that I stopped enjoying the game. I myself was streaming the game (twitch.tv/mastyza, shameless plug) and viewers helping definely saved me some restarts, but it never did feel Impossible or like I needed to be completely perfect to progress. sometimes you just need to take a step back and build a good counter deck for a specific fight.

Now that I mentioned deckbuilding, that's an important part of the game. It starts with a low amount of cards. Deckbuilding at the start for me would go like this ""oh, this enemy is week against slash attacks? Let's just put in every card with a slash attack."" And that worked perfectly fine... until it didn't. In earlygame you don't really need any light recovery (resource to pay for cards) or page draw, as the battles aren't long enough that you would run out. But there comes point where you definetly need those economy cards and you need to know the balance between strong cards and cards that will let you consistently draw and afford to play those strong cards. This is something you will need to play with to make work for you, but the decks only consist of 9 cards so it won't take you ages. In the end, if you are not confident in your deckbuilding abilities but still want to enjoy the gameplay and story, you can find some decks online.

Let me end this with simply saing, I LOVED this game. I do not think it is a game that everyone would enjoy but man... I LOVED IT AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD.

If you consider buying this game, I hope I helped you make the right decision (which is buying the game).",1672273313,1689762851,True,1,0,0.50373530387878418,0,True,False,False

You are basically a ""librarian"" and need to ""receive"" guests via ""invitations"". Once you receive ""guests"" yu have to battle it out and ""something"" happens to them if they lose to you. As a reward you get basically unique ""cards"" depending upon the floor and level and which ""book"" you burnt which you utilise to progress further into the main story or you could jump into some side stuff via a certain ""mechanic"". Everything in quotation marks has a different term they use in the game but I am using them as placeholders to avoid story spoilers cuz trust me when I say the story is top notch.

Combat:
I actually found the card system pretty fun. I was never really into card games until one day a few of my friends got me to play DUEL LINKS. After playing that game I realised how fun it can be coming up with strategies and synergising and creating the perfect deck. This game while obvoiusly different in its approach, has quite enjoyable and engaging combat even if you aren't into card games/deck builders as you can actually see characters fight it out and the background stage (both of these are important for the story and atmosphere that the game is going for).

Art:
I have always been a sucker for games that have meticulously crafted worlds with level design and osts that immerse you into the game and you just love it (games like Bloodborne, Persona 5, NieR, Darksouls, Final Fantasy XV, X etc). This game nails each and every one of those aspects. I do believe however if you arent a fan of visual novels or the way they are presented you might have some trouble then again the game's art direction is so good you might end up loving visual novels. Bonus points for the osts they are LEGENDARY (I mean it is the person who composed osts for Goblin Slayer, Ghost in the shell etc, Mili and Studio EIM).

Edit 1: The Story keeps getting better and better and the osts are still a banger. I would recommend turning off quick mode (Q is the hotkey) as it allows you to roll your dice right before you strike as opposed to automatically doing it for you, it made the combat more enjoyable for me as it makes your next move suspenseful and more interactive. Also, be sure to check out the books tab and read the pages of the people you turned into books for some lore on the world. Damn this game is deep, kinda makes you wanna ponder if this is what awaits us in the future.

Edit 2: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE TAKE THE WARP TRAIN, IF YOU DO THEN WELL GOODLUCK!
Also the game got real dark but the stories are SOOO good and the osts are probably some of the best (some even better than NieR and Soulsborne and Final Fantasy). changing rating from 8 to 9/10.

Rating: 9/10

I can most of the time sink some hours in and then just know the game isn't gonna catch me enough to complete it. This is one of those rare games that does catch me. I can already tell I am going to finish it.

The game is more RPG than deckbuilder.
The deckbuilder aspect is there but you can freely change their decks before every encounter.
So one can in theory build a ""deck"" that counters the enemy every single battle. Some people are into that, I'm not I just pull some strong cards together and press play, unless the difficulty asks of me to do so. Again the ""decks"" you build function more as kits for your fighters. This kit building and tinkering outside of battle is key and one must atleast not mind this or as I do enjoy it if one wants to enjoy the overall experience. 

Also a lot of story takes place in this game I don't mind it I like it, the story here manages to actually make me invested in the characters, even if it is the ones I slash to pieces. I don't play this game for the plot but the story does help make me feel that after every new story mission I'm accomplishing something towards a greater goal. And this does make me want to play more.

Also this game oozes character.

In this game, you follow the two main characters as they both suffer and inflict suffering in the cursed hyper-corporate hellscape they live in. The art is beautiful and the sound design is flawless. The voice acting is full of life, and every crunchy hit lets you feel the damage that your hopeless little cartoon enemy just felt.
The story itself is very engaging and well written, though you may have a tougher time digging in if you aren't familiar with the previous game in the series, 'Lobotomy Corp'. There's a lot going on, and it's so much fun to dive deeper and deeper into the intricate workings of The City. But while us non-Korean speakers will spend a good amount of time reading the visual novel style cutscenes, make no mistake: That is not where you will be doing the bulk of your reading...

That's right, if you want any chance of winning, you're going to spend a lot of time poring over enemy and card descriptions! While this is a deck building card battler at its core, it is nearly just as much a puzzle game at times. Misunderstand an enemy boss's mechanics or the special effects on a card, and you can wipe in a single turn, so don't think you're just going to brute force your way through. It's also worth noting that this game doesn't have the best tutorials in the world, so you'll probably need to do a bit of experimenting. There are a lot of fun card mechanics to play with, so you'll want a good understanding to put together an effective deck anyway. You'll probably spend a lot more time trying to puzzle out a good build than you will fighting, but if you're anything like me, you'll have a blast doing it.

I don't know if it comes across, but this is definitely a 10/10 recommend for me.

- Interface is terrible, unreadable and not user friendly. One example, for cards (mostly played by foes) wearing a very long description, the font is so tiny you cannot even read the text and there is no way to zoom (!). Another stupidity, to start a phase and roll the dices you have to press Space bar. If by mistake you do it twice (or if you forgot you did it), it skips a whole turn for your librarians, which 99% of the time means instant death. Not even a confirmation dialog for an action which at 99.99999% of the time makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE! I could go on for hours: cards covering the tall bosses dices, odd resolutions not managed without mods...

- Graphics are so and so in combat phase, decent between the combats but nothing to be remembered. Same for the musics: some are pretty decent, others are rather annoying.

- Mechanics are constantly added with very poor tiny explanations, leaving you in doubt of interpreting the constantly changing rules. Don't count on the log to help you : it vanishes so fast you cannot read anything, even if you de-activate the auto-resolution of dices.

- Be ready to grind... over and over... lower fights to finally unlock the rare characters and get a chance to progress in the end game. Some fights have up to 6 or 7 phases, which takes literally hours and if you die at any moment, you will not receive ANY reward for the unachieved fight (e.g. The Crying Children). In that regard the game even fails to be a rogue-like.

I really cannot understand the hype around this game. I return to Darkest Dungeon! I might not finish the last level and anomalies before long...

Edit: after more than 130h of (painful) play, the cup is full. I reached the Black Silence reception and the display is systematically freezing in the last phase. Really ?!",1686612323,1688942244,False,4,2,0.49730268120765686,0,True,False,False

The grind on this game can be brutal af. For that reason, if you suck at card games like me and are also wary of the vertical difficulty spike, I would suggest you go to the workshop and download a mod that guarantees page drops. Save yourself the grind, and the game becomes infinitely more enjoyable if you aren't the type to enjoy that, because some of these fights are brutal and LONG.

That being said: the plot and world building contain some of the finest writing I've ever seen. I adore the characters IMMENSELY, and just about every song is a banger. ""String Theocracy"", the intro, changed my brain chemistry forever. I've been brainrotting over this game for months.

If you are having any hesitation at all, I beg you to remove it. Go play it. You won't regret it. I'm not a card game sort of person and I LOVE this game. If it's too hard for you, go grab additional mods, but you MUST play it. And there are mods made by fans that create content on par with the game itself, so you're just opening the door to hours and hours of entertainment. I personally recommend the Ayin Realization mod (with the feather pen logo) and the Bookhunter story mod.

TLDR: Get the game, get mods if it's hard, you'll love it. Play Lobotomy Corporation and Limbus Company if you haven't already. You don't need to play Lobotomy Corporation to understand this because they recap it pretty well.

First off, the gameplay difference from Lobotomy Corporation to this game is insane for a direct sequel.

I mean it makes sense because one game is about managing a facility and the other is about turn based card game combat, but I'll be damned if the next Project Moon game also doesn't feature a unique gameplay system as well [spoiler](it's actually like a mobile gacha game or something that's also on steam so we'll see how that goes (hopefully well))[/spoiler]

It's a really good sequel I have to admit. Features characters we know, expands upon their relationships with each other, introduces memorable new characters, and gives much more lore on the world and the setting than the first game. Everything you could ask for essentially.

I like the gameplay itself. Card game (with minimal RNG on the card draw), damage/power is determined using dice, just like DnD, the key page and combat page system is solid, you can put one key page's perks onto another, it's fine. I'm sure there's a lot of ways to dislike the gameplay (dice being RNG, unpacking key and combat pages can be grindy, mostly linear progression) but I really liked it overall. 

Music is exceptionally good by most standards. Most soundtracks are fine if not actually good, and some are bangers, but eventually you'll get tired of hearing some of them on repeat, especially the main menu theme.

Most characters they introduce in this game are likable in their own right as well, even if some of them are villainous. 

Boss battles are done exceptionally well as well. Most of them have an intended way to beat them, but you can overpower almost all of them without thinking if you're strong enough at that point in the game (which you won't be because of the linear progression, but you can come back and replay any battle in the game).

Visuals can look pretty sometimes as well, except the character sprites (mostly), but at least characters are highly customizable.

It's almost hard to compare this to LC because their gameplay is so much different, but they are two of my favorite games and this one is directly competing against LC and Hollow Knight for my #1. 

Also Gebura (actual huge spoiler under this black box btw) [spoiler]and using her along with Black Silence Roland and un-degraded Binah for the final battle (literally 2 colors and an Arbiter)[/spoiler] is worth getting the game alone IMO.",1675721066,1688746579,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Various archetypes naturally rose and fell in use with the acquisition of new cards, but none of them ever became obsolete for good, and all of them became valuable options with meaningful decisions to be made in their build, right up to the very end.

Overall the gameplay really carries it but the grind is definitely starting to wear me down. I think I'm rather close to the end of the game, I'm at ""Star of the City"" rating, and I think there's only one rating left above this, but I'm certainly struggling to make it to the finish line. While I think its great that the difficulty scale of the game has kept up and I've only occasionally felt like I'm really breezing through fights, regardless of difficulty fights just get really, REALLY long. It's a pain in the ass how long some of these fights are, and then when I get stuck against some major boss fight like Xiao or 얀샋ㄷ요무 at the point I'm at in the game, I then have to backtrack to a previous long fight to grind more books so that I can continue attempting the fight. It just almost feels like mobile game-level grinding at times, and really kills the enjoyment of what is otherwise a really solid game. I think it's well worth playing even if you don't know anything about the lore of the Project Moon, which I really don't except for a friend explaining things at times. I might keep chipping away at it but I'm really not sure if I'm gonna be able to finish this so just fair warning about the grind.

Seriously though, the grinding in this game is one of the worst I have ever encountered. There's no leveling or progression in this game, once you've gotten all the key pages out of a book you can at least get more copies of combat pages but you only need so many, after that there's absolutely nothing you gain from repeating receptions, you just HAVE to in order to acquire more books needed for receptions you're stuck on.

  My friend, Impractical, introduced me to this game through a discord stream in late 2020, and in August of 2022, I got it for myself. Here I am now, with a 100% completion badge, looking back on how fun this game is even after I've beaten it regardless of the difficulty or trauma. 

  For starters, the game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation (LC), a game which I have yet to beat but know the story of and have been traumatized by, and Library of Ruina (LoR) expands on the world-building made by ProjectMoon (PM). The game starts out slow with a nice art style which stays consistently polished to completely jaw-dropping at later points in the game, introducing you to the main characters who you follow as you complete more and more fights, slowly and safely showing you the ropes. The pattern of ""start new fight, lose fight, use rewards from fight to try again with stronger cards, win, use winnings to get stronger rewards and unlock next fight"" can get dragged out for a while, and I understand people who dislike it, but I personally enjoyed it. I reveled in my victories as I slowly crawled my way through the difficulties levels of the library. 

  Canard, Urban Myth, and Urban Legend were all cakewalks aside from the specialized abnormality fights, but in the 4th stage of the game, Urban Plague, shit hit the fan. I was faced with something I had been warned about previously, the difficulty spike. Fights started ramping up, with no real way to find a solid cheese other than to slowly and carefully learn the ins and outs of the fight through trial and error, but that feeling of raw ecstasy when you finally pull it off and get those rewards is unique in it's own way, and I love it. Aside from a few fights here and there, Urban Plague was decently smooth sailing.

  Then, I hit Urban Nightmare, which is as the name suggests, a nightmare. Enemies started to hit even harder than before, and I could really feel the difficulty ramping up. I was struggling, and I realized it, but my momma didn't raise no bitch, so I kept moving forwards through the game's second proper boss, making it into Star of the City.

  Star of the City is brutal, and the game knows it. you are given 4 paths to choose from as you start, the devs knew that some of these fights were just unfair, especially if you were unprepared or just didn't read the enemy passives. Unless you had some ridiculous luck, you couldn't just unga bunga through the horde of guests. You have to study your enemy, and adapt as you go, making entirely new decks just to deal with a minion in a fight [strike] fuck you Bada [/strike]. At times, the RNG just is not in your favor, leaving you despairingly alone in a situation with no hope as all of the variables seem to stack up against you, but sometimes that's just how life is. Life isn't always fair, you just have to keep moving forwards and accept the past, which is what the characters do throughout the game's story but I'm trying to keep this as spoiler-free as possible. With blood, sweat, and tears, I crossed the threshold into the finale.

  Impuritas Civitatis is definitely the hardest, yet best part of the game by a landslide. Everything about this, from the art, to the character development, and HOLY SHIT THE MUSIC, just screams that there is a talented team behind this game with a passion for creating art and attempting to perfect it down to the last possible minute detail, and I love it. Despite this part of the game essentially being a boss gauntlet from hell including the secret final boss you can do if you did all of the floor realizations, I loved it all even if it took me a week to do the Keter realization. 

  All in all, Library of Ruina, despite the difficulty spike so high it makes Snoop Dogg look like a Mormon, is a fantastic experience if you enjoy gambling and deck building covered up with a bible metaphor and an absolute BANGER of a soundtrack.

I don't leave reviews, and certainly not serious ones. However, [b]Library of Runia is worth it[/b].


This game is worth every ounce of praise it gets, genuinely a hidden gem, and very much worth your time at full price or on sale.


It's rare that a game will keep you so enthralled in its world and characters that when it challenges every ounce of your strategy and knowledge, it still has the power to draw you back in. My playthrough took almost a year to complete, and while I would pick up and put down, the game its presence never truly left my mind. Much like a good book, it'll always be there waiting for you to turn the next page. Every aspect of this game has such a high level of polish that you can feel the love and joy Project Moon put into it, from its endlessly intriguing world to the deep combat system that always allows for so much experimentation or the soundtrack and Mili songs that set the stage for emotion and eventually nostalgia at every turn. Library of Runia seemingly has it all.


However, every masterpiece has flaws, no matter how insignificant, and Runia is not without its missteps. To put it short, this game will test you. Just when you think you've found the upper limit on what challenge this game will give you, It's a moment of underestimating what this game is capable of. I wouldn't say this game will try and break you, but it will challenge you. Much like any mountain we climb (metaphorically), we reach a moment where we doubt our ability, and Runia will cause you to doubt yourself. But mentioned it will wait for you to overcome that hurdle, and when you do, the story and new strategies at your disposal make Library of Runia [i]a mountain worth climbing[/i].


To wrap it up, Library of Runia is a hidden masterpiece worth your time, money, and small amounts of sanity. But hey, if you are still on the fence about picking up the game, then why not check out Project Moon's latest title Limbus Company? It does contain some mild spoilers for Library of Runia, but as of writing this review, nothing too devastating to your enjoyment has been said.
If Limbus Company captures your attention, remember your invitation to this Library is always here, waiting for you.

The music is audio direction is good, and the graphics are charming, but it's not one of those aesthetic-focused games, where the game is the immersion. The story is average, with a lot of bland tone setting at the beginning that could be skipped; and when the interesting part comes... It's not that interesting any way, especially because the main story, while having some emotional beats, is mostly progression, while the character's stories completely ignore show don't tell. They are still written competently, but I never felt compelled by what I was being shown. I still think the world-building is still presented in an overly complex fashion for what the story actually uses it for.

And then we get to the gameplay. It is deep in the sense that it makes the player consider a lot of things and pay attention to be efficient at it. But the way it is designed, your cards will get powercreeped. So the real game ends up being how far you can pull forward with a deck before you have to sit down, re-do the entire team, and then go back to destroying everything for a while. Either that, or you compose specific decks for each type of encounter the game throws at you, which is extremely time consuming. Which is not to say that there aren't interesting strategies to be made, you can feel rewarded for thinking ahead and doing proper battle preparations, but knowing the basics of the game, you can pull that off most of the times, which makes it feel more like a formality, and the UI utility the game gives don't help in making that process less of a pain.

Then again, making a solid, multi-use deck means getting cards for everyone, the proper key pages, and getting back any book you might have lost by losing the encounter, which amounts to time that you are not engaging in any particularly interesting content. In the hopes your deck works, by the way.

So in summary, I think this game has a target, which is people obsessed with deckbuilding and getting lost in knowing everything to be optimal at the game. I'm not particularly fond of such experiences, and there's nothing else in the game that makes it interesting to me in any way, so I'm not even a bit conflicted on not recommending it.

The story is lovely & extremely well-thought out, with turns and unexpected connections around every corner. Although there is a major integration of dystopian doom & gloom which may turn off some to the overarching theme, I felt entertained beyond ""We're evil because being good is selfish"" with the gloom being more of a culture than an attempt to prove how dangerous the world is & its rejection of those who wish to feel.

In terms of price, the game is enjoyable enough and absolutely long enough to fit its price tag well, although that is only if you are persistent. The difficulty spike, is absolutely, without a doubt, vertical. The story midway through will slam you straight upwards sky-high with not only difficult fights, but several new mechanics, the fights themselves becoming long (30min - hour for an attempt, the later the longer.) A reliance on build-guides and efficient play styles limit creativity as personal builds become extremely particulate and thought-out while still under-performing compared to near-perfect builds others have made. This can and will require utmost patience amidst the confusion of why your previous 40 decks didn't work.

Overall, there's a lovely story to divulge into with good game-play, interesting characters, and a world unlike most. I cant recommend this to anyone on the fence about purchasing, as the difficulty spike comes in beyond the refund point. If you enjoyed Lobotomy Corporation's story and are looking for another deep dive, this is your place. And if you haven't played Lob Corp, then you'll still find a new story (and hopefully game!) you'll deeply enjoy.

Note: I highly recommend reading through more well thought-out reviews that go more in-depth about mechanics, the difficulty spike, and story overall. This was more of a personal homage to a game I sincerely enjoyed and hope continue to see others enjoy. Thank you for reading!",1686632676,1686632676,True,1,0,0.50113379955291748,0,True,False,False

However, looking up Lobotomy spoilers was kind of enough to appreciate it for me.  Unwise I guess but also I'm clearly not a Project Moon shill. :D

The RNG aspects are kind of annoying.  One expects them whenever Dice are involved, but randomized loot too?  Having to grind some stages again and again?  Spending resources that, unlike gacha stamina or whatever, won't come back?  Risky.  This isn't an easier game despite also being a ""I'm actually a VN though I hide behind certain game mechanics"" game.  If you're looking for a relaxing experience, well, why are you here?  Did you even attempt to play Lobotomy?  Some people claim this is masochism and it sure can be!

I admit that, to me, a big part of a game is music, and Library of Runia does not disappoint.  Sure, some tunes are more ambiance focused than others but, frankly, ambiance is the name of the game for most OSTs, even in films.  There are many good games with good soundtracks, and it's good that Runia is one of them.

If you're more of a gameplay than story person, yes this game is not really for you.  The gameplay's RNG aspects are annoying, and there are other deckbuilding games like Night of Full Moon or Slay the Spire or Tainted Grail Conquest which will satisfy your itch better.  But Library of Runia is still compelling gameplay wise.

I've seen claims that this game can take over 100 hours to complete.  IF my opinion changes, so will this review.  But as it stands, despite still feeling barely competent at this, I'm really enjoying my experience with this game.  It is more of a Visual Novel than a standard deckbuilder or RPG, sort of like how Utawarerumono is also primarily a visual novel, but this game's gameplay is actually good.  Play this.  Play Lobotomy first, probably, but this game is definitely worth your time!",1686209524,1686209524,True,1,0,0.527559041976928711,0,True,False,False

- The grind is terrible and punishes you for losing, stalling your progress. I recommend not grinding receptions and instead installing a mod that gives you 99x books and cards. The game does not respect your time at all.

- The story is underwhelming for about 80% of the game, except for the finale and ending. The game has a boring loop where you meet new characters, get to know them and some slight worldbuilding, and then they go into the library and die. Roland says some quirky stuff, and you do it again like 50 times. The characters get zero development because they will die, making them all bland and uninteresting, making the game a drag and unrewarding.

- The game has RNG on top of RNG. Getting cards in your hand is random, your attack speed is random, your chance to damage the enemy and not lose HP is random, and there are almost no options to fix it. This leads to the last few stages forcing you to read guides, redo the entire deck to cheese (which kills the purpose of the deckbuilding aspect), and restart a lot. Most enemies are not hard, but they will simply outdice you 70% of the time and call it a difficulty as some cheap joke.

On the plus side, the game has a good story when you finally get there after hours, and the soundtrack is straight up insane in how good it is. It ranges from bosses to basic fights, and you even literally losing.

Overall, if you want to dive into this game, I suggest looking up guides and not grinding books without mods like a moron. This way a game will be a way better experience for you.",1686170721,1686170721,True,3,0,0.426893621683120728,0,True,False,False

The combat is turn based but with an extra spin to it.

Now for my favorite part, the Progression.
You don't level up like a traditional RPG, instead when you fight and win you take almost everything from the enemy in its entirety. This includes (Skills, Combat Abilities and Stats).
You can even mix and match your favorite aspects of a person to an extent.

Graphics were really well done as well, adding to the feel of the city. Had a ton of fun customizing the librarians and giving callbacks to some of my employees that survived the first game.

That said, I can't recommend just due to the story. Light spoiler warning (nothing specific), but Lobotomy Corporation was about an awful person in an awful world trying desperately to do one thing right before the end. Library of Ruina is a story about two awful people in an awful world going out of their way to make things worse for everyone else while then talking about how it is the fault of their victims for... existing, pretty much. That, and forming human bonds with one another. Or not forming human bonds in some cases. The justifications aren't great. 

Wanted to like the game because of how much I loved Lobotomy Corp, but I really couldn't. This is all personal opinion of course. I'm sure plenty of people loved the game, but the frankly pointless cruelty really didn't sit well with me. I've played a lot of other bad guy games that pulled similar things off well, but this game just never seemed to approach those situations with much nuance.

The gameplay is extremely fun and well thought out as I really have no major complaints, only flaw is how much info you need to learn at the beginning as the game is pretty complex and the start is slow but once you get to the middle part of the game you just won't stop no matter how tough the fights are.

Way to much time is spent menuing and switching around cards and sheets. If you do not constantly rearrange your teams' loadout, you will find it very difficult to make any progress. It a very tedious process.

The variety of mechanics and builds really made the game interesting, though there was one glaring issue in terms of said mechanics.  It felt like the enemies you faced got to experience all these fun and flashy mechanics, while you as the player sat there and witnessed it all thinking to yourself 'Wow that would be really awesome If I could do that.'  So I find it really strange that you put really fun aspects in the game that the computer gets to enjoy, but the players don't really get to.  Like this game would be the best game of the year for me hands down if it just switched 2 things.  1, remove librarian assistants and make it so that actual librarians are super strong.  You play as 1 character, you as the player get to use all the really cool mechanics and have all the really cool E.G.O's without having to 'meet' the requirements and have it so that the fixers and different nests come to the library and then you as the librarian recieving them, get to feel super powerful while you figure out how to last against the multiple enemies against you alone.  That would make it so that you wouldn't need as many books in the game to outfit like 45 librarians and librarian assistance, also it would make it so you would spend way less time in the menus and more time playing the game, and lastly it would make it so that the PLAYERS can enjoy all the mechanics and flashy builds not the COMPUTER.  And then number 2, since you would be a solo librarian against a mass amount of fixers in each encounter, the equipment slots should be something that can be earned either in the actual E.G.O challenges and grant dice power stats so that you can match up in a 1v4 or 1v5, or earned in combat normally on top of getting pages for your deck.  Either way it would make it way more fun, way less convoluded in terms of sheer amount of pages and books to sort through because oyu would only need to outfit like 8 librarians instead of 40, and it would allow the players to really enjoy the games creative mechanics and combat.  Not to mention it would really give a sense of those 1v1 battles and how epic they are when you come to face a Colour, because throughout the entire game its been 1v4, 1v5, on multiple floors, but then you face a Colour and things change its a 1v1.  Would be epic as hell.  Anyways sorry for the long speel.  But this game is really fun, has relaly cool aspects, just with a tweak or two, it could become 'lightning in a bottle', as opposed to just a 'great game'.",1683730590,1683730590,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is also highly innovative, with each stage and every enemy designed in a unique way that will challenge how you build your team and deck. Although it takes a little time to actually learn the mechanics (I still can't quite say I fully understand how every part of the system works even tho I've fully beaten the game), it is a very innovative system that puts your strategic thinking to the test.

Pros
-Excellent nuanced battle system. Incredibly complex & interesting down to its core, akin to oldschool Combat Puzzlers like Sonny 1/2 
-Well paced story and gameplay
-Consistently increasing difficulty curve. Most games stop at the point at which players would have to replay a fight 1-2 times. LoR laughs and has you consistently challenged throughout the entire experience.
-Incredibly well written story & world. When a story can make your heart sink with just a number, you know its well written. (724,284 days)
-Excellent, interesting, and quirky characters. This ties into how well written it is, but I just wanna outline it again.
-Loads of diverse builds and strategies, with character customization options not seen elsewhere
-Large amount of content. Even without going for 100% completion, this game can easily take upwards of 50-60 hours to complete. I've put 100 hours into 100% completion, and I'm on the last fight.

Cons
-Does have some tutorialization issues. Most of the first few battles are just coming to grips with the system, which could be eased by some better tutorials. Not a major gripe, as its still easy enough to get into once you understand it.
-Long fights can wear at your patience. While the combat system is interesting and nuanced, some of the longer fights can take upwards of an hour or more to complete, simply because spending the time to think out your move correctly adds up.
-The way books & keypages work can be asinine at times when it comes to progressing. This is my only real gripe about the game. Using a booster-pack system is interesting for the first half of the game, but when books are the booster packs, and you get them in limited quantities, AND they're required for progression, it can often force you to redo fights that you shouldn't necessarily have to. This becomes a massive problem when you are missing books from several battles prior, and thus have to redo an entire string of battles in order to be able to progress again. This compounds with how hard some fights are to make progression frustrating at times for no apparent reason.

Despite the cons presented, this is one of the few games in my opinion that is actually worth it at full price, and I HEARTILY recommend it despite its few flaws. My only wish aside from fixing the progression issue would be to just add more cards into the game to expand deck-building even further.

Outside from a few fights ([spoiler]Keter realization[/spoiler]) I thought that it was mostly fair once I understood the combat really well. The story I found to be pretty great and I don't really care about the story in games but this game is an exception. It's not perfect, it's the only video game card game that i really ever played. But I still love this game. One of my favorite games of all time.

Long game. Great Story. Go Play Lobotomy Corp (On Steam) first. Be aware, this game starts out pretty easy, but it gets pretty damn hard. Those looking for a challenge (albeit with cards and strategy vs mechanics and reaction speed), look no further.

+ Card variation and deck building goes hard. So many different variations and so many useful clever ways of using old and new ones (although, you'll most likely use the new ones as you progress)
+ Great Story, this time fully voiced*
 *[spoiler]In Korean[/spoiler]
+ Voice acting is good
+ Music is exceptionally good


- Intimidating at first. And even more intimidating as you progress with all the decks you can build, and all the ones you'll end up building that will outright fail (and others that will somehow succeed). The grind isn't always so fun when you get stuck on a stage
- Speaking of grind, you'll need certain cards to progress to certain stages. The game will tell you this. What you'll forget is you'll finally get to a stage where you needed x card, die, lose x card, have to go back to previous stages, and grind for it.
- RNG plays a huge role in not only the battles, but the grind. Good news is as long as you're preparing and doing some generally very mild number calculations (usually by just looking at them. With your eyes), then you'll succeed (most of the time)

I really recommend this game if you love world building, it has some of my favorite world building in any game I ever played, It has so much lore for small things that just make the world feel more real. The story itself is also really great, It has multiple storylines that I really enjoyed and made me love the game even more.

I also really liked the gameplay, Its a really deckbuilding game that was pretty difficult with some difficulty spikes. (Not a big fan of the games random difficulty through the game) I really like how each floor you can use to fight in the game has their own strategy that you can build your decks around, its just really fun to build decks and deal like 120 bleed or 98 burn in a single scene. Roland's ass is also concave so that kind of sucks but I can manage with that. The music of the game, with some of the major tracks being made by Mili is very good and I listen to it often i just love this games music. My biggest complaint with the game is that I wasn't too big a fan of the pacing, I found it hard to consistently play at some points but at certain points through the game and once you're somewhat close to the end of the game its really good with its pacing and its hard not to play.

Finally, I really liked the games ending, It almost made me cry and I'm really exited to see what other things Project Moon will be making (Other than Limbus Company). Final notes would be <3 Binah and <3 Gebura, game may make you want to read old literature, and we DON'T talk about love town.

The story continues, but the gameplay, while the progress stays similar, is completely different.
This ain't your 2D management game, this is the result of blackjack having a child with a gacha style turn based massacre simulator.

As with lobotomy corp, brace for some dark topics and questionable morality.
The game starts slowly, but before long the difficulty curve becomes vertical, so buckle your britches bitches.

I recommend this game, but with a warning.
This game, and it's predecessor, are not Skittles, but jawbreakers.
You'll have something to chew on for a WHILE, given you have the guts to keep moving and the brains to solve problems.

Man, i know the whole asian gamer tag memes, but damn do the koreans have a thing for difficult games.
Oh yeah, the soundtrack fucking slaps, the story's decently deep and touches on some very real issues, the gameplay isn't the usual piss easy baby shit i sleepwalk through.
This game keeps your mind engaged, and really gives you challenges.

Every fight from mid urban plague will be a tough nut to crack, but OH MAN is that feeling of success one helluva kick.

LoR is all sorts of crazy, but the writing is surprisingly good, and the worldbuilding therein is some of the best I've ever seen. I didn't really run into the vertical difficulty spikes, but this game does ask you to pay attention to several things at once during it's combat phases. This is a game that requires a lot of patience, reading, and an ability to change your strategies every once in a while. Don't let warnings of cruel difficulty dissuade you from trying it out. The community for this game is extremely helpful, and there are a lot of guides for the game that will make the experience easier for people who struggle with deck builders.

Just...give this a shot man. I know a lot of users complain about the difficulty spike being vertical but imo it's really not until the very very very end of the game. If you can read well and think things through decently you should be more than fine. 

Keeping it short and sweet, it's one of the most engaging RPGs I've played mechanically and I have fallen completely in love with the universe, story, characters, and music Project Moon has created. I would suggest getting at least some background knowledge of Lobotomy Corporation prior (which does actually have a vertical difficulty spike) but you can definitely play it without that.

10/10 would recommend - as long as you're willing to do some reading and thinking.

Library of Ruina is not a conventional deckbuilding game, but is rather its own little thing. It's a mixture of turn-based strategy as well. It is a decently difficult game, and comes with a degree of complexity--sometimes battles can look downright incomprehensible considering how many cards are being played at a time. Good play is also not dependent on luck, but allows the player to basically force the hand of fate given a proper setup--this can apply to page draw and clashing dice itself, both key parts of the game. The game is also not terribly imbalanced--though some floors do have more upsides compared to others. Every 'floor' is built around a certain playstyle, and there is a sizeable amount of them, enabling players to really be able to play in a style they like.

Project Moon's world-building is once again incredible, and Ruina's story is pretty compelling, building off of Lob Corp without really needing a full knowledge of Lob Corp's plot. I would argue that some receptions have such good storylines that it is basically required to read the pre-battle cutscenes beforehand.

I played Library of Ruina and I'm pretty much the Roland but in real life, so I decided to try out things he did to make friends and get my life back on track. I started by making a credenza (like in the game) and writing down my patron Librarians. I act aloof and mysterious like Roland and started wearing a black suit around when I'm outside (I bought a pair of black gloves.) I'm pretty far in my dialogue with the girls in the apartment next door, probably at level 3 or 4 with both of them. I starting talking to them about self improvement too (like in the game) to let them know I was preparing for the realization. (I know in the game if you don't realize everyone it's bad but I have until the ensemble to figure that situation out). Discord servers are like general invitations, where I can dive in and fight people until I book their worldview and that server. That's like the character pages in the game and I keep track of that too. When I get 100% I think I'll be able to passively attribute them.

Listening to someone who's enjoyed this game talk about it probably gives a similar feeling someone excitedly rattling off about a life-changingly intense TTRPG finale they just played. You can tell that they loved it, but to really comprehend why, you had to be there.

Extending that analogy, Project Moon is their indescribably passionate GM, and Library of Ruina is a stack of love-letter payoffs to every drop of investment their players gave to Lobotomy Corporation. It's not necessary to have played the first game to enjoy Ruina--it's fun, explains the context of its own story well enough, and its strongest story beats are uniquely its own content. But there are so many fulfilling moments of continuity that, once again, makes it feel like every slow-going session you've had with this GM evolved into something incredible, unique, and dense with acknowledgements of every little detail you remember.

It's not a perfect game, but it's one that I love for much more than what I can rate individually for a countless number of reasons, and I still think about its story on a daily basis after finishing it. It's an investment of time and attention for sure, but once the incredibly fascinating worldbuilding of The City's setting hooks you--once the vast amount of art and music and subtext that breathes each character to life piques your interest--once you hear that first Mili song--it doesn't seem to ever let go of you again.",1682200128,1682200128,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

the strategy behind the gameplay is smart and succint, it's probably the only card game in existence that actually gets my blood pumping owing to the high intensity and presentation of the battles in the game. there's arguably some amount of grinding but I'd argue that's only truly the case if you constantly lose and screw up, I can see how some people might get filtered by the gameplay here but pretty much all of that can be avoided so long as you use your brain and just take it slow to think every action through so you actually win. don't be a prudencelet.",1679518527,1681806925,True,29,0,0.675066709518432617,0,True,False,False

Will say, people coming new into the game should definitely start off with lobotomy corp, so that the plot makes more sense but it's honestly not really necessary. As someone who went into LoR blind, the world building to it is really good, customization of your nuggets (the library assistants) is fun, and the game's challenging enough to where it's enjoyable to play.

Also this isn't one of those games where you can just plug and chug through it, decks have to be specifically tailored to certain fights late game, and understanding the mechanics for the game is something that is fundamentally required to make it to end game.

[/strike] its was a struggle to decide a good or bad review, but this game have so much potential and good story and i hope developer can do better next game so i decide to leave a good review. [/strike]

tldr story and music is best, but poor gameplay progression design .

without spoiler story start with is there's 1 library contain any book anyone wish for, to obtain the book one must fight for it, you as librarians have to kill everyone come for books, and when guest killed they become book to add in library book collection.

the story itself is good in term of detail lore, background world expansion, if you like darkness/twisted plot you will like it.

the bgm have it unique style which sync with different atmosphere from relax chitchat to intense boss fight.

and here comes the gameplay:
the early 20% you feel the game was amazing, the mechanic is fresh and challenging, its feel satisfaction when you win the fight by making the right move

and then enemy card getting stronger with not reasonable scale, powercreep until you lose the battle not because you bad on it, but you lack of the new card which overall stat is stronger than your current card, and the way you get the stonger card is by grinding the latest battle which you lose but you get some new card if you kill some of enemy in the battle. each combat card is unique on its own and no crafting on this game so no way you can make your old card help on new battle, thus you just waste your time grind on cards then win the current battle then few battle later you have to grind again for newer card and your previous grind mean nothing. Also the story progression is you unlock new stage by using book you get from previous page, when you lose then you lost the page, so if you just won a tough fight and your next fight is tough then you lose which mean you have to go through previous fight again, and no auto battle which mean you have to manual grind tough battle again every time.

i manage to normal progress until star of the city and i just cant take the grind anymore so i find some cheat mod and clear the rest because i really like the story and already is a fans. i hope developer can do better next game with better explanation tutorial, better progression and leveling design.",1674376338,1681708086,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

I came into this thinking it was a Slay the Spire wannabe and found myself getting emotionally amputated by the sheer number of people who I barely know experiencing a torture where physical death is a relief. With footsteps light, I tread forth on this marshy terrain that threatens to drag me under the muck. The walls where I must climb to venture beyond was filled with flowering vine. Perhaps a beauty of sorrow or perhaps a writhing thorn. I must applaud the trials of before and mourned for mine existence at the tribulations of the end. Can't say I regret, but can say that the journey took all from my being. A rugged road where the bumps can seem unimaginable, but the leeway has always been there. The afterglow of another star brought me hither, the hopeful light of fascination from another rising star held me in prison. I beg not of a chance anew to venture again, but to relive the interactions between characters and peer into the windows with which they viewed the world. It stabs you in the side with a thorn that one can't help itch. It eventually becomes a part of oneself, consuming one's sanity. With this final note, I leave remarks, onward to a new journey with a multitude of depravity on a dingy raft through the sea of suffering.

This is my favorite game of all time. It's a complete single-player experience from an indie-developer that offers over 100 hours worth of story and gameplay, without any steam workshop mods that add more replay ability. The story is very grim and dark but so compelling in how the game presents the world and characters.

The official soundtrack by Mili, and the in-game BGM by Studio EIM (each Librarian has their own theme song, by the way, which gets more intense as the battle progresses) are way too good, they use the music as part of the story telling narrative and the moment when you go into the boss fight and one of the songs from the soundtrack, it feels incredible.

This game is hard. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ challenging, and I'm an avid card game player and the mechanics (often time, puzzle fights) are really interesting and novel. Every single Realization Fight is a Puzzle that is based on the lore of the enemy that you're going against, and the fights are well thought out, even if they are unfair or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times. There are guides and information resources online if you ever need help, but the fights are challenging nonetheless. There are also some noteworthy QoL mods on the workshop such as No Grind, which is excellent in avoiding redundant fights just to farm for cards.

I started this game without playing their previous title, Lobotomy Corporation, which the story in Library of Ruina continues from. You can play this without LobCorp but I watched the story of LobCorp on Youtube and it made me appreciate Library of Ruina much more. The Project Moon Universe that they have built up since LobCorp, Library of Ruina and now onto their 3rd game Limbus Company is one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had, and I look forward to what they have planned.

It's a fun game, but I can't recommend it. The gaming experience has been purposefully made awful.
As pointed out by many, it becomes hard in the later stage of the game, which is fine. Ideally, you lose, go back to the drawing board, and try again - but not in this game. You'd have to go back and grind, may as well for hours, before you can even try again - that completely broke the rhythm and ruined the experience for me. hard games and grinding are usually not an issue for me, I lost the appetite at some point for this game.

Don't let the reviews about difficulty put you off.

That being said, if you're looking for something mindless and relaxing then this game probably isn't for you.

The battle system is pretty complex. Each level generally requires you to adapt, improvise and overcome, and you sometimes need to really think outside the box for the abnormality battles. However, I don't find this to be a bad thing. Battles make you carefully think about your strategy, so when you win you feel like a real genius god tactician. Good fun. I wanna scream whenever I lose a 20min+ battle tho

The characters and world building are top tier - Project Moon never misses. You kinda need to be familiar with the events of Lobotomy Corporation if you want the best experience, though.

Library of Ruina is a masterclass at world and character building. I have never been so intrigued about a setting and it's inhabitants before, I want to know more about it, I want to meet more of the people who live there and see their stories unfold like with the guests we receive throughout the game. I was amazed how much I would care for some of those who we fight in the Library. SPOILERS: [spoiler] Seeing (and feeling) Lulu's wrath and anger at the loss of Mars, watching Phillip almost overcome his inner anguish only to be snuffed out by Oswald & Pluto causing him to distort, the horrors aboard the WARP Train with Tommy and Merry, discovering the mysteries of the Prescripts and watching Yan despair at his lack of free will, Xiao refusing to let her flame be snuffed out and manifesting E.G.O as well as hearing all the philosophies of the Reverberation Ensemble through their fights and logs. 

However my favourite aspects of the story were the Librarians, specifically my favourite character in the entire game, Roland. From the second the game started, I loved Roland's character. He always felt down to earth, believable, like what I was reading wasn't text created for a character but what a person would actually respond. For example some concepts other Librarians try to convey to him go over his head as while Roland is smarter than most it doesn't mean he understands everything, he's a lot more literal than philosophical. It's a nice trait for him to have it makes him so much more human.
Roland was the character I felt the most for emotionally in the story, it was clear early on to me he was much more than he let on, little hints here and there like his little smirk in combat like if wanted to (and he could) he'd crush the opposition in an instant, but I never could have predicted what Roland's actual intentions were and upon the full reveal of his story I felt for him, even while fighting him you feel his endless hatred for The City that took his wife, it's almost enough to make you hold back and let him win. [/spoiler]

The gameplay of Library of Ruina is a deck building RPG like you've heard many a time akinned to Slay the Spire, the back-and-forth between you and your opponents is honestly a joy to watch and can get very tense at times, some of my favourite moments in fights were barely scraping by with less than 10 health on bosses that had killed me multiple times. 
As you kill enemies and collect their books to turn into their pages to gain their moves and abilities, I like how this fits seamlessly into the story of the game, you're building the library and using the knowledge gained from guests to receive more guests more effectively, it's a nice system and you get a glimpse of story from them too, a nice touch. The sheet amount of key and combat pages allow for quite a lot of build diversity and damn near endless customisation with some pretty silly builds, looking at you Rapid Gnashes clone.

One of the biggest issues I had was my initial understanding of the game since the tutorials aren't exactly clear, the game explains what things are very well but doesn't really tell you how to use them. After a few hours you get the hang of it but I feel like poor explanation may be a barrier to entry for some people.
My other big problem is while the game allows a lot of build diversity, if you want to beat some of the harder fights you'll likely be locked to around 5-8 key pages to reliably win. Balancing feels a little too off with plenty of pages being to weak to use and others being way too strong to ignore, same with different floors of the Library with the biggest offender of this being [spoiler] Gebura, I really shouldn't be able to solo the entire Reverberation Ensemble Distorted with a single character. [/spoiler] 

Anyways, that's enough of me gushing about how cool Roland is, hit me up at the HamHamPangPang for a free sick meat stew.

Finally, the only thing that might beat the other aspects of the game is the phenomenal music: a perfect blend of intense orchestral parts, electronic embellishments, and Mili.

Mechanically, this game is very crunchy and there are a lot of moving parts that all somehow mesh really well to deliver a very thrilling and deep combat system. At its most basic level, it's a tactical turn-based deck builder. Rounds of combat are divided into a planning phase and an action phase. During the planning phase, you're told what action every enemy is going to perform and then you pick the actions of your party members to intercept and/or counter those actions. Then you hit play and everything plays out in a sort of initiative order.

As for the story, you're in the eponymous Library of Ruina, rising from the ruins of LoR's prequel, the Lobotomy Corporation. It exists inside of The City which is about the size of Africa and is a nightmare dystopia hell-scape of competing companies, gangs, mercenaries, and monsters. Mad science abounds. 
The Library contains books that possess knowledge. Guests are people that have been invited to the library, lured in by that knowledge. You command the Librarians, who test whether or not Guests are worthy of gaining that knowledge (through the universal language of Violence). Defeated guests become books and are added to the library's collection, which lures in more powerful guests. 
The setting and premise are very interesting and it paints a dreadful picture of everything that goes on in the city.

The art took some getting used to but it definitely grew on me as I continued playing. The soundtrack is excellent.

I'm going to recommend this game, but there's some things I have to tell you:
1) The game is hard as hell. Look up Library of Ruina difficulty spike is vertical.
2) The game is long as hell. My playthrough was 128 hours which is about average.

Although there are also some negatives there;
-The tutorial is just some basic instructions at Best. It took me 50h to properly understand that what the hell I'm actually doing. 
-They removed the grinding, which in turn has put a hard cap on how strong you can get before progressing the story, which means you actually have to be good at the game to beat the game and can't just power through it with sheer grind. but at the same time, it will make repetitive fights unrewarding. I liked the grind in this game. such a shame.
-The UI is confusing and I can see that it could have been done better. The main focus in this game is “Building better pages” and not at all on the characters. the characters are basically  just manikins and the pages can be easily moved between them. This fact took me a long time to understand and it made my game so much easier. (Making the character's appearance customizable while not letting the player to customize the page’s appearance did help Alot to lead me away from this fact btw). I keep moving the pages between the characters while the character looks still the same. Then I have to change the looks again manually to not confuse my sniper with my tank in the middle of the fight. A Very annoying design.
Thank you for your great game nonetheless. I can now understand why some people hate your new gatcha game despite it being quite decent. Apparently, The limbus company is nowhere as mechanically interesting as this one atm. These are some big shoes to fill in. [/strike]

Edit:
At this point, the amount of subjective love I have for this game is beyond the threshold that I would find convenient for myself to write any objective critique.
this game has been for me, what I would maybe call, a flash of inspiration. putting the innovative gameplay aside (which is in fact, something criminal to do compared to what this game actually deserves in any proper review), this game and the philosophical subject it tries to imply, has resonated with me greatly and has made me ponder on stuff which I've not done so in some time. I'll probably edit this review again to add my take on whether what Library Of Ruina is ethically trying to imply in its stories later, as as of now I've yet to finish the game's story (120h btw), and I’ll do so mainly for myself to have these stuff somewhere which it’s not easily lost. but yea, good game.",1678544681,1678910416,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,0,True,False,False

Sure Project Moon sucks at explaining mechanics and the people that work there are absolute sadists, but luckily for me I am myself a huge masochist. If you don't like getting stomped in the balls over and over by big women (and sometimes men) just buy Inscryption or something. But if you're like me and embrace the pain then buy it right now. It also goes on sale a lot so it's a pretty damn good deal.
Also the story slaps. I obviously won't spoil anything but trust me it goes hard.

First look at the UI is intimidating. If your trying to figure out what happened to all the ""cards"" you just equipped when you click a different equip button on a different equip menu. Don't worry you're hopefully at the beginning of the game you should find it again quickly so hopefully it wasn't too much of a setback, and get used to using filters.

Combat, Not as RNG as some people make it out to be, but as someone with previous experiences with similar card games, 
I will say new and somewhat experienced players with no/some experience in card games like these will probably run into some common/uncommon mistakes over and over again, especially since RNG is a factor and could hence be used as a crutch for blaming losses on. Not all the time, but sometimes. So if your wondering why your losing a battle over and over again, blame it on the dice rolls last. Because if you do it first, you'll probably be wasting time, and you'll end up putting over 100hrs into a single playthrough.

Side note: Shimmering really messes up the enemy sometimes, it's pretty funny.

Difficulty, Many people will say the ""difficulty spike is vertical."" Assume that they are correct, don't take it from me, I'm one of those professional assholes when it comes to card games who brings out Exodia on the first turn. 
So you can stop reading the review if you want.
Campaign only:
For the first, I'd say 12-ish campaign levels, you could probably get away with playing using your forehead.
After that you'll probably be around where you need some minor brain usage. 
The next 8-levels, ""2 in particular"" may be problematic if you have no ""special"" cards, but you don't have to have them.
The next 8-levels after that. Are arguably problematic if you don't have ""special"" cards, but 5 out 8 of them are an absolute cakewalk when you have the right ones. There was 1 of these 8 levels that probably fall under the ""vertical spike category""  Cause it really did stand out from the bunch. 
The next 6 levels you can treat as the previous 8, there shouldn't be much of a difference between them. Except for one, It's around here I believe where the enemy card menu doesn't really show ""ALL"" the cards that they may have at the start of the encounter.
The next four levels, whoo, really mark the ""spike"" of the campaign curve.
The next four levels, and maybe the last four for some people, are at their point in the game, hard, but also very fun depending on your skill level I guess.
Reaching the concluding campaign levels, the first two are laughable.
Reaching the uninvited campaign levels are pretty much what you would expect for the conclusion to what is hard game. Hard levels, Hard conclusion, Hard final bosses.
If the previous final bosses were not the final bosses; then, you reach the intended final boss, which is even more final than the other final bosses because now you've reached the actual final boss of the LORE. Perhaps harder than the previous level, but less planning will likely be needed.
If this final boss wasn't the final boss; then, you've reached the final bosses before the actual final boss who is now fighting the more final versions of the final bosses in clustered groups to make it harder yet quicker at the same time. Think of these like the secret bosses of the game, so you can expect these fights to be the hardest, probably, unless you have trouble with particular ""other levels"" that I won't be mentioning because you could technically take those whenever you want.
Speaking of said other levels, for those who have had them beaten and all the campaign levels beaten up to this point, the game should be easy now, so i'm not mentioning the difficulty of the last couple of levels, because they should hopefully be only moderately difficult at this point.

Just look up a story guide to learn the lore and move on to the next one. Never before have I seen a game that disrespects its players this much, which is a shame because the first Project Moon game is insanely good

This game features:
-Overpowered boss fights that will drive you crazy. These boss fights are often unlocked before you have the cards and pages that the fights are balanced around. If you do every abnormality battle and realization when you unlock said abnormality battle and realization, you are going to have a miserable time. That is just bad game design
-Level Systems that force you to grind. Every reception requires books to enter. If you run out of those books, you have to go back and play previous missions. If you run out of THOSE books, you have to go replay missions from even earlier on. To make matters worse, these are the same books that you have to burn to get new key pages and combat pages. And they pull randomly from a list. So you could burn a dozen of the books you need and still not get what you want, while also forcing you to go back and grind previous missions if you mess up the next reception. Combine this with unforgiving boss fights that expect you to build around their unique gimmick and you'll be replaying old missions a lot
-Way too many characters. There are 10 floors in this game. Each floor eventually has 5 characters. That means you will either be equipping each one of your 50 characters with weaker equipment or giving powerful equipment to a handful of them and ignoring the rest. Which the game encourages you to do by resource starving you the entire game. You can only obtain one copy of most good key pages, meaning you will have to constantly swap them to whatever team you want these builds on rather than recreate them. On top of that, you use up additional key pages to attribute their abilities to other ones. Which means that giving an employee 1 key page often requires you to use up at least 3. So you need a minimum of 150 acceptable pages, and if you want to not struggle with every fight you need most of those to be unique ones. Which, again, you have to grind for
-Unfun Boss Gauntlets. As you unlock a floor and gain new abnormality pages & librarians, you have to do abnormality boss battles. These range from laughably easy to frustratingly difficult. When you fully unlock a floor, you have to do a floor realization. Which consists of doing those 4 abnormality boss battles (in a row, with only minor healing between fights) followed by a secret 5th one that you haven't seen up until this point. To explain why this is bad, let me talk about the mana system for a bit. You start with a certain amount of light, which is used to pay for cards. Every turn, you gain 1 light. You can also refill light through a few other means, but the most significant of which are emotion levels and light generating cards. Light generating cards are incredibly important to keep your stamina up, but unless you have consistent card draw pages as well it will eventually fail you in longer battles. Emotion levels allow your employees to gain additional max light and fully restore their existing light. Emotion levels are easier to raise early on in missions and will eventually hit their maximum, no longer going up at all in longer battles. So let's say you've struggled for about 10 minutes on each abnormality and have now spent 40 minutes in a single boss fight. Your librarians are low on health, stagger resist, and light with no way to reliably raise any of that. Suddenly, the game throws a 5th powerful threat that you've never seen before, don't know how to fight, and definitely didn't build around as you didn't know it existed. And you have to hope your current resources and build is enough to succeed. If you fail, you have to both redo your entire build to make it fit better and replay that 40+ minute boss fight you just attempted. In my experience, these fights go from fun to ""I'm afraid of losing progress"" too fast for me to have enjoyed any of them

While I will continue to play this game because I am a masochist and I hate myself, I genuinely do not like it and do not recommend it to anybody else. A game that expects you to spend hours rebuilding your teams in between every single mission is a game for people who either need to seriously touch grass or people that follow online guides to the T.

Play Lobotomy Corp instead. That game is amazing. Or Limbus Company, since that one's free",1678353876,1678353876,False,5,1,0.493333339691162109,14,True,False,False

Despite the overall challenge being vertical, a slow pace with an understanding of sacrifice and reading will let you easily push through this game.

And remember that even the negatives gives some amazing positives when used correctly. The real challenge is knowing when to let certain things hit and when to fight, that's the first hurdle that the game truly throws at you.

Each enemy has their own story that the player can associate or find disgust with. As such all the characters feel alive. I'm always invested in the story which is certainly a feat to pull off.

The combay is enjoyable, very enjoyable. it feels very ""Pow pow"" as in everything feels important and intense. whether you're finding out how the enemy decides to attack, your plan and the clashing system offering the most intense moments as you hope that the die rolls in your favor.

The game uses die as its main method of attack, higher numbers = better outcome in a clash. This technically makes the combat RNG based but some builds can help you tank through the unlucky moments and strike through will willpower. Making the game intense but not unfair by any means.

You don't need to play the prequel to understand the sequel, its actually the opposite here. This game gives more insight into Lobotomy Corporation's ending and I love how this reverse method of introducing information was executed as it helps cover up holes of the last game while making more for this game; which is resolved outside of game media if games aren't your Forte. Studio moon has a very interesting sci-fi / dystopian setting that I never thought I would've liked and nothing I would've expected as a sequel to Lobotomy corp. 

The combat is fun, the story is interesting and the game as a whole is well worth its price. there is replay value if you like testing builds too, so the fun doesn't end.

mods? I haven't tried any.

I highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a nice story but doesn't want to endure the challenge of Lobotomy corporation. Or people who just dislike the genre of the first game or can't play it. Again, it's not required to understand the story here.

The story takes place in a fantasy world where your ego can form concretely and manifest your body. And we call that phenomenal ""distortion"". You can use it as a weapon. However, using your whole identity as a weapon will have consequences. Exposing your mind like that could make you lose your mind. In this game, you have to help Angela, the Artificial Intelligent main character from the previous game collect the book by making the invitation to guests and turning them into books by physical force to extract their memories. And gain one perfect book to answer the question of her life and become a human. In story contain some disturbing content such as gore, cannibalism, and social problem so if you like this kind of horror story this game is for you.

For gameplay Before the fight, you can make a deck with 9 cards and customize the passive using resources you collected during the game for each unit you are playing. And in the fight, there are many components that you need to be concerned about for instant stagger resistance. If it reaches 0 you will immobilize the next turn, passive and condition of the opponents, recover the energy that you use to play cards, use speed to redirect the incoming attack, etc. This is more than just press skill than getting buff that normal turn-based would be.

With all that, the gameplay is exciting to play. It is rare to see turn-based games that have complex mechanics like this. However, due to the mechanical complexity, the difficulty is increasing drastically. And that makes late content very hard to play and time-consuming. 
In some fights, I have to spend 1-2 hours to pass through them. Also, to enter the fight you must use the book you get from the previous fight. If you are defeated you will lose them. So you have to go back to the previous level to get the book which is very annoying to do considering the difficulty of each level.

Animation and sound effects used in combat are good and satisfying. you can get very cool combat animation in the form of  2.5 Dimensions with proper light and also the sound of blades clashing and the impact sound realistic and suited for each combat.

The song used in this game is from Mili. Mili has a very unique style of using notes and beat for example using beat in a Chinese theme song and her sound is very angelic. I had the opportunity to listen to it before the game's release because I am a Mili fan myself.
The theme song published by her is astonishing. And I like how I can interpret her songs in 2 different ways. Depending on what context you perceive it.

If you have never played the game, it is quite hard to interpret the song. you will eventually get the meaning of the song in a real-world context. But if you listen to the song in the game you will get different feelings. Most of the lyrics in the song are directly related to the character during the story. The experience of realizing the true meaning of the song is very satisfying for me. 

For instance, in the Iron lotus song by Mili,  if you listen to it for the first time you know that someone loses her lover in some incident and talks about her regret. After you play the game you will know more stories of one director name Xiao who dispatch to take one book from our library. Most of her colleagues including her beloved one have turned into a book by us and she is only a few that escaped. so once again she comes back to seek her revenge manifesting her ego to burn us down using her everything as fuel and fighting us until the end of her life. like the lyric “I am the fire. Burn all who dare to care for me. And my fuels are memories,  fuels are memories of you…” as you can see that the lyric is related to and amplify the feeling we get during the fight in the story and there is more which I really impressed by this art.

In conclusion, I recommend you try this game. the gameplay is unique with some horror stories and interesting stories with good quality theme songs from MIli. May you find your book in this place And I hope you enjoy this game as I did.

It touches upon subjects as profound and thought-provoking as free-will, vengeance and forgiveness of self and others with an incredible amount of depth, nuance and emotion, often times showing multiple perspectives on a single topic such that it never patronizes the player.


Both the gameplay and story contribute to this idea of living in such a cruel world, fighting against systems established beyond one's control, dictating virtually every aspect of life. The setting of the world, simply dubbed ""The City,"" is a cruel and unjust place, yet people live in it, building lives and families. The gameplay can seem difficult and random, yet players have thrived within its systems, creating powerful builds and tricks to beat the game's most difficult challenges.


This mesh of both gameplay and story funnels down from this grandiose theme all the way to minor battles and story beats and is unlike anything I've ever seen. The level select for the main story is itself a flow chart of various groups and peoples, showing the sonder that exists within The City. The mechanics of every battle, down to individual passives that enemies have, especially the Abnormalities, accentuate the richness of the lives and stories behind the battles.


Every character in Ruina struggles with breaking free from these systems, these cycles of almost unsurmountable proportions. And the player gets to witness how they fail, live with and persevere through this world. It makes for what feels like a complete and fulfilling experience, even when realistically Project Moon has shown a fraction of the City and its potential as a fictional setting.

You'd have to go back and grind, may as well for hours, before you can even try again - that completely broke the rhythm and ruined the experience for me. hard games and grinding are usually not an issue for me, I lost the appetite at some point for this game.",1678197273,1678197273,False,62,25,0.571987032890319824,0,True,False,False

I expected to like this game but not nearly to the extent that I found myself enjoying it. The story is actually fucking peak and the gameplay is fun as hell. The difficulty spikes may be vertical but it still feels fair. I love project moon. Unfortunately no other game is capable of filling the hole that this game left in my soul, even Limbus Company, which I do enjoy, lacks the complexities of Ruina's combat. Limbus unfortunately is not going to top Ruina unless the combat becomes significantly more complex which I can't really see happening as it is a gacha. If there's a game I wish I could re-experience wholly again it would be this one. Try to avoid spoilers as much as possible when it comes to this game, but I recommend reaching out to the community on how to deal with some of the roadblocks the game throws at you because the game is pretty difficult. Also, I recommend playing/experiencing the story of Lobotomy Corporation first, as this game heavily builds off of what that game established. It is possible to play this game first, but it spoils a lot of the first game, and I think Lobotomy Corporation's story is also amazing. It sucks that I didn't play that game and watched the story before jumping to this game, because I kinda regret not playing Lobotomy Corporation first now. I finished Ruina before Limbus' release because of that, but I still regret it. I'll still go back and play Lobotomy relatively soon.

I can't recommend it if you aren't willing or unable to dedicate a few minutes to understand mechanics, do watch the story if you're interested though it's really good!

If you are coming in with no backstory, understand this is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation and find a synopsis of the plot to start yourself with some familiarity. It's not 'required' knowledge, but it enhances a lot of the stuff along the way.

The best way I can describe LoR is that it's a beautifully designed masterpiece of meshing board game mechanics with video game puzzle'ry and Anime story. As soon as you 'figure out' how to cheese a mechanic, they add more, or make something immune to your plan etc. There are some 'broken' combinations but I would recommend not searching any out until you've really hit your frustration limit. Sprinkle in some truly 'Black Mirror' level surprises and you've started down the road that is LoR. 

The only warning I'll give is that toward the end the sheer number of 'things' you have to pay attention to can get overwhelming. Sometimes you can muscle through and sometimes RNG will punish you for not optimizing every roll. If that will be too frustrating than this might not be the perfect choice for you, otherwise nothing but the strongest recommend from me!",1677398224,1677440913,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting off this game is the sequel to Lobotomy corporation, one of my all time favorite games, and while the game play is vastly different its still fun using dice rolls and RNG to defeat opponents from a card deck you create yourself, so far the story is really captivating and I hope to spend endless hours playing. Overall I would recommend, it is a tad bit hard to understand the controls or what even is happening at first but once you get it, it just clicks and it's fun, enough said.

[h3]Technical Issues and Performance[/h3]
I have not encountered any crashes or significant lag while playing the campaign or custom receptions. There have been, however, a variety of smaller bugs that kept cropping up. The most obnoxious of which is the dysfunctional advanced search, which I am sure added up to an hour to my playtime due to frequent deck restructuring being such a significant part of the game. I have also experienced lingering card effects, enemies not properly despawning, and audio issues.

[h3]Graphics and Sound[/h3]
Whereas Lobotomy Corporation was fairly minimalist, LoR makes its greater budget known through a myriad of unique CGs during most visual novel sections. It maintains its unique stylized look that meshes well with the esoteric setting of the story and is further supported by an amazing music score that manages to hook into bigger story beats through well-written boss tracks. The overall presentation is frankly flawless, even if some of the more grotesque themes may be off-putting to some players.

[h3]Gameplay and ‘Vertical Difficulty’[/h3]
LoR features an abundance of interlocking combat mechanics that still manage to come together in a coherent gameplay loop. The basic idea is that each character has a certain number of speed dice available. Those double as both a determinant for the turn order as well as slots for cards to play. There are a wide array of card archetypes available, ranging from burn to bleed to discard and more. A single character can only hold up to nine cards, which serves beginners in the genre quite well due to the overall consistency such a small deck provides. Thus, experimenting with different setups can feel quite rewarding. 

During combat, cards are played against each other, resulting in clashes where more dice are rolled to determine block and attack values. While this does introduce a level of randomness, it seldom feels as if your success is based on luck due to the influence character- and deckbuilding have over the dice results. That being said, besides regular receptions, there are also abnormality battles and floor realizations against returning monstrosities from Lobotomy Corporation. These represent encounters that are more gimmick and puzzle-oriented and are a bit hit-or-miss. 

There are two issues with the battle system. For the former, regular receptions, it is due to an inherent grindiness. Whenever you defeat an enemy, they drop a book about themselves. This is an item that can be consumed to get that enemy as a playable character, or the cards they used against you. It also doubles as a prerequisite to start the following scenario, which in turn means that if you are defeated, that book is being consumed and needs to be reacquired to get another shot at progressing. While this is not often an issue, it can be frustrating when trying out new decks or hunting for achievements that require very specific scenarios or are otherwise prone to an early reset. This also very much highlights the lack of QoL through the lack of a quick reset function. 

The second part is the Abnormalities. Like I mentioned earlier, they’re mostly gimmick encounters and therefore a lot more susceptible to RNG than regular battles. They are also the source of the often-mentioned ""vertical difficulty curve"", as the Abnormalities from LC often simply don’t work quite as well in a deckbuilding format. Instead, including them feels more like fanservice and a bit of a weight around ProjectMoon’s ankle in terms of their ability to freely design encounters fitting their combat system. 

This culminates in a very awkward final act, where the overall difficulty outpaces the power creep of your available cards. The final act, while narratively limited, can take tens of hours of raw, brutal fighting and has one of the most ridiculous spikes in difficulty I've ever encountered in a game. The difficulty itself is not the issue; it's what this does to the pacing of the ending. That's this, and this is that, but I want to emphasize that this is primarily an issue in the final act, and more specifically, the true end route. Albeit, just like Lobotomy Corporation, there is very little point in pursuing the other endings, effectively making the Abnormality fights mandatory for a proper experience. 

[h3]Story and Setting[/h3]
The game picks up right where LC left off, and while it is not mandatory to have played it to be able to enjoy the story, it’s highly recommended to do so given the wildly exotic setting in which Library of Ruina takes place. The namesake library itself is an immense, supernatural structure that invites guests on the promise of them finding the book they desire at the risk of turning into a book themselves. The surrounding city is a futuristic hellscape in which megacorporations, each holding control over magic-like technology, are contrasted with the quirks of certain districts, such as the prescripts that are given out to follow cryptic and often lethal orders. 

While the overall narrative is very much focused on Angela’s endeavors, the game eventually forks out into four parallel storylines that, due to the nature of the game requiring peripheral progression, might be difficult to follow. Again, the final act is often brought up as falling a bit short of the otherwise fantastic build-up, and I will certainly echo that criticism. Most of all, however, the Library of Ruina provides fantastic world-building and is well worth experiencing for its unique dystopian setting. 

[h3]Final Thoughts[/h3]
It's insane to me how an indie team took the SCP concept and simply sat down to create the best panic simulator I've ever played. Then, years later, they completely flipped the genre and also made the best deckbuilder I have ever played. While Library of Ruina shows some cracks based upon the foundation that Lobotomy Corporation offered and also sometimes struggles with a slightly overdesigned combat system, most issues are either minor or largely confined towards the ending of the game. Despite these flaws, Library of Ruina is well worth experiencing for offering a unique take on both the deckbuilding genre and its vision of a highly esoteric dystopian future.",1676229934,1676229934,True,116,1,0.879348576068878174,2,True,False,False

theres meme and cool youtube videos that are fun to watch as you get further.

as said by everyone (look up videos of it) difficulty curve is vertical but very well made, you can think about it as like how xcom or darksoul teaches you.

modding wise, theres a good amount of great extra stories in the workshop (havent tried it yet) but seen some good ones.
if you plan on modding yourself however, it is not that easy to grasp at first and need quite some help online. however, once you get it working, its really fun, I personaly loved to get my own cards into the game, making the experiance more unique.

As someone who played this without experiencing Lobotomy Corporation, finishing this game left me with more questions than answers, but I'll be damned if its aesthetic wasn't super appealing. A completely dystopian and messed up world where human life is valued (as a resource or even food apparently in some districts) and everything kind of sucks, even for the people who are better off. Not even including the untold abominations and horrors lurking in the City, some man-made, some naturally occurring, and some that are just your fellow man.

There's too much about the world and its lore to even begin to try and review. The gameplay however I can review curtly. Very simple on the surface in early game, becomes radically more complicated and challenging as the game goes on, especially once you get to.. Abnormalities. There's a sharp difficulty curve. Sharp like a knife. Every battle feels fairly unique because every category or group of enemy has their own mechanics and effects with their different decks, decks which for the most part you can take and customize your to tailor to your own desires... whether that helps you in the long-run or not is another question.

To describe its protagonists without getting into spoiler territory, Roland and Angela are very, very peculiar protagonists. A lot of dystopian fantasies I feel have teenage protagonists. Young adults with chips on their shoulders, trying to survive in a messed up world.

Roland is a (seemingly) almost middle-aged man whose life has seemingly gone down the drain. He's humorous, has a bleak yet go-with-the-flow outlook on life in this messed up City, and despite his apparent wealth of experiences as a Fixer in the City, there's still a connection between him as a protagonist and us as a player, because he's just as clueless as us about how the Library works and even how some things in the City works. So even with his experience, his initial reactions to most things lines up with ours, especially since he has common sense.

Angela is another story entirely. She's your classic example of a mechanical being that slowly becomes more human in behaviour as the game goes on. She's more dry-witted than Roland, and doesn't enjoy messing around. But she's also the opposite of Roland in that she's far more knowledgeable about the Library for obvious reasons, but is for the most part ignorant to how things in the City largely work. Thereby creating a connection between the player and her, as her initial reactions to how most things in the City works reflects our own. 

They're very bizarre protagonists, but their banter is fun. And besides them, the wealth of other characters in the game is a massive point in the game's favour. From the other Librarians, to the massive conglomerate of different characters you meet through the game, however brief. There is also the little lore-bits and stories you can read in the game itself, with more lore being unlocked as you go through the game. A massive, massive collection of lore. More than enough to fill up a wiki's worth. The game's focus on books really is apt, because you will be doing a lot of reading to really appreciate the lore of the world. It doesn't feel 'contained', it feels like there is a world and story going on in the City outside of just the Library.

The music is absolutely stunning too. From jazzy tunes, to Mili's stunning vocal performances, to the different styles of music each floor of the Library has, its just a lot of fun.

Rich lore and world, compelling characters both lovable and hateable, fun gameplay that feels rewarding despite the massive difficulty curve making it a colossal challenge, very charming character design and art style, great voice acting, fantastic music.

10/10, can't wait for Limbus Company to see if it provides a similar experience. Might even pick up Lobotomy Corporation if I ever have time.

It's a dystopian city with mega-corporations controlling a chunk of their assigned district for the upper-class in their Nests, leaving the lower-class in the Backstreets to fend for themselves. However, it is not similar to any cyberpunk media out there. Shit, it's hard to say it as cyberpunk; there's some advanced technologies but the setting is overall pretty modern. The presence of Fixers and Syndicates is unique, too. It's a world where you can visit a mercenary's office and pay them to kill a bunch of criminals as long as you have the money. Said criminals can range from thugs to cult-esque or even a mafia. 

And let's not talk about the combat. Guns are hella expensive and not that easy to find, so combat is done through melee weapon instead. In most games, the combatants will have a full-metal armor. In Library of Ruina? You get people in suits that can deflect blades, stop bullets, feel nothing after being hit by a hammer, run faster, and more! This match of uniformed men and women using melee weapons to kill each other is amazing.

TL;DR Nothing is like Library of Ruina's plot and world. It's very unique, and the only reason it happened is because a bunch of Koreans read the Torah and Zohar and thought ""hmmm this is cool""",1675508682,1675508682,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

When playing Lobotomy Corp, I had to tell myself ""I just need to get though this to get to Library Of Ruina"" and checked out around hour 40 and had to cheat just to get to the end. I'm currently 120 hours in LoR and I hope it never ends. I'm glad I experienced the story of Lob Corp so I can 100% appreciate LoR and fully feel that I made the right choice.
The only gripe I have is the difficulty curve spikes up insanely not just once, but multiple times throughout the game. Multiple times have I had a 5 hour session where I barely made any progress.

Library of Ruina has a great Intricate turned based combat system where you build decks from the foes you defeat, mix and matching cards from previous fights to overcome whatever the game throws at you next. Floors allow you to center builds around specific mechanics, such as burn damage or pierce with their unique abnormality cards.

The music is fantastic with a special mention to Mili's entire album dedicated to the game in being phenomenal with catching the tone of the game and the fights they accompany. From Gebura's explosive electric guitar riffs to Chesed's melancholic and somber floor theme, each patron librarian has an OST fitting their character and play style. 

The story does a fantastic job of expanding on The City, an almost cyberpunk type setting where mega corporations wielding technology called singularities that are beyond human comprehension control every aspect of the residents' lives. Just replace the synth-wave, neon, and 80's nostalgia with horror and anime. The world project moon has created leaves me wanting to learn more and i'm eagerly awaiting their next game. 

Highly recommend if you like games with fantastic world building, turn based combat, and a decent challenge.

Gameplay. The good: combat system is something really new, i can't even tell you a game that is similar. Pretty complex rules, but that's my jam. Bad: they try super hard to say ""this is not a card game"". They call it books instead of card packs, pages instead of cards, acts instead of turns and so on.

Sound. The good: awesome music. Lots of tracks of all styles. You can never anticipate what a fight will sound like. Some battles last less than a minute and they have their own track. The bad: some status effects have a continuous sound effect while they're active, and if you have over a certain number the distortion is over the roof. I mute the game before attempting certain combos because is a cacophony.

Art. The good: The character art really sell the story. The procedurally generated characters all look different but never absurd. The bad: 99% of the ""equipment"" makes the characters look extremely ugly, luckily you can hide them and keep the stats

Story: not gonna comment much since I didn't play the previous game. The good: really gets you invested in the characters, on a feelings level. The subtitles are very well translated to English, very natural wording. The bad: Don't ask me what the characters motivations are or what most of them are trying to accomplish, I keep asking ""why though?""",1674872320,1674872320,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Shit gets dark and weird fast from: a cult of gears, a person with 3 animals as a head, fucking clowns, and boot leg Canadian health care everywhere. Gebura is based, and i really like Roland as a character as well, the overall cast was pretty enjoyable.

  The Gameplay is a complex system at first, but you ease into it after a bit. There are most definitely a few difficulty spikes, most notably one in the middle, and one near the end. I found that these spikes were extremely difficult to brute force, but simply progressing through the main story or just doing a bit of grinding makes the difficulty spikes a lot more manageable. 
  The realization fights and the other floor fights were often the most time consuming parts of the game, however they usually brought unique mechanics to the table so it wasn't repetitive. 
  Deck building is kinda dry early on, because you just get unga bunga cards with slight variations and status effects, it isn't until the end of Urban Legend (1/3 - 1/4 into the game) that you start getting more interesting cards. (discard, smoke, counter dice, charge, ranged support, mass attacks, more)

  The most fun I've had was in fact the campaign, the story cut scene right before the battle was always when I was at the peak of my attention and interest. The way Project Moon paint's this depressing world is frankly amazing, and I can't wait to buy their next game.

It's both an amazing deck builder and an amazing visual novel that get masterfully blended into one amazing game with a superb OST to tie it all together. Be aware though: it is a LONG game and most battles from mid to end game will take a while (think on the order of 30 minutes - 2 hours per battle).

I discovered this game (and its prequel Lobotomy Corp which I played before it) from the songs that Mili did as part of the OST. As such I went in already having high expectations for the use of the music, but the game fully merits praises of its own.

In hindsight, having 100%'ed the game now, I can say for certain I would have gladly played this game as both a pure visual novel and as a pure deckbuilder. That said, the blend of these already great individual components made the actual game into something even better.

The world is fascinating and you learn about it through the eyes of countless characters which each have their own flaws, goals, and views. There are no heroes or villains, only a highly dystopian yet still human world. I will leave it at that to avoid any spoilers, but I look forward to seeing more games set in this world given there are still many facets that the game did not get a chance to fully explore. Oh, and you do not need to have played Lobotomy Corporation to get into the story since the game will spoil all the events that happened in the prequel. However, there are lots of text, visual, and musical callbacks that definitely hit harder if you played Lobotomy Corp.

In terms of difficulty: there is definitely a big difficulty spike starting from mid-late game compared to the early game. However, I never felt I hit a wall with any battle. Either I rearranged my decks to counter whatever style the enemies were using or I went to other battles to get new key pages (these determine character stats and passives) and cards. I didn't track the exact number but there were less than 10-15 receptions/realizations (these can be a single or a string of battles) I had to retry at least once. And the most I remember retrying any given reception/realization was 5-6 times.

The battle system is complex and has so many different effects and mechanics that some battles can feel like puzzles in a way. Given that, while I loved the careful strategy involved both outside of battles (preparing decks, passives, etc.) and in battles (managing attack order, energy, etc.) I admit it takes a while. I personally got really absorbed into every battle and would not even notice the time fly by but YMMV depending on your own preferences.

Jokes aside, great game and fantastic story telling. Those who are getting into Library of Ruina don't get discourage with the amount of info they throw at you in the beginning. You'll learn most of the game before it start becoming hard. RNG plays heavily in the gameplay mechanic.

Make sure you read all the cards and know how to combine them, makes the game much more manageable. Experiment with different strategies like should one be focus on only damage while the other focus on support? Or do a combination of both? Focus blood build with Hod? Focus burn build with Malkuth?

Before you get into it library of ruina, be sure to review or play/watch a playthrough of Lobotomy corporation. If you decide to play Lobotomy for the first time...Good luck.

OST, 스토리/설정은 더할나위 없이 좋았으며 캐릭터 하나하나가 다 매력적이다. 

카드파밍 시스템은 별로 심하진 않았지만 아예 없어도 되지 않았을까 싶다. 

다른 리뷰에서 강조되는 기승전결결결결결결결 문제는 사실 그렇게 심하진 않다. 첫번째 결에서 시스템적으로 엔딩에 가까워졌다는 느낌을 너무 강하게 줘갖고 '왜 안끝나지?' 싶은 생각이 계속 들어서 그런게 아닌가 싶다. 적당히 끊으면서 해도 괜찮다.

게임 시스템에 대한 설명은 불친절하며 중후반부([spoiler] 도별2~3라인 [/spoiler])부터 난이도가 급격히 올라간다. 덕분에 게임 초반엔 시스템 이해하느라 공략 보고 후반엔 깨는법 찾느라 공략보고 진행했다.

전작(로보토미 코퍼레이션)을 하면 좋긴 하지만 아예 모르고 해도 스토리 이해는 잘 될 것이며 대충 유튜브로 보는걸 추천한다.

I do recommend this game, but with some caveats-
If you:
Enjoyed Lobotomy Corporation and want to see the continuation of the story
Enjoy deckbuilders with a significant degree of difficulty and optimization required
Don't mind banging your head against a difficulty curve some might describe as ""vertical""

Then grab this game. Otherwise, maybe check out some gameplay and see if it's your cup of tea; even if you're not great at deckbuilders, there's a set of pretty good guides on steam to help you out.

For the game itself, story is a solid continuation from where LobCorp left off with a fairly satisfying (if somewhat grueling) set of fights and finales towards the end, the art and presentation are solid, and the ost is a set of absolute bangers (seriously, even if you aren't interested in the game, check out the ost, it's sick)

All in all, I loved the game.

Its true what they say, the difficult curve is vertical around the middle part of the story, that's where you need to utilize and gather the correct cards for the fight... mainly stacking buffs like STR and END (Endurance) or Power. 

The story is what kept me going as I wanted to know what's next, the writing/VA is also good. 
The music that the game provides are awesome, I listen to it hours everyday because its that good and give you motivation (insert virgil meme) to go on.

Still better to go and watch a lore vid on the game before playing if you don't want to wait. Library of Ruina is a linear turn based jrpg. It takes place inside ""The Library"" a mysterious structure that lures in victims with promises of power, wealth, and glory. It's your job as a librarian to ""receive"" these guests on your floor, killing them and turning them into books for the Library's ever growing collection. Also plaguing the denizens living in ""The City"", an enormous metropolis run by 26 mega corporations, are monsters called abominations, essentially SCPs really. Occasionally, you'll have the opportunity to fight an abomination, and if you succeed its powers are yours to strengthen your floors librarians with. The game has interesting combat mechanics that keep it extremely challenging, but not constantly frustrating. There's a significant learning curve to it and the in game walk through of the mechanics is a bit confusing, but after your first couple of fights you'll get into the rhythm pretty quick. I'm not kidding about the difficulty by the way. You will fail, and quite often at that. But the feeling of overcoming a particularly hard fixer, enticed by the Library's promises, or scraping through an abomination fight that leaves you stressed out in your gamer chair is oh so worth it. Each fight is kinetic, the hits on either side really feeling like they have impact. Particularly strong blows feeling heavier when they land. The music is also spectacular, the almost persona like jazz will have you just sitting and listening to the main theme without realizing it.

------------------------------------------------------------------
So, played the game a bit more and now I think I can truly dissect this game. Do be noted I have previous experience with it on console so my impression will be very different from most others.

The game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, but it's written in such a way that you do not at all need to have played Lobotomy Corporation to understand what's going on. In fact, there's a different character whom the player will sympathize with at the beginning depending on whether or not they played LobCorp. Both new and old players should feel right at home. (If somehow there is an old player of LobCorp who's only just now considering to play this.)

The game is slow-going at first, if you're not the patient type, I don't recommend you play this as it takes until around the beginning of the second act before things start to mesh together. The story-rich tag isn't just for show and there's a reason why this won/got nominated for best VN. (I'm not sure which.)

Even if you do like the story however, the game is difficult. Not Pathologic difficult, but still quite difficult. If you have prior experience with deckbuilding games, it should be easier, but it'll nevertheless take dedication to actually finish this game. The mechanics are more akin to XCOM or other turn-based tactical games than a traditional card game. 

In fact, there's an argument to be made that it is a more complex and pure tactical game than XCOM since the turns are simultaneous and there's no strategic element. You and your opponent act at the same time. Do note that the game is actually biased in YOUR favor, but it pulls a lot of tricks to fuck you over, there's a lot of bullshit in the game. 

The gameplay becomes a masterpiece however when it finally clicks with you and you start throwing bullshit right back. It encourages you to master the mechanics deeply. If you go in with the expectation that big dice = win, you will lose A LOT near the end. That's not to say it can't work, but it'll be easier if you find ways to actually solve the problems rather than just try to smash them.

There's a lot of obstacles on the way to loving this game. But if you can make it past all that, this game becomes a masterpiece. One of the indie greats. I cannot recommend this dirt covered gem enough.",1671862643,1672859882,True,44,1,0.721892833709716797,0,True,False,False

I am NOT fine with pure evil being depicted as reasonable, relatable, or necessary for the greater cosmic good.

The first fight two fights are morally grey.  The third fight is straight evil.  I intentionally lost, but losing is canonically impossible.  You have to win eventually.  The player gets resurrected for free, every time, and risks nothing except a little time and a little pain.  Every single guest risks death (or worse, depending on what ""books"" are), and is given no clues whatsoever as to how outclassed they are - and you have to fight them until you inevitably win.  There is nothing fair or ethical about the role of the player.

For reference, I'm completely fine with Yanderesim, My Lovely Daughter, and Postal 2, because:
1) The player character is not portrayed as good or sane, and has the potential for (some) positive character development.
2) The player takes great risks, and is likely to pay the appropriate consequences for their actions.
3) There are peaceful options.  Yes, games that are literally about murderous, manipulative, selfish psychopaths are more ethical than this game.

Keeping it brief:

Communication with the player is simultaneously over-saturated and under-detailed, so you're overwhelmed at mechanic introductions but you still don't know exhaustively what they do until you go to a third party source.

The game inexplicably offers automation or abbreviation to the gameplay elements over which you *want* nuanced control, but you have to manually sort through UI elements that could just as easily be a static readout, and hit buttons that only have one outcome. (Seriously? I can auto-select actions for my team, but I have to roll the speed dice manually every turn?)

There's constant (and significant) power creep and every engagement requires different strengths and resistances, so the ability to save character loadouts is broadly useless but you still need to respec and regear them almost every single stage.

Said respec gets more and more tedious as you unlock more characters per team and more 'equipment', (5 characters per team, 10 teams, one 'gear' page picked from dozens + their duplicate entries, nine ability 'pages' picked from hundreds.) 

Adding insult to injury, 90% of equip-able pages are fully irrelevant 1-2 stages after you receive them, but you still need to sort through this inventory glut every time, and the limited sort/filter options are either minimally helpful or clumsy and slow to use.

My broad take on the game is that of design that emphasizes its weaknesses, a dearth of very obvious and basic QoL features, a somewhat clumsy UI, poor communication of mechanics, and a gameplay loop that almost seems to go out of its way to make the banal parts take up more time and attention than the interesting ones.",1672616529,1672616529,False,1,0,0.492015302181243896,1,True,False,False

18 hours in and the game feels more grindy than difficult.   Most of the difficult comes from the requirement to grind out the high level abilities that are required to make the game easy.

Vertical difficulty?  Pfft!  It's more like gambling (poker) then anything.  5 out of 10 floors unlocked so far and I've won every fight by pressing Q (fast forward battles), spacebar (roll dice faster), P (randomly pick cards), spacebar (start battle).  This game is literally Q, _, P, _ constantly, while watching TV.  I always win battles because this game's difficulty comes from the grinding.  Once you have the OP cards (from grinding), then the game is a joke.

I have yet to lose a single boss fight (when fighting seriously), and I'm currently on 6th floor out of 10 floors (I'm assuming there are 10 floors in the game, I don't know for sure, because I don't cheat by looking up anything from WIKI's.  I'm 100% blind in playing this game).  My winning strategy:
Step 1)  Start boss battle, mouse over boss, read weaknesses, die on purpose
Step 2)  Switch gear (cards) to match the bosses weaknesses, fight boss

And like any good game with complex system mechanics, learning to use and abuse them nets you immensely powerful and satisfying rewards. This game gives you every tool you could possibly want to make the wildest combinations, some obvious and some you'll have to experiment to find.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

It certainly has difficulty spikes, but none so insurmountable that a solid strategy won't work. The main progression also branches off, so if you're having trouble with one fight, maybe you can do another and see what you can get. And of course, you get access to several different floors with different abilities that you can tailor to your strategy. Or, honestly, you can breeze through the early game with whomever you're most fond. But again, it's useful and quite fun to experiment with the different floors to see what you can do.

[h1]The Story[/h1]

Finally, the story is fantastic. If you're someone who prefers gameplay over story (like I do), you are served well. But for those who want to watch a good story unfold, this game provides. While this game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, and while the story is discussed, Library of Ruina's plot is still great without any knowledge of LC. The two leads, of course, have a compelling dynamic that's very fun to watch, while the world is built piece-by-piece through the clips you see of everyone living in the City, from those in the backstreets to those at the very top. It gives you just enough to understand what it's like while still leaving an air of mystery around the setting.

There's a reason this is the first game I've fully completed, and why it's one of my most played games. And I plan to come back to it again. It's an incredibly fun experience from start to finish, with so much room for creativity.

Battles earn you ""Books"" which are card packs. Key pages act as Units you can field, and Combat pages their moves. The deceptively simple deckbuilding gets expanded further when you consider the Abnormality pages each floor, or ""Team"" has. Stupidly high costing cards are useful on Malkuth's Floor of History, as she has an ability where you can decrease the cost of that card. 

Abnormality cards are also fun and simple. You earn emotion coins to refill and expand your energy pool, causing fights to get more intense instead of less as time goes on in the bout. If everyone expands enough times, you get an abnormality card. There are two types of coins and two types of cards. Positive emotion coins are earned by rolling maximum on dice, beating enemies, staggering them, or winning clashes, and earn Awakening pages that are relatively low power, but simple and always solid. Negative emotion coins are when you are doing the opposite, I.E. losing, and earn complex, risky Breakdown pages, which can be bad for you, but may be what you need to turn the fight around. 

You also need to earn the Abnormality cards through fights with their respective abnormalities. These puzzling bosses at first teach you the ropes of the game alongside regular encounters, but eventually become tests of deckbuilding and strategy where a bad deck can lose the fight before it begins.

The aesthetics and production value of the game are staggering (pun very much intended), and though a far different kind of game from Lobotomy Corporation, the previous game, it is very competent and lovingly designed, each floor is beautifully animated, and contains 3 battle themes, or rather one theme that goes into different movements as the fight intensifies. Speaking of L Corp, you don't need to play it to understand or appreciate the plot. You can go in with the added context, and appreciate Angela's point of view, or go without, and have Roland's point of view.

The voice acting, while only in Korean, is excellent. The plot is darkly delightful, as no matter what viewpoint, you learn more about The City, the grimdark cyberpunk world their franchise is in.

Plus, the modding community routinely pumps out high quality post game like content for the shiny new powers you get at the end you unfortunately cannot use for most of the few new fights left.

All in all, this is an excellent game you cannot go wrong in buying.",1671758485,1671758485,True,3,0,0.54086756706237793,0,True,False,False

It’s difficult to describe exactly what Library of Ruina is. It’s like a card game, turn-based RPG & visual novel all rolled into one; as the old saying goes, “it must be seen to be believed”. Also, the difficulty spike is vertical.

It’s a relatively recent game done by South Korean indie studio, Project Moon. It’s a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, but in a completely different genre. Unlike LoboCorp before it, Ruina’s fully voiced. & when I first heard it, I thought it had potential to take off, but was hampered by only being voiced in one language (though, there’s at least English text).

Project Moon stated in a recent Q&A that for their next game, Limbus Company, they’re considering dubbing the voice acting into multiple languages if there’s enough interest/demand for it; which I’m excited for!",1671723765,1671723765,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Let me tell you right now when I say the difficulty spike is vertical. I have 160+ hours in game and I still have not completed the main story. Almost there but I am getting skill issued. Amazing game with beautiful story and amazing artwork and scenes. 

The artwork of the abnormalities and the atmosphere that you feel in every fight scene make every action so much more impact full. For combat don't enable auto play, have your space bar make every hit count so you feel as if you are the one fighting or to make a moment so much more tense because you really need the high roll.

The characters are so lovable. They have unique traits and their character design is so well made that you can tell who is who when you only see their silhouette. Playing this game you will find out their emotions or their characteristics that literally determine their play style. While yes you can make your own deck, you will unlock special abilities that will enhance each groups specialty. Again this adds so much flavor to the characters and you learn to love them or hate them.

The music, I mean c'mon Mili is literally in the intro. How can you not listen to the intro every time?! The lyrics in some music tracks really add so much flavor to the fights because they match how the fights feel, or that they match with the theme of the character. They literally have a core mechanic of ""Emotion"" in the fights because in this world emotions are amplified is so many ways due to lore reasons. (Play the game or spoil yourself!) 

 My only wish is there to be difficulty options so casual players may enjoy the story and the world building that PM do so amazingly well or people that get skill issued like myself. Project Moon has not disappointed with their work and I really look forward for their next game Limbus Company (Late February 2023 probably).",1671679036,1671679036,True,1,0,0.510638296604156494,0,True,False,False

As a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, it succeeds, as an independent experience, it succeeds, as a narrative, it succeeds. I have little to no gripes with this game, and even then, I can overlook them due to just how spectacular this game is.
I'll get my cons out of the way so I can get to gushing.
-Can get a bit grindy, expect to repeat some Receptions over and over again, especially if you constantly lose books due to being bad at the game or unlucky.
-Not the game's fault, but it is a shame that to get the full experience, you'll have to play Lobocorp. Don't get me wrong, I adore that game too, but it's very difficult to recommend and beat.
-Most of the time the challenge is welcome and fun, but on occasion (especially with some late-game bosses), it can feel a bit unfair. All I have to say is ""Untranslated name"" and people who have played this game already know what I'm talking about when it comes to the less fun boss fights (not to diss that fight though, great story implications, banger music).
And there you go, those are my cons. Aside from that, expect an unforgettable experience. The art is beautiful with a striking blocky paint style, I find myself constantly humming along to the music, and the gameplay is the embodiment of ""just one more round"". I especially like the Abnormality fights, which feel more like puzzles than fights. Plus, as a fan of Lobocorp, I'm glad to see them execute the fights in a way that embodies the trial and error of figuring out how to deal with them in that game. I'm afraid to say anything about the narrative, because even the most minors things I don't wanna spoil. Most I can really say is that if you enjoy well executed body horror, this one's for you. Some of the scenes made me feel genuinely ill. If you enjoy card games, RPGs, Project Moon's other works, or just good games, I really encourage you to try this one out.

Long version (with mechanics explanation and stuff)
The story is captivating and had me shed a tear at times. 
The music conveys so much emotion, the OST never dissapointed me.
The visuels are beautiful without exageration, this game has alot of good art during cutscenes.
The mechanics are fun, from emotion levels to status effects, some cards lead to chain réactions (example, if a character has a certain status effect on hit grant X amount of strength next scene.) Just don't forget to read what the game throws at you, i can see it being a common pattern in the negative reviews. They say the game throws you in with little to no explanation but really all you have to do is read, if someone as stupid as i could 100% the game so can you.

Enough about the artistic directions, let's talk about the gameplay.
The receptions are fun and unique some of them having their own gimmicks, the difficulty curb IS vertical. The game get's hard at some points but remember this, if you kill a guest and get their book you keep it even if you lose the reception giving you better cards if you burn them.
Cards, what are Cards? Cards are the main way of attacking in this game, you get them by burning books. You can equip 9 cards per deck with a max of 3 of the same cards, key pages are like armor in this game. You also get them from books.
I see a lot of people talk about Light and not understand how it works so ill run it down quickly.
Think of Light as mana, you need a set amount of Light to use a card, each scene you replenish 1 Light unless you level up your emotion level by winning or losing clashes, with each emotion level you full replenish Light and get extra Light nodes.
What are emotion levels? Emotion levels give you buffs, to level up from 0 to 1 you need 3 emotion coins (which are given to you by winning clashes ((it will give you positive coins)) or by losing clashes ((will give you negative emotion coins))) the amount of coins needed to 'level up' increases with each level.
Why are there different emotion coin types you may ask? Abnormality cards, to get Abnormality cards you need to make the team emotion level (think of it as global emotion) rise, depending on the amount of coins you have you can either get negative Abnormality cards or positive ones.
And that's all im gonna mention for the mechanics, you can find out the rest on your own ;)

I give this game a 10/10, it may be even my favorite game. I feel empty now that i finished this game luckily there's workshop mods.

There are many reasons, but the main one would be: It has absolutely no respect for your time. If you've played Lobotomy Corporation, then rest assured that it's nowhere near as bad here - but the general hubris of the design is still there, as much as I hate to say it. In fact, a lot of bad design tropes from LCorp have made their way into the Library; everything is a lot (and I do mean A LOT) more refined, but when you take a closer look, you'll start noticing familiar patterns.

[h1]The Difficulty Curve is Vertical[/h1]
Many reviews mention this, so let me start here. Yes, the game starts out very easy and gets quite hard very quickly, and for one, I don't have a problem with that. I have a problem with what makes it so hard.

1. The fights get exponentially longer as you progress. The first reception can be easily completed in 5 minutes tops, but as you reach mid-game, you'll find that some boss fights can take up to an hour. One reception can have two, three or even more acts, which are their own separate groups of bad guys to fight. After that, certain story fights have you fight a boss that has 5 separate phases with their own sets of mechanics... and of course, if you die in those, you have start right at the start. And then it gets even worse.

2. Power creep. Simply put, latter cards are flat-out better than earlier ones (in case you didn't know, Ruina is a deckbulider). Around mid-game you'll get some cards that will probably be viable until the very end, but for the most part you'll be constantly replacing your decks. I've had multiple situations in which I steamrolled reception X, only to be defeated by the next one - and had to rebuild the decks based on cards I managed to get from the enemies I killed in that failed reception.

3. Rebuilding decks is unwieldy. Not only the UI is clunky, it also involves a lot of searching, equipping, unequipping. The card effect search, while it's nice to have it, feels like it's missing features. On top of that, there's a lot of depth to this game and there are many, many, MANY effects. Too many, perhaps. And for each floor (which you'll end up having 10, after the Sephirot) you'll have 5 librarians - so that's 50 decks in total - each made out of 9 cards + one key card (which also has sub-cards connected for passive abilities)... admittedly, you'll be mostly rebuilding one floor at a time, but that's still 5 decks. And they have to synergise and be adapted to the fight at hand. Out of my 90 hours played, it's safe to say that at least 30 were spent building decks - but I didn't use a guide or watch anyone play, as I fail to see the point of that.

4. Gacha, and the punishment for failure. No, there are no microtransactions. The only way to get new cards is to burn books which are left by killing enemies and winning receptions. You don't know which cards you'll get, and of course you'll want the more rare ones, key cards in particular. So often you'll end up burning all books you've gotten from a grueling, hour-long reception just to get that key card... only to find that you actually needed that book to progress in the story! So here we go again. And if you'll lose a reception, you'll also lose the book that you needed to start it... in other words, there is a very big chance you'll have to redo fights which were already crazy long to begin with.

[h1]Unforgettable Melodies[/h1]
I'll stop complaining about the difficulty and bring up the music. I mentioned that it's made of pure feels, and yes, I stand by these words. Many pieces are made by Mili, chances are you're familiar with them. Momocashew's voice is sweet and ominous at the same time, which is a perfect fit - and the songs add lots of emotions to the already powerful scenes.

But that's not why I called them unforgettable. I did so because of just how much I had to listen to the same songs over and over and over, because they're the background music to a boss fight that lasts for an hour.

Example: there's this boss, let's call him C. He starts out as bunch of small enemies which eventually fuse. You fight his fused form, and then he breaks up, and you have to do that again. Repeat 3 times, do a small last phase, and you're done. Now, C's battle theme is a song that lasts 3 minutes. A very pretty song, which feels like a tasteful homage to Simon and Garfunkel's Scarborough Fair... but if you have to hear it repeat 15+ times? You'll go mad. And that's just one time you have to fight him...

There are more cases like this, but my general point is: the music, while fantastic, repeats far, far too much.

[h1]Keep Your Eyes Buttered[/h1]
Let's talk about the writing. This is perhaps the most schizophrenic of all my points, because it's both genius and embarrassing at the same time.

The embarrassing part is the level of grimdark. Let's be honest, our world is a pretty cruel place, but for the most part cruelty is a byproduct of ambition or apathy - rarely a goal in itself. And here there are so many impossibly cruel acts done for seemingly no reason, Coldsteel the Edgehog is getting a Nobel Prize in physics for using this game's edge to split subatomic particles. I will cut out your brain and rewire your guts while you're still conscious and let you drown in your own blood upside down in 1000x slowed down time so that the meat I'll get from killing you will be tastier, allegedly. That's how grimdark we're talking.

As for the genius part? A lot of stuff is good, but what is [i]transcendental[/i] is the theming. Now, I've tortured myself with playing Lobotomy Corp for 130 hours, so I have a pretty good understanding of the characters and the abnormalities. And here the stories of the characters and the symbolism of the abnormalities come together in an impossibly perfect way. I won't spoil anything here, but this part is so incredibly good that it makes suffering through both of those games worth it. Sort of. 

Oh, and for the record, you don't need to play Lobotomy Corp to play this - the game does an excellent job at telling you not only what happened, but also what sort of effects it had on the characters. Admittedly, the only way to truly understand those ordeals is to go through them yourself, but... I don't recommend that.

[h1]The One Perfect Book[/h1]
I really wanted this game to be better than LCorp. And it is. It's so, so much better. But after 90 hours I simply can't go on anymore. 

The way I see it, the best way to experience this game is to have had participated in Early Access, watching slowly as the story was unfolding, having plenty of time to reconsider strategies, participate in the community eagerly awaiting the next patch. It feels like the game's difficulty was designed with those people in mind - that's why it's so strange to us newcomers.

I still had plenty of fun with this game. I'm glad about the huge step up in quality of all elements of the game from LCorp - the writing in particular. But I think this is where me and the Project Moon part ways. Maybe you're the kind of person who enjoys time-consuming game design; in which case there's a lot to love about this game. I'm not recommending it because to a person with a similar sensibilities as me, this game is ultimately a road to Gehenna. And you'd probably want to go elsewhere.

First of all, the story is probably one of the most interesting and engaging aspect of the game. Building up from the limited info Lobotomy Corporation, it adds so much more and still leaves so many questions unanswered. The City itself is much bigger than anyone playing it for the first time can imagine, and the characters living in it have so much lore behind them that you need to read additional info in their bios in game.

The battles in these games are super fun and engaging. Each battle not only has action but tells a story through the fight. As the story progresses, the fights do become harder (difficulty spike is vertical, I'm looking at you QoH), but after beating them you get this sort of feeling of relief. There are a few battles that seemed a bit harder than it should be, and there could be some balancing that can (and maybe should) happen. If you can solo most battles with one specific floor, then there might be a problem with their power levels.
 
The game mechanics is hard to learn, no doubt about it. There were times where mechanics of fighting was difficult to understand, and even though there is a tutorial it took me a bit to figure out how range and mass attacks work. Don't get me even started on counter dice. But I believe once you figure them out you'll truly have an easier time understanding how to fight effectively.
The music in this game is phenomenal, a masterpiece. So much so I got the OST. Each floor has their own unique theme to it that fits their personality well, and if thats not enough the dynamic music should be something. I heard about Mili before, but I think this game is the what brought their music to my attention. From String Theocracy to Gone Angels, they fit the fight they are featured in. Also buy the artbook (After beating the game), some pretty interesting stuff in there.
 
This game is not for the light-hearted. There will be parts that when playing seem impossible to beat. I would know, it took me a few tries to beat one of the last bosses. But I believe through good strategy (and a LOT of luck) you can find the one true book too!

The game-play may not be for everyone as card games never are, but the way the system is setup makes it so fun to build your decks and librarians for every situation and the use of every floor makes you swap strategies keeping it fresh. After the beginning portion of the game difficulty spikes and I really enjoy that as with being further in the game lets you make even more unique decks to play. The game-play is fun for me, but I believe the story and world-building carry this game a whole ton. Roland and Angela are wonderful main characters and learning their story is very fun with all the mystery surrounding it.

BUT if you can get through the difficulty spikes and the steep learning curve, this game will reward with great music, great story and a whole lot of feels for all the characters. Seriously, watching all the librarians grow as people and the meltdown boss fights hit me hard.

Love gameplay. If you like deckbuilders/turn based strategy games, you'll love this one. 
A lot of possibilities, with up to 5character per team in late game, team buffs, a lot to think about yet it is still affordable to go with unperfects teams. 

Easy to understand.

Lots of content. You will not see the end. It does get harder cause you'll blindy do bosses first time and have the bad team for it. Not so hard once you get the hang of it.

This game follows really well into the ending of the previous game, While it still branches off enough with its story and its own characters that you really don't need to have played the previous game to understand it.

The writing is a masterpiece, Project Moon gets you to understand and care about a character that was just introduced (Or hate them depending on the context) and it adds so much more depth when you end up killing that character, Especially when you see the situation from their perspective. Usually killing a character leads down the line into more people getting dragged in and killed as well, This really helps to play into the theme that the suffering that you inflict will always come back to bite you.

The gameplay is pretty fantastic for the majority of the game. The combat system is well though out and always had me excited to get the gear of the very characters I was fighting. The deck builder system allows for pretty much limitless creativity, Though it does kind of block out casual play later on. The game is exceptionally well balanced for the majority of its runtime, Though later on it hits a genuinely unfair spike in difficulty [spoiler](Specifically in abnormality battles)[/spoiler] that I could attribute to lore or that project moon hates everyone that plays their games (I'm leaning towards the latter).

The games community is also very close-knit and pretty fun to hang out with. If you are interested in involving yourself I would start off in the Reddit or Discord servers as you can meet a lot of really cool/friendly people there. The games fanart is phenomenal, The art community is full of really talented and skilled fan artists and I really do recommend checking it out! The last thing I would really suggest checking out or giving a read is project moons webcomics set in the games universe, They are really well written and enjoyable reads.

All in all the game is fantastic. The lore is incredibly amazingly written, I don't think there was a point in the game maybe besides the very very start where I was not incredibly interested in the lore, The gameplay is phenomenal with very few flaws beyond it mountainous difficulty curve, The games community is really fun to hang out with and has lots of interesting fan work put into it. I really cant wait for whatever Project Moon releases next.

The problem is that the good game is buried under everything else about the game that doesn't want you to play it. Even after 13 hours of play, there are still mechanics which interact in completely obtuse ways and surprise me, and even after seeing them trigger, I still don't entirely understand what made them play out as they do. I refuse to believe there exists a human being who can look at a fight once you hit the stages where Ranged cards start being involved, and accurately assess exactly what's going to happen once you press ""resolve"" for the relevant turn, or correctly predict which characters will regain how much Light(the game's resource spent to play cards) at the start of a turn.

It doesn't help that the UI aggressively doesn't want you to understand the game. Is a card currently boosted or penalized by a status effect? Possibly, the game doesn't provide you the final resulting dice being rolled anywhere, so it's up to you to calculate the end result together(and a given mid-game turn may result in some twelve cards being tossed across the playing field on any given round, so have fun with that). You have some 6+ teams of characters, each with their own loadouts and piles of passives. Perhaps the game could tell you when a passive interacts with a card you're equipping? Ha ha, no. And of course the lists of passives are long enough that you have to scroll them for each character.

Ah, you think, but I will just focus on one or two teams, to make sure I have a decent overview of what's going on. Screw you, the game replies, certain battles can only be fought with certain teams, even if the teams are entirely interchangeable except for their limit breaks(abnormality cards).

Battles yield books, which work both as tickets to enter later battles and can be melted down for cards. You can do any battle any number of times(unless you lose, in which case the ticket is lost and needs to be regained), so you have technically infinite books, limited only by your patience. Yet when you gain cards from books, it's random which ones you get, which means you may need to grind for them in an entirely *risk-free* way. It feels like the game is lacking some sort of additional resource or timer which would cause you to be cautious or sparing with your resources, but it doesn't exist, so once again all a loss costs you is time.

You can always swap around equipped pages(books, cards and pages are, despite being related concepts, separate things, certainly no confusion will ever occur) and cards between battles that are part of the same ""reception,"" but you oddly enough can't EDIT pages(changing their passives) between battles if they're part of the same reception. Why? No idea.

The game will, in its defense, yield almost all the information you need to understand exactly what it's doing, except these will be dumped on you as novella-length text piles full of proper nouns that make them hard to parse.

Every single button or card will, when moused-over, make an insanely loud clicking sound, just to make things more annoying.

Even little UI things, like sometimes you banish a menu with an additional left-click, other times with a right-click, are annoying.

All this is really sad because, as said, there is a decent(albeit at times annoyingly random) tactical card game under the UI that tries to prevent you from playing it or understanding how it works. There's also a decent story and an interesting setting. Characters that sometimes have funny or emotional interactions. A really great soundtrack.

But with this UI, I can't in good conscience recommend anyone play this game without having a really high threshold of patience.",1669127547,1669127547,False,58,4,0.629343926906585693,7,True,False,False

it's remarkably difficult to explain what exactly this game's gameplay is about, but I'll just say that despite everything relying upon dice rolls, RNG is almost never the reason you win or lose
the game gives you several ways to minimise risk, primarily buffs and also the fact that you respond to and manipulate the enemy party's attacks means that you are always in control and aware of the worst case and best case scenarios
I've never seen a game that allows the player so many different, viable builds, without them feeling broken or otherwise unbalanced
the game gets harder and harder as it progresses, to the point where you really will have to form decks specifically for tackling the current opponent(s) you're trying to get past, but I will give you this bit of advice: status effects bypass damage resistances, which can allow you to end torturous phases of certain bosses faster than any other method

I had high hopes after reading the reviews and seeing the high ratings. I did not enjoy this game at all. I didn't realize that it was only in Korean, which kind of detracted from the start. Then the gameplay was not enjoyable for me. I like card games, as I'm a big fan of Yugioh and Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, among other things. This was very basic, but not in a good way. I didn't feel like strategy was all that important and it was easy to just get unlucky. One of my biggest pet peeves in turn based games is having to select an enemy when there is only one left. This happens quite frequently in this game. If you forget to click on the single enemy, then your character does absolutely nothing and you take the full brunt of the attack. Between that and some unlucky streaks with the dice rolls and card choices, I got annoyed with this game, not to mention a little bored, because I was forced to play slower at times to make sure that things were happening the way I was intending them to. Overall it just felt clunky and unintuitive. The menu was also annoying, since you have to click, click again on basically the same thing, then click another button. It felt redundant. I found the characters boring and the story too cliche. Maybe it gets better, but I'm not waiting any longer for it to pick up.

Let me first start with the good parts.

-The music is simply amazing; it was great in Lobotomy Corporation, and it remains as such; I love these tracks and will absolutely listen to some outside of the game.

-I really like the artstyle as well, everything is either very pretty, or downright beautiful.

-The story is very good as well, and really expands on the universe that Lobotomy Corporation created; it also allows you more insight onto the characters than before.

In my opinion, those three are the best parts of the game. Now, let's get onto the bad.

-The gameplay. Unless you like RNG, prepare to be absolutely destroyed regularly; you WILL have to replay levels again and again, either for farming purposes, or because you lost another level, requiring you to regain a lost book, which is not fun at all. Additionally, again, RNG - even if you have a good deck, there is a very reasonable chance you will still lose nonetheless; victory or defeat is often outside of your control, and comes down to pure luck. Unless you like having a lot of RNG, I sincerely cannot recommend this game.

I knew this game was going to have RNG, but not that it'd be this awful - if you're here because you are interested in the story, please, just watch a youtuber play instead, either that, or download the console mod as soon as you can; I'm doing that right as I write this, because I'm already sick and tired of this RNG.

UPDATE: 04/02/2022, day/month/year. I've played an additional 115 hours ever since my last review.

I've replayed the game after almost a year of having completed it once. I still cannot recommend it. I got further than before, but inevitably got stuck later down the line. I'm sick of it again, a year has passed and I still have the exact same issues AND MORE this time around.

The game really isn't meant for long fights unless you bring very specific decks, which is a massive pain, either you BRING this specific min-max deck, or you lose, that's it. The RNG will never be in your favour. I have completed every fight in the game, except for two realizations in the last two floors - and I simply can't get past them. And I know damn well that trying to progress into the final boss fight without doing these realizations is just suicide.

Its just impossible, I can't do it. The game starts off painfully easy but grows painfully difficult and annoying with its mechanics, from having to repeat the same fight again and again and again, down to simply not being able to get through  some stages without cheats. And worse off: every console mod is broken, so I can't get past this and I'm now basically stuck.

One thing is simple, if a player is forced to look up a guide on how to clear your game, then something is definitely wrong. Say whatever you want about me, there are SEVERAL others who agree. All of my friends that played this game, have cleared it using console, so I'm not ashamed to say that I did so too and that without it, I wouldn't have been able to. The way I see it, having the console mod is a MUST for 'playing' this game, otherwise, you WILL find yourself stuck, you WILL have to look up a guide and even then, RNG may just not let you progress FOR DAYS.

My views on this game remain. Only touch it if you like extreme RNG and if you're generally lucky, otherwise, you will most definitely not like it. If you're here just for the story, please, look it up on youtube instead.

I can only hope that Limbus Company, the sequel to this, isn't as filled with RNG ... but seeing as its a play store Asian game, it will probably be a gacha, so I'm already foreseeing that I will be disappointed. I must say, I will not buy Limbus Company before watching about half of the game on youtube.

And returning to the game a few months later. 13/11/2022, dd/mm/yyyy.

I still stand by my reviews. I've played an additional 145 hours since the original posting of this. Same issues as before. Infuriatingly bad RNG and stupidly unneccessary fights make this game a bog to play through. Much like before - I managed to get further this time around without cheats. But once more, I had to use them again, as continuing on became too infuriating.

The last fight, the one against the distorted ensemble, is single-handedly the worst fight in the game. Firstly, it is completely unneccessary, the game should've ended in the fight prior to it. Secondly, its annoyingly difficult as well, as now, you're fighting FOUR of the ensemble at an once - on top of that, in a SINGLE reception too! So fail once? Too bad, go back to the start and redo it again.

Limbus is closer and closer. I can only hope that they make the game better and less infested with stupidly unfair RNG. Once more, I cannot recommend that you buy this game, unless you like RNG.",1621653178,1668321661,False,2,3,0.438389480113983154,2,True,False,True

Gameplay: it's a deck building game with turned based combat. In combat, your librarians will face off against guests. Defeating guests will reward you with books. Books are used to gain more pages to make your decks stronger. The game gets increasingly more difficult as you progress ('vertical difficulty' as some describe it).

The game is colorful: the character looks nice, the stages look nice, the abnormality looks nice, and the attacks, albeit become stale due to how much you use them, still look nice. The presentation is very well done by the developers. 

The voice acting is well-made. But what shocked me the most was the music of the game. Each floor has its music that gets elevated the longer the battle goes on (There are 10 floors and 3 stages of music elevation). The bosses have tailor-made music created for them, and the boss's music takes priority over the floor music. It promotes that epic fighting feeling and makes it unique.  
 
The story is intriguing. The setting is a city that has a hierarchical system of statuses. And Angela, who was a previous character from the Lobotomy corp game, made a library that entices people with knowledge. If they win - they get that knowledge, but if they lose - they get turned into a book.

The way the story is narrated is brilliant. Before the battle and post-battle, you get a snippet of the character's story. But once they turned into a book, you can go into the credenza to read more of the character's story, like a book. And in those stories, they make a lot of foreshadowing of future encounters with characters, which makes a lot of those ""a-ha"" moments. Every character is related to other future characters. The story is a bit depressing, but I don't mind. There is always hope that it becomes better for the characters. And I adore the characters of this game. They are well-written and likable. 

The fight is arduous and confusing. But there is a good tutorial that lasts for the first 3 battles that explain the basics very well. After finishing the early game, is where the fun begins. You have a deck, and in it, you have attacks that you can get from enemies. There are a lot of different strategies that you can mix and use. At first, you control 1 character, but later on, you will have 5. It becomes very chaotic and fun. Sometimes, it is very infuriating to fight. You can spend around 40 min deep in the boss fight, only to lose it all and start over. It can take 3-4 tries before defeating the boss (around 2 hours), but once you do win, you scream in victory. The fights do not mess around, they are difficult, and you need to understand the mechanics. The combat is challenging and infuriating, but it is rewarding and engaging.

You can also fight the creatures stored in the library's stories as bosses who upon defeat will upgrade the floors of your library and allow you to channel their powers in battle. While the game starts off easy, new mechanics are introduced over time like the defensive smoke status or the ability boosting charge status. Furthermore, getting the true ending will require a mastery of the game's deckbuilding mechanics. The game also has a pretty big modding community for those who want an extra challenge.

Just kidding! Interesting setting and narrative help to prop up a game with overly complicated systems. The card battle game-play is passable, and grindy. Playable, but meh.
Voice-overs are in Korean but full English translation is available.

--------

Meh. 

Interesting setting and narrative
As a narrative sequel to another game (Lobotomy Corporation), Library of Ruina boasts a original, gritty world in a fantasy sci-fi setting with a love of melee combat. There's plenty of violence and protagonists with rather questionable morals. As you continue to play you'll be uncovering mysteries and drama.
Just ignore the fact that your boss is an expy of Rei Ayanami.

Complicated systems and initial learning curve
I'm sorry, how do I start the next mission? I have to ""send invitation""? And to send this invitation I have to also send a ""book""? And these books are collected from the dead ""guests"" who you ""invited"" last time? And to gain resources you have to burn these books... oh, and now I'm mission-locked, pardon, invitation-locked until I increase my Library's threat level. And how do I do that?
Maybe it's a translation issue, but all the in-game systems are hidden behind a wall of narrative-based terms which are not intuitive at all. The tutorial really could do a better job explaining what to do. Making the initial learning curve even more 'vertical' is the (admittedly original) combat system.

Mediocre combat
Well, at least they tried to do something different. The combat is semi-inspired by Slay the Spire. You attack and defend using randomly drawn cards from your deck, pardon, from your ""combat bookshelf"" and spend energy, pardon, spend ""light"" based on the light cost of the card. Also like StS, you can see enemy intentions so you can react to enemy actions accordingly.
However, the damage and defence values are randomised within a range egs. slashing 1-4 or block 2-3. So are enemy attacks/defences. So you can't always accurately predict the outcome of each turn, sorry, each ""clash"".
More significantly, the cards themselves are almost always extremely simple. No extra card draw, no extra energy, no card drafting, no card creation, none of that wonderful combo wombo StS stuff that using a card battle system enables. This is good in a way because you will control multiple characters and fight multiple enemies, but undercuts the whole point of using a card-based system in the first place.
The battle system, which is the main gameplay loop used to grind out cards, sorry, grind out ""combat pages"", is mediocre at best. Playable, but meh.

Perhaps that is the main takeaway - playable, but meh. I can imagine someone getting hooked on the edge-y setting and violence, and enjoying grinding out new cards,uh, ""combat pages"" to play with. But there is a lot of competition for my attention here on Steam.

BTW, apparently there is a huge difficulty spike partway through the game. I couldn't be bothered to pay that far. The systems in the game nor the narrative just didn't draw me in enough.",1665557436,1665993322,True,4,1,0.491367459297180176,0,True,False,False

I'm not typically someone who enjoys card-based battle systems. In fact, it's something I've bounced off of on dozens of games over the years. Library of Ruina does it a bit different which really hooked me, and I think it's not the cards themselves. It uses a hefty amount of dice rolls as well to make battles dynamic and really engaging on a cerebral level. The fights in this game, while long (and often exhausting the further you get in the game) always feel like a brutal back and forth where you're not 100% in control of the situation despite it being turned based. 
The plot and worldbuilding is top notch. it is a sequel to a previous game by Project Moon, Lobotomy Corporation, which also had a hefty amount of quality writing. It's not surprising Library of Ruina has that as well. As a direct sequel, it does expect you to know a bit of the previous game, but even if you don't it does a wonderful job with introducing a protagonist who doesn't know anything either (and frankly, cares about as much as you probably do). 
This is a fantastic RPG I think anyone can enjoy if they can accept a hearty challenge. Unlike Lobotomy Corporation, it isn't completely inpenetrable and oozes with style. I'd feel comfortable recommending this to anyone.",1645321506,1665615550,True,11,4,0.620337069034576416,0,True,False,False

If you love dark, dingy anime settings and don't want to think too deeply about the card game, this is a game worthy of picking up.  The central idea of combat is pretty simple, your enemy will pick cards that execute certain actions, either offensive or defensive and you have to pick cards that will counter those actions as best you can.  As you defeat enemies, you get new character cards that your librarians equip that give them better stats.  Different groups of librarians eventually get different special cards that you can activate when you do well that give bonuses, or bonuses with penalties, to your librarians.  You can replay fights, or even find random ones, by using books you already have to trigger (or retrigger) the encounters, but you also need to burn books to get new cards, so you have to find the balance between keeping a ready stable of cards to replay missions or find random fights, and burning books to gain new cards.  The central problem for me was that ultimately, certain cards are just better than others, so there's very little incentive to redo anything but the latest fights if you get stuck.  And while the story is intriguing, it's not intriguing enough to carry the otherwise uninteresting combat.  If you really love dark anime settings and stories, this will likely scratch your itch, but if you're foremost looking for a good card game, you may want to keep going.",1665459378,1665459378,False,0,1,0.442781329154968262,1,True,False,False

11/10, masterpiece.

This is a deck building game with turn based combat against AI opponents, the progression of the game gives you options on when to do things, but most every fight is mandatory.

The story is mainly delivered through the pre and post fight cutscenes, along with the optional ""realization"" fights giving you exposition on the 2 main characters, angela and roland.
The story is amazingly told, and is imo one of the more beautiful ones in games in general.
HOWEVER, While this game is not as hard as its predecessor lobotomy corporation, it is still very challenging to play through blind. Along with that, while you do not need to 100% the first game to fully understand the plot, beating the first game gives you significantly increased understanding of one of the main characters motives, and a bit more poignancy behind their dialogue near the end.

The soundtrack is astounding and manages to get into my top 3 for bossfight themes.
While the first game, lobotomy corp, locks its ""true"" ending behind doing literally everything in the game, for library of ruina its 3 endings are much more accessible, 100%ing the game is not mandatory for either of them.
That being said, completing the game is a fairly large time investment. Though in my opinion its well worth it.
It has amazing art in it aswell, and many of the attacks in-game are very flashy and appealing to see them pulled off.
There are countless ways to approach most fights, and in general, the game gives you alot of room for creativity in solving problems. Only a handfull of fights force you into a specific solution.

Amazing game, great character designs and writing, god tier world building, amazing plot, and is an in general masterpiece without many flaws.",1665245533,1665245533,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Being a sequel to the notoriously hard Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina changes up its gameplay to be a card collecting, deck building RPG while still containing an amazing narrative and world building. 

Gameplay loop 
While you may think it is a card game similar to StS, you cannot mindlessly play your cards and expect to win, even with meticulous deck setups. 
The overall gameplay loop can be quite satisfying as it boils down to beating new fights, then being able to use the cards and passives of the fight you just did to upgrade your own decks (small praise to the boss fights letting you use most of the same passives and cards they have when you fight them, making them feel like actual bosses when on your side). The game inserts a wide range of unique and thematic archetypes in both the fights you can do and the decks you can build. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of unique archetypes and the ways they were slowly built upon throughout progressing through the game. 
This game has a staggering amount of content, with an average play through taking an estimated 150 hours.

The difficulty is vertical
While the game maintains a smooth difficulty curve at the start to ease you in, it quickly inserts many difficulty spikes along the way as it culminates in a true test of your deck building and game knowledge near the end. 
While the spikes in difficulty can pose a challenge and frustration, it is quite similar to the try and fail cycle of a souls-like game. You will need to refine your deck building and your strategy every time in order to be successful. The main difference that causes more frustration in this game is that your suffering and losses are extended to many, many turns before you lose instead of being over in 2 hits. 
While the game can be difficult at times, the game also gives you a variety of very overpowered decks and builds if you are able to discover them as you level up your deck-building skills. If overpowered builds are not enough for some fights, there may also exist some method of clearing a fights in an unconventional method. The game definitely gives you the options and freedom in order to clear some of the harder fights this way if you are able to use the game knowledge to your advantage. 


Story
While this game is technically a sequel to Lobotomy corporation, it is able to stand on its own if you have not experienced the first game, however as it is a continuation of the first game, the narrative experience would only be heavily enhanced if you have played lobotomy corporation(I just watched a quick summary video to get caught up). 

The main method of story exposition that the game uses is with some good old visual novel style vignettes. These play out usually between fights to add lore and world building to both the guests (enemies) you will face and for the librarians (allies) that you will use to fight.  
In addition to the visual novel exposition, the game further builds on its world and narrative through some optional readings and imagery that can be found on character key pages, combat pages and passives. These are just some extra bits of lore that are sprinkled in if you really care about some characters and story lines. 

There are many literary (and operatic even) references that are littered throughout the game in the story, characters and songs. 
The overall writing style gives such a refreshing and unique narrative that avoids chasing common tropes and trendy story lines that can be mindlessly regurgitated today. The game takes a theme and explores it over the course of its narrative, showing us how the characters can represent their own interpretation of the main theme and what happens when they clash with opposing ideals. Even without the full literary context of the references that the story draws from, the overall narrative is a breath of fresh air and really makes you care about its characters and the struggles they face in this dystopian cyberpunk world.
The story is also fully voiced in korean and the voice acting is quite good even if I don't understand a word. 
Even if it is a korean game, the translation is solid and impressively does not take you away from the story with noticeable grammatical or word errors(In fact, I learned a couple of new words from this game).

Music
The first thing you are treated to when the game begins is an amazing opening song sung by Mili. This is also not the last time you will hear Mili as they will appear again with fully voiced original boss themes created for the game. Each song is a treat and heavily relates to the boss in which the song is composed for. The songs were created with many motifs and symbols from the game, but can still be enjoyed by those who have not play the game at all. 
Even with some amazing songs by Mili, the OST songs for the game, composed by Studio EIM are also no less amazing. Ranging from orchestral, jazz, city pop, EDM, and rock, the soundtrack does a superb job at conveying its representative character themes when tied to the games emotional flux system.

Graphics
While the game borrows a bit of the artstyle from the previous game, it is a bit more refined in Library of ruina as the bigger sprites have more strokes and shading, giving the game an unique artstyle that blends well with the combat. 
The combat graphics itself is similar to darkest dungeons and their 1 key frame attacks which work well within the game thanks to the sound design and feedback of hits and clashes. 
The backgrounds of the game are quite unique and give off that oil painting feel with rich colors and use of layering. 

Cons
While the game is amazing, no game is without flaws. Here are just a couple that bothered me throughout my play through.
- The deck-building interface is a little lacking for how much time you need to spend in there, there should be more options that help you search through cards and passives in an easier way than just searching card names or filters. 
- During combat, the interface can sometimes get in the way of viewing dice info or aiming your combat pages (for example when zoomed in or when you need to pan the camera or hide the passives page to click on a specific speed die. Additionally, the UI makes the game seem a lot more complex than it really is, and to a random viewer who has never played the game, you really cannot tell what is going on.
- The game can get grindy at later points thanks to its gacha system for cards(highly recommended the No-grind mod if you hate grinding at all).
- The tutorial lacks a lot of info, it is basically a huge text dump at the start of the game. While I am happy how the concepts of ranged and mass atk pages are introduced later on once you are a bit more accustomed to game, there is still a lot of information the game omits from you. Whether that is intentionally for the player to discover or just a lack of info on the games side, I cant help but think that the earlier fights should have had more of an emphasis on teaching the player some of the nuanced mechanics through a combination of gameplay and text as opposed to just dumping it all at once. 

I would highly recommend this game for anyone looking for a challenging indie strategy game with a great narrative and music.
As a new fan of Project moon, I have high hopes for their future endeavours and hope they can continue to break the cycle both in games and outside of them.",1664074173,1664130696,True,22,0,0.712014615535736084,0,True,False,False

Don't be Intimidated by the amount of text bombarded to you just by opening your passives because actually getting gud in this game requires you to have a PHD in Planning, Strategy and If you want to Get Gud² you also need to sacrifice your soul to make the optimal build for a single librarian.

(Myo's Prowess on Gebura is the best decision I've ever made)

In this game, the Difficulty spike is steeper and more treacherous than the Mariana Trench if it was a Mountain. 

You could be breezing through levels and actually feel like you're good only for the next stage to bend you over, stab you, take your wallet, Your Dignity and Your Chastity before finally throwing you in a ditch, And you'll be lucky if it's in that order.

In combat, Reading the Enemy's 
Cards, Passives, Buffs, IP address and Spatial Orientation is paramount in late game, Where attacks take whole square meters of meat off your guys, Learning thy enemy is almost as important as beating them with a lead pipe.

Of course there are still E.G.O suits but unlike LC (Not counting the Sync Cards), Most Ego cards are to be used Once and left on a cooldown once used. 

These cards can either change the direction of a battle or do jack shit because you tried to use 4th match flame against Rhino Ram.

And just like that, All your planning, Contingencies and Blood Sacrifices are null and void as you are beaten to death with a flagpole.

Oh. Did I mention we use dice here too?

Dice rolls are just as good as they sound, And by that I mean you'll be rolling minimum rolls for 4 Hours straight only for the enemy to consistently roll max. 

As stated before if your rolls are trash even your strongest moves will do jack shit.

If your cards are trash, You will do jack shit.

Speaking of: Cards or Pages as this game calls them.

Cards can be boiled down to:
How many times and How hard can I hit this bastard? 
Or:
If this Block dice Fails, I will instantly die.

Pages are your main method of attack, Most of them deal damage and some of them deal much more damage under specific conditions or trigger beneficial effects

Take for Example: Singleton Cards, Only One of these must exist in a deck for it's effect to be activated.

Will of the Prescripts: If Singleton, Draw 3 Cards.

Multislash: If Singleton Draw 1 Page and Restore 2 Light.

Building your deck around these cards are essential in most fights, As a Singleton Player myself, I find Singleton Decks to be consistent with Pages at the ready almost at all times I only have to worry about light.

Closing this Half Awake 3 AM Review, Library of Ruina is a Fun, Strategic and Torturous game with enough words to fill a 34 page smut fan fic. But the story is interesting and its punishing gameplay makes you really plan things out, with you often having to come up with plans and plan Bs on the fly. Strategy and Reading go hand in hand and in this game, Mastery of Both is Just the start of your long, tear filled and broken desked journey.

9.2/10 The Library has Ruined My Eyesight, This isn't a joke.

They eventually start to randomly wander into your library, where you greet them, murder them and make books out of them for your Korean tomboy dominatrix waifu - so that she can read their lives as a story instead of talking with them like a normal person.
Oh, also, you start falling in love with the dominatrix bookworm even though she tore off your legs and arms due to Stockholm sindrome.
The only good thing about this game is the soundtrack.

Gameplay:
You make a deck of 8-9 cards or so, make a team of 1-5 people, choose passive abilities and then fight ""library guests"" to progress the story, taking their cards and passive abilities once you defeat them.
However, their passive abilities and cards are outright better than yours, so after every fight you're going to have to change passives and deck of every single one of your party members (which is goddamn tedious...)
How does one round of combat resolve?
you initiate combat, both you and the enemy roll speed dice, which determines the order in which cards will be played (but not really! Since there's a shitton of exceptions like ranged/mass attacks, clashes, etc)
after the speed dice are rolled, your enemy selects what cards he will play and at what targets, you can then select your own targets and your own cards.
Every card contains a number of offensive or defensive dice
there are 3 types of offensive dice, slashing, piercing and bludgeoning (some characters have different resistances and stagger resistances)
there are 2 types of defensive dice:
evasion and protection - evasion can dodge an infinite amount of attacks as long as you keep on rolling higher than your opponent whilst protection reduces the damage taken by an attack by the rolled value, or deals stagger damage if your roll is higher
Example of an interaction:
Card A has 2-8 evasion die and a 1-3 slashing die
Card B has 6 piercing 2-3 dice
Card A evasion rolls: 5, 4, 3, 2
Card A slashing rolls: 2
Card B slashing rolls: 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3
Result:
5 (evasion) beats 3 (slashing), A dodges takes 0 dmg
4 (evasion) beats 3 (slashing), A dodges takes 0 dmg
3 (evasion) beats 2 (slashing), A dodges takes 0 dmg
3 (evasion) beats 2 (slashing), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)
3 (slashing) beats 2 (slashing), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)
3 (slashing) beats 0 (no die), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)

if it was protection instead of evasion it would play out like:
5 (protection) beats 3 (slashing), A takes 0 dmg and deals 2 stagger dmg
3 (slashing) beats 2 (slashing), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)
2 (slashing) beats 0 (no die), B hits and deals 2 dmg (and stagger dmg)
3 (evasion) beats 0 (no die), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)
3 (slashing) beats 0 (no die), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)
3 (slashing) beats 0 (no die), B hits and deals 3 dmg (and stagger dmg)

Do you know WHY I wrote this step by step interaction?
BECAUSE THE GAME DOESN'T EXPLAIN JACK SHIT, and if you want to try playing this, you better Google for some tutorials/guides because the game manual ain't for shit.
I'm 60 hours in and i still do not fully grasp how the fuck combat works.

there are also counter dice which i have no goddamn clue how - interact with the world
after a while you get multiple speed dice per character, which brings a whole lot of fucked up interactions which are incredibly tedious to manage as the UI continues to fight you (FUCKING CLASHES)",1659908507,1662398442,False,3,0,0.463305503129959106,0,True,False,False

No. 
Game's not fun.

EDIT: Finally beat the game after 200+ hours. My opinion hasn't changed but I feel like I should explain myself better.
The game is a pain in the ass to play, everything's dependant on dice rolls and they will fuck you over. It's also a card game on which enemies are constantly playing by different rules than you, and they will 90% of the time have access to better cards than yours. 
The game is nothing but an uphill battle, with zero downtime and zero chance to at least enjoy your achievements. ""Oh, you beat a very hard fight? Here's an even harder one!"" beginning to end. 200+ hours of this. 

""But why would you put yourself through this?"" Two reasons. 
First reason, I loved Lobotomy Corporation and I felt obliged to play through this as well. Lob Corp is another game filled with punishment, but that punishment felt deserved, the game was always hard but never* unfair. Even more than that, clearing a hard challenge gives you a clear reward with benefits that stay relevant until the end of the game. And after each hard day there's a period of respite where you as a player can enjoy what you earned in peace.

Second reason , the story. While the gameplay sucks and I hate it with all my soul, the story's great and it kept me hooked through 200+ hours of CBT because it made me want to see what happened next. It's like reading a great book that gives you paper cuts every time you pass the page. By the end you feel fullfilled but your fingers are covered in bandaids. 

TL;DR: Game is not fun.

Library of Ruina is a work of beauty. 

I would call it one of the rare few truly well defined games with a very clear vision and direction. It's not a direction that might agree with most, but it's certainly a game that caters to its niche incredibly well. 

Developed by ProjectMoon, the game is a primarily story based work that is heavily inspired by classical literature such as The Library of Babel which serves as its namesake. It draws heavily from poetry, history, and myth, to draw interesting parallels in its dystopian setting to our own reality. 

The story, at its core, is actually fairly simple in concept. However, in execution, it is a masterful work of dystopian fiction that makes excellent work of its dystopian setting as a framing device for setting the stage for the titular Library, where the story is focused on. 
Instead of clinging to basic nihilistic themes common to dystopian fiction, Library of Ruina excels in forging its own path like a flower blooming in mud. A seed of light in a moonlit world, one might say. It combines a VN style story with complex deck builder gameplay that ties directly into the story itself, complemented by amazing music by Studio EIM and Mili; and further enhanced by a very charming anime-esque aesthetic. 
The only downside, regarding the story, worth mentioning is that it’s harder to appreciate the characters of the Library without playing Lobtomy Corporation(the game that this is a sequel to). One might also argue that this game does not exactly tie up all of its loose ends, but I believe that to be a fair and natural result of this game being a stepping stone for the developers to develop their universe.

While I do consider its charm to be primarily story based, I also have nothing but wholehearted praise for its gameplay which is suitably unique for its genre as a deck builder game. Most would compare this game to Slay the Spire, which is a fair comparison, but I also believe it stands very strongly on its own with its slew of unique mechanics and gameplay/story integration. 

Even after completing this game, I still find myself coming back to play it just for simple enjoyment. It’s rare to find an Early Access game as well thought out as this, much less one this polished. I have not played this game as much as others, for I only started playing it quite late into it’s Early Access, but I followed it at the recommendation of a good friend of mine and have been impressed for a very long time.

Certainly, it has its fair share of bugs, but the developers have proven themselves to be highly competent at ironing out the kinks and communicating with their players. Their clear vision and intent to create a game for a clearly intended audience instead of recklessly reaching for the masses is something I deeply respect.

There’s also a cosmetic element to the game that allows you to heavily customise your Assistant Librarians and their appearance that I find to be relatively charming with Steam Workshop support and the already intrinsic customisation system they have. This is something that I believe greatly supports roleplaying and personalisation.

What I respect even more is their drive and ambition, along with their ceaseless passion and creativity that has led to this wonderful amalgamation of story and gameplay. Although young, I believe that ProjectMoon has a very firm grasp on the identity of their company and the types of games they want to make. 

The development cycle of Library of Ruina as an Early Access title was not exactly smooth sailing, but the journey the developers and fans have walked has produced something magical that I can only wholeheartedly recommend. 

The game has a steep learning curve, especially in it’s penultimate chapter. It’s not the kind of game that anyone can play, which would make it hard to recommend to most, but for those who enjoy fair but demanding challenges, this is definitely a game worth trying. If not for the gameplay, then for its story. 

I personally consider the story to be brilliant, human, and very well presented. I will not speak deeply of my opinions on the story beyond that, for I believe that a story can have many different interpretations. In this world, and our own, there are as many people as there are stars in the skies; each one a story of their own with views of their own.  

In closing, this is mine: I believe Library of Ruina is an amazing game and an experience that should be tried at least once should you find yourself interested in the genre and interested in a fairly unique experience.",1624598505,1660353445,True,10,0,0.611503899097442627,0,True,False,False
1256670,120087075,76561198006787752,0,6,5473,0,5473,1654653069,"Library of Ruina is a deckbuilder game that takes place in a dystopian megacity. Its story is told through visual-novel style cutscenes (though there are almost no choices), and covers multiple factions and storylines at once. It takes place directly after its predecessor Lobotomy Corp and spoils its true (canonical) ending in the process, though it doesn't go into enough detail to reveal everything that happened at L. Corp.

Like its predecessor, Library of Ruina is an excellent game that tries to mix a lot of ideas together, but is hamstrung by the fact that a number of those ideas, while interesting, do more harm than good to your enjoyment of the game. To its credit, LoR is IMO a far more fun game than L. Corp, and it has far more good ideas than bad ones. 

Pros: 
- Absolutely fantastic music. Easily one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a game. 

- A very fresh and interesting take on a dystopian world that, unlike many other dystopian games, doesn't borrow heavily from common existing tropes such as cyberpunk stuff. Project Moon borrows ideas from the SCP Foundation, but adds enough of its own stuff to make the world feel entirely their own. Their games have a very unique feel that I really like.

- I liked the game's story, and finding out what happened next was my main motivation to play more.

- The game's card system offers a lot of opportunity for experimentation when deckbuilding. If you like building, rebuilding, and tweaking decks a lot, this is a good game for that. You never sit on one deck for long.

- The game's fights are thematically and mechanically very varied. Different factions in the game all have their own fighting styles, so you have to figure out how to fight them as you go. The more difficult fights can get so mechanically complicated that they remind me of MMO raid bosses.

- The game is very open with its information. You can see your enemies' cards, which card they will play, and all card descriptions. The only issue is that there can be a lot of information to process at times. 

- I rather like the game's art style and voice acting.

- The game as a whole is a lot more slick and well-made than L. Corp. The devs have really improved across the board.

- The game has built-in modding tools, and there are mods available that bypass a lot of the cons I list below. 


Cons:
- The game is grindy. The way you get new cards is by opening books, which drop from your enemies when you defeat them. Books are basically in-game lootboxes, and opening one doesn't always give you all the cards that are available from that book. Meaning that if you want more cards, you need to redo a story chapter and defeat more of that enemy to get more books to open. This can get *really* tedious, but there is a no-grind mod to bypass this.

- The game is brutally hard, and there is no way to change the difficulty outside of modding it. Starting at around the 1/3 to halfway point of the game, it's not unusual to take multiple tries before you can clear each new chapter. While that on its own is fine, the problem is that this game pairs that high difficulty with a high barrier to retrying as well. Most difficult games counterbalance their difficulty by making it easier to retry, but LoR does the opposite. The next point explains why.

- Playing a chapter in the story consumes a book (or more than one) that drops from the previous chapter as an entry ticket, which means that if you fail the fight in that chapter, you need to go and redo the previous chapter to get more books to use as entry tickets before you can try again, and the books you need don't drop 100% of the time. It feels pointlessly grindy and unnecessarily punishing to do this. 

- The game doesn't explain its own mechanics very well. I felt at least partly lost pretty much through most of the game, and the fact that so many new chapters introduced new combat mechanics in the way different people fought didn't help with that confusion. It's a lot of information to take in. I get the impression that this is one of those games where you feel lost for pretty much your entire first playthrough, and you only start feeling comfortable with its mechanics either at the very end of the game, or if you do a second playthrough.

- The storytelling can be hard to follow at times. It tells multiple storylines at the same time, with each storyline following a given faction of the game. It can be hard to keep up with all the new factions and characters being thrown at you, and it's easy to forget at least a few characters along the way. 


Points that can be good or bad, depending on what you're looking for:
- This game is really long. It's probably around 100 hours or more for one playthrough. I took about 90ish, though I used mods to make the game easier and remove the grinding halfway through. 

- Some of the late game fights are very complicated and very, very long. Some fights can take well over an hour to complete, even if you're sort of familiar with them. More difficult enemies will phase change, spawn adds, or transform halfway through the fight, and each time this happens, you want to stop and read all the new cards and passive abilities to figure out what you're supposed to do. It's a lot of information to process, and that in itself can take a long time. To top it all off, if you fail any part of that, you'll wipe and have to start over. It's not uncommon to wipe in phase 5 of a boss fight 45 minutes in, then have to go through those 45 minutes again just to get to the part you were trying to figure out. That's the kind of game this is.

- The game leans hard into its dystopian themes and gets very grimdark at times. The recurring theme of the story is that life sucks for pretty much everyone in the city, and the game does not shy from showing you just how many ways life sucks. Whether this comes across as interesting storytelling or anime edgelord stuff is probably entirely up to your own tastes. Personally I think that while it's very dark, it's too well thought out to be edgy crap, and is much more in line with horror writing. The Love Town storyline in particular is some of the most unsettling stuff I've read in a while.


Overall I really enjoyed this game, but the grindiness and difficulty really put me off at the same time. I ended up installing mods to get around those two issues because I was about to drop the game otherwise. I'm glad I did, because I felt that the good parts of the game were too good to pass up. I really enjoyed both L.Corp and LoR despite their flaws, and will keep an eye out for Project Moon games in the future.",1659671892,1660352625,True,13,1,0.666389882564544678,0,True,False,False

Every fight in this game gives you that 'fist pump' feeling once you have won, and most of them are well balanced such that you end up winning by just a hair on your first or second try.

I think the mechanics are mostly fine. It's an attempt to innovate on a few pieces of stale card battler mechanics, and that alone is praiseworthy.

Unfortunately, the game doesn't respect your time. Even after you become familiar enough with the mechanics to know, at a glance, what a given exchange is going to do, going through five batches of idiots with four speed dice and four to ten cards to match them against five other idiots and their three to four speed dice is just a gross slog. 

You'll start to get the impression that the game developers don't respect their players once you get to the third and fourth big rungs. You'll get a number of fights against really beefy guys, self-reviving guys, and defense mechanic guys that just take forever without presenting a challenge. This reaches its fever pitch at a fight called ""The Crying Children,"" with seven phases and a defense mechanic based a smidge on luck, at least for the first part of half of those phases.

If that one fight were it, a one-off issue with one designer who just really liked angelic motifs and creepy child giggling so much that s/he wanted the fight to last for an hour, I'd probably flip that thumb upside down. I'd be hesitant given how many of the fights surrounding those bits are also just lengthy number matching bores, but still, if it's not representative of a whole philosophy of disrespecting your player, I'd still go for it.

Nope. Each of the apex floor challenges is a similar slog through five or so bosses you've already done, all in a row, with a different character representation and some neat story fluff as to what's going down.

Repetitive challenges are not good game design. Sticking the player in the same place for ages to wear them down, while in theme with the game, isn't good game design. In particular, copying content from the front and tacking it onto the back to stretch your content isn't good game design.

It's a crying damn shame to say it, because I really love the writing these guys have going on, but the mechanical presentation is too lacking to make it worthwhile. Save your thirty bucks. Read the wiki instead.",1660200652,1660200862,False,20,0,0.565267801284790039,5,True,False,False

Buy the game, buy the OST, grab some tea and start praying to RNG.
If you want a challenging CONSTRUCTED single player deck builder and not one where you pick up cards as you go like Slay the Spire, this game should be on your radar

[h1][u] Pros[/u] [/h1]
    • Many options for deck archetypes to mess around with. Everything that I’ve come across so far seems viable, but some are stronger than others.
    • Challenging battles and special “abnormality” fights that play more like puzzles so you can’t run through the entire game without ever changing your decks.
    • Innovative and deep battle system that I haven’t seen very often (or at all)
    • Interesting setting with tons of world building and a gritty story that’s a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation. Knowing what happened in Lobotomy Corp will make the story here more impactful but it’s not required to know what’s going on. You can more or less pick up what happened by reading the story told in Library of Ruina.
    • OST is fantastic. I had to buy it. It’s more than just nice to listen to or good music; it changes to fit the situation and adds to the atmosphere of some of the bigger battles.

[h1][u] Cons[/u] [/h1]
    • The game is very complicated, but extremely rewarding if you understand it, which will take some time. 
    • The tutorial is… not the best. It’ll teach you the basics and most of the important concepts, but you’ll have to read the in-game manual if you want to know how all of the interactions work and some of the more complex mechanics.",1660075404,1660075404,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Library of Ruina is a direct sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, both in events and characters (as strange as that may seem at a glance).

It's a non-roguelike deck/team-building game, where you progress through encounters that gives unique rewards which allows you to further expand your team and progress.

The setting of the game is a high-tech dystopian setting, a mega-city just called The City, where homeless people struggle everyday to get by, mercenaries called Fixers do work from finding a lost cat to full on warfare, criminals called Syndicates mirror Fixers in work, super-corporations called Wings make their bank while hiding both the nature of their technology, and their horrific practices.

You invite all these colourful characters to the Library, where you both fight to the death, where those invited will get books (information) that they want, or turn into books themselves when they lose (which is used to get rewards).

And with these rewards, one can also create really funky builds.

Through this, one explores the setting with all the different people that in habit it, learning more about things like Fixers, Syndicate, Wings, and the very nature of The City.

Here's a tidbit about the setting:

Library of Ruina is a game set directly after Lobotomy Corporation (and some comics made by Project Moon), where you're the morally ambiguous guys who beat up people in the titular library because Angela decided that she craves books...and depression.

The gameplay is pretty good, though it is luck based due to the combat being decided by dice (How hard you hit a person and if you get to hit them as an example) but it lends itself somewhat nicely once you figure it all out. No promises on rolling minimum five times in a row though...

The art style fits the world you're in this time while still keeping some stylized aspects about it (white/grey skin for select characters and your little buddy librarians) and helps to get you immersed in the city the game is set in!

Your employees return with a promotion to Librarian! (How good that promotion is to them is debatable) Now with some more customization options available like being able to change their skin/eye color, make custom dialogue for them during fights, and dress them up in the clothes of your enemies! Now you can make Yesod look like the dolt he always was.

The Sephirah return! Sporting nice fancy library attire to accommodate their new job and with a new outlook on their lives to boot! Dress them up in the coolest/dumbest outfits, they can't stop you!

My one gripe with the game? It can be a ""tad""...difficult sometimes, though that's probably because my strategy accumulates in making a shoddy set up that's somewhat combined to fit a style and then being immediately proven that I gotta rework it...or that's my luck gaslighting me.

 But that's all I can say! Except for that if you plan on playing this game, PLEASE get caught up on Lobotomy Corporation, I highly recommend it too but I understand that the gameplay it has is not for everyone, still, you can watch videos about it from lets players or people who've compiled the story into one big video. There are MASSIVE spoilers for Lobotomy Corporation in Library of Ruina due to the fact that it's a direct sequel.

That's all I have to say! Good luck out there fellow Librarian, and may you find your place in this game.

[b] Second Half: 4/10. Did you forget we were playing a Project Moon game? [/b]

This game is good, which is why I am giving it a thumbs-down. It tricks you into thinking you are playing a good game, and then reveals to you the bitter truth of its quality.

The first half is impeccable. Naturally, a grind-removal mod is required in order to manually correct the dreadful pacing set by the game's 'book-burning' booster pack-esque system to acquire new cards, but otherwise, it's pretty good, and it is reminiscent of games like Darkest Dungeon.

The latter half is where some glaring design faults come into play. To provide some context, this is a card-game JRPG, where the characters' moves are cards and they expend a mana-like resource called 'Light' in order to use them. In the early game, most characters can play one card per turn, with uncommon mini-bosses having the ability to use two.

Eventually, by late-game, every character is expected to be able to use two cards per turn and more, as time goes on. With any fight that lasts more than a few turns, your characters eventually have the capacity to use three or more cards per turn.

A CRITICAL design flaw is made obvious out of this design choice: a character draws only one page per turn, but can use over three per turn. Inevitably, a character will 'crap out' and end up using one card per turn with an empty hand, which severely limits their effectiveness -- and as far as I can tell, the enemy characters are unaffected by a similar restriction. In addition, using many cards per turn -- which is necessary to keep up with the enemy force's onslaught -- costs a lot of Light resource to do, and inevitably your characters will also 'crap out' due to a lack of Light mana to actually cast their cards.

As consequence, EVERY DECK is required to have cards that draw more cards, as well as cards that add Light back into your pool. A deck that does not have both will 'crap out' and become useless after ~4-6 turns.

This doesn't sound bad until I tell you that a deck can have different 9 cards, with a limit of 3 copies per card.

Ergo, a third -- or more -- of your deck is SOLELY populated by light-card recovery cards, and this is an efficient build. Late-game, many of these recovery cards require the pseudo-buff called Charge to use, where Charge is generated using certain cards and is expended using the recovery cards.

This means that, in the late-game, your deck will consist of:

- 2 - 3 cards to generate Charge.
- 2 - 3 cards to expend Charge, recover Light, and draw cards.
- 3 - 5 cards to actually play the game with.

With, at MINIMUM, half of your deck being dedicated SOLELY to recovering light and drawing cards... you can see where the creativity in builds die, right?

In addition, each character can use a set of passive abilities called a 'Keypage', where equipping a different Keypage grants that character with different health stats, speed values, resistances, and passive abilities. Many of these Keypages in the late-game necessitate that they are built a specific way, or are damned to be useless. Many of them end up falling off entirely, and become unusable.

[b] tl;dr -- monotonous, tedious deck-building that railroads the player into building every deck a certain way makes this game suck hard past mid-game and anyone who gave this game a Thumbs Up stopped playing after Urban Plague [/b]



EDIT, MANY HOURS LATER:

I still agree with a majority of the points here, having beaten the game and played it over again, many times. Obviously, there's better ways to recover resources outside of Charge, but they're locked at the very end of the game where there are only a few fights left (if any).

Still creatively bankrupt from a gameplay perspective, but also from a writing perspective: it strikes me as an uninspiring and generic 'tween's first dystopia' world.",1631993706,1659476959,False,23,13,0.491544902324676514,1,True,False,False

and a superb ""successor"" to the lobotomy corperation game

it gets very complex though and theres a lot to keep in mind
and the difficulty curve jumps up every couple of fights (is managable if you make use of everything possible)


the method of obtaining cards can be grindy (repeatedly doing the same fights) but can be completly avoided with the ""NO GRIND"" mod that gives you 9999 cards from burning books. The only downside is from what ive read is that some cards that are suppossed to be limited in number also get changed to 9999 cards.


Edit:
finished the game at about 180 hours its possible to beat it a lot faster if you actually read what the passives do lol. and use your passive attribution thingy + dont forget about general receptions because the cards they give are awesome

got all the achievements at about 200 hours of playtime.
The difficulty spike is vertical. 

tips:
Take breaks if your stuck. Some things can absolutly be cheesed if your desprete (most methods are on youtube). You can brute force nearly everything in the game. 
For me the most important part to ""git gud"" was to expiriment with diffirent cards and passives to find my own playstyle.  also when clashing always estimate the attack and defence value rolls   usually its the average between the two numbers (1-12  => probably 6    ;  3-6 => 4 or 5 ).

    /rest is somewhat ""spoilery"" to the deck building/progression stuff
in the beginning of the game where fights rarely reach emotion lvl5, you can build decks with barely any draw cards or light restore cards, since you regain all your light and draw extra cards with each emotion lvl.
at some point youll start to get longer fights in which the characters reach emotion lvl5. your not gonna have any light to use your cards or not have enough cards to use at all. 
So usually the rule of thumb is 2-3 light restore cards (1 or 2 of them can be conditional like on clash win) 2-3 card draw cards (if your good enough all of them can be conditional).

Longer explanation:

I'm sad to say NO to this game, I'd actually love to be in between since this one is a GREAT game with very interesting mechanics and it's very challenging, but I can't really recommend a game that just doesn't want you to play.

I loved Lobotomy Corporation and I love Library of Ruina, the story in both is very interesting and the execution is beautiful, with lots of mechanics to discover and understand.

In short, This game is NOT for players who don't have that passion to understand its mechanics and delve into the story, but it falters in something essential.

Spoilers aside and with no pro/con, I prefer to explain it as follows:

Library of Ruina starts strong with a TCG+RPG battle system and a visual novel story style, the characters and story are kind of deep, nasty, full of gore and selfishness. As I said, the gameplay starts strong, it makes you think of your actions and roll dies to your best luck, you'll beat nobodies and climb up the story ladder, meeting with some strong fellas who you need to beat and climb even higher to uncover all the secrets, earn valuable cards (attacks) and pages (equipment), getting stronger each single chapter until...

Until, that's why I can't recommend it, usually an RPG gives you an option to grind if you feel too weak or you cant realize a strategy to beat a certain enemy, which, in this game there's a lot of it (Not that much grinding), cards sometimes have special effects and most boss fights have a certain gimmick, figuring out the gimmick is recommended at first and I do mean ""at first"". As we all know, game progression makes bosses harder, well this game takes that too serious, making bosses unfair, up to a point where ""luck"" matters, if you read some guides for later fights, you'll find ""use this, do X, prepare Y and hope for the best"" for certain fights.

The game is beatable, many have done it and I myself have gotten really far, up to the last fight of the game (At least I've not seen any guides for that one) and I didn't take it lightly, I studied, I looked up some guides for certain battles, I did everything to win and leaving guides as a last resort when I really couldn't do it on my own... And I still can't beat the game, I really had to cheat in certain ones or mod the game, etc, which isn't very nice, I don't really like beating games like that and only resort to moding when I'm already tired of a game (yes, I got tired of it).

Quick explanation of what's unfair:
Your attacks are cards with cost from 0 to 3 light (and some cost more but are powerful) you regain some light each turn and earn more as you progress, some cards have a passive to regain light, but you can run out.
Easy, right? now throw an over powered boss that can target everyone with 2 cards at the same time and does massive damage, those cards cost 0 and boss' passive is ""regain all light each scene"".
Not nice? well what about ""Shuffle all cards into deck and grab new ones, their cost becomes 0"" that's an enemy only skill.

If you read all of this, thanks, I hope you like the game, I did, but I wouldn't really recomend it to everyone, just for its artificial dificulty spike as AI isn't outsmarting the player, it just becomes downright unfair.",1659296945,1659296945,False,103,3,0.737888097763061523,13,True,False,False

I love the world so much, with how fucked up it is and dystopian, yet somehow normal people can become as strong as dbz characters with reality destroying moves, that make them more like monsters, than the actual monsters in the game. 

The gameplay, while very confusing, is also really good and fun and in-depth. It definitely feels like you need a doctorate to play this game or understand whats going on, i didn't play it for awhile when it first came out, but when i came back i just brute forced it until things started to make sense. Of course googling tutorials helps a lot too. The whole gimmick of defeating threats to the library and gaining their powers makes every new character you learn of exciting, cause you get to basically absorb more and more powerful people, and make your librarians unstoppable. But of course despite how powerful you become, the enemies keep somehow being infuriatingly powerful towards the end, it gets really fucking hard, despite how unstoppable you become.

The game start becoming repetitive. It fun for the first few hours but became tedious and boring the longer you play it.

Performance, is terrible. A lot of unnecessary resources was being loaded even though they aren't used.

Community. Well how do i put this. Toxic, especially the english community. There is a few good people but the bad people is too much. The japanese community is nice though so i recommend going there instead if you want a welcoming community.

Workshop, bad. I've been modding this game for more than 2 year. Watched how mod community grows and the game development as well. When they decided to make separate game version. They introduced LorId. Which make a lot of mod broken. While it indeed avoid a lot of mod conflict. The mod support is a joke. We still need to manually change things on our own to make something like mass attack card.

There is a lot of low effort mod in the workshop. I get it that its mostly just a joke mod but c'mon. Even the good mod is just all visual and has copy pasted code from other mod that pretty much doesnt introduce anything new.

Conclusion, only buy this game if you want to. While on discount. Otherwise if you're looking for a good card game i suggest Slay the Spire.",1607279580,1657736425,False,2,4,0.340421944856643677,1,True,False,False

The story is intensely compelling; it somehow managing to be horrifically macabre at one moment, and speculative on the human condition the next. This game touches on a lot of emotions, and to say it was a rollercoaster would be a massive understatement. While the game is a direct sequel to Project Moon's first game, Lobotomy Corporation, the games does a very good job of summarizing the events of the previous game to the point where you don't really need to play the previous title to enjoy this one. Though I would still recommend at least watching a youtube video of someone playing lobotomy corp, since the throwbacks made in this game are very satisfying.

The gameplay is difficult, to say the very least. It's often joked that the difficulty curve here is vertical, and I've gotta say, without the power of the internet helping me build better decks and and passive ability sets, I never would've made it halfway though the game. It's definitely possible to use the most powerful ""cheese"" strats to blow past most of the game, but even then I found there to be many fights that left me completely drained by the end, hanging on by the barest skin of my teeth.

The visuals are quite unique for this kind of ""visual novel hybrid"" sort of game. Especially during cutscenes, there were a lot of moments that elicited a ""woah"" reaction from me, such as when the screen would crack and become bloodied if a character was severely injured. During battles, the hit effects also change depending on the type of move and how big of a blow was made. All of it comes together to really sell you on the moment, and results in a much more immersive experience.

The music is a toss-up between genuine bangers and lyrical masterpieces, especially for those written by Mili. I'd listened to the album, ""To Kill a Living Book,"" many times over before playing the game, but nothing compares to listening to them in-game with all the context behind those lyrics playing out in front of you. On the other hand, the battle BGM you hear for each floor also bops, with the music evolving to become more and more hype as the battle goes on, even switching tracks depending on which side is winning. I've always been a sucker for adaptive music in games, and this is no exception.

I hate writing conclusions, so for this impromptu essay summarizing all my feelings after beating the game, I'll just say this:

Gameplay is very fun, however at arround the urban plague levels you might get stuck for a bit. At times like these its good to just take a step back and maybe stop for a bit, come back later and kick the enemies asses. Progression feels good. A con however is that you keep unlocking new cards and therefor need to update your deck every time you want to use them. Deckbuilding is fun however so don't let that stop you.

Short abnormality fights are generally fun, learn their gimmicks, build a deck that suits their gimmick, and it doesn't take long to restart whenever something goes wrong. 
But ""boss"" fights that generally take around 40 minute to clear, (with a brand new gimmick fight that you've never encountered placed at the very end), feels horrible to play when you have to lose a 40min session just because you've brought a deck that doesn't suit the very last gimmick.

There's a lot of decision making not only while you're fighting, but even before that when you're gearing up your characters. Honestly, your battle prep is like 75% of the battle; you're constantly getting new stuff to gear up with that you have to stay on top of it if you wanna win. There have been times where I just simply could not beat a fight because my pages were lacking, so what I did is kill as much as I could to get some of the same pages that were killing me, or just go and do another fight that might be a tad easier, and just gear up as much as possible.

The dice system does open the gates to a lot of RNG, but that's part of the experience. Sometimes you're gonna get bodied by bad RNG, but there are also times where you steamroll with good rolls. I've pulled comebacks out of nowhere due to good RNG and it's always exciting. This is also another factor for your battle prep: you have to think of ways to mitigate bad RNG with your builds, both in and out of fights.

There are a lot of references to the developer's previous game, Lobotomy Corporation (this game is actually a sequel to that one), but you don't really need to play it to enjoy it.

Overall, it's been pulled off nicely without being too overwhelming.

The defensive skills dont work since you have to dice to make them work. (higher number wins)

I would highly recommend looking up the story of Lobotomy Corporation before starting this game (optional but it improves the experience). You have lots of interweaving stories with plenty of optional reading (page descriptions) if you want to dig deeper into this world. There's tons of theory crafting that can go into building decks and new options are thrown at you left and right as you gain the abilities of your opponents. The combat has a lot of randomness considering it involves literal dice rolls but there are lots of ways to mitigate this randomness. The art and music are top-notch. This game may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is a darn good cup of tea.

My only complaint about this game, and a fairly major one, is that the later stages can be especially long and difficult. There are no difficulty settings so your only options would be to give up or build better decks, possibly after some light grinding (thankfully, the grind has been significantly reduced since early access).

I highly recommend it if you are a fan of great stories with fantastic writing. All of the characters are given a backstory with depending amount of screentime, including the trash mobs you farm. Despite being the sequal of Lobotomy Corporation, you don't need any kind of knowlage from there to understand whats going on or know about characters. The game does good enough job to reintroduce them in a not-boring fashion.

  As for it's gameplay, it is a turn-based card game on it's core. Game does good job with introducing its mechanics and giving you tools to utilize it.

The story is amazing and the combat is very fun. There is a lot of depth in deck building and how you approach encounters. Each librarian has their own playstyle and it works so well with the card system.

Gameplay : Card game with unique elements thrown in. Beginning starts out really simple and by the end its really complicated. Story is told through a visual novel esque style, essentially still images where characters talk and interact. A massive amount of cards, play styles, deck styles, character styles etc are all present and you will need to be building top of the line decks by mid-late game to progress. This is not a game where you can throw ♥♥♥♥ together and have it just work, every part of your deck needs to be fine tuned and synergistic (at the very least you need to do this at endgame).

Graphics : Love it or hate it really, its unique and personally grew on me by hour 3. Card art is fantastic, combat animation and fluidity is stellar. Character design is also brilliant, every enemy has a unique feel and every abnormality feels special in its own way.

Music : Songs by Mili whos style I don't really like at all except for maybe 3 of her songs in this game? Anyway if you don't like her music it doesn't crop up to often. 95% of the soundtrack is some form of piano, violin, orchestra electric stuff? Hard to describe really as it varies quite greatly, but they are all so good and captures the atmosphere.

Setting : Grimdark setting so expect some edge, some cringe, gore, and other topics related as such. Personally I found it a little cringey at some points but ended up getting really involved with the characters and story so I didn't care.

Story : Sequel game but you don't have to play the previous game. All info you need can be derived from playing and reading the story as it appears. Story is fairly simple and average quality with ups and downs.

Difficulty : Extreme. Very extreme. It goads you into a false sense of security before absolutely wrecking your ♥♥♥♥. And when you hit that vertical spike in difficulty, you will realize that every fight after that is another vertical spike, and then another, and then another. It can be very frustrating since it partially relies on rng elements, and then partially on how well you understand the game. There is some minor grinding in the game, namely for farming the best pages as they might not drop on first clear, or not enough of them drop.

Bugs : No bugs encountered

Recommendation : Recommend if you like the deck building format. If you can stomach visual novel type storytelling then go for it. If your fine with the game getting very difficult and taking over 100 hours to clear then go for it. You will spend most of your time building decks and fighting battles so if you like that then there you go.

Personal: Great game but it has pissed me off way more than once. Never lucky.",1647737698,1654806137,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

In this case, you kill them and turn them into books which allow you to morph into them and define your stats. You likewise gain attacks from cards also received upon killing them. Of note, the ""enemies"" that you kill are mostly helpless passersby that you lure into this library. Sometimes if you murder them in just the right configuration, you get an accessory that gives a very tiny boost to your character.

Battles are mostly short, which is greatly appreciated, and dying doesn't set you back anything. Unfortunately, the game itself drags on far too long (why would I spend 150 hours on this?) and primarily drags you down in setting up far too many interchangeable clones (up to 50 of them?) all with their own bodies, cards, and accessories when you only fight with 3-5 at a time.

The gameplay is deep and challenging, and just random enough from dice rolls to be exciting and fun without feeling unfair. Only cons I had are (1) some battles get a bit too slow as you progress up, where you know you're going to win but you still have to go through the (long) motions, (2) the UI for building your decks kind of sucks. You will accrue a lot of useless cards that just clutter your inventory, and the controls and shortcuts aren't very intuitive, and finally (3) there is a slight grind if you want multiple copies of certain cards or if you lose the next story battle. In some ways this is fun because you get to replay and master a match (or see if you just got lucky the first time), but other times it's an 'easy' fight, just tedious and long to get through...

It's not superclear at the start, but it's not hard to pick up the basis and learn.

It's easily a 50+ hrs game, and I'm far from finishing it, but the story has already passed my interest. I feel like in the hours I played it never really started to get going, the stories about the characters going to the library were all pretty boring except for one or two little stories, and it's recommended to read pages after pages of their backstory after spending 10 mins in combat with them and being done, lol. Maybe it's an immersion thing I don't get, since we're employed at the library?

To be fair, you can enjoy the story and have a lot of lore to consume if you are a teen or younger, FOR WHAT I'VE SAW, but to say the story is pretentious, it's to say the least. You can have an idea of how pompous and inflated the names of some enemies or places were. A lot of them just fell flat after seeing how fucking stupid the lore or design of said enemies were.
In the end, it's still a positive review for me, since it gets carried hard by the good gameplay, and the evaluation of the story is more subjective. 

If you want a taste of ProjectMoon, play Lobotomy Corp. first, a masterpiece with a more concise and fascinating story.

Amazing music with a lot of soundtracks
Wonderful story building. Characters do not fall flat and it's easy to get attached to one.
Excellent sequel to Lobotomy Corporation and fleshes out lore without requiring you to have 
Each floor offers a different play style allowing for more interesting deck types.
Good difficulty curve. New mechanics are slowly introduced overtime and beginning stages allow for trial and error.
Some stages are like puzzles instead which encourage new deck types and new play styles.

Cons:

RNG can be problematic. Think Darkest Dungeon problematic. 
Two major difficulty spikes present.
Boss battles aren't shown as a boss battle until you start the floor. At least you can exit out of the game to avoid the fight.
Can be repetitive over time. 
Repeating stages to get certain cards can be annoying.

Overall, this seems to be a pretty good game. The art is nice, the music is good, and the gameplay is fun.",1638656248,1653439100,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

(and be warned, its difficulty curve IS vertical)

in this game you can:
- get staggered
- get staggered
- nail a full 4d chess combo that leaves you with a good feeling for a while
- get staggered
- go into battle completely unprepared
- open the curtains
- assemble the perfect build with a ridiculous amount of power (but it won't matter because in the end you WILL get all low rolls and Get staggered)
- get lucky! (1/6 chance)
- Get unlucky (5/6 chance)
- NOT talk about love town
- give the silent orchestra diarrhea*
- create a chain of people dying trying to retrieve the books of people who died trying to retrieve the books of...
- feel an increase in your own emotion level
- become THE big bad boss, only to realize the aforementioned big bad boss entered with a poorly thought out build (alternatively, with no key pages)
- get staggered
* have not confirmed if i can do this

i would recommend either playing the previous game, lobotomy corporation, to full completion if it interests you or reading up on its story if it doesn't, as this game does continue off of its story and as such does contain spoilers for it",1653431190,1653431190,True,87,27,0.844125926494598389,5,True,False,False

Also can I just say there is nothing quite as satisfying as having a floor of intricately designed nuggets all with unique decks that all compliment each other utterly destroy any opposition. (You can even give them unique lines and design their personality yourself.)

I suggest getting the NoGrind mod and a bunch of unique skins for your nuggets, it really improved the experience for me!

And another thing about the stability, maybe it's just a problem on my side, but be careful of opening too many books and getting too many pages and cards, the game started to show input lag the further I got into it and the more things I unlocked. (Probably because of the NoGrind mod giving a lot of surplus, so if you plan on playing with that I suggest you to be careful unless you don't mind having 2-3 sec input lag)

Now don't be deceived, this game may look heavily RNG based; every single attack, the speed at which all attacks are executed, defense and dodging. But despite all that, if your loadout and deck is carefully handpicked you will pretty much always win. Which is why it is fully possible to solo boss fights that are intended for you to fight with like 15 people in total.

In other words if you know what you're doing (or just follow a guide from someone who does) you'll manage just fine. 

The difficulty curve of this game is the exact moment the game doesn't let you just mess around anymore. You'll be forced to make up strategies and decks that compliment both with your other librarians and the equipped page of the librarian in question.

Don't expect a single good deck to blast you through the game either, you'll be forced to change your decks almost every fight the further you proceed. Picking things willy nilly (based on whether they are rare, cool and shiny) is absolutely not gonna get you anywhere so you're gonna have no choice but to actually use some brain power.

If you find this to be too hard you can (as previously stated) look at a guide, or use some mods that removes one of the limitations of the game to make some really overpowered decks.

Either way, the story of the game (despite how it can be a bit over the top sometimes) is still marvellous! It's a continuation of the previous game (Lobotomy Corporation), so it is recommend to play (or at least spend some time on wiki of) that game before coming to this one.

This isn't a game for everyone though, so do take into account that it's not gonna be a smooth journey if you take it lightly or as a casual experience.",1653389167,1653411965,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

Music and visuals are top notch and gameplay feels great, the game is a direct sequel to Lobotomy Corporation but plays very very differently.

anyways game's pretty great, easily my favorite game of all time. however like some negative reviews that point out the flaws of this game with the most major ones being:

lots of rng in battles. (isnt as bad in mid to late game but yeah)

doesnt anwser a lot of questions in lobotomy corp which upsets a lot of fans.

difficulty, the game expects players to understand mechanics as soon as they are introduced (which they do have a popup tutorial for but its still a compliant for a lot of players from what i see)

some minor grinding, some fights u gotta redo like maybe 1 or 2 times

sounds pretty bad but the game has a lot more good points imo. The art style, the music, the story, the characters, the gameplay are all great.

There is some grinding obviously and sometimes it feels like shit to have your dice roll be unlucky, but a deeper issue is that it can be hard to tell what is going to affect how combat is going to play out before you begin. I recommend turning off the Auto-mod when starting out, because you really need a play by play of the action to start this game out. 

The combat pages will automatically tell you if the enemy you are targeting is weak to the damage type you are using, but all modifications to the dice rolls only show up DURING combat - so if you missed that you got a debuff that for instance - increases the Power of enemy rolls - which is different from the damage of rolls mind you - then you could find yourself eating shit from what you thought was a relatively safe trade. Additionally, how speed dice interact is less obvious in cases where the dice are equal. 

At the same time, after the first blind attempt it is very satisfying to craft a team that exploits the enemies weaknesses and counters their decks. Crafting synergistic teams with the abnormality pages of that floor is very fun. I'm very interested in the story. The art of the cards and in the cutscenes is stellar, and I'm invested in these characters who I'm only catching brief glimpses of. I feel the game is at it's best when you are playing a puzzle game on how to beat the enemy
EDIT; Having just beaten the game, It's fucking stellar game. They are very good at weaving story and gameplay. It is very difficult in the late half of the game. The final parts are boss fights after boss fights each one requiring powerful pages and a solid strategy. Gameplay wise- there are cards and pages that are only unlocked after beating the game or in final fights - and honestly, while I continued playing some afterwards to try some meme strategies and achievements. there isn't much reason to keep playing after beating the game. Its a satisfying conclusion to a story, but it does make it a weird gameplay decision to only unlock the cards at the end when you have no more reason to use them.

There are some extremely frustrating bugs I have experienced - most notably invisible pages in a final fight and unclear interactions involving a certain page that can change decks mid combat, but otherwise bugs were fairly minor.",1647190627,1653186061,True,9,0,0.576141178607940674,0,True,False,False

I'm not really a fan of deckbuilding and turn based games but LoR has caught my interest due to it being the sequel of the sadistic game called Lobotomy Corp. The combat is great and fun, it doesn't feel like other turn based games as the combat sequences feel smooth. Deck building is fun, intuitive and extremely customizable. Story is amazing as well if you play this after Lobotomy Corp, though that isn't required.

What I really want to point out here though is the quality of the OSTs.

Kether's, Hod's, and Malkuth's OSTs are AMAZING. I haven't even reached midgame yet but the OSTs alone are pushing me through difficult fights just by motivating me with their tunes.

Huge variety of cards and strategies you can put together, and you're always finding more and more powerful new things that breathe new life into cards you previously thought bad. There's a lot of room for experimentation and creativity. The battles start simple, but quickly ramp up in difficulty and expect you to have a solid gameplan and well-constructed characters/decks going in.

However, getting all of the current ""tier"" of cards for a given part in the story can be grindy, especially since beating a difficult encounter once doesn't necessarily mean it'll be easier to be again. However, the card pack rewards are generally worth the grind.

The story is fantastic too. Great urban fantasy/dystopian story that uses and builds on the backstory given in Lobotomy Corporation (highly recommend playing that game through to the true ending first before playing this). Characters and dialogue are great, as are the little vignettes that accompany each enemy encounter. It's actually rather astounding how many art assets this indie team was able to dedicate to all of these side characters and their stories, and it certainly helps bring it all to life. This, of course, applies to the huge amount of voice acting as well.

I'm not entirely sure how far into the game I am (20hrs at the time of writing), but it seems like this game might be LONG.

Sound fun? Well, it could be, for a while, if you can stomach the dialed-way-past-11 grossness factor, the outlandishly grimdark corpo/mafia/horror-from-beyond/psycho-cult/evil-AI dystopiapocalypse setting. Now and then they throw in a vaguely likable character just so that person can meet some ungodly cruel fate that would make Howard Phillips L. himself cringe and mumble ""That's a bit much, isn't it?"" under his breath.

Is that all cause for a negative review? Nope. I'll tell you what is. The gameplay, such as it is, is extremely pedantic min-maxing in the context of a game so RNG-happy, it uses deck-building card draws AND random dice rolls. Remember how games like Slay The Spire feel fair because you know more or less exactly how much damage most abilities will do? Well, this is the exact opposite, you're guessing, hoping, replaying individual fights again and again in order to have the dice roll good in your favor. The enemy essentially always have stronger cards and thus better dice intervals than you. This is compensated by letting you see what they're going to do each turn (except when you can't! Hee hee, they have fun screwing you over) and thus letting you plan how to respond. Problem being, there often isn't a very good response.

Eventually you unlock some fun stuff, like being able to manifest an abnormality (coalesced trauma monster) into a new form and move set for one of your librarians (murderous slaves). This is powerful and very useful, but you get all of ONE of these on one floor (a ""dungeon room"", if you will, for the ""invited guests"" to ""be murdered in"") after the massive hassle of fully ""suppressing"" all five abnormalities on each of the first three floors. Each suppression is usually a stressful, annoying gimmick battle that is won partly by figuring out /exactly/ what the insane, sadistic developers decided was Zer Correct Way To Do It and any deviation or lack of sufficiently powerful character and ability cards will see you face down and wondering why you bothered trying. This all also grants you a number of abnormality-based perk cards that activate as your murder-librarians get emotional, but most of the bonuses are either pitifully weak, or worthless trade-offs of negligible overall benefit. Some will screw you over even more than the enemy!

You get a ways in, and it gets harder. Then it gets harder. And then it gets harder. You're forced to obsess more and more about every little aspect of your librarians' character card, and trait-granting character sub-cards, and the exact composition of combat cards, including light (energy) recovery cards, card draw cards, actually useful cards with strong attacks and blocks, useless evasion cards that always fail because their intervals are too stinking low but which WOULD help you recover essential stagger resistance if they worked - which, as discussed, they do not. And so on and so forth.

The game is not fun. The game is barely a game; it's more like a device intended to sell strategy guides, and while I'm sure you can (and should, if you plan to 'play' this so-called game) find some right here on Steam for free, I really don't see the point of playing an instruction-following simulator. There is no room for error here, no room for stylish customization of your combat teams; in fact, there's no point in preparing more than one or two, three at the most, because your cards become all obsolete shortly after you obtain them. There is absolutely such a thing as good and bad cards in this game, and if you're not filtering your current battle selections by the most recently attained library rank and its associated encounters and card drops, you will die and die and die until you do. A few older passive abilities may be marginally useful later on, but most of them scale too, from worthless to slightly less worthless. The enemy's character cards frequently have abilities they do not actually have when you obtain them, so that's fun.

So, in summary, we have a depressing game in just about the most awful Crapsack World trope setting you can imagine, which gets pretty predictable despite the kooky weird stuff they toss in near-constantly. We have stressful gameplay that consists of obsessively min-maxing your team and then struggling through 30-60 minutes of precision enemy-move-countering and tactical order-giving, only to lose all your progress to a lame boss fight after three boss-and-grunts fights.

Do you like being both depressed and tense as frick? If not, do yourself a favor; look past the novelty and the charming weirdness, see what's actually underneath, and then give this ""game"" a hard pass. You can probably find the cutscenes online if you care about the icky mess of a story.

If you aren't willing to sit down and buckle up for some truly mind-boggling enemies and learn a complex system yet mechanically simple gameplay loop, [b]this is not the game for you[/b]. While everything happening under the hood is surprisingly deep, and you definitely won't understand how it works half the time, it is a point and click game where your decisions are made in the planning phase for the most part and the actual execution is significantly easier.

If you hate losing and want to beat everything on your first try, [b]this is not the game for you[/b]. While technically possible, unless you use a guide, there is a level of trial and error that will come with figuring out which builds work and which builds don't. Not only in general use, as your decks grow stronger and eventually require tuning as the difficulty increases, but against specific enemies that may need a certain playstyle to beat without pulling your hair out.

If you dislike the idea of RnG, [b]this is definitely not the game for you.[/b] Dice are an integral part of the system, and many of the mechanics (damage, ""initiative"", certain status effects, etc.) affect or are affected by the roll of a dice.

So, I've debated if I should give this a positive review or now.

On the one hand, (pros)
the story told is amazing,
the characters are entertaining,
I love the combat system,
the flavor of each card hits,
the art is very enjoyable,
and the music is great.

On the other hand, (cons)
at certain points of the game, you will suffer. 
You will hit a brick wall that seems impossible to pass... until you revert back to one of two routes: full-stop office or going all in on the red mist.
Because of this, the deck building fails because there's not really a wide variety of decks if you want to succeed.
Even then, it could take you 3 hours to get one possible run just for it to be decided on a die roll because you didn't draw the right cards.
And in the final fights, some cards lose almost all use, because the devs decided to throw away the concept of 'mana' (or 'light' in this game) for the enemies. 

Weighing how bad some of the lasts fights made me feel (kinda like the devs actually hated me for even thinking that I could have fun in their game) with the enjoyment I got from every other part, I'm going to give it a positive review.

Pro: good plot, art, ost and gameplay
Con: difficulty spike, dull endgame
8/10
The plot is great, the gameplay is well designed, the OST is good as well. It would have been a flawless game if it wasn't for the vertical difficulty spike.(You will see what I mean once you have played the game.) The game at the end also is somewhat disappointing, as you get less and less new stuff to work worth, but more complex enemies to be dealt with. But you know what will make your life easier? Go read some guides. If you were here for the gameplay and plot and do not enjoy the difficulty, watch guides LOL. It does remove some fun where you see the deck you built destroy enemy, but it makes your life a lot easier.

The plot of this game continues off the game Lobotomy Corporation, watching a video on the plot will enhance your gameplay by a good amount. But it is not necessary. 

Also people do complain about the heavy rng portion making the game very annoying, but on the other hand, it does make the game thrilling sometime when the important rolls comes out in your favor. So I won't call it a downside.

The mods helped me cheese some of the battles. There is this one mod called unlimited passive transfer, you can install the mod, launch the game with it, it will allow you to have repetitive traits on the same person, even after you quit the game and enter the game again the traits are still there. I personally did not suffer from the vertical powerspike THAT much because of this and the help of some guides. Aside from this funny glitch, I do not really know that much about the mods. 

Note: I did mention the ost is good above, but I just want to mention it again because it also fits the battles they are for. Increasing the fun of combat by a lot as the OST has changes as some of the battles proceed.

Overall a 8/10 games for a normal people, goes lower if you can't tolerate repetitive times doing the same battle, but if you are an OST enjoyer and deckbuilder fan this is 10/10. (which makes it 10/10 for me)

10/10 I love this game so much. 

Do you like card games? This game will probably tickle your fancy. The combat is fun and engaging, and even with the heavy RNG sometimes thrown in here and there if you approach each fight with strategy in mind you will definitely win. It also feels pretty amazing to high-roll and save one of your characters from dying.
The combat might take you some time to wrap your head around since it can get a bit complicated and specific but once you have that down you will know what will happen with each action.

The music is amazing and the visuals are unique and pleasant to look at. The level (or floor) backgrounds and music are particularly beautiful.

Lastly I would highly recommend that you play the prequel ""Lobotomy Corporation(LC)"" (also a really fun game) if you want to immerse yourself in the story as much as possible. Or at the very least look up a summary video on Youtube. This is because Library of Ruina(LoR) starts right after LC and the game throws you right in the deep end when it comes to exposition and doesn't really recap what has happened prior to LoR. The actions or dialogues some characters make/say will not have as much of an impact were you not familiar with the lore.

You build a team of characters with their own decks(and changeable passives, to give them all their own deck gimmick to bring to the team) and face them off against another team. Later you will face multiple waves of enemies, and will be able to send multiple waves of teams yourself. While the difficulty curve isn't entirely as vertical as others may make you believe, it is noticeable in the gameplay. In the early game, you will progress through fights quickly, and will probably overplan for every fight. You may begin to wonder how people spend a hundred hours in this game. Then you hit the end of the midgame, and it all makes sense. quick fights start to stretch into 10-20 minute battles that will mentally wear you out, and they only get longer, and while in the early game, it will be 1 or 2 chains of quick fights, later it evolves into you having a list of 8 different 30 minute boss fights to chew through. These fights are amazingly designed, and immensely satisfying, and you will probably have to take a nap to recuperate after each one. You'll think the emotion meter is just silly anime mechanics, but you'll feel your own emotions rising with it later on. The difficulty curve may not be vertical, but it certainly doesn't ever slow down. You will occasionally get stuck on a few bosses, but for most of the early ones it's pretty obvious when your decks aren't going to do the job early on in the fight, namely when QoH deletes one of you librarians turn 2. There's also a bit of an annoying grinding aspect, as defeating enemies essentially gives you card packs of the cards they just used against you. While it's cool that you can generally use the cool shit that you just got put through, sometimes you don't get what you want and have to deal with that aforementioned cool shit being used against you again. Over all, great game. Sometimes needs to be taken in small doses, but boy do those small doses feel good. Story's pretty solid too. There's the main plot, which is a neat continuation of Lob Corp(you can play both in either order and get a similar experience, both keep the other somewhat secret). There's also a lot of shorter stories for the characters you fight, which are nice in themselves and also give you insight into the setting of the city, which is very cool. Unfortunately, most of the side characters short stories end unceremoniously with ""and then they came to the library so we killed them"", but a few of these stories live on even through that, albeit sadder and sadder with every time they show up again.",1651023226,1651023436,True,2,0,0.541908860206604004,0,True,False,False

Plus the story picks up right after Lobotomy Corporation and retells a bit of it so you don't need to have played it first to understand it. Plus the game has many ways to extra bits of story besides the main voiced story taking place. This is a game triple A dreams of making but doesn't.

That being said the game currently is unbeatable due to the issue with unbalanced cards. specifically mass attack cards from the enemy. While each attack from the enemy can be attacked directly to cause a 'clash' between you and the enemy, these mass attacks are a all or nothing thing and while early on when they're introduced they're kinda weak but can be maybe beat by your units, late game has such power creep on the enemy to make them seem tougher that it just becomes unmitigable damage that either kills your units in a long fight, since the enemy can use them more than once, or staggers them which causes them to take double damage till next round and most commonly die from it.

The game is great, has a lot of different deck builds, and setups to make a really strong synergy with some cards to really make it fun while also being an extremely nice challenge for a variety of builds. but these unmitigable mass attacks that are instant just wrecks the game. overall, a 9/10 game but requires mods to remove enemy mass attacks because they aren't balanced and are there to just screw you over and waste your time.",1648333326,1650776972,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

PROS:
+ This game has some of the best storytelling of any game I have ever seen, and more people need to talk about it. If you've played Lobotomy Corporation, this game will entirely spin your perspective on said game and it's story. No spoilers on in what way, however, but it does an amazing job expanding on the world-building, characters, and lore while tackling some incredibly tough subjects in a horrific but fascinating and surprisingly thoughtful way. If you're a story kind of guy, you're going to love this. Do try to play its prequel game beforehand for the full experience.
+ Gameplay is incredibly fun once you get the hang of it. If you are a fan of fast-paced card battlers, this one is definitely a gem. It can be a bit tricky to understand all the mechanics, but once all the info clicks it can be incredibly enriching to come up with everchanging strategies and builds to combat the different enemies you'll face.
+ The music and art are GORGEOUS, and the amount of style this game has is remarkable and really contributes to the atmosphere and narrative. So much work was put into every detail and it shows. Mili also makes great music!
+ Roland is the funniest looking protagonist to exist ever and I don't know why. It's great.

CONS:
- You are going to need to do quiet a bit of grinding in this game. A lot of time is going to be spent building decks, coming up with strategies, and even the fights themselves rather long. If you don't have a good bit of free time, progressing in this game will take a LONG time. People who don't do well with grinding, have little time to spare, or are in it solely for the story which is locked behind game progression won't fare too well with this.
- This game's main mechanic is dice. Aka, the amount of damage you do and if you take damage is almost entirely randomized. If the RNG gods aren't in your favor, you could lose at the worst moment and be forced to do a whole fight again or have your meticulously planned strategy fail spectacularly. And RNGJesus is not merciful.
- While this games difficulty curve is mostly fine, they are a few difficulty spikes and some cases where you will unlock things the game probably intends for you to beat later. This can be very disorienting if you want to beat everything as you unlock it, and also frustrating. 
- There are a lot of ""boss"" fights in this game that appear without warning, which can definitely throw people off-guard. It doesn't personally bother me, but  I can see how it might to someone else.
- The game doesn't do a good job explaining its mechanics unless you happen to be a very good learner when it comes to reading things. Anyone else will usually have to resort to learning through trial and error how things work. But, as stated in my PROs, this learning hurdle will eventually click.

SUMMARY:
This game is one of high build-up, and high payoff. If you're able to get past the grinding and RNG that a lot of people can get frustrated with, you can immerse yourself in a genuinely fun game with a great story that has shocked and amazed me even at just the half-way point. If you enjoy games in a similar genre to this one, such as Slay The Spire, or are simply looking for a game that you can fully engross yourself in, give this game a try.

The game is extremely lengthy with very involved cutscenes and great voice delivery. The gameplay can be difficult if you don't read cards or abilities but is pretty comprehensive once you do and gets easier towards the end once you have some absurdly powerful combinations at your disposal. In spite of that, every boss is lovingly crafted and every encounter thoughtfully designed so that nothing feels samey despite the sheer longevity of this game.

To say the game ate the nuts of my expectations is an understatement, as the game, even after all the spoilers I've seen, managed to surprise me with everything in the end. The games story is an amazing piece of fiction which should be in public schools everywhere. The soundtrack goes from jazz, to rock, to standard video game music, to full on orchestras. The games art was ok. The world building far surpasses what lobcorp did, which means you get to know many a thing about the city. And finally the gameplay was actually kind of shit. The fact that most battles are dependent on rng to be won kind of fucking sucks, especially when the punishment for losing a battle is losing the books used in the reception, meaning you have to get those books back to try again. Plus more rng in the  books you get, its up to luck if you get the books you even need for the fight, plus you also have to strategize around deck building and decks and fucking attributes or some shit, and don't even get me started on the battles strategy. The game starts off easy, gets quite a bit harder, then you get to the queen of hatred where the difficulty spike goes vertically. The game is a wet lucid dream for big card game fans, for people who like hard games and dying to the same shit that you literally cannot change over and over again, and for people who love world building. For anybody else this game is going to cannibalize your existence if you cant get good. And unlike games like Dark souls where the fights outcome is dependent on if you can dodge and time your attacks correctly, as I have said before Library of Ruina is a rng mess where simply playing it feels like chewing glass.

Where the real meat and potatoes was for me in this game though was the story. MAN THE STORY! It was dark, brutal and constantly left me wanting to know what was happening next. It wasn't just the content of the stories that hooked me either, but the delivery system itself was just so cool. It felt very reminiscent of the type of writing in things like Stoker's ""Dracula"" or Shelley's ""Frankenstein.""

I didn't know at all what I was getting into when I bought this game and I think the steam page doesn't sell just how FUN and INTERESTING this game can really get. It has easily become my favorite game I have played ever. Full stop.

It has complex and satisfying card mechanics and even features a refreshingly challenging difficulty curve in the latter half of the game. Project moons world is well crafted and interesting with each story beat slowly revealing more of the world to you as you play. As you play, more mysteries reveal themselves almost as fast as the answers reveal themselves. The story kept me wanting to know more, and even when I was finished with the game I still found myself wanting to know more about this beautiful world they've created.

The game starts out a bit slow, with a somewhat daunting amount of tutorial, but once you get the basics down, most of it becomes intuitive. Once you're a comfortable length into the game, it will start throwing interesting additions and twists to the combat. Some are just interesting cards with unique abilities, but others can be fun combat puzzles that are a blast to work out.

As you first get into it, the book burning mechanic might FEEL like a gacha system that's complete chance, but it's actually got a really clever mercy system that means getting a copy of everything from a book isn't difficult at all, with only certain books ever making you go through the fight more than two times to get everything you could want from it (Unless of course you find yourself REALLY liking certain combat pages that is.)

The game isn't without it's flaws of course, but they're few and far between. Some wordings on cards or mechanics might not be as clear at first glance and there are some things that aren't well explained in the game or really explained at all (like most of how emotion coins work), but even those things aren't egregious. Like with emotion coins, you don't really need to understand how they work to succeed. I found that I made it perfectly fine through the game even if it wasn't until very late that I realized EXACTLY how emotion coins work. (It's neat, but not really necessary knowledge. and if you're really curious, you can always look it up! careful of spoilers!)

Although unfortunately there are some fault, mainly with the progression system where when you defeat a foe, you get their book(deck) and you then have to either spend it to unlock it's content or to progress the story, so you will have to grind fights to get what you want. Luckily you can avoid expiring the book by quitting the game.

There are also boss rushes that you might spend half an hour to an hour in only to get killed by an unexpected mechanic forcing you to start from the beginning of it.

 In fact,if your reading this you should check  it out  pronto on steam, once it's on sale I'm sure you'll love this game if you like  anime or turn based games with stellar storytelling and breathtaking Ost's composed by Milli .  

This game  posses the most depth  and love out of  all of the  turn  based card rpgs I played in my life  along with a amazing which immediately throws   you into  into a grim dark,dystopian Korean  setting known as 'The City.'  The 'City ' of-course by nature is a warped, crap-sick world  with cosmic horrors and dangerous government human experiments which you have to repress in order to survive .  The existing  natural resources are  scarce  along with most  people's compassion  so as a result the dregs of the society must scavenge organs from passer byes just to get by, while the rest of the world's citizen ladder climb in their own little corporate versions of hell!   When your buying this game, your not only purchasing  a masterpiece of a cyberpunk novel but a fun deck-builder which scales in intensity , and pace the longer the battle rages on.

Story and Setting: 10/10

Your a washed up  mercenary/fixer  with little to  no memories , who one day mysteriously wanders into a abandoned  and rustic library xd.  Little do you know, you will soon be deftly amputated  and forced to serve a all powerful being with a god complex who forces you to kill in order to find the 'one true book' ensuring she can escape the hell-hole that is 'The City. 'That's right when you kill enemies in this game you not only acquire their abilities,move-sets but their  tragic life-stories too which you can read in the credenza.The card art of course is  breathtakingly gorgeous  and often depicts  your guests ahem victim's past life in graphic  detail...whether they were some corporate executive of a company to the lowliest  street rat. 

Furthermore the main  premise of this game is simple fact that you can rise from  lv1 crook  by killing your way up to the top. This means you'll start at  the bottom of the  nadir turning - street rats  and cannibal chefs alike into books until you finally attract the notice of the City's elites and spec-op units who will promptly  flock to your sanctuary in search of the truth behind these ahem disappearances . Consequently  as you turn more people into books, your squad will get new abilities,stats  and the knowledge acquired  from your guests ,wink ,wink which will provoke  even more guests   to flock to your library en-masse  in hopes of securing the forbidden knowledge only you posses or themselves.

Gameplay:9/10

All battles are decided by the throw of a die which determines  damage  done to enemies and initiative  . Out roll enemies  in the hopes to stagger them to deal double damage for the fatal hit. Akin to pokemon each character or nugget in your squad has certain weakness or apathy towards blunt,pierce and slash damage types. Exploit the enemies weaknesses by targeting  their weaknesses  while playing defensive cards to recover stagger damage.  Status effects your cards can procc vary from paralysis,burn to fairy damage.Overall,the nuance in comabt stems from the deck archetypes you build around as well as which floor you use to amp up your squad's fighting ability.  Decks archetypes cyou can build around include; Burn,Bleed,Fragile,paralysis  to even Fairy.
The rule of  thumb here is always replace  and update your decks as soon as possible as enemies will constantly drop better cards, so you have to adapt  on the fly. 

Bosses and Difficulty :8/10

  Mostly balanced, save for a few late games boses which are so complex the dev's  probably don't know how they work.  My main gripe here would be the abno battles which feel like filler as well as the grindy nature of late,late game which feels like Gacha ..Overall,the  game is pretty forgiving up until urban legend where you have to utilise  every  mechanics you learnt in the first two acts otherwise risk getting slapped around like a dog by the game's vicious Ai who are not only beefier then you but are more vicious in every way.

Unfortunately, I watched my friend play this game so playing it on my own for the first time was a bit spoiled. This game has everything I love in a video game; Replayability, an AMAZING story/setting/plot, really unique characters in a vastly morbid world... not to mention the sound track is probably the best of any video game I have ever played. However, this game has a lot of graphic content that could make someone more sensitive really feel uncomfortable, so do be aware of this.

The company, Project Moon, in of itself, is my favorite company for video games and I cannot wait for Limbus Company (the sequel to Library of Ruina), anything made by Project Moon is always worth a look. Not only is Project Moon making sure it's customers are getting the best experiences possible, but the entire community is really friendly too. The memes, and lore are both discussed often and extensively as it's a niche title, only few people know it even exists. As much as I hate to say this, I hope the game stays at a level where it is not common knowledge like the titles everyone knows and loves.

Take into consideration this game takes place after Lobotomy Corporation, so if you are ever thinking this game is worth playing and you want to understand the entire story behind it, I'd recommend you play the predecessor and the hidden references to have a real sense of what the story is about.

I cannot recommend this game enough in a single review, now go play it right now or else the Hana association will find you.",1648626011,1648626011,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's like Slay The Spire... but not quite.
It's thematically like its prequel, Lobotomy Corp... kinda.

There's really no good comparison that you can 1:1 this game to, but I'll try to put things into perspective.
The gameplay, where you have a set number of ""speed dice"" (think Initiative dice from D&D, but rerolled each round) that you can then select and use that dice to attack with a ""page card"" (your prebuilt deck of attacks, drawn randomly like a card game), is really weird to understand at first. However, the early game is very, very forgiving while you figure out how the system truly works. They don't hit you with bosses that require specialized teams to fight until a ways in, and by that point you'll have realized that Bigger Number doesn't always mean Objectively Better, especially once Bleed and Burn are brought in and open up the combat to neat specialized builds.

The music is astoundingly good, and each team you use has their own theme, which isn't even getting into the boss music - some of the best and most thematically appropriate BGM I had seen up until Project Wingman, and even then it's a close race.

The game runs fairly well on most systems. There are some parts that might cause some slowdown, specifically the scene transition with the pages and particle effects, which can kill frames for the half second it's on screen, which is less of a gameplay problem and more of a nitpick.

The story is astoundingly good, and stays on-theme almost the entire time. You *DO NOT* need to have played Lobotomy Corp to 100% to understand what's happening - the important notes of that game will be addressed in this one when they become relevant. Do note that the only voice lines in the game are in Korean - there are no options for English, Japanese, or Chinese. However, considering the potential cost of a localized VA track, that's fairly understandable for an Indie game.

Overall - give this game a shot. If you love it, go on loving it. If you don't, I can't blame you, this game has the potential to exhaust you mentally with long, hard boss fights and tons of minutiae to sort through to make an effective build to counter a particular fight.

Library of Ruina is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, a game that I've come to dislike a fair bit. It had a fantastic setting populated by a gorgeous character cast to offer, but the gameplay was tough to tolerate for various reasons. 

Well, I'm delighted to say that LoR has nicely managed to retain (if not improve) the good bits, and as for the gameplay, it went for a different genre. I saw someone describing the game as a deck builder with the roguelite bits excised, and that sounds just about right; its structure is comparable with what Quantum Protocol has going for it, for whoever's familair with it.

I firmly believe that Library of Ruina is capable of standing on its own. Being familiar with Lobotomy Corporation isn't required, although it's not going to hurt either. I let LC be without reaching the very first core suppression, and even this shallow level of familiarity paid off splendidly. Again, though, LoR does plenty to make sure the player isn't in the dark about what happened previously.

When it comes to pacing, Library of Ruina begins by offering disjointed (yet deeply engrossing, assuming the game's setting manages to capture your attention) stories that eventually evolve into something far grander, cohesive, and multi-faceted. It's anything but a short journey, but so far I've been thoroughly enjoying its every chapter, and the game's two central characters have vastly enhanced the experience.

Now, as for the gameplay, Library of Ruina is basically a party-based deck builder. So, you're building a deck, but it's distributed across several characters with their own health bars, energy levels, and passive abilities. What complicates things is that, no matter how much energy a character has, the amount of actions available to them is a completely separate variable. So, if you have a hand full of cards that cost 0 energy to play, you'll only be able to play one of them if that's your limit.

And when you play a card, you don't just choose an enemy you wish to thwack and call it a day. The target for your intention to thwack someone is not an opponent, but an opponent's intention. Maybe these intentions will clash, and that's a separate story, or maybe it'll be a one-sided (unopposed, that is) strike which is more or less the best case scenario.

This is the combat's central component, and mastering it is the key to victory. It's probably a touch too convoluted for its own good, especially at first, but it's not impossible to figure out by simply playing the game and becoming more familiar with it. Ah, and by the way, none of the actions happen ASAP. Instead, you queue up all orders, end your turn, and observe what happens.

The combat's complexity rises over time with the introduction of new mechanics, but this isn't a cause for concern: these additions are rare, and plenty of time passes between them. Besides, while it's crucial to understand how exactly these mechanics function, none of them become omnipresent. Quite the opposite, in fact.

I'm currently at the Star of the City section, nearing the endgame. The difficulty has certainly become respectable to say the least, especially given how trivial the very beginning of the game is, but for now all is well, and I'm quite certain things would be even smoother if I were to finally tweak certain aspects of my approach to deckbuilding.

Having an absolute blast so far, and it's pretty sad that there's not too much content separating me from the game's finale.",1641728225,1647615726,True,17,0,0.659730672836303711,0,True,False,False

Library of Ruina is a game that speaks to me like no other game has, with an absolutely enthralling story with amazing characters, beautiful artwork and sprites, and music that makes you think ""this was an Indie Game?"" This game will draw you in and keep you there. The gameplay is complex, and you need to have a solid understanding of the games mechanics for you to succeed. The battles in the mid to lategame take a fair bit of strategy and can't be bruteforced (trust me I have tried). This is especially true for the final reception. The difficulty really spikes at times and can seem unfair, but all it takes is going back to the drawing board to remake decks and passives.

This is no easy game, it teaches well and tells you everything you need to know but after that it's your strategy, tactics, and decisions that will drag you out of the pits of hell. The game is difficulty and will make sure every mistake you make will cost you a winning chance. I love this game, it really challenged me to try harder, figure out the best course of action, and watching my plans of attack work wonderfully or modestly to get an upper hand. There are MANY times where I wanted to just ALT-F4 but sometimes you just gotta suck it up and try better, not harder.

The story of the game continues off from Lobotomy Corporation and does a great job summarizing the ending of that game to then jump off into it's own story. The characters are from Lob Corp and do have quite a history from the said game but the writing doesn't really take a lot from it besides the ending. The characters are wonderful (especially Binah, I am very biased) and the story is great. There is a lot of talking in the story segments but after a long-winded fight, sometimes it's great to just relax and read the aftermath of the said fight.

My favorite, and possibly best part of this game is the MUSIC. My god the music. There are multiple pieces of music, one for each floor, for each major event, there are lyrical songs for boss fights, and most of them have stages of intensity.

Its schizophrenic difficulty, odd design decisions and constant tedium made it difficult to complete. But push on, said one friend of mine. For the sequel is much better. And so after a vicious 60+ hours, I stepped off the nightmarish coal locomotive deathtrap that was [i]LobCorp[/i], and onto the gleaming electric bullet train that is [i]Library of Ruina[/i]. And boy, was he right. 

What i'm trying to say here is that claiming ""Ruina is better than LobCorp"" is like claiming water is wet. This game is leaps and bounds better than it's prequel, packed to the gills with a massive amount of content and stuffed with so much passion, detail and smart design that I am well and truly flabbergasted. Everywhere you look, this game exudes style and grace, from it's lavish U.I., to it's positively [i]phenomenal[/i] soundtrack, to the intricate bits and details of the engrossing combat system. That's to say nothing of the quality of the games' story or voice acting, both of which put many games with hextuple the budget to shame. 

And the gameplay is... actually good this time! Holy shit! [i]Ruina[/i]'s card battling, dice-rolling, turn-based bloodbaths are a gameplay and visual treat. The basic idea is that each character has a deck of nine cards they can draw from, with one card being drawn a turn. Cards cost a resource called ""light"" to play, and each card has a set of attacks or defensive maneuvers that roll between a set value, such as 1-4 or 3-8 as examples. You play these against enemy attacks which do the same, and weigh the cost of cards, their RNG values and their special bonuses against the enemy. While this sounds very RNG-intense, it really isn't. You always have a high amount of light and cards if you play well, meaning there's always room to tilt the odds in your favour to a large degree. Add on top of this an absolute boatload of equippable passives and special moves and you have a combat system that's just darn fun on top of offering an immense amount of strategy.

The game does have some hiccups though. As a warning, [i]Ruina[/i] gets hard. VERY hard. It requires either a lot of careful reading what each passive does, or a lot of netdecking, but getting through the game can be a substantial challenge. A lot the harder stuff is still totally beatable and very fun to experience thanks to the amazing presentation, but make no mistake- this is a game that will challenge you in a lot of ways even if you're an experienced deckbuilder. I'd say the difficulty remains tough but fair right up until the very last final stretch, at which point it becomes a bit unbearable, but by that point the game is nearly over and pushing through to the end is possible with some gumption. As well, the game requires a lot of irritating back-and-forth finagling with the passives and frequent grinding to earn better cards, but both of these issues can be fixed with mods. For the record, only the former really bothered me, since doing fights over and over again just gives more opportunity to try out new strategies and dive into the huge amount of content on offer. AND it has fucking mod support! So not only do you get a game that's like 100 hours long, you also get a ton of high-quality fan content to go with it! And I mean high-quality, some of these fan mods legitimately rival the base game in quality. Insane. 

And that's just the thing. At it's current price, [i]Library of Ruina[/i] is an absolute steal. This is an exceptional, beyond superb experience that really showcases the strengths of the Project Moon development team in ways that the previous game only hinted at. There's just so much good, meaningful and awesomely fun content here that I can't do anything but wholeheartedly recommend it. 

And yes, you DO need to beat [i]Lobotomy Corp[/i] first and no I don't CARE that it's bullshit hard. Do it you coward, I wrote a guide to help you finish it so you can play this game instead. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558274102",1641452213,1647290317,True,10,0,0.5872344970703125,0,True,False,False

Invitations, books, librarians... probably none of it makes sense without actually playing the game. There's really no way to pitch this game. At most I could say it has deckbuilding and turn based combat and you unlock more stuff as you progress.

The base game was really fun. Not too grindy, you should never need to do a stage more than twice, though you can replay it more to get more copies of the cards. Very forgiving progression, once you have something you generally can't lose it. Some of the late game bosses took some tries to beat, though I don't think that's a bad thing. Good strategy and a bit of luck will get you through.

The modding community is great, and I would encourage you to install some mods after finishing the game to make the experience fresh. You can find many mods in the Steam Workshop. Props to PM for making a public API so the game is mod-friendly.",1646700135,1646700135,True,11,0,0.597806215286254883,0,True,False,False

However, the playstyle is entirely different and more along the lines of Slay the Spire in the best of traditions.


The game starts with Roland, a perfectly normal and average washed-up Grade Nine Fixer who gets isekai'd on his search for a good sandwich, and is promptly turned into the personal man-slave of everyone's favourite L-Corp AI, Angela. As this game is a Library Combat Simulator, your task is, just as in a real-life library (work in real-life library, can confirm) to welcome customers into the library with the promise of books, beat the hell out of them until they turn into books, then use those books to lure in new customers into the library. You can, alternatively, set fire to your books to gain better equippable key pages and combat pages with which to do battle.

Key pages not only have passive abilities to help you in combat, but also have different appearances. Some are objectively better than others since they have a superior option called Appearance B. It's worth noting this has been nerfed considerably since release, and can no longer be used on male Patron Librarians, so Appearance B Netzach is no longer a thing. You can set up your key page with a bookshelf of carefully-thought-out combat pages in advance of the battle in order to create a setup that works synergistically with the passive abilities of the key page and the other allies on the floor. Or you can just go with the meme option of triple Rules of Backstreets, triple Red Notes and triple Unforgettable Melody on every deck. What is brain? How does work? Only +STR. Unga bunga.

To further assist you in your work on the path to acquiring the HamHam-PangPang Sandwich, there are SCP-like tools and monstrosities known as abnormalities that can be unlocked and deployed to help you in combat, such as the iconic Bongbong. Your combatants can also gain boosts from accessories such as cute maid headbands, glasses and... dog ears, which can all be earned by meeting certain achievements in combat.

As you progress further through the game, more floors will unlock in which you can beat up customers, but we all know the best floor is Technological Sciences because Yesod has an absolutely banging soundtrack and great abnormality pages to beat the bejeezus out of customers with his bare fists, unless you favour Kimono Yesod or Magical Girl Yesod over Thug Yesod. If this is the case, I do not know what to say to you.

On the offchance that you don't want to go with the available outfit appearances, you can jazz things up with Fashion Library meta with some help from the Steam Workshop. A considerable number of people put a lot of work into modding the game so you can have maid outfits equipped on your nuggets. Or French maid outfits equipped on your nuggets. Or turn your nuggets into even more of an eldritch abomination than they were already. Just be aware that the Steam Workshop does contain outfits which feature spoilers for the game.

P.S. There are no mushroom parties any more. Mushroom parties are prohibited as per the orders of the Library Director, Angela. Anyone who talks about mushroom parties and Netzach will be swiftly disciplined. Likewise, there are also no Santa Hat parties.

P.P.S. We do not speak of the Train.

P.P.P.S. Also, please do not bully the child too much, else bad things may happen.

P.P.P.P.S. Also also, make sure to always love and cherish your AIs! Follow the Tony Stark example and call them DUM-E and U and make sure they grow up to be big and strong like Skynet. Wait, actually, don't do that.

P.P.P.P.P.S. HamHam-PangPang has now breached the fourth wall.

About the game:
I wont go into detail what it is about, but boy... the plot starts off a bit rough and convoluted. The more you play the more everything starts to make sense. You get to understand the entire psychology of all librarians, the director and your adversaries. You start question your actions, you start to understand the actions of your adversaries, you watch as the director [spoiler] starts to question their actions and starts to regret putting the life of her guests on the line[/spoiler]. The plot itself starts as a 3/10 and ends with a 12/10 to make up for it.
Gamplay-wise, absolutely fun. If you love deck-building and building characters, this game will be fun for you. It is extremely complicated when you start, but if you invest a little time into it, the game will teach you slowly but surely how all mechanics work.

I would recommend his game to everyone although the genre doesn't really appeal to many people and it isn't the kind of game everyone would play.
(67 hours in)

UPDATE:

Now after getting 110 hours into the game I am still not finished. This game has vast content and I am still considering a second playthrough of the game because of how much fun I have had playing it. The bosses are incredibly annoying to get through but its fun to do, the challenge is hard and losing means going back to phase one. But I wouldn't remove any of the bosses I fought in this game.

The music in this game is perfect. The music matches their character's themes, their motifs, and is honestly beautiful.
Its so good that most of this game's songs have made their way into my music playlist. I even set my wallpaper to a video of Chesed making coffee as ""Chesed"" (emotion 1) plays.
The song ""Roland"" encompasses everything I mean when I talk about how good this game's music is. After having played the game, listen to the song's that often fade into the background while you furioso your enemies and see if you can spot the underlying motifs. 

As for the story, as I haven't yet finished I cannot refer to the ending but the setup and explanation for everything, the character's goals and motivations, everything I see right now just a few battles before the ending is perfect. There are even multiple endings to get (3) and I really like the divergence in these paths. You get to see how things may conclude if your characters were just a bit different, if the stars didn't align to cause them to act this way.

This game is my favourite game of all time, and to say that without having actually finished it, only goes to show how good this game truly is...
Buy this game...
Do it...

You get to see what the enemy is going to do in their turn, and you can use your cards to counter against them. You start of in a 1v1 format which is very manageable, but later the game evolves into a 5v5 format where it might be harder to understand what is going on. The game does introduce its mechanics all at once so it might take some getting used to.

As with any card battler, you get more pages (cards) by beating opponents. The way this game works is that if any guests are beaten in the library, they become books, and you can use the book's pages to fight other opponents, meaning you gain the exact same pages your opponents were using before if you were to successfully beat them. This leads to a fun gameplay loop where you get increasingly stronger alongside an increasingly difficult pool of enemies.

Each enemy you face also gets an appropriate amount of backstory which leads to an immersive experience. For example, you just booked this guy's best friend. So now you get to see this guy cry over it and resolve themselves to challenge the library. The threat level of each enemy also obviously increase as the game goes on and I find myself excited over the possible future enemies that the library has to face.

The game is very difficult, however it is forgiving. Any loss that you might face won't set you back hours of gameplay, and the game encourages you to try different strategies by giving you more chances to do so. Late game battles do take a long time to finish though, so you will mostly lose out on those minutes you wasted trying to beat down a boss.

For fans of Lobotomy Corporation (This game's prequel) looking for the same magic:
I was a lobotomy corporation's fan because that game was creative. A lot of stuffs can happen at the same time in a management game so the players are usually given the ability to pause. When fighting dangerous abnormalities in lobotomy corporation, some of them can prevent you from pausing the game. Now, THAT is a way to convey something's power beyond numerical values. Lobotomy Corporation has loads of those moments. Every new day, every new abnormality is fresh. This game, despite the very apparent increase in budget, is lacking that magic. You won't find any of that in this game. There isn't much more to see after you've played the first 3 chapters. Sure the special effects look better as you progress through the game but that's it.

Story:
I can't tell if the story would be interesting to you but what I can say for sure is that by the end nothing happens. The main villains who showed up for a few times are killed. More than half of them we don't even get to know for more than 5 minutes. This review is longer than almost EVERYONE's stories. Most characters are just random people that are introduced and then killed within the span of 5-10 minutes. There is no lesson to be learned and nothing that makes you feel any kind of emotion. Angela is sad that she was tortured for tens of thousands of years and *almost* killed for a cause she didn't care about. She found a friend and suddenly decided to forget about whatever happened to her in the span of 3 months at most. Then everything just returned to how it had been before.

More on characters who showed up in the game:
Most characters are shallow and really are just there to be killed off by you. You don't even feel bad for them. Why would you? You barely even get to know them. If you just ignore the waifu or husbando status then what is so interesting about Binah, Myo, Yan, any character that isn't Xiao or Phillip? Binah's whole personality is being a mysterious goth person. Would the story even change if she's dead instead of alive? The characters in this game when compared to Lobotomy Corporation's abnormalities are vastly less interesting. Abnormalities allow for space to imagine. It's harder to come up with a monster that is interesting than to write Binah. If you're looking for an interesting story, with interesting characters beyond how they look play something else. Play a real visual novel. Play Lobotomy Corporation.

Deck building:
The strategy involved in this game is shallow. Your deck size is limited to 9 cards. It's more like picking a few synergistic abilities rather than a card game. You overcome obstacles by making your own numbers go higher than theirs by adding ""passives"" which most of the time just makes your numbers go higher. Sure, you can play and beat everything without passives but it doesn't change the fact that it's still just a game of your number>their number. Without passives you'd just be playing cards with the base stat that can beat the other guys' stuff and take the L somewhere else. No tactic required bigger number = good. Ignore the ""this game is just RNG"" people. They don't know what they're talking about. The advantages are overwhelmingly in your favor. There is no RNG. You will always beat them once you know that you should go for bigger numbers. It doesn't come anywhere close to slay the spire in this aspect.

The music
If I have to give a reason to play this game it would be for the music. It managed to sell the fantasy of the game really well. You'll be hype for fights up until the end of the game. Even when the game isn't challenging (most people probably never even lose once) you feel like you're on the front-line. That said, nothing quite comes as close to White Night's theme (and the subsequent 3rd warning) from Lobotomy Corporation because it isn't just a cool song, it's an emotion, the dread you feel is very real even if you you just listen to it on YouTube.",1624611487,1645921194,False,5,0,0.414168983697891235,0,True,False,False

I beat the game today, honestly, it was satisfying to finish it, the ups of the game are an absolute high that that's unmatched by basically any game out there, however, the lows are also very bad, as you can see from my last review. Overall the game is a 10/10 still IMO as I've never played anything that required me to do so much research and planning just to win. I won't spoil the ending of the game but the way the game plays out in the final half it boils down to this... You think you beat the final boss.... hehe there's another boss. Damn, I finally beat that boss... wow there's another boss <<<this loop plays out for a while. 

Overall honestly this is a game I think everyone should play as I won't forget truly a masterpiece, however ... the things I would warn anyone getting into this game is it will take months and hours on hours to beat, don't give up on the parts of the game that make you feel like trash, the abilities of the enemies you face are worse then yu-gi-oh card effects, and finally, if you think just because you have end game gear you're entitled to 1 shot decimating things in your path think again(this is probably not for you). 

my message to the devs after completing the game is amazing work on the game overall however, try to make the player feel less like their not in control of what happens, when the player reaches end game they should feel like its end game and take the feedback of the community on the parts that feel bad as those parts will 100% make people not finish the game overall. I had many moments of wanting to quit this game but I came back because of the story and good times I had on it. Lastly don't force a playstyle on the player. This is a deck-building game but when it came to bosses like Binah's final realization, it literally felt like if I didn't bring a specific deck I lose...

2022-02-06 Review. 
..
Before i start this second review before beating the game I wanna say this games story telling and everything else is super amazing but there's just certain parts in this game that make you think if the devs we're high in there offices coding this or if it was even play tested. Once you get around to end game the game gets super not fun with the convoluted mechanics that the bosses and enemies are throwing at you and most of the time , you're going to spend hours running the same boss over and over and over again for days on end just to progress a little bit. Its.... not ... fun.

[h1] Here's why you should play this game if you're on the fence about it[/h1]
This game is 10/10 I'm honestly debating putting it as my favourite game of all time on steam.


This game is honestly amazing , everytime i play it i enjoy the story lore music and everything else more and more. Before i start the review I was
on the fence about getting the game at the beginning because personally speaking I thought Lobotomy coporation was super boring. If you're wonder why i bring
up a completely different game when talking about this one its because Lobotomy coporation is the prequel to this game and Library of ruina is the sequel.
what i recommened doing if you truly want to this game but havent play lobotomy is to watch a playthough of the game so you can have a greater apperciation
for the story and characters before going into this game. I promise you this game is 100% worth it the amount of effort put into it is amazing. 
and finally...

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
[i]This game is a deck building game where the odds are always in you're favour as long as you think outside the box.[/i] 
This game consists of you being level 1 goons to fighthing literal ""gods"" and overlords as you construct decks to you're fitting
if you think you learned every system the game has to offer , the game will throw at you a new system just to humble you. There are passives,
status affects and anything else really you can think of. You play as the villian in this game in a sense but later on you discover some stuff
interesting things that happened with the first game to connect this second game. As you battle more and more foes you get stronger and strong 
and the game allows you to as flexible as possible when it comes to making new builds or trying out new things. This game gets super super hard
on some dark soul level but once you overcome those trials the reward make all the work you put in feel 100% worth it. 
Honestly a really fun game overall and i've never really had a bad time playing it. 

[hr][/hr]

[h3] Story [/h3]
Without spoiling too much this game is about finding one sense and what defines someone or something as human. It gives off abit of nier vibes but
this game is its own thing an should be respected as such. Every character in this story is intersting and are all fighting for something 
they believe in. It gets really tense and the overall mood of the story shifts alot. 
[i] Would you say,That someone who had every intention to be brave was a coward? [/i]
[i]I sacrifice people to create a better world , but who will be there for me in the end [/i]
[i]Do you think it's fair for someone to help others but expect no compensation for their work in the end? [/i]
[i]I did it all for you and you wouldn't even look at me [/i]

These are just a few of the lines you'll encounter in the game and their honestly all well place/ executed.

[hr][/hr]

[h3] Music [/h3]
Every song in this game slaps , there really isn't a single song that isnt good. I don't really have anything more to say besides this 
and most of the songs in this game are on my playlist so honestly. 20/10 on music , whoever was in that studio deserves a raise and the whole team
should feel proud to have some of these OST's in their game.

[hr][/hr]

[h3]Overall[/h3]
Honestly from what you can see above i really enjoy this game. It's probably in my top 5 next to ghost of tsushima and the other big titles. I feel 
like everyone should at least give this game a try as it's a really interesting game overall and i'm looking forward to what ProjecMoon decides to release next
i'm currently not even finished the game after all the hours i put into it and i still feel like its a masterpiece. 

Thanks for reading my review this far , if you do get the game cheers and if you don't thanks for reading my review anyways, peace.

Ruina had fixed many crashes, issues, and had always been fast to respond to feedback whether it's good constructive criticism or the immensely salty or unjustified idiotic responses of some people. Moon has been so efficient in just fixing many things.

Story:
You don't need to know Lob Corp to play this game but it definitely does help a lot. As its own, it tells the story of Roland, Angela, and the Library as they receive guests from all over this dystopian world and discover many stories about the world around them. It's an interesting way to tackle things but it also focuses on the Librarians to call back on the previous game's events while also telling its own story. You are essentially a 'villainous faculty' spreading chaos in the hopes of completing your own goal. By turning your visitors into books, whether they are kindhearted souls, villains, or people who just live day to day lives, you simply carry on and attempt to find the one true book that would turn Angela into a book. This has some interesting twists and is just in general fun to witness.

Pet peeve - The villains being revealed was fairly interesting but I wish they got more moments. Their dialogue with each Librarian showed a lot of potential for one on one conflicts.

I also wish we saw more about the world or person's story in the books.

Gameplay
Cards and dice. It's a bit complicated and the tutorial, as helpful as it is early, doesn't explain certain mechanics. Early on it's a bit rough but the more you figure out the game, the easier it gets. Much like Lob Corp it's a game that I definitely recommend playing blind, and taking a peek at hints for when you have too much trouble. The game doesn't stay easy forever and makes sure you know how mechanics works and so on. Yan, Red Mist, and Purple Tear in particular. I'm sure you can find some wacky build out there but you'd be able to master a floor and understand what playstyle they have. You're definitely going to have a favorite depending on what playstyle you want.

Abnormalities are neat little boss fights alongside Realizations that tests you to the limit, but rewards you with amazing cards and even special powers called EGOs that you get to use later on.

Music

Astounding. But I'm the rare few that only loved Mili's music the first time, and simple meh to their music. It's great but there's a reason why Love Town's first music was amazing. Regardless, each Floor and certain enemies have their own music and frankly hearing them pick up the longer the battle goes is very very fun. 

Characters

Lots of em are lovable. Some you might dislike. Depends. Character customization is great too and you can have an entire army of custom made nuggets! (Characters). Alter it as your floor goes. Depending on what enemy you defeat you unlock cooler stuff to customize them. There's also battle symbols too.

Replayability

I feel like this is a game where rather than replayability from the start, you just keep playing and going on. Even without mods you can simply practice and try to find the ultimate floor build or just mess around. Meanwhile with mods, you can definitely have an amazing time.

Overall

I recommend this. It's a unique and fun experience.",1589668595,1645410183,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Though while I do like the deckbuilding aspect, it does get kinda tiring the more units (up to 50) you get, or the fact that floors start off kind of useless until you get to match their unit count with the rest of the library so you kind of use the same things over and over again

Tl;Dr - If you don't like passing two hours in creating  the perfect deck for a single combat, don't buy this game. If you love it... Welcome to the Library.

Probably speaking you love deckbuilders because of ""Slay the Spire"", you've found "" Monster Train "" you liked it, and probably this poped up in your recommendations.
Now first thing firsts. This is a GOOD deckbuilder. But it's completely different as deckbuilder than the aforementioned games.

The first big difference is that you don't play as the hero climbing the tower... You play as the ""monsters"" trying to prevent the hero to climb the tower. So, every game mechanic is around this key difference.

Slay the Spire and Monster Train are ""Roguelikes"" deckbuilders, this one is more in line with Magic the Gathering.
In a roguelike game you don't create beforehand a deck, you find some cards along the way, based on the cards you find you start a build. 
In Library of Ruina  every character ( your nugget if you come from Lobotomy Corp.) can use every card you collect.
In short you manage ""levels"" in every level you can unlock a maximum of 5 nuggets to use during the fights.
You can equip your nuggets with ""attack cards"", with three type of damage, and ""equipment cards"", giving you resistance to those three damage types.
You can unlock for every level a special effects. For an example in one of the level is better to create a burn ailment strategy because it's easier to do it, because of those special effects.

In short you need to create levels that are created to take a certain type of intruders and to do so you need to consider those sinergies:

1)Your nuggets decks vs enemy deck
2)The nuggets decks
3)Your nuggets decks and the level special effects
4)Your level special effects vs enemies deck/stats

Consider the first 15hrs circa of the game a ""tutorial"" in a way. The game wants you to be efficient in considering those 4 points. Before you reach a certain grade you can more or less wing it even with an unoptimized deck, but after that... You need to be able to create a level that takes in mind all those four points.

In short you need a lot, but a LOT of strategizing for winning in this game.

yeah I known about P key to auto dispatch  but this design is just against the core of gameplay. Dev selected the worst abnormalty's mechnism (as the same with hokma in Lobotomy Corp, which is also about time). 

And too many special rules appeared the first time during a 4~5-round's each round (floor's last battle), each made you total waste hours to retry/rebattle the frontier rounds, no check points (even save the current state 
 at round start for interrupt the game to take a break) is designed so you must spent bunch of continues hours to try once, and spent so many tries to understand the suddenly happened rules, and then can really start to considering beat with the right choices(with correct party build).

Game balance become skew while entering the end part of the process (just like Lobotomy Crop.), early access helps to discovering the very skewed design so until the middle part is adjusted to reasonable difficulty, but the end part isn't. 

Dev guy's never learn about this (force player to play without QoL feature) and feels good about this decisions, although I have very positive comments about other part of this game (if not I won't spent over 100 hrs on both), I still sill NOT recommend this game to others just because these design.

But I still muscled through the first level and what made me quit is, the game has a very steep vertical progression that is the cards that you get from higher level are always better than the lower ones and you get bombarded with so many cards that you just use the monkey brain of big numbers = good at some point.

But the entire last part of the game is awful.  There's like 20 more or less boss fight receptions in a row.  There's checkpoints between the fights, but if you're short on any cards and want to get more of something you'll have to start this entire 20 fight chain all over again from the beginning.

Library of Runia elegantly evolves from laying one card a turn to using dozens of cards a turn forcing the player to make several tactical decisions balancing risk, short term and long term payoff.

The pages the player can play are brilliantly animated elegantly communicating the intent behind the cards from singular strikes to relentless beat-downs. The pages are more tactile than many action oriented games; I often found awed by the power and brutality conveyed by the cards. 

The main gameplay gimmick of Library of Runia is that when you defeat an opponent you get their book which can be use to obtain their cards, yes the ones that just destroyed your librarians. You can also can obtained the opponents keypage which often gives sustained auxiliary effects. Library of Runia also gets very hard near the end of the game detailed knowledge of the combat system, powerful decks, and sustained focus and insight into the situation is crucial to triumph. I often found myself holding my breath and revealing in triumph as a critical roll or sustained pressure suddenly turns the situation drastically in my favor. 

Library of Runia does have some minor issues, the search engine for cards can be ineffective at searching for a specific cards, but I managed to get used to the games quirks after some time.

Until like mid game story seems out of control and battles too simple. Also I have not seen this many after-boss-bosses ever in my life. Below are some things I wish were clearer, or some things that should be patched.

1. Attack order. Based on the tutorial I would think my infinite speed die would go first. but only sometimes. I also don't know which page clashes with counter die when I stack against a target.

2. When a target is staggered, I wish it would tell you when you are guaranteed a kill. I always overstack it because I'm not sure.

3. You should be allowed to clash a mass attack with a mass attack. Also I did not know for the longest time you don't have to target the mass attack page to clash it.

4. I did not know if you have a page with attack on top defense on bottom it and you only use the attack, the defense carries over.

5. In the burn book section, there should be a search bar.

6. You should be able to 'lock' a clash. Currently, any higher dice overwrites it and then you have to go over everything at the end to make sure.

7. When multiple enemy pages are targeting one of yours, you should be able to tab through them (with the tab key), like you can when you target the opponent's page. 

8. When hovering a clash, it only shows one side. It should show both sides.

9. When using mass attack, right now it randomly selects an opponent's page. It should automatically choose their weakest page.",1642835864,1642835864,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I finished the game a while ago(5 months ago?), but the world, characters, and story still live rent-free in my head. At the beginning after the intro, I was uninterested in the game with the reasoning I will say later. Thankfully, I was watching someone play the game and decided to stick with it. Eventually, I got interested in the story and started liking the game. At this point, this is my most favorite game of all time. I've played the game about 3 times and spent much time on ridiculously difficult mods(on and off workshop).

	The story is amazing being well written with many of the characters(especially the main ones) feeling quite real with great voice acting supporting that. Although this game’s story is dark and mature, many moments are thought-provoking or wholesome. Also, I like the fact that the characters are not sexualized and have clean, formal attire outside of individuals that shouldn’t like monsters or gangsters/crazies. Really respect this. This game is the sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, but you don’t have to know anything about LC because most things are explained. But, knowing LC’s story may provide you with a different view and give a deeper look into the main characters. Yet, I have some problems with the story.
	1. A slow beginning. I’ll say the worst part of the game is the first 2 tutorial tiers because of how slow it  is with most of the early people being booked are weak nobodies with no one that cares about them as they’re replaceable and without relevance to the overall plot outside of the moral points of the story being made. But it’s likely just an aspect of the world the developers wanted to get across and the fights within the first 3 tiers are tutorial fights. I’ll say the real story begins after the Urban Plague tier.
	2. A bit rushed towards the end
	3. No real exact time for events

	I’ve heard from some that the game is grindy due to the book-burning system. The amount of grind you have to go through is based on how good you are. Because the amount of books that you get depends on how long you can afford to prolong a fight and depends on if you can win since if you lose, you lose the books you put in. If you lose, you can close and reopen the game before the defeat screen to keep the books. Very useful for bosses. Although the devs have sorta tackled this issue from a patch months ago
	Personally, not much of an issue. There's just a lot of receptions and fights in general.

        Although this game is a card game on the surface, it feels and plays like a turn-based rpg with various moves and abilities. I feel it gets interesting past the early stage due to the many combat mechanics and specific effects/pages given by a floor in the library. There's a nice battle simulation afterward. However, I find the early game not very exciting from the small scale and low length of the battles, no passive allocation, and little floor abnormality pages.
	For floor abnormality pages, in the early game, there’s an ability that lets your character suicide bomb at 30% hp. Or in the late game, there’s an ability that forces you to choose all your character's actions in 30 seconds for power. Of course, there are simple effects that give power. Most importantly, the game lets you allot passives from pages of the booked people. There’s a lot of optimization and synergy doable with decks and floors resulting in strong builds, but it can be simple as you like.
	Also by the end of the game, you manage 5 characters that have their own stats, hands, decks, and passives to work with. They start with 2 actions and as the fight goes on, they can have up to 4 actions. May also be true for enemies,
	Also, I’ve heard a lot of complaints about rng but I found it minor as it only slightly arose in overly tough fights. Though you just have to read and understand the game, assuming your decks are decent, not even good. Some tips for players or future ones.
	1. Defensive dice helps to lessen damage. If a character is facing a dice roll(unwinnable or uncertain), damage reduction through defense and stats is huge. Also includes redirecting attacks to take damage for another.
	2. Passives to decrease rng or win any clash. Like giving a character power to overpower enemies. Or making a support that buffs allies and debuffs enemies(bosses)
	3. Using defensive dice to deal with annoying dodge dice. If an opponent is using a huge defensive action with a weak attack, it may be better to not respond. Just using dice or pages to counter another or not responding to actions helps.
	These tips seem simple, but you’d be surprised at how many people don’t do any of these from playthroughs and live streams.
	A large part of this game is reading and understanding.


        The game’s music is fantastic. By now I’ve mentioned floors. When you choose a floor to receive a guest with, each floor has its own theme set that's made with the floor's main character in mind. Also, in battle, if you end up in a “dire” state, the game plays the general battle theme set. A problem is that the floor ost is abruptly cut at times.
	There are lyrical songs by Mili for boss fights, opening, and credits. I believe that they elevate the boss fight. Personally, my favs tied are Children of the City and Poems of a Machine. 
	There are also 3 more ost sets, but those are for non-reception Library fights.
	Also, I really enjoy the main menu “lobby” song, what I’m going to say next sounds contrary, but when I closely listen to it, I feel a sense of reminiscence with a large part of hopefulness to the future. It's also nice jazz. 

         Another specific thing that I enjoy is the flavor of most of the cards, especially the later ones that come from specific characters that show an action or depict a certain scene/moment in the game with the page title.
	I’m fond of the game’s art style as I think it fits the game’s tone. I also appreciate the number of bg art and effects.

         This game is difficult, but a good part is on your decision-making and knowledge of the game since the devs give you all the tools for fights through passives, abnormality pages, etc. After the first 3 sections of the game, each new section afterward will have a difficulty spike. 
	If you ever find yourself stuck in a tier and you have extra books of that tier lying around, I highly advise you to randomly shove those into the invitation screen to do these fights called General Invitations in order to potentially receive highly useful pages of that tier. Those pages may be even more useful at the end of the game. 
	Actually, out of the 100+ fights of the game(reception or Abnormality), I found 5 to be ridiculously difficult even among the difficult fights, but you can cheese 1 if you’re smart while you can wait to do 2 of the others until you’re stronger.

	There is a lot of customization. Outside of the main character of the floor, you can fully customize the in-game look of each person. You can customize the hair(front & back), face with their expressions, name, lines in-battle, hair & skin color using a color palette, height, and clothing using page skins. There are even skins in the workshop that include full-body, head only, and hair only. There are also accessories that you can get after a reception to put onto your characters like some glasses, bruises, and an aura effect.
	
        Oh, but I have to say that the game’s optimization is poor.

	I suppose that’s all I have to say about this game. All that’s left to say is that I look forward to the story and world of the City in future games and comics. Looking forward to the Leviathan comic as the prequel to the next game Limbus Company. This game was quite the journey and my GOTY 2021 despite some problems. I sincerely hope it will also be yours whoever reads this. That’s all!

The mechanics are deep (Ive spent hours just designing team comps) and satisfying. Even after the game has ended I come back just to experience the mechanics. They're a breath of fresh air in comparison to a lot of the industry, and I can only find fault in that this battle system will likely be unique to Library of Ruina forever. But it is a unique game and experience, so I suppose that's appropriate.

Without spoiling too much, the story is superb. It will forever hold a place in my heart, and I have no doubt ill be thinking about it decades later. The themes are rich and deep, and it presents something of a critique and solution to much of modern day ennui. I've actually memorised the realisation achievements, because I wholeheartedly believe they are good virtues to live by. Not even to mention the world building and uniqueness of the setting.

Finally, the soundtrack is absolutely amazing. They must have contracted the pianist because by god are these themes memorable and nice to listen to. The boss themes especially are memorable and impactful;, with much commendation to Milli for her voice and artistic talent.

My advice for any new players would be to stick it out. The game can be hard, especially if you don't fully understand the mechanics. (I only fully grasped counter dice at floor of philosophy realisation XD) But if you look up guides, and keep at it, you should be fine. (Search up blockma strategy for Pluto, you'll thank me if you make it that far.)

The game is EXTREMELY difficult. If you don't fully understand the mechanics by Star of the City, you are going to get rekt. I really struggled to defeat a certain firey boss that continued to roast me alive.

There is also excellent modded content available in the workshop. It adds new cards and keypages, and some look nearly indistinguishable from the base game in terms of quality. Some come with their own custom assets and storyboards that rival the basegames.

The game does a good job of explaining what happened in its predecessor but it cannot capture the pain and despair of these characters.  The previous game covered the suffering of those individuals who become the librarians but this game is focused on Angela.

The game play itself is familiar to anyone who has played deck-building games.  Personally I am not a huge fan of such games and cannot really comment on whether it is a good one or not.  I would have really appreciated a lower difficulty level for folks like myself who are here for more than just the game play.  As it is I will admit to using a cheat engine to get past some of the more difficult fights so that I didn't interrupt the flow of the story.

The artwork is, in my opinion, excellent.  They manage to illustrate the grotesque nature of this world without lingering on filth and gore.  Even the body horror aspects manage to elicit more pity then disgust and I think that furthers the core of the story itself.  The painterly backgrounds lend a misty, dreamy feel that also serves the narrative very well.

Normally when a game is in a language I don't understand I will listen for a little while and then turn off the voices.  Not so with this game.  The voice actors are so superb that even though I do not know what they are saying, I can still appreciate the depth of emotion in their delivery.  Angela and Roland are, of course, stand-out performances but the other voice actors are also excellent.  Not to mention whoever did the audio effects for all of the different ""digital"" voices did a great job.

The world-building is fascinating, a combination of corporate cyberpunk and magical realism with a distinctly dystopian bent.  While Lobotomy Corporation merely hinted at the broken world outside its walls this game expands on that light sketch to paint a City without hope, a future that should have been bright but has fallen into darkness and decay.  Yet even in all of this it manages to not be so broken that it feels unrealistic or unsalvageable.  It is still a world worth saving.

Last but certainly not least is the story itself.  It is a rich and sympathetic look at the pain and suffering of an unloved child.  I really cannot express how moving I have found this story to be.  In Lobotomy Corporation I felt that Angela was being horribly abused and I am pleased to see that the writers have not shied away from that thorny topic.  The depiction of a woman struggling with her own inner demons is not made any less powerful by the fantastical elements that surround it.  Indeed it is amazing how the anomalies that seemed so disconnected from reality link into her inner pain.

Recognition should also go to the localization team who have done such a wonderful job of bringing this game to an English speaking audience.  Thank you all for your hard work.

Overall this is a very enjoyable game and I am really looking forward to seeing what Project Moon will bring us in their next installment.",1641011029,1641011029,True,9,0,0.63374030590057373,0,True,False,False

Completing the first game, Lobotomy Corp, is not mandatory (I did not -management games aren’t really my cup of tea-). You can read an exerpt of the scenario to follow up.

But, to sum it up, both games takes place in a gritty, dystopic asian cyberpunk-ish universe where megacorporations called “Wings” triffle with the technological and supernatural, to abysmal consequences. The first game placed you at the head of one of those shady Wings (much like the SCP foundation), and Library of Ruina puts you in the aftermath of that. The scenario and dialogues make references to those, but as the main character is “new” to this and get explained some stuff, the players who don’t know Lob Corp won’t suffer much from missing out (though, if ultra-stressful but tastefully gimmicky management sims are your stuff, go play it already).

I particularly appreciate the fact that the game can be enjoyed in bits : I can play for 30 mins to an hour and be done with my gaming session, but I know that some advanced fights can last a couple hours.

Much like most RNG-ish card battler games, Library of Ruina requires attention, and a pretty amount (quite enjoyable, so far) of RPG micro-management : you’ll have to regularly edit decks of entire teams, think about synergies and optimization, stuff like that.

The combat system is enjoyable and deep, while being very crisp, thank to a very dynamic execution of attacks (it is not real time, though, but the combats can be quite choregraphic).

Though, I REALLY advise to pay attention. Most complaints about RNG (the game DOES involve dices, after all) are more about precipitation and lack of reading than about the game being unfair. Really, the combat system designers should be praised for a system that will ALWAYS keep you on the edge of your seat.

Don’t worry though : pay attention and you will triumph.

The bad points, now :

- The game is badly optimized. If you have a potato PC, think twice.
- The interface and combats can be overwhelming at first. I STRONGLY advise to impatient players to watch a tutorial video online. There are plenty of those, and they are pretty clear.

The world building is fantastic, the music is great, and the storytelling is excellent. While having played lobotomy corporation will help with references and significance, it isn't necessary to have played it to understand what's going on.

The gameplay itself is also quite good. It's a complex deck fighter that is many layers deep. While I would not say the gameplay by itself is enough to make the game great, everything packaged as a whole makes for an unforgettable experience.

I haven't been able to get this game out of my head. It is a masterclass in atmosphere and storytelling in ways that so rarely work in this medium. It is also one of the saddest pieces of media I have ever consumed. The sadness runs so deep in this world and this story that the people in it don't even understand that they live in utter despair and that hope for a better future doesn't even come into consideration. It is not necessarily that the things that happen are sad, or even that the general vibe is sad, but rather that the world IS sad. It is so sad that it can be almost crushing, and the build up to the end is something worthy of praise. It features probably the saddest character I have ever seen, and the way it is handled isn't mopey or melodramatic. Helping this character overcome their trauma is probably the most powerful thing I've ever seen done in a video game, and it's a series of boss fights.",1620029718,1640849774,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

But Library of Ruina is really something special, easily my favorite game of the year. It's often discribed as a deckbuilder, but that's really a misnomer because it uses a card-based battle system. This is fundamentally a turn-based rpg that uses the deck of cards as a stand in for the abilities you gain and upgrade.

Despite how complex the game is it remains remarkably interesting and well-balanced. Usually not even a fight goes by without you getting access to a suite of game-defining skills and abilities.

That being said, this is probably not a game for everyone, and I'll list the pros and cons below.

Pros:
*Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay
*One of the most innovative recent RPGs
*Constant feeling of expansion and discovery.
** It's actually hard to understate how frequently I've had the feeling that I just got the most amazing piece of equipment or move.
*Challenging
*It's an RPG that really sticks to keeping its gameplay consistent with the story. 

Cons
*Gameplay is highly complex and not all of the mechanics are well explained. When an attack or defensive move was 'retained' and how they differed from 'counters' it not obvious. Mass-attacks are similarly confusing.
*The constant barrage of new stuff is overwhelming at times. One time after a fight I unlocked essentially 2 new deck-archetypes, 2 new sets of boss fights that grant 8 new abilities each, a whole new type of card and mechanic, a 2 new characters, and a bunch of story developments. It was all useful and extremely cool, but overwhelming regardless.
*This game can be very hard. There weren't that many fights I struggled with, but if you aren't the type to over-analyze your every move, you can easily shoot yourself in the foot. 
*This game is LONG, like every fight can sometiems be a 20~30 minute slugfest. Especially near the end.

The soundtrack is fantastic, the story is seriously some of the best writing I've ever read and wouldn't work as well outside of a video game since you are contributing to the suffering of all the characters by continuing to lure them into your library. It is some of the greatest media I've ever experienced. I would recommend playing until you get to the final phases near the end and then watching the rest of the story on youtube or something.

This game is exhausting to play. The deck building is daunting but is not that complicated since the decks are pretty small. You do have to manage a ton of decks and the UI could use some work. The basics of combat take a bit to get used to but once you figure out the intricacies, it goes pretty smoothly. Reading enemies mechanics is more troublesome, since they can have as many cards and abilities as you and it can be easy to miss crucial points in fights. Regular battles where you are fighting variations of the same grunts with maybe some elites are fine, since enemies tend to behave the same and they can be taken down .

The final phase is probably constituting a third of my total playtime and for a game whose story is the main draw, having it grind to a halt in the middle of an emotional beat is simply awful. The story pretty much stops and you are forced to fight boss after boss until the story limps to the finish line.

The issue lies in the pacing of the story's most emotional parts being locked behind obnoxious boss fights. If you ever played a card game and had to read your opponents cards for their combo, imagine that experience but multiplied by the number of enemies that show up. Having to micromanage interactions between your 5 characters and the opponents 5 characters is tedious enough, but when fights drag on, you simply get tired. Then suddenly lose to some attack you misread or simply missed because you've been fighting the same boss for a couple hours (it can take over an hour per attempt). It really isn't about luck if you pick the right cards, but there is so much trial and error to the bosses and it takes so long to even attempt a run that I got burnt out multiple times and had to come back to this game multiple times to beat it. I really don't know why they needed to drag the game on and on in the middle of the highest emotional point but it is really frustrating when I have to invest so much time and energy grinding through these fights, just for the next morsel of progression.

This game has the design ""you are as strong as the equipment you have and the decisions you make"" and to get the equipment you have to beat the enemy that has it, so all new fights are difficult up-hill battles. And to get all the equipment you ask? Two to three fights should do it.

Intriguing, grim story with an amazing atmosphere, detailed, impactful art that makes you pause, all supporting deep and challenging gameplay. Great experience, especially for card game or strategy enthusiasts.  Difficulty can be high at times, but there is no challenge that can't be beat easily with the right approach. One of the best games I've ever played. 

The story and art is breathtaking. Seriously, I kept going back and just admiring the stills. The grim atmosphere that permeates the entire story makes every event seem important, there are no real lulls in the pace, I was excited for each and every reception. Going into an invitation, I'd be looking forward to seeing new guests and the story of how they've arrived at the library. Although you move through so many characters quickly, there is a logical progression as the library grows from a mere rumor to something much more. The art is incredible. Sometimes I just pause in the deck building screen and just look at the cards. The design of how they manifest in battle is continuously satisfying. The audible SMACK of an impact or the bloodcurdling screams of certain enemies meant I never wanted to turn my sound off. Every area's atmosphere is great. 

The gameplay is deep and challenging. As a deck building strategy game, you'll be introduced to new cards and mechanics at a good pace, meaning the game never feels truly overwhelming with mechanics, even for a beginner. You'll have a lot of time to get acclimated to the basics of combat, get introduced to simple mechanics such as bleed and burn, before the game drops more layered and interesting mechanics on the player. Before long, the game ups the difficulty, forcing you to really understand what's going on to succeed. A great part of the game is just how each reception brings a new challenge and the strong balancing of the game allowing for players to have a lot of different solutions based on what they've already completed. And man, the mechanics get fun, especially for abnormality fights that force you to solve them like a puzzle. They start off simple, such as a fight where you have to time when you start the turn, but get more chaotic and diverse, such as a fight where you have to make decisions at breakneck speed or a fight where you're trying to remember if the card the enemy played is real or not. The difficulty is high but honestly at the right level. If you've got a focused plan, theres nothing in the entire game that comes out to too much luck. Each and every fight is doable simply with the right plan, its just that making good combat pages can be difficult if one isn't experienced in these kinds of games. There's a great community that can help with even the most direly difficult encounters.

But I just find it really hard to enjoy playing this game.

The rules are really complicated and annoying. About every other fight you get introduced to a new card that that has 3 minors but still notable game play changes. There's so many small thing the game is expecting you to remember its just overly cumbersome and a relatively simple idea.

The story tends to drag a little. Scenes are very dialog heavy followed by characters talking about their own point of view on scenes that just happened. It kind of fits the tone but it adds a lot to the fatigue I get from playing. 

And the Difficulty curve is all out of whack too. You'll spend the first ten hours playing against parties the same size as yours using cards of equal power, and no strong gimmicks. Then it just flips and you're out numbered by enemies that just have strictly better cards, and absurd gimmicks that purely benefit the enemies. The game does so little to prepare for this difficulty spike, and leaves no indication on what it expects you to do to counter these absurd compositions.

Edit: I'm twice as far in as I originally was when I wrote this review. The story and aesthetic of the game just keeps getting better, but my problems with the game also keep getting worse. It seems like the payoff is there, but the effort it takes to get there is worse than I thought. Nearly 70 hours in and I'm not at the end yet. If you think you would like this game, have a hundred hours to kill, and strong determination go for it. Otherwise I have a hard time recommending it.

Edit 2: Nothing like losing 2 hours in to a boss fight on the bosses 9th phase for the 3rd time. You then get decide was it bad luck and just waste another 2 hours. Maybe watch someone else fight for 2 hours see what they did then waste another 2 hours fighting it.

Final Edit: 130 hours in I beat the game. I still don't recommend doing a normal play through, but this game is something special.",1635551899,1639706879,False,155,34,0.713097810745239258,0,True,False,False

The combat in this game is quite possibly the best of any turn based game I've played. Setting up you're decks and playing them are both hugely important to your success, and both are incredibly satisfying when done right. The amount of customization in this game is expansive without being overwhelming. Don't think this is a game you can breeze through, it's hard, very hard, and there is no easy mode. But with a lot of experimentation, and a little luck, you should be able to make it through. And the satisfaction you get after beating a hard level is great

The Presentation is also phenomenal, both the music and art are great. The story is, well confusing, really good. I haven't played Lobotomy Corp but I'm still enjoying it. The characters are great, both in their design and in their stories. Some moments in this story hit you like a truck, so be prepared.

My only criticism is that this game can sometimes be hard, to the point of feeling unfair, But i'd say the highs far outweigh the lows, so you might just want to grab a guide and hope the RNG works in your favor for some fights. Also this game isn't great at teaching you the ins and outs it's systems so you'll want to look that stuff up. If they fixed up these points it'd be a straight ten.

Overall I'd give it a 9.5 out of 10. If your in for a dark story and a good challenge you won't be disappointed.

I usually despise card games or anything that plays like Library of Ruina, but I found myself in love with about everything the game does. It introduces concepts slowly to not overwhelm you, ensuring that anyone can learn the game.

The game offers multiple ways to play, and all of them have their own perks, making it so that you can just choose a playstyle that suits you. There isn't any real ""wrong"" deck, just ones that are ineffective in some situations, and excel in others. (Or, if you're pretty good about it, one thats just good globally).

The soundtrack and art isn't anything that slacks either. The music done for the game (especially select pieces made by Mili) are phenomenal, and are incredibly well done. I usually don't like listening to music at all, and I heavily enjoy every piece in Library of Ruina. The art is wonderful, and some CGs are perfect as a desktop background.

Thats not to say the game is perfect however, as the whole game (especially later on) is immense trial and error. I quit this game for a month because of a part that was so insanely difficult that whenever I did come back to beat it, it took me roughly 50+ attempts, with different decks each time. The difficulty of the game spikes randomly and is incredibly inconsistent in the later half, as one moment you be fighting really hard against one fight, then the next fight is a cakewalk that takes one attempt to beat compared to the 10+ attempts you've done on the previous battle. 

The only issue I can think of besides that is story continuity from their previous game Lobotomy Corp, as it provides context to some of the events that are going on, and gives you more information about key characters you'll be working with.

Overall though, this game is wonderful and I'd highly suggest anyone who even has a speck of interest in the game.",1637810071,1638346493,True,1,1,0.5,0,True,False,False

Its hard to put into words, and its not the best analogy, but the only way i can think to describe the sudden change in feel to that game at that point is as if you were playing Skyrim when all of a sudden without warning, you were suddenly playing Dark Souls. except nothing is changed on your end to make you able to properly face Dark Souls difficulty. it feels almost like an entirely different game almost. it goes from feeling like your actual skill matters and allowing you nice leeway to have some fun with your decks, to suddenly having to change decks and even floors to perfectly face each challenge aswell as pray for good rng to a level you never had to before. 

as if that change wasnt bad enough, the method to shape decks and get specific floors ready for a fight is fine enough... if you dont plan to be changing much for awhile. having to change it per encounter? it is a tedious chore in and of itself to shift everything around and prepare things each time.

its a shame, as up unilt that point it felt fine. good gameplay, good difficulty, etc. but the sheer increase and change in feel at that point alone makes it to where i have to do the opposite of recommend, but actually feel i should warn against it. it saps the fun from its own game so suddenly and harshly im not at all sure what was going through their minds.

The sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, but it has a new gameplay system. Turn-based Card Battle system where you have your units roll for speed as opponents show their incoming attacks, then select cards to have your units respond to opponents. If you have higher speed, you can intercept lower speed opponents and change the fight to your advantage.

As the game progresses, new mechanics are slowly introduced, such as ailments (Burn, Bleed, Smoke, etc.), Ranged attacks that happen immediately before Melee attacks, Counter dice, etc. If you complete your objectives well, you'll begin to unlock various boss fights that will test your knowledge of the gameplay system, which will in turn reward you with greater power through additional units, upgrade cards that can be selected mid-battle, or special attacks.

The game is very regularly updated, generally once a week if not faster (aside from a one month hiatus that preceded one of the biggest updates ever upon return), with hotfixes for bugs or new cards happening very closely after. The game is very good about not abandoning mechanics, as later fights will incorporate older mechanics in new ways and introduce support for the archetype that can bring them back to glory.

All in all, Library of Ruina is a very consistent turn-based strategy card game with a lot of cool mechanics that blossom as you play along. Highly recommend it, my personal Game of the Year.

The characters are amazing and paint this interesting grimdark corporate dystopia where everyone must fight for survival, coupled with trying to make sure you and yours have something worth living for. The characters are human, their thoughts and feelings are evident, and I genuinely teared up a few times. 

The said this is a hard sequel to Lobotomy Corporation. If you haven’t heard of that game before you are going to completely lost for some of the major plot points, and aspects of the world. The game does eventually explain itself, but be prepared.

It's worth noting that this game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation.  Although you do not need to play that game to understand the story of this one, I would strongly encourage it as it is another amazing title.

To people wondering if you should get LoR: I cannot recommend this game enough, but the beginning can be a bit rough if you want to follow the story.  The tutorial also isn't that good.

I dont know where else to mention this so I'll just put it here:
The game has only 1 save slot yet again for no reason which is just an absolutely confusing design choice tbh.

I bought this on release and then dropped it an hour later till now.

The atrocious UI that physically hurt to use at release has gotten a lot better but is still lacking a bunch of features that make it feel clunky or just archaic for a turn based combat game like this in 2021.

Theres no drag and drop.
No options for ui scaling (or game settings at all really).
No popup window to compare cards or stats.

You are again tasked with micro managing 50 characters (10 teams of 5) making character loadouts for each and every one of them (granted you can save and load sets to every single one if you have enough cards but thats still doing the same thing 50 times).

Theres no feel for a combat cards strength or character progression you just get tons of cards that all do basically the same thing they only differ in small ways like:
1-3 values higher or lower on moves.
Attack type and order of the 3 moves.
Random seemingly insignificant status effect like 1 dmg of bleed at the start of the next round.

Key pages (basically a loadout/class with stats) too only vary in tiny amounts of hp, resistances or random worthless 2% chance +1 dmg on attack passive abilities that are just sad to look at.
Im like 6 hours in and I dont feel like my characters are any stronger than they started out as I just keep giving them the highest rarity/newest things I get but it all looks and feels the same.

Combat itself is just utterly frustrating dice rolling thats no fun and makes you feel like you are blowing at a concrete wall until a lucky roll staggers an enemy and lets you finish them.

Combat is basically just clashing (your card vs the attacked enemies card) or flanking an enemy to keep them from attacking another one of your dudes.
But this system only KINDA works because every character rolls a speed value at the start of each turn that is completely meaningless after the first character moves cause your dude having 5 speed doesnt matter when the 1 speed enemy is standing next to your 6 speed guy that just spend the opening move on walking over to the enemy.

An enemy can play a combat card that has a dodge move at the start and if you are unlucky that 1 move can dodge all 3 of your attack moves leaving you helpless as he just beats you over the head with the remaining 2 attacks and theres nothing you can do about it. FUN.

Theres no displays to show you the card of the enemy that is about to attack your selected character or anything you just have to go back and forth clicking on each enemy to see their card comparing resistances and attack types of every single one its just a chore that doesnt need to exist.

No real tutorials just like 6 pngs that tell you what stats do and how to attack and thats it.
No tips on how to use any of this to your advantage or how to build a good deck/team.
It just gets frustratingly hard as the enemy count increases as you wont be able to deal effective damage and focus enemies down without taking heavy damage yourself anymore in a game without (proper) healing moves.
Like seriously just a short tutorial telling you to ""use that card vs this kind of card"" would have been enough to make this half as painful.

All the special rankup challenge kind of monster bossfights ive been through so far have been gimmicky garbage like in lobotomy corp again often times leaving you no other choice but to trial and error till you understand the arbitrary 1 time mechanic and are lucky enough to win cause you gotta beat that boss with a single character to unlock the second character slot for that team.

Luckily those monster fights can be tried an infinite amount of times till you make it cause regular story missions destroy the books you used to enter them if you lose forcing you to backtrack in the story fighting old enemies again to get the books back if you didnt keep spare ones and theres just absolutely no reason for this to exist other than to annoy the player.

I really hope their next game (despite it being a mobile game) has some decent gameplay.
Cause I really do like what they have been putting out so far on a surface level but I just cant recommend this chore to anybody in good conscience.
If you are interested in the story go watch a letsplay.
If you are interested in turn based combat go play something else cause this is real bad.
This game has nothing to offer that you have to experience in person unless you like to boast about how you threw yourself at the same unfun fight 35 times till you won.

Im probably just going to cheat my way through this like I did with lobotomy corp in preperation for the next game which is set in the same universe and will feature characters and story elements from this one.",1638050842,1638053208,False,2,2,0.500364124774932861,0,True,False,False

Game play wise it replaces the management sim with a team based card combat system in which you earn cards through fights that you can use to increase your characters stats and abilities or fill out their decks to fight with a particular strategy. The game gets difficult later on and will require you to either have a strategy that works for the particular fight and/or grind fights to get the stronger cards you need (Though I didn't have to grind the same fights too often)

As a librarian, your job is to bully and torture the trash that enters your library while slowly gaining enough recognition to assert your dominance in the city. (P.S not joking about the torture, you actually do that to gain more rewards)

LOR is a simple card based/deck building simulation which you use to pit your librarians against noisy individuals which crossed into your sacred lands. Unlike most card based games, rng elements in this game can be controlled, limited and exploited by you, the player, if you know what you are doing. 

In LOR, you can create different decks for your librarians and progressively improve the cards they use by defeating enemies and or going mad (emotion system). Remember when you played games and defeated the boss and the boss joins your party but becomes utterly useless. In LOR, you become the boss and inherit (steal) the abilities that they had. If that isn't sufficient, you could combine multiple bosses abilities to become a one man army if that is your play-style,
 
Price: Very generous compared to the amount of time you will spend finishing this game (no lesser than 50 hours since you will be making alot of mistakes)

The game is separated into 6 sections, Canard, Urban Myth, Urban plague, Urban Nightmare, Star of the city and Boss rush the movie
The first 3 sections, Canard to Urban Plague can be considered early game where you would learn about the different mechanics of deck building and clashing. The early part doesn't have alot to offer story wise as it is just settling you into the chaotic setting of the city but instead focuses on introducing the mechanics so you would not keep dying at the latter parts
The next 2 sections, Urban Nightmare and Star of the City can be considered the mid game where you would learn more about the city and the librarians. Additionally you will start touching on more abnormalities in the library and be introduced to the boss-rush mechanics.
The last section helps ties the game together and can be considered long or short depending on whether you are able to understand the game mechanics and utilize them to its full potential. 

Music: Amazing. The soundtrack you listen changes depending on the librarians emotion level and the floor they are fighting on. Furthermore, when you reach the mid game, you would start experiencing bosses with their own bgm which would draw you into the right mood. Especially the final section of the game where they clearly put alot of effort into producing the right soundtracks to give you that fighting emotion. If that hasn't convinced you yet, they are selling the soundtrack as a standalone for 75% of the base game price and people actually bought it.

Cons: Gameplay difficulty. Difficulty spikes as soon as you reach star of the city and it is no exaggeration. But, if you actually paid attention to how the game works and not used some cheesy ass bleed/burn only build, the game-play spike isn't too bad. 

Overall, you should definitely get this game if not for the game-play but for the story and the music. Especially for the late game where they have clearly spend alot of their budget on.

Library of Ruina is the sequel to the game Lobotomy Corporation, though you can easily play this game and get an understanding on the story even if you haven't played the previous game, even if it means a few things might confuse you a bit more.
It's a story-based battle sim, taking place in a library. Your goal in this library is to invite guests, fight them to the death, and turn them into books. With these books you can either invite stronger guests, or burn them to access the pages, which can serve as both your attacks and armor.
The game is a bit known for having specific parts of the game where difficulty may bottleneck (the first chapter of Star of City is a prime example of this) which can discourage anyone who wants a relaxed gameplay session, but needless to say the game is very worth looking into if you enjoy deck building, strategy, and some overall good story telling.
I can't say much else without spoiling both games.

8/10.

Let me explain. This is a great game, and there's a lot of people that acknowledge that, yet don't recommend it anyways. And there are legitimate reasons for that, the game has a lot of flaws, and its really, really long. However, in today's age, there's a lot of games out there that have done so much to try and appease everyone that they've lost what made them special in the first place. Personally, I would rather have a rough game made with passion than a cash grab with high production value. And it's clear to me that a tremendous amount of passion went into this one. But that's that, and this is this.

Cons
-Roughly 100 hours required to beat the main story. For some people, this will be a good thing, but for others, this will make the game hard to juggle between your job and having a personal life or enjoying other things. 

And it would be one thing if it was only the combat and story that took up this time, but too much of it is spent on the deckbuilding itself. Do yourself a favor if you pick this game up; instead of equipping each of your characters with an entirely unique deck, build one for each archetype that works, save it, and move it to whichever characters you feel like using at the time.

-Missing sound and visual effects. I dont know if its just a bug, or if they were actually abandoned, but there's a lot of AoE attacks in the game that feel unfinished. They either feel like they're missing animations, sound effects, feel like they're playing too slow, or a combination of the three. Thankfully they're rare, but it happened often enough to me for the game to feel lesser because of it.

The same problem exists for story cutscenes, too. The music in this game is great, don't get me wrong, but I wish there were more soundtracks for the out of combat portions of the game. There are a lot of instances where the bgm feels too happy or calm for the situation. On top of that, there are a lot of times where it feels like the game is missing appropriate scene transitions.

-This game is a direct sequel to another game from an entirely different genre. If you like both deck building RPGs and workplace management rouge-lites, this probably wont be a problem for you. But for me, it was. While you don't *need* to play Lobotomy Corp to enjoy Library of Ruina, it does add context to the story and enhances the experience. I skipped this problem by browsing through the wiki and watching all the cutscenes from the first game via youtube, but its still a barrier to entry.

-An overwhelming amount of mechanics with a mediocre tutorial. This is probably the biggest barrier to entry the game has. Don't worry about it too much though, you'll probably figure out most of it as you play, and there's some helpful guides on youtube as well (Hod's Emotion Coin Class is a great one.)

-New cards locked behind RNG. For me, this wasn't too big of a problem, but it's understandably frustrating for others. Some fights in this game are especially long, and while you'll usually get what you need from beating a boss just once if you're efficient, sometimes you don't. And when you don't, it can be a real slog to go through it all over again. You usually wont have to go through a fight more than 2 or 3 times to get all possible rewards, though.

Pros
-The gameplay is incredibly unique and satisfying when you win. Cardgame RPGs are a recently emerging genre, with a lot of them either drawing the majority of inspiration from Slay the Spire or behaving like a more traditional tabletop game where you replace your attacks and equipment with a deck of cards that you shuffle through, while otherwise behaving exactly like a turn based rpg. These aren't bad things, Slay the Spire is a great game, but it's really refreshing to see a new take on things, and Library of Ruina really goes the extra mile into making its gameplay feel different. I won't bore you with all of the details, but essentially, combat phases are turned into dynamic ""clashes"" instead of being turn after turn, and there's a unique leveling up mechanic that takes place during each individual fight.

-None of the encounters are randomly generated. Every single fight has been hand-crafted. Each one is a puzzle with its own pattern you have to figure out, instead of going through a flowchart of the different kinds of possible assorted enemies. And then there are specific fights with even more unique mechanics that feel even more like puzzles to solve that turn into gauntlet battles later on. Not all of them are great, but they're all uniquely designed. It takes time to do this, and I really appreciate Project Moon's dedication to doing things the hard but right way.

-The music is fantastic. This is highly subjective, but you'll find a lot of people saying the same thing and I'm just throwing my hat in to say they're right.

-The setting is entirely unique and well-written. We aren't shown everything about it, and not all terms are immediately explained, which could be a good or bad thing depending on your tastes. But once you understand what all the terms mean, everything starts to make sense, and you get this really cool post-apocalyptic modern fantasy dystopian world run by a mysterious ruler that intentionally keeps it the way it is. There's all these different factions that are constantly struggling for power, offices of people that just try to keep the peace, weaponsmiths that are mentioned and shown via the equipment your enemies wield, monsters lurking in the backstreets, and it all comes together to feel like a world that lives and breathes on its own. It's a great setting and I'm looking forward to learning even more about it when they finish their next game.

-The characters have personality, the story is good, and the messages are profound. There's a lot of obvious inspiration drawn from the Epic ""Orlando Furioso,"" and the ultimate theme is about the cycle of revenge, but there's so much more to it than that. (It also helps that the execution of Revenge Bad was *actually* well done and didn't rely entirely on making you feel guilty about killing pregnant women 3 times and dogs.) We have the common, Baby's First Themes like those, but we also have topics like the hope for one's self to become a better person, the expectation that we'll one day discover meaning to our lives, how an act of supposed selflessness can actually be the worst kind of selfishness, the different forms Faith can take and why we need it, and many more.

Neither of these lists are exhaustive, but the review's already getting too long and I feel like I already listed the major points that will affect whether or not you buy it. One thing I wish they had more of would be side-stories of the main characters' daily lives outside of the combat. What we have is good, I just feel like there wasn't enough. But with all that being said, it's a fantastic game that really shows it came from the heart of the developers, and we need more of those.",1637895290,1637895290,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Long review ahoy.

* Before talking about the game, you should know two things first:
Library of Ruina was first released through Steam Greenlight, where it was periodically updated with balancing and story progression in an episodic way. This is why some older reviews critique the game for not being finished. The game is currently finished so you don't have to worry about that ^^
Second, LOR (Library of Ruina) is also a semi sequel to the game developerses first game, Lobotomy Corporation. LOR takes place in the same universe and continues the story of LC (Lobotomy Corporation). So to get the full/enhanced and intended experience with LOR, it is recommended to either have played LC or looked up LC's story beforehand. However, it is still possible to play LOR without knowing 100% of the story/lore from LC, since LOR's narrative is focused on telling a new and unique story half separate from LC's, expanding the world the games take place in and laying down the groundwork for future instalments. Also, when LC's storybeats are used or referenced in LOR, they are also usually re-explained. So if you are unfamiliar with some of LC's stuff, you won't be completely lost.
Other than that, the two games each have different and unique gameplay styles from each other. If you are interested in that, too. Also LOR completely spoils the plot of LC, just so u know.

* Actual game stuff:
The game is a story driven mix of rpg, visual novel, action card-game strategy game. With a big heap of futuristic, capitalistic dystopian. You are Roland, a washed up low grade mercenary called a 'fixer', as he stumbles into a supernatural library and gets suckered into assisting the robotic owner, Angela, with her plans of becoming human and getting revenge for her past. You follow their and the other librarians' journey through the City to expand the library and fulfill their goals. The City itself is a giant and technological advanced dystopian metropolis, where mega corporations each role districts and murder or worse is the daily for most backstreet citizens.
* The game itself is split in three/four sections;
Story sections, which are visual novel styled and play out the story.
The library, which works as the main hub, where you can manage equipment and prepare 'invitations' for 'receptions' + other.
The receptions are battles you have with the invited guests. They play out as turn-based 'card' battles. Usually, it's your team of librarians vs. the guests. Each of your allies has a deck of 9 cards which they can use in combat. Each turn, all characters will roll a speed die(s) which determines the order of the characters' action. Then, you will be able to see your opponents attack card + who they are gonna target. you can select each of your librarians and pick one card from their hand and point it towards an enemy. Once you are satisfied with your librarian's actions, you can hit continue to see the fight play out. rinse and repeat.
The 4 section of gameplay, also called an abnormality fight, is kinda similar to receptions/normal battles, but they work on slightly different rules. You will face an abnormal creature and have to maneuver its mechanic to defeat it.

This game is just fantastic. If I could nominate this for multiple awards, I would. Soundtrack, story, gameplay, everything is just fantastic.

This is solidly, and without a doubt my favorite game I've ever played, and I've put probably way more hours than I should have in a game I've owned for less than a year, but that was for a reason. I have to say that I really love Project Moon's work so far, and they're my favorite game devs at the moment.

Library of Ruina has a unique battle system unlike any that I've seen in any other RPG, and I really love it. So much so that when I beat the game, I decided to look into mods so that I could extend my game some more. I'll get back to mods later. The base game, itself, is long, so you'll definitely get your money's worth in terms of playtime. There are also a lot of ways to play the game due to the variety of skills, floor-specific buffs, and loadouts you can give to each of your librarians. This adds something of a sandbox element to the game that is very fun, even after you've beaten the game as you can replay previously completed fights. This also means that there is value to replaying the game should you choose to do so. Elements such as buffs, debuffs, effects, speed, attack order, dice types, resistances, staggering, and abnormality powers give some amount of complexity and depth to the combat such that you can improve your gameplay by thinking smartly as you build your teams and respond to the enemy's actions as the fight proceeds.

Moving away from gameplay, you have the story, art, and music. I absolutely love the OST for this game. The vocal tracks by Milli are amazing as are a number of the themes from the unique encounters. The rest of the OST is pretty solid as well. I'm no art critic, but, hey, I think the art looks great. The story is great. Project Moon really excels at world building and writing characters. You will learn a lot about the setting of this game from the story and credenza. The main two characters, Angela and Roland, have some great stories as well. I'll leave it to you to find out about them as well as the rest of the stories of the city. It's all really great stuff.

As a note, this game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation. Note that if you're coming from that game that this is a completely different gameplay system if you didn't catch that already from earlier in my review. On the other hand, if you are interested in Ruina but maybe got turned off by Lobotomy Corporation, I'll say that Ruina will explain most of what you need to know so that you won't get lost and will know what you need to know to understand Ruina.

I said I'd get into mods, so here I go. As an English player, you have two main options for getting mods: Steam Workshop and non-Workshop mods. Mods are great for adding more customization to your game and adding more content. Don't like the way a certain mechanic works? There's probably a mod for it. Want some more character customization options? There are outfits, hair, and eye mods in the Workshop. Want more battles that give you new gear and maybe an interesting story? Check the Steam Workshop or Nexus mods. You can get so much more from a game with a good modding community than a game without one, and Ruina is a game with one. Personally, I love challenging myself by taking on modded fights with equipment from the base game.

I do have to say that some fights in this game are hard, and sometimes you may have to do some fights over again to get more equipment, but  I don't think this detracts from the overall experience. It feels SO great to finally beat a difficult fight. For the most part, the game has very good balance, and if you're running into trouble, it may just be because you need to upgrade your gear or change the way you approach the fight. Unga bunga isn't going to get you through every single fight. You do need to strategize sometimes. In terms of repeating fights, if you get through it once, you can just as easily get through it again. Furthermore, you'll have an even easier time once you get better gear.

At the time of this review, I've put 406 hours (about 2/3 of that has been spent with mods or sandboxing with builds in the post game) into this game and have had it for about 5 months. It's definitely my favorite game I've ever played, and I hope Project Moon gets more recognition someday. They definitely deserve it. 

I consider this game a must-play or at the very least a must-try. I'm looking forward to Project Moon's future work.",1625183669,1637846321,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The gameplay is backed by a phenomenal soundtrack, consisting both of breathtaking Orchestral pieces, and songs performed and provided by the amazing musical group Mili, and the sound design of the game itself is a topic all its own.

I don't have all that many hours in this game yet because I'm replaying the predecessor to this game, but you will definitely understand LoR more and enjoy the abnormality fights more if you are familiar with Lobotomy Corporation.

I've mainly played the game while it was in early access, so I will need to update this when I get around to it. But the deckbuilding and fighting feels snappy. You can skip the dialogue and cut scenes if you really want to, but I think it's an essential part to enjoying the game. There's still character customization, different stat bonuses from specific fights, etc. It's definitely the type of game you will find yourself sinking a lot of time into.

EDIT: I finished the game, and I wish it could still go on, but alas, all good things must come to an end. [strike]And yes, like everyone is saying [u]this is Early Access done right[/u][/strike] The game is finally complete, I still see no reason to make any changes to my review, besides this one


[h1]The Basics[/h1]
Library of Ruina picks up directly after the true end in Lobotomy Corporation, so you're gonna be pretty damn lost if you're new to this universe, the game has some explanations and flashbacks here and there. Personally LC is not a game for me so what I did was watch all the story cutscenes and read up on a few of the creatures known as abnormalities, as well as footage of key moments of the game to try and understand what that game is about, I don't feel lost with that level of knowledge but some references fly over my head.

[h1]The Gameplay[/h1]

This game is a very addicting turn based RPG, you have a team of characters with speed dice which they use to take actions, and the order in which they do, and combat cards, each with their own set of dice, every speed dice can play a card, which has a point cost and then when that character's turn arrives they will attack or clash with another character and attack or defend based on their card dice, which can be attack (2 categories, melee and ranged and 3 types, slash, blunt, pierce) or defense (block and dodge). Simple right?

But then, characters also have a stagger gauge that will leave them stunned for a turn when empty, and then there's also damage resistances, for both health and stagger, and then there's passive abilities, amount and roll range of speed dice on characters, passives, emotion gauges, team emotion gauge (the music changes based on which gauge is higher!), card mechanics, and then you have to manage all this information in battle, prioritize some things and as a result overlook others which bite you in the ass and steal a turn from you. [b]The game itself is easy to learn and you have a manual you can read at any point[/b], it's just that battles can get pretty chaotic and might not be able to pay attention to the little details, like you want to focus on defense and redirecting attacks so no one gets hit too hard but then forget that you're using a slash attack against a slash resistant enemy, which is not terrible unless you were counting on a stagger to turn the tables.

Outside battle you build decks for characters which have 2 types of cards, the combat pages you use in battle and a key page that defines their stats like health, stagger, number of speed dice, damage resistances and passives, owning a key page also unlocks that character's appearance (their entire body minus the head) to use when customizing your crew, key pages are also used to transfer passives to other key pages, so you can equip a page that inflicts 1 bleed stack on a successful slash attack and give it a passive from a key page that increases the power of slash dice by 1.

[h1]The Story[/h1]

Next is the story, which follows Roland, a fixer that finds his way into this library and is forced to work with the director to help expand it, by challenging people and defeating them to turn them into books, which gives the library more power and expands it, opening more floors and recruiting important characters. The story has multiple layers, there's the overarching story of the library that is presented to you as you win battles and develop the library, and then there's smaller plot threads that you see glimpses of before each battle that show what life is like in the city and how people are starting to take notice of the library and sending their own people to find out more about it, or recover the books of people you defeated and obtain their valuable information. [b]The story will also present you with a ton of in-universe terms that are mostly found in other source material such as LobCorp and some novels, if you're curious, this seems like a good guide to the world of LoR to check, but I'd suggest only checking after deciding if you will deal with or skip LobCorp and/or its lore[/b]

[h1]The Music[/h1]

And last but not least, the music, the music is great, alright? The game has a cool opening, a cool menu and dialogue theme, as for battle music, there are various flavors, which music plays in regular battle depends on what floor of the library you're fighting in and which team has more emotion points, if the enemy has more, a generic theme with 3 levels of intensity will play, if your team has more, that floor's theme will play, also with 3 levels of intensity, and of course, there's also special battles that have their own themes, some of them with lyrics, you know in RPGs that means business. [b]I'd tell you to go check out the battle themes but then YouTube might end up recommending spoiler videos so proceed with caution[/b]

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]

Library of Ruina is a game that brings me excitement like no other (ironically, the theme of the game is that people fight and intensify their emotions to become more powerful), it's my most played single player game, and the one I've played most consistently, quite a feat for someone like me who keeps jumping between a couple games at a time

I really like this game so I hope that I managed to hold your attention and/or gave you enough information to make a decision on the game, preferably towards playing it, if you like turn based RPGs with good story, abundant lore and catchy music I don't think you can go wrong, even if it takes [i]some[/i] dedication and research to understand the setting. My only complaints are that the story ended and there's not much replayability other than replaying old fights (except 80% of the boss battles) EDIT: They added workshop support for custom fights, although the workshop NEEDS a tag/category to find them more easily",1612125251,1637825992,True,9,0,0.566091477870941162,0,True,False,True

Game got fantastic music. I really like the art. The only problem is have with this game is the game play. Lots of mindless grinding. Combat pages seriously need a buff and enemies need a buff. Many combat pages will never get to see the light of days. And I just breeze through the fights. Gotta love me some cheese. Love the story and world building of this game.

Overall I would say the game deserve a high 7 to a low 8 out of 10 in my book. A seven, I think LOR is a wonderful little game. I would recommend it to people; however I think the game is a bit of a niche. An eight, I think the game can be arguable a classic for its niche. The game is definitely worth its price.  

This game also raises and discuss many interesting philosophical aspects. Though I do wish it would discuss those existential phenomenal more in depth rather than just gloss over.

Liked the game so much, that I actually 100% the game. o.0

The pause between updates allowed you to hype yourself more for the next update, to reflect on the story, to think where it could and couldnt go. I am very grateful to this game for giving me something to wait for every single week, for almost a whole year. BUT, the game most likely feels like a slog now.

If you are reading this in the distant future, the game was updated with a new fight or two each friday pretty consistently. There were a few breaks, but otherwise it introduced more story and gameplay each week. This is something that you would expect to be the case with a tv show, but you don't see it with games. Ruina is the first game I know of that took this path through its early access, and it certainly hooked me in.

The story of Library of Ruina is exceptional. The game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, which i recommend you play first, but it is no means required as one of the main characters, Roland, has little to no clue of the events of that game so you can get to learn it alongside him. Roland and several other fellow patron librarians are tasked with battling foes that were invited into the Library owned by Angela in order to gain their books in Angela's quest to find the One True Book.

Ruina takes a somewhat unique approach to its characters, and I won't get too much into it as that's part of the charm. The early game can be a bit bland storywise, but it picks up early on and keeps that momentum up until the very end. There are several battles that have a very strong impact and are some of the highlights of the game.

The gameplay is rather unique in some aspects. It plays out like your average card game, with card draw and energy management and the like, but it has the unique aspect of controlling several different characters with their own decks at the same time. This gives you a lot of room for customization, as there a lot of mechanics for special decks that you can mix and match in order to get a strong team composition. The difficulty is also never too high, unlike the game's predecessor.

The game is also split into two parts, the receptions and the abnormalities. The receptions are the main story, in which you receive some of the many guests who arrive at the library, while the abnormalities are monsters from Lobotomy Corporation who you can fight against in order to buff up your librarians and learn some info about them. Both of these parts are fun and feel separate from each other, being designed rather differently despite keeping the same mechanics.

The soundtrack for this game is also one of the best ones I have heard in a long time. Not only is the game's music great, there are also a variety of songs that were produced by Mili, which are also very good and fitting for when they play despite having vocals. The music covers a lot of varying genres, from stuff like rock music to classical.

The game is still in early access as of posting this review, but Project Moon has already talked about how they are planning on fixing several things that have been untouched in some time. Their work so far has already been very exceptional, so I don't doubt their ability to make changes. The ending, while being very good, still needs some tweaking story and gameplay wise, but that is something that the developers are working on right now. 

In conclusion, buy Library of Ruina. This game is an incredibly unique and fun experience that handles things so differently from so many games. It's worth the $30, and it's no short game, with 115 hours being how long my full playthrough took. I hope this guide helps to convince you of getting the game, and if not, at least helped you to consider getting it.",1618801411,1637796484,True,3,0,0.524474203586578369,0,True,False,False

[/b] An iconic line that we will hear very often in this wonderful piece of art that is called Library of Ruina. It isn't your usual library where you just borrow your books and go away, you fight for it.
An anime style game about strategy and tactics? I'm always in for that. A game that also has a well written story and wonderful people that accompany that? That's even better! But I shouldn't get ahead of myself, because there is one thing that always needs to be asked about a game: Is it a worth buy title or not?

[b] Story: [/b]
There will be no spoilers, you won't have to worry about that. But it needs to be said that the story takes place after the events of the prequel of the game Lobotomy Corporation. Of course, you don't need to know everything about that game in order to understand Library of Ruina, only the basic information is enough. Which makes this game's story very good: You don't need knowledge of the previous game to understand what they're saying. (I actually played Library of Ruina before Lobo Corp, so maybe it's just me on that point.) Characters that appear in the story so far are mostly likeable, side characters that have their own story are also characters that can or cannot be liked by the players, which is just a good point for this section.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]
This is a game where you need a bit of experience: You fight the people where you may end up winning or losing. If you lose, you try to find a strategy build around card building and find the best build that you think could beat the people. With this said: This game does require you to grind, it also requires you to change up your builds from time to time. The most important thing about the game is also continuing to learn and become better. The game mechanics are taught to you by a manual provided by the game, but you wouldn't get far by just reading that. If you did understand the gameplay of the game you'll realise one thing: It's luck based too, which is a positive and negative thing for me, but it's expected to be luck based. One thing that this game took from its prequel is how cruel it can be, and that is in my opinion well done, especially when both games have way different game genres (Monster Management vs Library Battle Simulation). Overall though, the game mechanic is super fun, the visual novel section where you find more stuff out that involves the characters could be tedious for others, but it was enjoyable for me also.

[b] Sound/Music: [/b]
And here we have yet another example of why I love hearing things in games. The game has well done, almost perfect, sounds and music that accompanies this game. Calm, hysteric, serious, sad, nerve wrecking, orchestra, and even our wonderful genre ""Is this Doom Music?"", it's all here in this game. The game doesn't have just its original songs from this game, it also has remixes of the prequel, which sound really terrifying and stress filling, just like how you'd feel in Lobotomy Corporation when you hear those songs. If anyone is interested, they are all on Youtube and it's worth listening to. The fact that they got Mili songs in here too is just purely amazing.

[b] Graphics: [/b]
I don't pay attention to graphics that much, but it's pretty stylish and pretty. The only problem I'd have is frame rate drops in battles on high quality, however that is only because either the stage isn't optimized yet or my PC is bad.

[b] Replay Value: [/b]
Currently, there is no way to have several save files, only by backing up your data in your LOR Folder on steam, so the only way to really re-do fights is just battle them with your usual setup or you risk starting all over again with no gear.



[i] In the end, I just have to say this: If Project Moon keeps this up and continues making that great of content, it'll be a wonderful indie company, especially when I consider this is an Early Access game! Definitely recommended for people that like these type of games! [/i]

As the game progresses, you're given more and more cards to work with as the main difficulty comes from how you utilize every card you've gained and how well you've learned the different mechanics presented. This game, depending on how you understand the rules, can be so hard as to barely scrape by in a fight, or easy enough to use only one Librarian to sweep an entire encounter.

That being said, my other main praise is cost-efficiency of the game. To beat the story took me 100+ hours, and the game only costs $30. And for 100+ of gameplay, it was highly enjoyable!

My only complaints lie in certain Abnormality Fights that are just not very fun to play (Price of Silence).

If I had to say the main draw of the game, it is the story and the characters in it. Although the game is a sequel, it tells its story in a way that even a newcomer can enjoy it, with small nods and bits that people who played Lobotomy Corporation will notice. No single character is there to simply throw away. Each one is established and well written, with amazing VA (Albeit only in Korean, the emotion in every line is clear).

It's for the best to not skip LC before playing LoR otherwise some scenes won't be as impactful and you might fail to understand a bunch of lore mentioned through the game.

The story begins right after the events of LC and we're quickly introduced to Roland, a battered down Grade 9 Fixer (the lowest rank in the Fixers, people who do all sort of stuff in exchange for monetary compensation, ranging from intelligence gathering and protection to finding your lost cat) and it's all downhill from there.

Gameplay dragged out past the halfway point in the story. I had other stuff to start and finish so I just grabbed a couple of cheat mods, went through the fights myself, read the backstories of the characters, and still enjoyed the rest of the story.

Soundtrack is 10/10
Story is 10/10 
Graphic design for characters, UI, etc and general style of the game is 10/10
Gameplay is 8/10.

Honestly if you're coming from Lobotomy Corporation and expecting an easier experience....yea, it's sorta easier. But despite the ability to search for cards and their specific abilities, and despite the ability to retry fights without losing your nuggets, it's still very much a classic hard game by Project Moon. If I had more time I could've grinded my way to a legit playthrough but all in all that's my only regret, otherwise the game was very much worth my time and money.

For people who wanna jump straight into this game, I don't doubt you'd still be able to enjoy the game and its story, but for those who want to know if it really is worth going through LobCorp before playing this game...Yes, it is worth going through the [i] story [/i] of LobCorp at the very least. Watch the story sections and some of the gameplay on Youtube if you don't feel like playing a management game. There's simply far too much context and emotional buildup from that game that it legitimately feels like you're missing half of LoR's story if you haven't experienced LobCorp.",1637683444,1637683444,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I usually have the mindset of plan my day to play a game I buy for 1 and a half hours and make my final decision. I was already 5 hours in before I realized I loved this game. That said, I will parrot the words of other reviews a bit.

- If you do not like deck building
- If you do not like RNG (I love it, for those who don't it really isn't that bad, I will explain.)
- If you do not care for studying game theory, all the guides, and spending hours at a time planning
This might not be the game for you. But I still say give it a chance. (note that you don't have to actually study, but this game will reward people who are meticulous and understand risk/reward decision making.)

This game will offer you:
- A well paced and translated story, with just right cheese/serious ratio that keeps you engaged 
- A simple, evolving into a complex deck building tactics AND strategy game

If you like to take your time and are not afraid of failure, this game will reward you with all those endorphins you crave. It has such a simple yet elegant game play loop that I did not once fault the game for any RNG stuff. 

Each fight is basically hand crafted for you in a way that each new fight will be challenging but still within your reach. Though for the first 20 hours of the game, all I needed to do was get cards with the highest chance of winning a clash. Progressing also slowly integrating new mini mechanics into the game, so you get used to knowing what the next reception will bring. By the time you reach the gimmick bosses, you might get your heart served to you, but you can overcome it. This game eases you in, but once you get to the town that should not be mentioned... It don't stop.

This game rewards people with cool heads and perseverance. My only complaints right now are about how the music it scripted. It is a good soundtrack, but the way music plays is either repetitive or just jarring. Though it has been a very long time since a game made me just enjoy the ride.

Library of Ruina is what has me fully interested in ProjectMoon's future now that they've shown they can make an entertaining game and not just a masochist simulator like Lobotomy Corporation. 

+ A moderately deep mix of turn based combat and deck building where the game frequently throws new curveballs and challenges overtime through already established mechanics to keep the game fresh. 
+ Despite lacking deck building experience, the game is friendly enough at the start to give the player time to learn the systems and take advantage of the turn based system. A good deck can only get you so far as you're expected to adapt with the battle and it is very much possible to change the tide of battle to your favor even if the start of a fight goes sour.
+ The emotion system during combat is great in keeping the player aggressive during combat as increasing emotion level is reliant on earning emotion points which is given though clashing with enemy dice rolls (as either a win or loss gives you a respective point to your meter). Also a good lowkey risk/reward system as getting extra books from specific enemies/bosses to burn for new enemy pages/cards depend on how high their emotion system is (in other words, keep them on the field during fights for a bigger reward but at the cost of longer turns with them hanging around which is dangerous).
+ Unlike Lobotomy Corp's snail tier completion requirements, Ruina does a good job making the player feels like they've actually accomplished something after finishing a new story battle or abnormality fights. The motivation helps since the game is pretty long. Seriously, don't listen to people whinging about ""grind"". At worst, I had to repeat fights a couple times to make sure and get all possible page/card drops and it only serves as a good opportunity to test out new cards and/or optimize your build for a better result which only helps for future fights down the line. 
+ Story is mostly enjoyable with decent world building and using characters from Lobotomy Corp as a continuation point helps with this too. Roland and Angela's changing relationship during the story is certainly a high point that the game focuses on quite a bit (as after all, they are the protagonists). 
+ OST is god tier with dynamic combat music dependent on emotional levels and some really good vocal boss themes from Mili. 
+ The production value is great with plenty of nice looking art for cutscenes, Korean VAs, customizable character sprites, and battle backgrounds.
+ Can always appreciate a dev team going out of their way to make mod support for fans. 

Really, my only few issues with Ruina are:

- The pacing of how floors are handed to the player after the Lower Floors is poor and makes the whole floor management system superfluous at best. By the time you start getting Middle Floor abnormality fights to upgrade them, you likely already have [spoiler]E.G.O pages unlocked for the lower floors[/spoiler] And well, why the hell wouldn't I use [spoiler]lower floors which have E.G.O pages which changes how fights go significantly until I finish Middle Floor realizations I'm only unlocking now when I'm half way through Star of the City rank[/spoiler]? I simply wish the Middle Floors were handed to the player earlier or at least made more ideal to use instead of Lower Floors for most of the game (this isn't even mentioning Top Floors which are even worse in this regard for how late they feel crammed in). 
- The game lacks how Lobotomy Corp was able to integrate its story so well with the actual gameplay loop and structure. Frankly though, it's a sacrifice I'm fine with because Lobotomy's gameplay is utter trite and Ruina's gameplay is fun which shockingly, is an important thing to a ""video game"". 
- The one big story element I don't enjoy at all are[spoiler]The Blue Reverberation and his cronies. Take Organization XIII from Kingdom Hearts (already a bad sign) and filter them in the lens of Lobotomy Corp's world and all you get are a bunch of quirky edgelords. It's a real shame the game seems to be hyping them up so hard for the finale given I really doubt learning their true intentions before the end of the game is going to change my mind on any of this. Simply one of those cases where they're committing such abhorrent shit that it's hard to take any, ""The ends justify the means,"" excuse the game might try to pull seriously. This is especially bad when the game already has this as an overarching theme for the Library's existence to begin with.

Also now that I've beaten them, their fights are a complete endgame slog. I can respect PM for making so much content for a finale (even if they range from the spectrum of ""okay"" to ""fuck off"" tier overall) but the way it just drags on given how long it takes to get to them in the first place feels overkill. I dunno, maybe it's just burn out, but I just didn't enjoy the way it was structured.[/spoiler]

Even if you're not fully into card games, if you like turn based combat, there's likely something here to enjoy. If you played Lobotomy Corp (and somehow didn't already play this) this game serves as a good continuation in my opinion and once again, an optimistic outlook on ProjectMoon's future when it comes to actually making games.

So I had to go back *level up* this character to max and then when I thought I would be placed back to the part I finished off at from my last attempt nope the game sends me all the way back to the first boss.

Library of Ruina is a bookstore the size of a city block--you'll get lost in it for hours at a time, exploring a bottomless well of new and interesting stories to experience and share.
Review as follows:

I spent 160 hours with this game, but it's lived rent-free in my head for so much longer.  The world and story are evocative, unique, and at times disturbing.  But the gameplay is just as unique, you'd be surprised how much changes when you strip the ""roguelike"" from ""roguelike deckbuilder"".  There's depths to this game, and thanks to being singleplayer, it's an ocean of archetypes and strategies that don't centralize around a defined ""meta"" you might find in something like YuGiOh or Hearthstone.  It's all the joy of first discovering Magic the Gathering with friends, except in this case you don't even need friends!

The depth isn't just in the card pool, either.  It was about 100 hours in before I felt like I finally had a firm grasp on the nuances of a *single* mechanic.  But in the game's defense, I got along just fine for the first 100 hours understanding it largely as ""[thing] happens, and then when [thing] happens enough you get PRIZES!"" This forgiveness that lets you bumble through is true for most of the game, but your game knowledge is put to the test in the distorted mirror of the main game, Abnormality fights.

Abnormality fights are one of my favorite concepts in the game as a whole.  They're a series of challenge bosses you can encounter largely in parallel to the main story, and the rewards for beating them are more people (i.e. deck slots) to use at once in battle, and powerful effects that can change the course of a fight.  However, these bosses aren't just ""hit it until it dies"" HP sponges, they're thematic tests of game knowledge and strategy--a challenge issued directly at you, the player.  ""Do you have the finesse to beat this boss within inches of his life, but ultimately let this uncontrollable NPC finish him off?""  ""Can you take out this magical girl without winning so hard that she gets angry and turns into a murderous leviathan?""  ""Can you fight off a swarm of worker bees while a debuff builds up that punishes you for every attack you make?""  

These kind of fights will often seem like insurmountable roadblocks, but as long as you come in with a plan, victory is nigh-guaranteed.  Which is good, because later you'll have to do a megaman-style boss rush against handfuls of them in a row.  Have fun with that.  I did!  I enjoyed every second of planning, of tactics, of executing that grand strategy into a victory that was entirely my own.  Each deck had my spin on mechanics, my own expression of the kind of player I wanted to be.  

And the game expresses right back.  Especially as you get a grasp on the game and get to the later half of the story fights, the very mechanics resonate with the story itself to create beautiful and memorable encounters.   You'll fight biker gangs who get stronger by making themselves bleed, a cult leader that hides behind a haze of smoke, devout followers of inexplicable prophecies who get told to use a specific type of attack at random and are rewarded for it.

There are popup textboxes everywhere which give overly long sentences with vague explanations, such as ""This part of the screen shows the cards which you can play during combat"". No shit, Sherlock. Thanks for being useless.

The game bugs out when opened on a 21:9 screen (it stretches horizontally so parts of the screen are cut off). You can fix this but entering the settings menu and leaving it.

The visual novel parts of the game have corny dialogue and the text rendering engine hasn't really been throught through. The text gets rendered letter by letter, but each new letter re-triggers the line-break mechanism. So as your eyes follows the new letters coming out, long words will start appearing near the end of the line, and by the time they're half visible, the whole word will get transfered into a new line. Similarly, as more and more text comes out, in cases where it doesn't fit the contents of the text box (three lines), the letters will suddently start to get smaller, and each re-render will trigger the positioning algorithm, making the text jump around endlessly. You then have to wait for it complete its choreography so you can actually read the thing. For a story-reach game which focuses on telling the story using these text-boxes, you'd think they'd pay more attention and actually try reading them instead of following a tutorial on how to write text in whatever they're using.

The cutscenes are so random and out of place, I thought the game crashed twice in first 20 minutes. You're reading somehing and you keep clicking to go to the next part of the conversation, and suddenly you click and it's all black. No fade out, no transition, no sound, nothing. It's just -- bam! -- and you're looking at a different scene now.

The game says partial controller support, but it just doesn't recognize the controller nor do I see anything about controls in options.

It looks kinda nice, but that's about it. It's nothing out of the ordinary; it's the usual ""nice"" look of this type of games. 2D sprites with a bunch of particles floating around and several post-processing effects on the top. The art style of the visual novel, the menus and the battlefield with chibis is so ridiculously different that it looks like three people wanted three different game, and barely managed to find a single programer to stich it all together in a large mess.

I too can only recommend this game! From my point of view it does not only have Objets d’art, but it can consider itself as such. The story is deep and involving, allthough very dark and sad at many times. The artwork is otherworldy, yet beautiful, and the music is extremly good and atmospheric (including a few very nice sung pieces).
Also it is one of the few games these days which bother offering you an intro. An intro which was catchy enough so I just had to listen to it in full whenever I came back for a few more receptions.

Gameplaywise the game has both a fair amount of difficulty and complexity and it was a joy to figure out working decks while progressing.

I personaly would recommend playing Lobotomy Corporation first though, as it will give a lot of attachment to the characters involved and some understanding about the world it is set in. Yes, you CAN skip playing LC ... but I daresay the story of LC would be a lot less impactful if you play LoR first and then check out LC afterwards. And I personaly consider LC a recommendation and work of art aswell, allthough it is probably less enjoyable for some.
( It uses some effects like screen filters, which might annoy some people and also has roguelike-content, so you will have to start it over from scratch a few times before finishing it.

Comparing it to Slay the Spire, StS is like playing a calculated, slow, challenging game of chess against a worthy opponent while classical music plays in the background.
Library of Ruina is like playing ten simultaneous games of chess, while the world around is on fire, the rules on every board are different, your opponents want to kill you and flay your skin, and there's the band from Titanic playing the coolest banger music ever.
You can also put your friends in this game and use them as pawns in your battles, which is a feature transient (is that the right word?) from Lobotomy Corporation.
The story and setting are dark, and has really unsettling and disturbing tones and themes, also deals with heavy emotional baggage and ponders on a lot of really philosophical questions.

I know not where to begin explaining my infatuation with a product I would be willing to play 4x the amount of time I've already poured into it. Even placing it down in the category of card-based feels like simplifying an experience that is simply so much more than that.

While countless other reviews should have alerted you to the difficult yet always rewarding receptions, the unique builds you're able to employ over the course of the game and the magnificent art the people over at Project Moon just continue to improve on with no end in sight. I, personally, struggle to enjoy experiences that give me no written substance to latch onto.

No expansive world, no solid characters, no message. It is then, a relief, that Library of Ruina is strong enough in this department to radiantly glow atop its narrative pillar. The City, clearly a labor of love from Project Moon oozing with creative spins on the tried and tested 'Cyberpunk' citadels and yet with so much still left unsaid to spark my imagination alight. Fixers, Workshops, Associations, Syndicates, Wings, Every little piece of new information has my brain swim with possibilities-- Or original ideas for me to drown in during my free time as I develop my own.

And then the characters. If you take a glance at this community you'd be able to look up any single one of these characters and no doubt find at least one individual who sheds blood in their adoration of them. The main cast, their story. The strong feeling of progress as I saw this individual that's always been so beloved to me slowly climb out of the calamitous situation they've sunk themselves into. The relief Ruina can give me even after showing me the darkest, most disgusting recesses of that hellscape city. 

Library of Ruina is an entertaining game. Library of Ruina is a game that deserves a level of attention hundredfold what it has now. Library of Ruina is a beautiful game. But to me, Library of Ruina above all is an inspiring game. I love LoR, I believe that if you give it a chance, you will too.",1635171385,1635171385,True,4,0,0.495999991893768311,0,True,False,False

Game has developed a lot and in it's current state (even though we are waiting on the last final improvements and content) it is outright worth it now. If you were ever hesitant on buying the game because it was early access or heard about bugs/issues, trust me. The game is in a good state and getting close to being finished, Project Moon did good.[/h1]


Everything from this point under is the original review, I felt like I had to include a new note as the game has changed to enough of a degree with some core mechanics that it felt wrong to not add at least something, though I won't edit the review below. For extra context, I originally stated I had 23 hours of game time, I have almost 200 hours now, let that speak for itself.

[b]Edited 18th August 2020. If you want to know if the game is worth the money at the moment, the answer is Yes. While I previously said it was not worth the money, the game has improved upon all of it's issues and after coming back to the game after 3 months, I can say the 6 hours straight I sunk into getting back to the new content was worth it.[/b]

[b]The review below was my initial review, anything that has changed will be formatted using the strike though formatting alongside an italic formatting to show my changes. Aka [strike]this[/strike] [i]and this[/i]. This is to show my initial thoughts alongside my views now to show how my opinion has changed over the 3 months as I believe since I originally stated that the game was not worth the money, I believe it might benefit you to see more of how my opinion changed first-hand.[/b]



Library of Ruina is a Project Moon game, keep that in mind before you think about anything.
[strike]That aside, as of the current version of this review, the game stops at Chapter 3, the devs are going to implement more in the future but with all the bugs popping up it might take a bit of time as those need to get fixed, so have patience.[/strike] [i]As of the new review date, the game has added more content, while I have only managed to scrape the beginning of Chapter 4 thanks to the difficulty tweak, I am already enjoying myself again since I have had no bugs occur.[/i]

So, since this is a Project Moon game I am going to draw some obvious comparisons first:
As of my current playtime (4 hours as of the initial creation of the review, [strike]now on 16 hours[/strike] [i]now on 23 hours[/i]) I have not experienced any unusual frame drops or memory leak issues.
The flow of the game is smooth and has an overall more consistent framerate.
There is a large information dump at the start of the game, but you will learn what to do quickly through trial and error.

Okay, now that those 3 points are out of the way (which if you have played Labotomy Corporation, you know why those 3 are important), let's get down to the main downside.

The game has (during it's current lifetime) a LOT of bugs. Though the devs have been very hard at work fixing all the bugs people have been sending to them and the game [strike]is slowly being more and more[/strike] [i]has become polished[/i] thanks to community involvement and developer dedication. 

So [strike]with all the current bugs[/strike] is the game worth it? Yes?
Look, now that all the Launch bugs are dealt with, the game itself is quite enjoyable. The music (despite looping) is very relaxing, the character customisation got an upgrade from the previous game, the turn based combat using cards gives more choice, the abnormaility system [strike]gives a lot of risk/reward for drawn-out combat[/strike] [i]gives a lot of choice that can alter your already RNG based choices[/i] and seeing all the characters from Lobotomy Corporation in a newer style is interesting.

If you are planning on getting Lobotomy Corporation, get that first, as this game spoils a lot of plot points from that and is a continuation of that game.

I'm an avid card gamer and an engineer, so I'm not completely dumb.  I'm 12 hours into the game and I still only understand about 70% of how the combat works.  The combat is very very complicated and the hero management is equally complicated, the first few hours will be pure frustration if you expect to have a full understanding of how it works.  

You can spend hours changing in/out decks and attributes on your multiple teams of heros per each fight.    I'm curren't 'just getting through the game' by using a deck or two on one of the hero sets that is well rounded and adjust it if I lose, because I win most fights anyway and it's not worth the hours you'll spend on deck building to get that perfect fight where you take almost no damage.  BTW you don't get punished much for losing a fight, so it's more efficient to just try it out.  If one of your three characters lives in the end its a win regardless.   I also had a build that I was working around, logged in the next day and one of my main cards were changed (due to an update) .

With all this overcomplication I still enjoy it because it's very unique, well polished and new (overcomplicated) combat mechanics and cards keep it interesting as you progress.   Huge tip, turn off speed combat at the top of the screen immediately in your first fight so you have a better chance of learning how the combat works.

FYI:  I normally finish games, however I stopped playing late game because the amount of micro management for every fight feels draining, I no longer enjoy playing.  I haven't timed it but it might be 15 minutes to prepare for a fight.",1630249820,1634524878,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Playing the game the first time; I was always excited to see which abnormality would show up. I enjoyed Roland communications with Angela. And it always warmed my heart to see how well each of the patron Librarians are taking their new [spoiler] third [/spoiler] lease on life since the events of the other great game: Lobotomy Corporation.

I wont tell you which game to play first; but Lob Corp is usually better to play first for building attachments to the abnormalities; and understanding the dread of when you have to face them again. [spoiler] Everyone always talks about the  doctor, but no one remembers the dreadful start of the show. [/spoiler]
Regardless even without the knowledge of the previous game; you can easily get by simply by attaching yourself to Roland's shoes in entirety.

So; how is the gameplay?
Getting new cards feels exhilarating at first, but turns into a constant grind pretty quickly.
The game planned to make all routes by going from the left most path to the right most; but I recommend going whichever direction you want. [Spoiler] For example, clearing love town is somehow easier than clearing 'Mister Emotional'. Burn is pain. It is always pain. No matter what part of the game your at. [/spoiler]
How's the RNG? Well this gets more chaotic than you think. Max and min rolls are both relatively frequent, but thanks to Project Moon keeping the emotional system gimmick. Losing clashes is often just as viable strategy as clearing them. Abnormality Page RNG however; that's surprisingly more unforgiving than the dice itself.

What's the best strat in the game? Easy! [strike] Exodia Patron Librarians. [/strike] Each floor specialises in their own unique way. Blue routes often lead to team-work and success as a group. Red pages often lead to [strike] Your entire team dying by your own choices. [/strike] Chaotic strategies that give a little extra spice without any [strike] fair [/strike] overwhelming issues. [spoiler] Except time. You could give every librarian +5-10 power and I will continue to never again pick that option PM. Time is painful when everyone has 5 speed die, and you need to stop 3 mass attacks a round. [/spoiler]

Art is unique and clearly something that PM put allot of effort into. If you think I'm being sarcastic about anything please believe this isn't it. Art, Music, Storyline and the hearts that went into this were all very impressively added to the best of their ability. Well; in my opinion anyways.

Speaking of music; I would have to argue the music made every realisation battle just that bit more epic. This will be a long running spoiler so you can skip to the end for recommendations. [spoiler]
Alright, you were warned. Angela's suppression theme for Malkuth, Yesod, Hod, and Netzach is fitting for the similarities to the original theme. We weren't really trying to help Angela; we were here to bring her down. It was a clash of our beliefs and emotions. This is the managers rebellion once more, and we will work with our Asyiah friends to show the slightly crazier than usual Angela who's the real boss. In between nodding your head to an epic violinist.
During it's final phase, phase 3, the final struggle. Weilding true loyalty at the envious Snow white, Throwing into a coffin Der-shwwits, Allowing all the painful expressions of a secretly happy Shy Look, and Smelling the faint aroma leaves this pleasing nightmare behind us while we enter the finale of the Asyiah battles.

Moving onto Briah floors, we are gifted with meeting the three terrifying patrons of family, Tipherepth, the child; Gebura, the problem solver, and the most attractive coffee man. I mean Chesed that isn't pronounced cheese-ed. Their battles against Roland from it's beginning to it's end... That felt like us trying to help save a lost citizen of the city. We were completing our goal from L corp. Making the world a better place, one person at a time as sorrow yet blood pumping music pulses in the background.
At least, until the third phase. The third phase was us, against his overwhelming despair. 
   In Tipherepth's fight, Roland has lost the ability to see the light or hear our voices. Not even Tiphereph herself can press into Roland. To our aid all of the magical abnormalities show their true colours once more. They are the hero's of hope, and just one more time, they will help save just one more person at the worlds end.
( [b] Extra note, In my personal battle with Roland; Tipherepth got the last hit in with King of greed close contact. In my head-cannon; Tipherepth ultimately beat Roland by a hug. [/b] )

   In Gebura's fight, we (attempt) to show Roland power isn't everything. Killing senselessly can only lead to despair. In the final phase we engage against the ultimate nightmare; and known Gebura killer even in Lob corp. Nothing there. By overcoming this final tragedy, we carve out Roland from his fury; and save the lives of innocent employees around them.

( [b] Extra note: During the personal fight against Roland, Ironically my team almost always died during the Mountain of corpses section.  Deciding on a hail mary, I used the page Mountain of Corpses to fight back, and managed to clear the rest of the reception with Gebura... However; Gebura failed to get the last blow. Instead; Roland ultimately ended himself. After learning about a certain city secret, Mountain of corpses looks pretty similar to a certain smoke opponent. This means in my fight, Gebura could not overcome Roland until she understood where he came from. And likewise, during the final combat, within a neck and neck battle; Roland won. His ultimate attack outmatched Gebura's and would slay her within a follow up attack. He embraced the power of the red mist and surpassed her, just as in Lob Corp. But bleed killed him first. In my own head cannon; I imagine it played out that Roland shattered Gebura's false sword, obtaining the power he desired for so long. Yet before Nothing There could deliver the final blow; Roland himself delivers the last attack... To nothing there. Smiling, the sword pierces his own body; the only thing that can truly end nothing there; itself. Roland collapses before Gebura; and Nothing there finally understands what humans want more than power.  Love. [/b] )

   In Chesed's fight... Well to be honest it wasn't really a fight. The entire reception/counselling was a bag of gimmicks. The ending included. All the members had their fun phase as a rather sad fight in which we had to engage against Roland who was trying to make us happy. It actually felt kind of wrong for the majority of the battle, at least until the absolute final phase. All in all, a fun little war in which neither side really wanted to fight.

Then of course game the battles of Atziluth, Hokma and Binah. Well; I have to leave some secrets for you to find out~
My only warning and hint: Prepare for a long haul. Recovery can help;  [b] But it's not enough. [/b] [/spoiler]

   Now for the last question. Would I recommend Library of Ruina? It depends.

Ruina Is a commitment. You can't beat the game in one day. You can pretend you can, but some fights you can spend hours on, and in one mistake you lose it all. If you don't have patience, this isn't for you.

This is a card game; luck will always be a part of what lets you win and lose. It's doubtful even if you played for 300 hours, and 10 different full playthroughs, that you can achieve a perfect run of Ruina. If you cannot accept the constant fear of failure, this game is not for you.

Lastly, if you have feelings; this ride will hurt. Story aspect is major to enjoying this game, not absolute however.

That all said; Yes in a heartbeat. Library of Ruina is worth it. It's a worthy successor to Lobotomy Corporation, and I look forward to when you find your desired book in this garden of knowledge.

Gameplay-wise, I am terrible at deck-building games, so I personally had some extra difficulty along the way, and luck does play a rather large part in the game overall, especially later on. However, outside of that, it's fairly easy to learn and understand if you take the time to read and digest what mechanics do what. With workshop support, you can make the game easier or harder if you prefer just a story playthrough or want to be bent over. You can also add in new customizations to make things more fun. Like using Arknights characters with appropriately made themed decks to pretend the operators are actually there. Watching W beat up street punks was particularly enjoyable.

Presentation: 10/10
Everything from the fantastic story artwork, the amazing art on the many cards, the little animations as the character models clash and fight, it's all great. The voice acting isn't in english, though, but I still like it. And of course, the music. The music is legendary.  

Story: 9/10
Library of Ruina tells so many little stories about a horrifying yet fascinating world, and there's so many that are great. It really helps makes the fights more memorable. It's really good. I can't give it a 10, though, because the ending really drags out quite a bit, and the story gets a lot more sparse at that point, only for it to end before really feeling like concludes much. I guess I just wanted it to feel like some of the characters we've gotten to know and like got a chance to say something at the end.  

Gameplay: 9/10. It's a deckbuilder, it's kind of niche, but it's good. The mechanics make sense (but the guides could be a little better...) and give you a clear vision on how risky certain actions are. The choices are intense and I often found myself engrossed. Do be warned, there is a lot of deckbuilding in this game. There's some intentional power creep, encouraging you to make new decks as you advance into new stages of the story. You're going to be building and rebuilding decks all the time.  

I don't feel like it's at a 10 because I ended up disliking one thing about the game, which is how valuable card draw and light restore (energy restore) are. Often half of my deck was devoted to these things, just so that my characters wouldn't suddenly run out of energy or cards and be left useless. There are plenty of options for both, but it's still quite limiting. The options that take care of both needs ended up being insanely useful and would be in almost every deck I made. It was noticeable, and I think a bit of a problem. 

Other thoughts...

The battles in this game can take a long time. Like, a really long time. There's a lot of creative battles that change how you need to think, and then often the game will have you fight 5-phase fights where each phase is very different and requires you to change your playstyle. While it keeps things fresh, it takes time, and if you fail you'll end up back at the start. This game took me 140 hours for a reason.  

I did run into one glitch while playing, an issue where an opponent's cards wouldn't display properly. Never figured it out, but won anyway.  

A lot of battles end up being quite gimmicky. Be prepared to read a lot of passives. As much as I liked having to figure out these puzzles, I can see people not being a fan.

I bought this game 44 days ago. Since then, I've played about 124 hours, so around three per day. As you might be able to tell, I'm a big fan of the game. I didn't play the prequel, Lobotomy Corp., as I didn't even know there was a prequel for a good while, so I'm almost certainly missing some emotional beats. Even missing as much as I currently am, it would be accurate to say that this is probably in my top five favourite games ever. Word of warning, there's a pretty ridiculous difficulty spike a few hours in, in that you'll spend the first nine or so battles absolutely cruising through every enemy, before getting to the actual meat of the game. It does get quite a bit harder.

The gameplay is a deck-builder, probably familiar to those who've played Slay the Spire or anything like that. It can be really difficult, but there's also a lot of potential for absolutely broken builds, for those who get a kick out of that kind of stuff. If you're just here for the story, it's probably simple enough to find a few such builds online, in order to blitz through the combat. Not that I'd recommend it, because the gameplay is fun, but if you're not drawn to that sort of thing the option is there.

I'm not going to discuss the story much. I'm very enamoured with the setting, and Roland has become one of my favourite dudes, ever. The nitty-gritty of the story is extremely compelling as well. The story structure is basically a bunch of small narratives woven together into a much larger plot, so at any given moment, there's a real plethora of things to be interested in. Whether that's the setting, the characters, the current 'episode' of the plot, or the overarching story, I'm sure you'll find something to hold your attention. The accompanying art and voice acting is also fantastic. The actors speak in Korean, but the emotion and character is masterfully conveyed, even though I don't speak a word. If you're worried about the translation, it's also fantastic, better than most native English games. The story is told in what is basically a visual novel, so if you don't speak Korean and are not a fan of reading, the story probably isn't for you. Word of warning: it's pretty dark. Keep you big-boy pants on for this one

Anyway, I love the story. It's the main reason why I kept playing through the difficulty spikes, and boss battles I was too stupid to complete easily. Don't be like me. Don't fight Star of City bosses with Urban Nightmare pages. That being said, I think the pacing has a really negative impact on the plot.

Essentially, because of how difficult some of the fights are, you might spend several hours or even days between story beats. It's quite discombobulating, and I think a lot of the emotional tension, especially in the finale of the game, was lost because it took me several tries to get through certain fights. It's like pausing a movie in its climax to spend several hours crunching numbers. Impact is lost. It's inevitable, I guess, but still somewhat disappointing. Again, if the story is what you're here for, there are broken builds. I only figured one out, but it was enough to make the final battles much, much easier.

Despite that, there are still really gripping moments where the gameplay and plot come together, usually accompanied by absolutely stellar musical performances by Mili. The non-vocal music is also great. There was actually a moment where I had to quit a session entirely because of how much shaken I was by the union between gameplay and plot. It really brings home, at least to me, how the medium can play to its strengths in order to enhance a good story.

So, yeah, I'm a fan. I really hope Lobotomy Corp cuts me a bit more slack, though, because this game kind of kicked my arse.",1632481820,1632481820,True,32,1,0.724945604801177979,0,True,False,False

While I don't feel qualified to comment on the playstyle of LoR or LC (which are both vastly different from one another), I can say with certainty that they both are lovingly made games that fit into a wonderfully crafted world full of so many questions you're going to be striving to answer.

It's extremely dense, both gameplay and story-wise; it asks a lot of you, and therefore I don't think it's going to be to everyone's tastes. But if you enjoy RPGs and you're into card games like Magic: the Gathering or Slay the Spire, LoR is absolutely worth a look. 
The setting expands heavily on the fragments of worldbuilding from ProjectMoon's first game, Lobotomy Corporation, and can only be described as ""anime-flavored nightmarish hypercapitalist dystopia."" The art design is extremely stylish and the music is one of the best soundtracks in any game I've ever played. (I will be listening to Library of Ruina's OST on loop for the rest of the year and then some, despite having spent hours and hours hearing it during the game.) The card-based battles are challenging and strategic. There is a lot of text to read (fitting, for a game about a library), but the dialogue is snappy and the characters are varied and delightful. The visual novel-style cutscenes are voice-acted in Korean; I don't speak a word of the language, but it sounded pretty high-quality and being able to attach voices to the characters helped bring them to life. Good use of sound effects further enhances the cutscenes and helps them feel full of ""action"" despite being still images.

I don't think the game has a lot of replay value, but it's long (my playthrough took about 150 hours), so if you ask me you are definitely getting your money's worth in terms of hours of entertainment per dollar.

Also, take note: LoR is a dark and violent game and includes a lot of body horror. You can find a full list of content warnings here on ProjectMoon's official Twitter. This technically describes their _next_ game under development, but covers LoR nicely as well: https://twitter.com/LiberareLimbus/status/1415964619743535105/photo/1

My main criticism with the game is that the tutorial is Not Good, and I'm not sure whether this is an artifact of the English translation or if the mechanics are just as opaque when explained in Korean (or any of the other languages the game offers). If you get confused, I strongly recommend consulting an external reference, such as the Library of Ruina wiki (although beware of spoilers). If you want to avoid risking that, turning off ""quick mode"" for a while so that you can see exactly how combat plays out step by step can also be very helpful for getting a feel for the flow of how actions are actually resolved. My suspicion is that there are _still_ some mechanics that escaped my understanding despite having finished the game, but that they're mostly edge cases. I didn't play the early-access versions of LoR, but my understanding is that the fully-released game has a much more forgiving difficulty curve and does a better job easing you into the gameplay. That said, if you want to be successful, be prepared to spend a good chunk of time strategizing, poring over card options and optimizing your builds to overcome specific challenges. This is not a game you can easily brute-force your way through. As someone who really enjoys the deckbuilding element of CCGs, once I understood what was going on with the rules, LoR delivered an experience that felt like it was designed to be exactly what I'd want from a game in this genre.

A few things about the mechanics I'm sure the game told me _somewhere_ but that I felt were weirdly unclear:

1) Each character draws one page (card) per turn.
2) Each character gains one Light per turn (energy/resource used to play cards).
3) When a character's ""Emotion Level"" rises, their maximum light increases and their Light is restored to this new maximum.

Keep these things in mind when building decks (i.e., be mindful of how you're going to avoid running out of resources) or you're going to have a Bad Time.

My second concern is that some elements of the plot of the game might be incomprehensible--or at least, a lot less meaningful--to anyone who hasn't played Lobotomy Corporation. LoR doesn't assume the player has played through LobCorp and should be enjoyable on its own merit, but I would encourage anyone who wants to get the most out of LoR to give LobCorp a spin first--with the caveat that LobCorp is an entirely different game genre and that its gameplay is, put simply, a bit rough. For anyone who isn't interested in management sims or games with crushing difficulty in general, I recommend the screenshot LP of LobCorp by TeeQueue of the SomethingAwful forums.

Lobotomy Corporation hinted at a bigger world and Library of Ruina, fittingly, expands it in a way that has me eagerly reading through the English versions of ProjectMoon's companion material. Seriously, I love this game, and if I sound like an overenthusiastic fan...well, it's because the game sucked me in and made me into an overenthusiastic fan.

This game is magical, this game is horrifying.

It truly is one of those unique games that has no other real comparable game.  At it's heart it's a deck builder, constructing multiple (1-5) mini-decks of nine cards each for your little librarians to use.  Its more in the thread of CCG games ala Hearthstone or Magic, where your main goal is to gather a huge binder of different cards to set up those decks.  Win a battle, get fancier cards to handle tougher battles to get even fancier cards and repeat.

The story is an interesting take on the dystopian, 1/4 hunger games, 1/4 cyberpunk, 1/4 cronenbergian horror 1/4 anime sci-fi crazy that somehow all works together.  The closest would probably be some of the better Dr. Who stories, except remove the omni-benevolent goofball with a magic miguffin to just make all the problems disappear.  The setting definitely is it's own and the topics they dive into are deep and their thoughts on the subjects are nuanced for good sci-fi.  

The story is very well written and outside of some stilted dialogue is very well translated (if it weren't for the voice acting I might not have known).  Voice acting seems good and lends emotional weight to the dialogue though with the noted issue of being completely in Korean.  Still welcome addition since there is A LOT of dialogue, though well paced.

Art is simple but well done, every character even the minor one scene players all feel interesting with a unique style.  The music is... wait stop reading and listen to the opening cutscene above I can wait... okay so it's like that but a whole CDs worth of Mili's music (usually at the important boss battles) each track is a treat.

Early game is confusing as you try and get to grips with how combat works.  You assign key cards to your librarians which give them initiative dice which you can then use combat cards on which themselves have up to four combat dice and I've gone cross-eyed.  For the most part you can match up stronger numbers against weaker numbers and build decks that focus on exploiting enemies weaknesses and be fine (one piece of advice is turn off quick mode in the upper left during combat, it'll slow down combat but you'll see the dice being rolled and give you a better idea how things interact).  Mid game you'll understand combat and will have a variety of teams specializing in different styles, the story will have multiple threads going so even getting stuck on one thread means you can go down others, get better cards and return which is nice.  Most battles* are fairly short, so even a loss isn't too bad and you'll usually end up with some new cards if you got a kill or two in.  The end game ratchets up the challenge, though by then you'll be able to create your own horribly broken decks to compensate.  It's a meaty system and leads to a lot of interesting decision both in and out of battle.

*Later in the game there will be Realization battles which are significantly longer battles typically having your party work through multiple different earlier fights without rest culminating in a final capstone fight.  For most, these are more test of endurance that are tense and fun and show how far your decks have come as you blast through some of the earlier fights.  Some of the later ones though can be just mean, either horribly gimmicky fights that are more chore or running into a capstone fight that your decks aren't at all suited for and welp there goes an hour.  

The final bits of criticism are the ever grown list of bonuses and the randomness.  Your characters will all have different preferences, some like to use slashing, some burning ect, some cards will have conditional effects like +1 damage against bleeding characters and the enemies will have their own conditional defenses all of which you will have to keep track of because the game will present the information but not tally things up for you.  Early on this isn't too bad but later there is a lot to keep track of, and some of the interactions between these effects isn't clear.  Attacks and defense will also have a range of how effective they are, normally these vary by +/- 1 which isn't bad and adds some tension to the fights, but there are a few that can vary wildly, from either being blockable by your weakest card in the deck or beating your strongest.  Good luck planning around that.

These are more annoyances than showstoppers though, can't be both a unique interesting game and fully polished and balanced and the trade off is MORE than worth it.  That said, if you have concerns about disturbing things like body horror, depictions of self harm, or things in that nature you should be warned.  This story can get dark, some of the scenarios stayed with me well after I turned the game off.  If you can handle that and are undaunted by a combat system that throws a bunch of numbers and mechanics at you then this is the game for you.",1632187544,1632187544,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love this game, and there are no words properly that can describe it better than it already is
I have always been a card game nerds, so the learning curve for me is easy (doesn't meant for others)

You, yes, the players, are the one creating the ""easy mode"" button yourself.

And what's make me even sadder are some of the old difficulty curves and elements got removed from the game (for the worst or for the best),

The next 5 hours felt like decently difficult matchups.
After that, it felt like the difficulty curve spiked and I was just theorycrafting and grinding and repeat.
Eventually I lost interest before fully completing the game, it takes away to much hours to progress now.
Its sad that the game makes you lose the flow of playing.

I like how this game have heavy story, gorgeous art, incredible music, and even full voice dubbed.

Gameplay is a turn-base card game which has quite unique mechanic.  You can adjust your deck & passive freely in anyway that suit you. Moreover, there are enemies that you can't fight in normal way, you have to use your brain to adjust you deck to win. And That's make the game more interesting.

If I have to point out some bad point, it's the story. Not that the story is bad, it's GREAT in my opinion, but it's rely on the prequel (Lobotomy Corporation) too much. Of cause, They explain what happen in the prequel, but that's not enough, we can just get a grip of it. The abnormality fight kind of doesn't make sense if you never play the prequel. So to enjoy the story to the fullest, I recommend you to play, or at least read the story of the first game first.

Overall it's enjoyable game, best sequel of all time, I love this game a lot. And I hope you would give Library of Ruina a chance to shine bright like a star.

Give it a shot, very simple game but also challenging and really tests how you learn and understand the mechanics. It gives you a manual as a little guide so no worries. Deck building may seem like a hassle sure, but its not that hard if you know what you're looking for. Grinding exists but in all honesty a lot of other games have worse grinds than this.

It's a fantastic game with cool mechanics, graphics, a nice soundtrack, a great plot, really cool and unique setting, awesome characters, and honestly a bunch of other neat stuff.

For anyone who's played Lobotomy Corporation, this game that takes place prior to this one, I would absolutely recommend it to them if they enjoyed the themes of the first game. Mechanics wise, it's a fairly different ballpark though, so if it doesn't seem like your cup of tea and aren't interested in the story and setting, you may want to breeze over this.

Despite that though, considering the game's esoteric themes, grim setting, and all around enjoyable cast of features and characters, I highly recommend this game for anyone.",1631570604,1631570604,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
1256670,99297305,76561197989100521,934,194,3810,0,1133,1663432534,"Library of Ruina is a very hard game to write about. I'm giving it a thumbs up - But you should be very wary of this and read this entire review to get an idea of what is right and wrong with the game.

First, the combat system and team assembly stuff is fun. It's a good system that has a light random dice roll system mixed with card deck building that leads to very interesting strategies. The encounters in this game are very difficult and require complex builds at times. It's also absurdly long, which is nice. Also, you don't need to play the first game, Lobotomy Corp to enjoy it.

The downside? The story. Now, at first, Library of Ruina and it's previous game Lobotomy Corporation have this terrible problem of having a very interesting idea, but poor execution. Get this, in the ANIME AWFUL CYBER-SEOUL ARMAGEDDON there is a rip off of SCP-Foundation that studies magical creatures and objects and also gets energy from them. Now, you may be like ""Wow! I love SCP writing and that is very cool!"" The problem is that Project Moon and this team of Korean Dev's were not fufilled with that premise alone and instead tried to add almost a DUNE level of world building and content that is not only confusing but absurdly tedious to read about.

In example, look at the guide sections here. There is like a 500 page guide just trying to clear up the story on this. And no, this isn't translation issues - Instead, it's an author biting off more then they could chew and trying to mix in side plots about robots wanting to become human, the human condition and decay, body horror, some mythical evil piano playing angels and demons, uh - And way too much garbage to list. Combine this with alien terms like ""Fingers"" ""Nests"" ""Wings"" ""Syndicates"" ""Heads"" ""Fixers'"" ""E.G.O"" and the list goes on and on to a point that it's a nightmare.

Good story telling doesn't require a glossary or additional documents to explain things. It's just overly complicated and awful. Due to the magical/Horror themes, there is absurdly large plot holes. Take for example a section in the game where W-Corp (Yet another thing that requires an essay to read about) has a magical bullet train that goes around the city that gets you to your stop in ten seconds or less. EXCEPT DUN DUN DUN - Actually, while in normal reality you get there in less than ten seconds, once you board the train you actually are put into a pocket dimension where you spend 1000 years in a light-stasis where you can move, sleep, whatever - But you don't require food, water and can't be killed. So, people go insane and once the ride ends, a magical team takes everyone on the train, uses magic to put them back to the point there were before they entered the train and memory wipes them. So, that alone makes no sense - BUT ON TOP OF THAT the reason this horrible eastern commuting system exists and is in use? ""Because, it gives power and energy to the the city!""

The hell? So apparently, this diabolic torture system is in place but they can't... I don't know, make a solar plant or instead use the horrible time dimension to actually make scientists work in large lab or mansion affected by this magic to solve all the worlds problems within ten seconds? This and other SCP knockoffs clash in a world that has no laws or any sense what so ever. It's almost comical how alien and odd the entire setting is considering this is a world where magical anime girls, time warping trains, proof of divinity by nonstop angels and demons running around, haunted bathtubs and space aliens exist yet humanity somehow has resorted to cannibalism and purge style law enforcement because figuring out the logistics for one city is just too much effort. 

And that's why Library of Ruina's story is terrible. It's awful. But, on the bright side, a ton of the SCP like objects and monsters are really interesting and cool ideas... But it's just too complex, too pretentious and worst of all trying to be far too epic for what it is.

So, in a nutshell, the game is good. It's unique. It plays well. It has some decent writing in parts, but overall is a nightmare of plot. I would say it's worth playing, but just don't try to get into the plot and background of the world, it's insanely dumb.",1631551427,1631551656,True,0,0,0.455869495868682861,2,True,False,False

Along with a phenomenal soundtrack, I can't recommend this game highly enough.

[b] Gameplay: [/b]

The core of the gameplay initially seems very similar to slay the spire, but there is much more to it than that. Having to manage the moves of up to 10 characters at once can get out of hand quickly if you aren't careful. But, the feeling of spending ages meticulously setting up a turn, double checking which attack goes where, and what special statues and effects you have to look for, and finally sending it through and having everything work out exactly how you set it up, is beyond satisfying. Granted, this doesn't happen a lot, usually you get a bad roll, or you forgot to account for something, and you get punished accordingly. But it's rarely large enough of a mistake that you can't recover from it. Ruina rewards being thoughtful and meticulous, and really understanding exactly what each action you take does.

Before you get to the actual gameplay though, you have to build your deck and arrange your passives. This is where much of Ruina's complexity lies. You aren't forced to learn how to build a perfect deck right from the start, but proper character and deck building is what really allows you to succeed. At first, it's not necessary, and you can roll through the game just slapping together your strongest cards. But, you'll eventually hit a roadblock where you feel like you can't progress. At this point you really have to understand how to put together a deck and properly play it. 

For me, the game went through a cycle. I would be strolling through, feeling like I finally understood everything, and like I was unstoppable, before I walk into a fight that demolishes me to the point that I don't even think it's possible to progress. At this point I had to explore all my options. I would try different fights to get better cards, and re-tool my builds and build up to the point where I could finally just barely beat the fight that I thought was impossible. And from that point on, the cycle repeated itself for most of the game. There are a few difficulty spikes that feel like running into a brick wall, but nothing so bad that you can't reasonably overcome it.

It's also very intriguing being able to see how the different characters and gameplay elements were translated into the new style. I loved being able to see mechanics from the previous game be re-imagined and made to fit into a completely different form of gameplay. 

[b] Story/World-Building: [/b]

I fell in love with this world during Lobotomy Corporation, and it has been greatly expanded upon in Ruina. Having a chance to really see and understand the city that was previously only mentioned, was a treat. The amount of effort put into fleshing out the city and its inhabitants is outstanding. With the amount of characters that are in this game, I would expect to see a lot of lackluster, forgettable characters. But almost every character you see feels authentic and real, even if you only see them very briefly.

The story is Ruina's greatest strength, I can't delve deeply into it without spoiling the game or its predecessor, but it's really something special. Especially if you've played Lobotomy Corporation. I'm sure it would still be enjoyable without playing the prior game, but I can't imagine it having the same impact. Being able to see returning characters get more fleshed out, and fully voice acted was very fulfilling.

[b] Music: [/b]

I'm not one to take notice of the music in a game very often, but there were a few tracks that really stuck out to me. All of the songs by Mili are phenomenal, Children of the City was the standout for me, but they were all top notch. The feeling of going into a boss battle that has been built up for such a long time, and having it be supported by such a fitting track was amazing. Much of my excitement going into a big fight was in anticipation of a Mili song accompanying it. Getting stomped into the ground by a tough fight isn't so bad when the music is this good.

[b] Conclusion: [/b]

This is the definition of a hidden gem. A game so good that you just want to tell everyone you know to drop what they are doing and go play this game. Without a doubt the highest quality indie game that I've ever played, and one of the best experiences that I've ever had. Over 100 hours of high quality content.

Now that I've finished the game. 
The game is nice, the characters are good, the story is fine. Some fights may get frustrating, and the difficulty of the fights varies extremely greatly (e.g. a certain ending series of fights vs  what follows immediately after) , but generally it just takes a bit of tinkering. Understanding the mechanics will also probably take a bit of time, but for this price tag, there's a wealth of content to play through. Just find your favourite Patron Librarian and use their floor for basically everything. life is good.

This game's combat system is quite a handful to tackle at the start (and some mechanics, like the fact you can change the clash target by clicking on an enemy dice, is not explained at the start.) but once you do, you'll realize the potential behind this game.
A good comparison for me is a cross between Slay the Spire and Into the Breach. You will spend a LOT of time planifying the perfect moves and clash with each of your team's dices. But then you'll press space and see it all unfold in the most satisfying fashion. The combat was also extremely tight,with a main story where you can just build a regular deck, and a series of side challenge with puzzle like bosses that might requires you to learn patterns or build a certain deck to tackle. In the last third especially I've had MANY extremely tight boss battle where I was one turn away from defeat. And those battles gave some of the most satisfying feelings ever.


PROS:
- The music is absolutely godlike, each levels having their own set of music that ramps up as the battle goes on. Several songs made by a japanese group including the intro also bring a lot of intensity in many boss fights.
- The story is also pretty decent, told in a really visual novelly way but spaced enough that it is not annoying. This game tells some pretty gorey and heartwrenching stories from different perspective in a way that is rather novel. While this game is a direct sequel to Lobotomy corp (who has a different and frankly far less appealing gameplay)  enough breadcrumbs are given to understand what happened throughout the previous game over the course of this one. You may want to watch story/video summaries of it if you want to get on the settings for this game fast though.
-This is combined with pretty good graphics as well.  The developpers clearly invested the money of their previous game well. Far from the cartoonish style of the original game, this game will show you great sceneries (especially the library itself) much more sleek and beautiful characters and character designs, and a certainly stylish look to the City (that pairs very well with the atmosphere and the music of the game.). At the same time this game feature very adult and violent moments that it wont spare you. While not Saw tier, you should avoid playing this if seeing blood makes you faint.
-The gameplay is EXTREMELY satisfying.  You will spend a lot of time enthralled in battles as you plan every single dice of your team to counter everything the enemy throws at you the best. By the end the screen will be fillew with arrows of every characters' action that you unleash by pressing the space bar. The gameplay is also very balanced around each tier. You will need to keep up in cards with what the opponent gives you, but, provided that you grab a few of the ""elite"" combat pages (that upgrade your character) you can keep up for most of the game without grinding. You WILL have a lot of very tight moment in the late game with tight battles that could go tits up on a single dice roll.

CONS:
Most of the cons of this game is about time management. 

-NO SAVE DURING COMBAT! While this makes the game ""fairer"", quite a few boss battle WILL last a LONG time. The most was up to [b]two hours[/b]. That you can't quit without a defeat. This game is not for small sessions, especially in the latter half with realizations (challenges). You will have to anticipate at least half an hour  for regular battles, and over an hour for realizations/late game bosses..
- The card equipment page is rather clunky and not the best. Swapping combat profiles and deck (which will you do a lot early on) is rather unintuitive. Eventually you'll make 5 top tier profile for your main team and swap those around to shorten the time.
-Grinding books can be annoying. A few combat pages (especially golden ones) can really change your power level, and getting them with the first fight is luck based. While I managed without grinding much (which gave me a rather balanced difficulty) you want have to do some boss fight twice or more  to get them, which depending on the complexity/time can be seen as tedious. 
-While grinding is not needed early on (I managed without) at a certain point of no return in the late game where the game will warn you, it is [i]necessary[/i] that you prepare. The game's final hurdle is notoriously long. 15+ hours long, with many checkpoints, without the possibility of getting new cards. Going back to get more resets the process, which can and will pîss off unprepared players (like another review below) so get the best cards (and finish the ""challenges"") you can before that point

In short, [i]if you have the time to play it[/i], this is definitively one of the best combat card game around.",1631132373,1631133422,True,1,0,0.501450300216674805,0,True,False,False

I'm not being hyperbolic, I'm not lying in this slightest. 
This is the strongest plot I've ever seen. The only unfortunate thing about it, is that it requires you to have attained the true ending of 'Lobotomy Corporation'. 

I'll say it again, this is the *BEST* videogame story I've ever witnessed. The gameplay is extremely fun, though in my honest opinion, it enters a level of difficulty that's just obnoxious in the endgame. However, it's very much possible, and should just be taken as a challenge to improve. 

Buy this videogame, and play it. If you dislike Card Games, or you find this game too difficult, download the 'Console Mod' and its dependency from NexusMods. Made sure you set the game on its 'beta' version, which brings it back to a version where the mod is compatible. 

Play this videogame, experience its story. You will laugh, you will cry. Combat in this game is amazing, and if you get to a point where you stop enjoying it, just download the damn ConsoleMod to finish the story.

But this game deserves so much more than that, so just excuse me if this review sucks. 
I'm just delighted by how good this game is, it has been a while since I last felt this about a turn based RPG. And honestly? It doesn't end there. The music, the story (even more if you played Lobotomy Corporation, or at least watched the story, like I did), the world building, it's just insane. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

Starting by the gameplay itself, it's a turn based RPG with deck building, as many others. But I think the difference in this one, is that the force to be reckoned with is not exactly the cards, or the builds, while they are certainly necessary and can be devastating, if you build them correctly, the player is the main force here. Every move your opponent is going to make, it's shown to you, no need to ""read"" an AI, it's all about how YOU take that information and adapt to it during the battles, and even before them while choosing which team to use. There's much more to it than just that, but it would take a whole steam guide to talk about it all, and said guide already exists, so go look for it if you're interested.

[h1]Music[/h1]

Can't say much about it, other than that from the ""anime opening"" it has, to the sad moments music, they're all just spot on.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Not gonna say much as well because it's probably one of the biggest charms of this game. But I can tell it's told as a visual novel of sorts, and has a lot of lore written in ""books"". Also, if you start the game and feel like you're liking the story, please at least watch the story from Lobotomy Corporation, it makes the story even better.

[h1]Graphics?[/h1]

[strike]I mean, they're basically pngs.[/strike] The art is incredible, I like it a lot, but I always though it's all about taste, and you can find a ton of images and videos in the internet, so just see for yourself.

All i can say is, This game alone i have played alot, and im glad to keep playing over and over with it. Especially with the community being so wonderful and hilarious with memes about  the game along the way, while i was streaming this game. The card system is the one of the unique key features in Library and got me hooked on how to approach each fight and calculate in your own way, with luck on side. It makes the victory so much sweeter. The story of Library also, one of the best ive seen so far, that captivates the lore, truly and deeply how each character interacts and feel they are apart of the story. All of them remembered.

If you like CCG deckbuilders and have a lot of time on your hands (I completed the game decently quickly and it still took 120 hours) I would definitely recommend this. I love the story, I love the gameplay, the music is phenomenal, and so is the art. 

So how does the game work?

Each turn, you can play one card using your light (basically mana). Cards will have 3 types of dice on them: attack, defend, and evade die. When your card meets your opponent's, you'll have a clash, where the person with the higher dice roll wins. Attack die deal damage, defense die reduce damage, and evade die will recycle on wins and restore stagger.

You have 2 health bars, an hp bar and a stagger bar. Obviously, when you run out of hp, you die. When your stagger is depleted, you become incapacitated and take extra damage. You win battles by reducing enemy hp to zero.

At the end of each battle, your opponents will get turned into books (hence the name). You can do two things with these books: Burn them and add their passives and moves into your collection, or use them to lure higher ranking groups in.

This is how you progress through the game, burning books to make your characters stronger and using books to lure better enemies in. You'll start by killing nobodies and move up until the higher ups start taking notice of you.

As you progress through the game, you'll unlock more and more mechanics that make the game increasingly complex. For example, you'll eventually unlock the ability to play two cards per turn. However, You're still only gaining one mana and one card per turn, so you're going to have to find ways to make use of the extra die. There are a number of things that just blew me away. A few things you can earn are just so cool to use once you have them.

I loved the story. I'm a sucker for good worldbuilding, and this game has it in spades. Sometimes characters will mention certain people, and then later on in the story those people will turn up. Everything mentioned within the game feels like its there for a reason. In terms of a narrative the game focuses mainly on interactions between the main characters and their fellow librarians. If you're willing to sit and read a bit, I think the story is generally pretty enjoyable.

Again. Library of Ruina might be my favorite game of all time. If this review sounded interesting, I'd recommend giving it a try. This game is a steal for $30.",1630752527,1630752527,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Suggestion to the developer: 
The guidance of this game is over-complicated (a piece of shit). And if it is not improved then trust me, many gamers will request refund before starting to enjoy this game.

On top of rich worlbuilding that always remains interesting, this game boasts some phenomenal character writing, especially for its protagonists. It also features a multitude of one-off  antagonists who range from despicable to instantly lovable, but are all memorable in their own way. This writing quality is further aided by fantastic character design and artwork.

Despite its status as a sequel, I was perfectly fine playing this without having finished Lobotomy Corporation. The protagonist will be just as clueless about past events as you, and you will progressively learn everything that really matters alongside him.

The gameplay starts off very gentle, but before long throws some real challenges at you. If you're as inexperienced with card games as me, you may need to look online for help with building decks. Despite that, I found it to be a very fun combat system, and my only complaint is that the battles at the tail end interrupt the pace of the story a bit too much for my liking.

Soundtrack is great and tailor made for each battle and scene, with some genuinely emotional vocal songs by Mili. UI design is pleasant and functional, and the sprites in combat (though I'm not generally a fan of chibis) clearly had a lot of love put into them.

This game has phenomenal storytelling, worldbuilding, characters, music, art and gameplay. The story in particular is what pushed this game to 10/10 category for me. It’s not merely “good” like many other story rich games in that it doesn’t shove a bunch of incomprehensible lore and timelines in your face and call that a good story. There’s plenty of lore to be sure, but it all relates to the world in a believable way. You very much buy that this world could be inhabited by real humans if the technology existed. This game story goes to places I thought games don’t go to anymore. Real and mature topics that are grappled with, not merely mentioned for deep points. Various philosophies are followed their logical end point and it’s a treat to witness. All glowing praise so far, so what’s the caveat?


If there’s one pothing I cannot stand in games, its grinding or mechanics that otherwise waste your time. And boy, this game loves to do just that. The two biggest offenders are having to play the same battles over and over again to farm books, and the boss rushes where one death sends you back to the start. Many other reviews have mentioned these issues, but thankfully this game is on PC and we have cheats. So, I would recommend downloading a trainer and skipping the grind. That doesn’t mean the gameplay is bad and that you just skip that too, far from it, but grinding can wear down the best combat systems. I say just skip the grind with a trainer unless you REALLY enjoy it. It does offer a lot of grinding “content” if you’re into that.  

The grinding issue aside, the game is excellent and I am thankful I was able to experience it. Well worth the price of admission.",1630152694,1630153266,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

I primarily got into it because I was interested in the story, after having dived into the story of Lobotomy Corporation, but Library of Ruina is a phenomenal experience all on its own.

The gameplay is much more fun and involved than it looks, due to the numbers-based nature of the card battling. What looks like simple point-and-click gameplay is a much more engaging thought process of weighing speed priorities, roll probabilities, special effects, buffs, debuffs, and more. And that's just the combat. The deck- and character/page-building is just as important, and just as interesting.

The story is the reason I got this game, and the combined lore of this game and Lobotomy Corporation (its predecessor) are some of my favorite video game stories of all time. The librarians are great, and despite their flaws, are all lovable. The guests all have their own stories going on, and while life in the City gets absolutely horrific sometimes (we don't talk about Love Town), seeing all these stories and how they intertwine with each other and those of the main characters kept me interested all the way to the very end.

And, not content with making a game that's fun and a great read, Project Moon graced us with one of the best fucking soundtracks ever. At one point, I literally alt-tabbed out of the game in the middle of combat to spend twenty dollars on the soundtrack. It's that good. I'm not a music aficionado, so I don't really have words to describe it, but this is one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard.

I'd say that previous background knowledge in Lobotomy Corp is beneficial but not required at all to play this game.

Speaking of the game itself, it's an incredibly detailed deck builder with lots of elements (different character pages which give various stats & perks, combat cards to use during battle, equipment to use which gives stats). The game really goes in-depth offering a lot of ways for the player to utilize various combos and synergies.

With that being said, this game is extremely difficult. I'm currently about 1/10th of the way through the game and I've already hit a progression wall multiple times. On top of the game play, the story, artwork, and soundtrack are all also extremely well done and detailed.

Gameplay wise, while unforgiving (not as much as Lobotomy Corp, that for sure) it feels rewarding to finally defeat a tough opponent, the deck building is really well made and I would say balanced in general, however a well versed strategy and deck building person will surely exploit certain cards with abilities which make it even more rewarding to play with deck customization.

The game is hindered through its story. Its story is great , you just need to sit through the previous game Lobotomy Corporations long and hard management gameplay. (My friends like it , I cant stand management games) It would have been nice for some recap material or for some disconnect from the previous story.if you like that kinda thing , Check out Lobotomy Corporation before playing this game.

This game is nothing short of legendary and I would highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in turn based combat or deckbuilders. The gameplay is simple enough for new players to get into yet complicated enough to provide hundreds of hours of content. I'm a big fan of the artwork, the character design is awesome, Studio EIM and Mili did an amazing job with the soundtrack, a lot of very interesting bosses, and the list goes on. As for the story, I had very high expectations after Lobotomy Corp, yet they still managed to blow me away; The first half of the game is very engaging and interesting and the second half is one consistent YOOOOOO. The whole story I'd say is about 100-200 hours of content, with hundreds more in replayability and silly builds (hehe lone fixer). If you're a fan of Lobotomy Corp, this is a must play; the gameplay is very different but as someone who doesn't really play deckbuilders, I still put 700+ hours in it.

This is one of the better deck-builder games I've seen, and is clearly a labor of love from the developers. I went into this game off a blind recommendation from one person, knowing nothing about Lobotomy Corporation, Library of Ruina, the developer or anything else. I've been absolutely blown away with the quality of this game.

If you're a fan of deck-builders, dice-based, semi turn-based games mixed with post-apocalyptic gory bizzaro narratives and a stiff challenge,  I could not recommend this game any more highly. For the price especially.

Biggest Pro's;
+Varied and meaningfully different cards/decks
+Lots of fights, content and different takes on the gimmicks the deckbuilding offers.
+Consistent and unique art style, storytelling and game designs
+Very well balanced combat; it can be very punishing, but is also very rewarding if you're clever about it
+Unique setting; takes place in the world of Lobotomy Corporation (its' prequel). 
+Pretty in-depth story if you bother to figure it out, or at least decipher some of what's going on.
+Absolutely stellar OST

Neutral/Bad(?) Things
~Difficult. This game is not easy by any stretch; I tend to be very good at games, and this one has given me some pause at times. This game is not afraid to stomp on you. It will do so routinely. This is a huge ""Pro"" in my view, but others may not like it.
~Grindy. This game can be quite the grind in terms of refighting the same fights due to the system used to open new fights/levels. There is substantial time investment and grind in getting everything unlocked and building new decks/perfecting them. 
~Narrative.  The game's storytelling, setting and presentation are definitively unique and interesting (to me), but they're presented in a somewhat obtuse way akin to a korean anime or something like that. It's a bit stilted and involves a lot of logic-defying timeskips and other such nonsense. It does make sense but will take significant consideration and paying attention to understand. This could turn some folks off.
~Gore.  The game's story, art, setting, etc is very dystopian and at times outright insanely disgusting (Looking at you, Lovetown). This could be a turn off for some folks.",1629647010,1629647010,True,7,0,0.551966309547424316,0,True,False,False

Masterpiece of a game. I never played LC so I went in blind. The game tells lore through character's personal stories and conversations. Nothing is really laid out in front of you for you to read to understand the LoR world. Once you get the details things just start falling in place building up as you go. Got me searching up LC lore to learn more and even got me reading ""Distortion Detective""

""10/10""

 Gameplay: 

Intricate combat system may deter people from playing. Definitely requires more brain power the deeper you get in the game. Some people quit because it's too hard (Surveyed some LoR players). Having a person explain the combat is easier than understanding through tutorial. You will probably be sitting in your seat wondering how you lost after a 40 minute battle until you know how to build decks and apply attributes. Once you do get the hang of things, combat will feel pretty amazing as you redirect attacks and do some fancy shmancy anime comeback.

Then I banged my head against a wall and felt like crap for 2 whole weeks.

It's a bit like that with Library Of Ruina, and I still haven't finished it yet.

I would say the game doesn't do a good job explaining everything correctly but the combat system is so complex.

The presentation is extraordinarily slick, smooth and confident, from art direction to music to sound work. Everything comes together and manifests beautifully; there is never a moment where the game loses the aesthetic sheen its created for itself. This pretty mantle is worn over an incredibly brutal game.
Ruina has a gentle learning curve, but gets extremely difficult towards the summit. In addition to that, the game is oppressively dark and bleak, and lasts for over a hundred hours. Many will be filtered by these qualities in a game they might otherwise find attractive, but the hard edge only adds to the aforementioned confidence which oozes from Ruina. It never compromises its central identity.
The gameplay itself is on the thoughtful side, being a turn-based game. Bosses near the end will have paragraphs of text explaining their abilities and how they break the game. The central gameplay is centered around building decks of cards, customizing equipment and engaging in a race to out-cheese everything you come across. The very smooth learning curve aids you in this process, helping you to become an expert at the game by the end. But even when you're breaking the game over your knee and doing stupid shit that should never work, the game will still punish you. It's not quite as hard as its predecessor Lobotomy Corp (until the last 20 hours), but Ruina is in general a challenging game for most of its runtime. I wouldn't describe it as a casual experience despite being at its core a story-heavy, aesthetic-heavy deckbuilding RPG, so beware what you're getting into. 
Regardless, the game is fantastic and you'll be rewarded for the effort you put in. I'd go so far as to say Ruina is easily one of the greatest RPGs of all time. It's been released in an era of RPG decline where many games have lost their identity, and stands apart because it has a unique perspective to show the world.

That said, I'd like to start by prefacing that while I've never played the prequel title, Lobotomy Corp., I did watch the cut-scenes from that game and read up a bit of in-game lore on Youtube and on the wiki respectively. So, I did have some background knowledge when heading into my first play-through of the game. And with that, let's get to it.

First off, Library of Ruina is pretty deceptive in its outward packaging. It may seem like a deck builder like Slay the Spire, but it has more similarities to a turn-based JRPG. In fights, your turns consist of assigning actions (read: your cards) to each of your character's action slots. Outside of fights, you'll be tool boxing your team(s) equipment in the form of their decks and passive abilities (once you reach the stage of the game that allows it).

The reason why I say the game has more commonalities with a JRPG over a deck builder is that your ""decks"" will only ever consist of 9 cards. So, you won't be making any of those efficient engines you may be used to like in other card games like Magic the Gathering or the like. 

Fights are team based and you'll be figuring out how and when to use each of the cards you've equipped to your character. That said, the cards themselves have a variety of dice on them that'll be compared to your enemy's own set. If your dice roll higher, you win the comparison and the appropriate consequences will apply.

If you boil it down to its most basic elements, the game has a lot randomness in it. This randomness, alongside the different mechanics some of the fights will throw at you may seem downright unfair. It doesn't help that the game’s loot drop system forces you to repeat fights until you are satisfied with the amount you want. Even worse, some of the same loot you’ll be grinding for is used to progress the story. 

And with an ante system in place, losing a fight means losing the loot you worked hard for previously. I wouldn't be surprised if this will turn away a lot of potential players, provided they don’t get turned around by the tutorial (which is leagues better than how it was initially) can be a considered an information dump.

The game does give you the tools to tilt the odds in your favor though. But it'll be up to the player to mix and match what you have for the best possible outcome. The game’s repetitive nature is not for everyone, but if you’re willing to get down and dirty with the repeats and eventually triumphing over the ordeals, then it’s something that won’t get to you.

Moving on, the art style is distinctly unique. For those who like the Japanese style of animation art style, this may strike a chord with you. Unfortunately, I'm not artistically deep person, so I can only say with honesty that it pleases my personal taste of aesthetics.

Next, is the music. Again, I can't say more than the music is an enjoyable experience. But special mention has to be given to the musical group, Mili. They lend their talent for the opening song as well for special boss themes. Even after I’ve shut down the game, I find myself listening to their songs on Youtube. If anything, they’re all very memorable.

Lastly, the story. The story follows the main characters of Roland and Angela alongside a plethora of other characters that make up the cast. You won’t ever leave the location of the game’s namesake, so all the story that develops is character driven. Though you are given glimpses of a wider world through short vignettes of the people of you’ll be battling. This is mostly told through a visual novel format, so if that’s the type of game that may not interest you then you may need to brace yourself if you plan to give this game a shot.

The game gives a lot of tidbits of lore. It’s never enough to give a full picture but there’s enough for your own mind to fill in the gaps. This is more so if you take the time to read the Credenza section where you can read more in-game lore.

This game has been an enjoyable experience to me and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested enough to give it a chance. However, this game is very niche. And I must caution any newcomers to properly manage their expectations.

If you’re still on the fence, I recommend looking into streamers or YouTube videos on the gameplay and see if it’s interesting enough to try it for yourself. But with these last words, I’d like urge you to give this game a chance. You may or may not like it, but this game does have an interesting tale to tell.

And with that, I hope that you may find your book in this place.",1629175419,1629175528,True,34,0,0.765029191970825195,0,True,False,False

From the Worldbuilding, the Characters, the Design, its all amazingly put together. I could indulge myself learning about it all day.
For an Early Access game, Project Moon really outdid themselves from the days of Lobotomy Corporation. With constant weekly updates jammed with high-quality content as well as attentively listening to community feedback.

But now onto the gameplay.
To be honest, I thought I wasn't really a fan of turn-based strategy combat like this. I prefered direct combat like RPGs and FPSs, yet here I am with over 400 hours on this game. In short, the gameplay is really good, though can be very confusing for a new player. The tutorial doesn't exactly help as much either (but does give some understanding, so you should still read it.) However, once you've settled in, your sure to create your own optimized and unique builds for your nuggets.

The combat is RNG-based in a sense, you have a set of cards (Combat Pages) that you and the enemy use. On those cards are a set number of Dice with a range of numbers. Example: 4-8, 5-10. The Dice will roll within that range, if you roll lower, you lose the clash, if higher, you win the clash. These Die can also have extra effects added onto them. Generally though, the RNG is pretty forgiving, losing a clash isn't really the end of the world, not to mention with beneficial effects like +1 Power or such will make it much easier.
If you played similar games like Slay the Spire, the mechanics will be much easier to get into.
There's also Speed Dice and Resistances, but those are a bit easier to understand than Combat Pages, so I'll leave it to you to learn.

I'm a really big fan of the visuals and sound effects. Nothing is more satisfying than hearing the ""snap"" as your nuggets duke it out on the field with powerful attacks, with some of the later stuff you get being pure eye candy.
Not to mention the music! With songs by Mili!! I could honestly ask for nothing more.

The story is really engaging, with the aspects I mentioned in the beginning making the experience even better. Just so you know though, Library of Ruina takes place after PM's previous game, Lobotomy Corporation. As such, there are several bits of info from the story of that game. You don't necessarily need to play Lob Corp to play Ruina, but you'll have a better understanding of the main cast if you do.
Also, the Story is one of the main components of the game, so if your not a fan of long dialogue, you can skip it. (But then your kinda missing the point of it.)

Like I've been saying, Library of Ruina is a great game, even though I am biased towards Project Moon. I do mean my complements sincerely. I'm very much eagerly looking forward to their next games, as well as learning about their world.

A card game where all the cards art and effects are minor variations of each other and have almost no diversity in flavor so I can't tell the difference between them by optics...  Incredibly dry, dull, and painfully written lore which distracts the mechanical understanding even further than it was already...

- progression fun and constantly new things
- near endless combinations possible i kind of key(deck-building) for one character
- what i especially like is: u got a group 1-5 and u build a keypage (deck) with unique combat cards, which means u got 1-5 decks which can be stat related combined with passives u got from keypages, its glorious fun <3, and you got 10 groups at all at end game, which means you got 50 characters with unique decks and passives

Yes, the gameplay loop is unlike anything I have ever played. At first it made no sense at all but after a while it starts to click and you start to see more and more complexity like those old JRPG games. 

The voiceover is really awesome and was what is lacking in lobotomy corp.

I would say this is a really weird and unusual gaming experience that is more closely related to a roguelite style of gameplay where you improve your characters and take on harder and harder challenges in a nutshell.

To aid in the development of the library, your job is [i]receive[/i] the guests after Angela greets them, as per normal city conduct. The combat is intricate and, despite chance extending to almost every aspect of the game, surprisingly consistent. While the early fights are near impossible to lose, the later fights take an intricate understanding of all of your tools to beat. It’s a long game, but there is legitimately that much content in there. All of this takes place in the city, by proxy of the library. Never leaving the library, your window to the world at large is through the varied individuals who walk through the library’s doors. All in all, it’s one of my favorite games with incredibly good gameplay and fantastic worldbuilding.

[b]Gameplay[/b]

With the tutorial spanning a similar amount of pages to a research paper while making good use of visuals, I can’t do the combat much justice in this tutorial. It’s very complex, and continually builds on its core mechanics all the way to the end. That said, hopefully I can convince you of its excellence.

In combat you control multiple librarians, each having a deck of nine cards you build prior to battle. In having multiple characters, each one can specialize in different aspects. Some characters may specialize in winning clashes, enduring long battles, applying status defects, staggering enemies, or simply going first. The game provides many avenues to winning battles 

Fighting in this game centers around characters clashing against one another with their cards. Typically, faster characters can dictate who’s clashing with who. Each card will have a number of dice which will then be played against the opponent’s card in the order listed. These dice can take the primary forms of attack and defense, further split into three damage types (cut, thrust, blunt) and block and evade. The rules of a clash are always the same regardless of the dice: the highest number wins (nothing on a tie). If an attack beats an attack, the higher value will blow through and hit at full force. Blocking naturally mitigates damage taken, and will help to stagger attackers when winning clashes. Lastly, evade can keep dodging attacks until it loses a roll, additionally restoring stagger resistance. Get rid of large evade dice by defending at them.

So I’ve mentioned staggering twice now without actually saying what it is. Each character has a health bar and a stagger resistance bar, with most attacks dishing out equal amounts of damage to both before resistances. Drain the health and you get a book. Drain the stagger bar and it’ll immediately interrupt their actions for the rest of the turn and the turn after. Further, staggered characters take double damage from all sources. What this means is that you have a chance to try and cover your own staggered characters while being able to single out enemies with proper coordination. Beyond that though, characters don’t die very quickly when they’re not staggered, and to this end, it’s hard to lose a battle all in one bad turn.

With all this in mind, you have an impressive amount of control over these fights. There are enough rolls for initiative that you have some control over who clashes with who, and can generally be able to give yourself some good options with the cards you put in your deck. For instance, it can sometimes help to have fewer, larger dice, or many smaller dice on your card. With that in mind, you can usually pick card matchups that can turn out favorably consistently, or otherwise mitigate damage. Since battles are not usually won and lost in the span of a single turn, lucky breaks and bad rolls will balance each other out. While you may be disadvantaged in fights in terms of raw numbers, whether you win is typically a result of your preparations and decision making. Sometimes it’s up to chance, but winning is always on you.

Adjacent to the combat is who exactly is doing the combat. Every floor of the library is staffed with a patron librarian from the main cast. The rest of the characters on the floor are made by you. Well, you’ve got a lot of control over what their head looks like. The body and weapon are associated with the character loadouts, you can set the appearance as you please. So you can control the appearance and name, which is great since the specialized loadouts that you create tend to build their own reputations. To add to this, you get to edit (or not) a few lines the characters will say during battle. It’s the best kind of character creation, as your characters are defined by their actions and tendencies, rather than being forced into the role the story dictates for them. With that in mind, this game gives you the tools to have your own side stories without compromising the plot.

No game is without its flaws. This game is long. Since fights aren’t won and lost in single turns, you need to be puzzling out many turns for each, and that takes time. Combat is consistent, and once you’ve solved the puzzle once, you just need to retrace your steps to do it again. So this leaves the question of why you would repeat fights. Enter book burning, or how you obtain cards and loadouts. Killing an enemy in the library will score a couple books, which will get you some randomized cards (in limited quantity) after the fight. Additionally, receptions require a couple of books to tempt the guests, who will walk out with your hard earned texts if they beat you. If that happens, you’ll need to snag some more books from previous fights, not to mention that you’ll need a few extra to get the resources you’ll need to triumph in these fights. This game is hard, and you’ll need every resource at your disposal to win, and a few extra chances to identify exactly how to win against new enemies. To get these chances and resources, you’ll need to challenge defeated enemies over and over until you eventually make it. While a good deal of fights don’t penalize the player for losing, those that do can slow the game down significantly without much payoff.

[b]Writing:[/b]

The story is a major focus, and is told in a visual novel format similar to the previous game. That said, the player is not an active participant in the story. Anyhow, the story follows Angela past the conclusion of Lobotomy Corporation, developing further on the city it was intended to change, eventually reaching the inevitable conclusion. This game, same as its predecessor, builds the systems in its world and follows how people would cope. It’s a place where idealism goes to die, for that is the way of the city. It’s a story showing people at their worst, with compromise or apology. To say the least, it had a very interesting take on human nature. Intention, morality, and justice are all quite complex after all.

On a side note, the player is not expected to have played Lobotomy Corporation, with all relevant points being described in great detail in Library of Ruina (perhaps excessively). That said, I believe the experience is much better having played Lobotomy Corporation, as being familiar with the existing lore sets your expectations appropriately. It’s that tangible sense of fear when you see the [spoiler]REDACTED[/spoiler] on the other side of the battlefield, and seeing that it’s just like what it was in L Corp. For this matter, it’s quite fun to see how many elements from L Corp were translated (with remarkable precision in my eyes) into the Library’s format.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]

The genius in this game is in its challenging, but fair combat, and how it constantly reinvents itself all the way up to the end of the game. Yes, it’s long, but there’s always something new at every step to keep you interested. The level of customization is probably among the best out there, and everything comes together to reinforce the narrative.

The soundtrack is amazing, reminds me of Persona and it's great!
The story is a lot of fun, I enjoy the gore that's not actually shown, I love the mystery surrounding the library and the depth of the lore!
The artwork is just woosh, I love the various styles used in the game, the arenas are interesting and the little characters are cool.
The gameplay is addictive, I usually don't enjoy luck base systems too much but it hasn't bothered me so far, it#s pretty exciting to success against impossible odds! So many cards and pages to use as well, you can create the exact archetype that you want (defender, attacker, buffer, etc).
The customisation is amazing, you can really tailor your characters to look the way you want them to it's so much fun! Titles, layered gear, appearance changes, text lines etc
Oh and the QoL is awesome. Everytime I'm thinking ""oh it's too bad, I really wish you could do X"" then I realise 2s later that they've actually already done it! Like for instance the fact that you can put gear on your character but actually hide the it so it doesn't cover your model.

Although a completely different type of gameplay(rather than management its more of a turn based fights with cards like slay the spire etc), it is still extremely fun. I find myself waking up and playing at least once a day simpley because of how much fun i'm having despite the game becoming a little easier after I finished the farming. 

The music in this game is simply top notch. It probably is one of the main reasons I play this game daily, the jazz, the piano, everything is just so chill and I find myself humming along sometimes as I bash some fixers with my nuggets.

If you're a fan of lob corp, buy. If you've never played lob corp, either go buy lob corp and try playing it like a real man or watch a youtube story video on it THEN buy this game anyways because its a really really fun game and not playing the prequel shouldn't stop you from buying it.

Also mili sings its OP, which makes it even better!

Edit: Obviously from my playtime, I think this game is pretty coo. It's been a long while since I've updated this review, but let me do so anyways. This game is still amazing. The gameplay has been elevated more than 10 fold from what it was before, giving a unique experience and joy of theorycrafting like never before. 

If you are thinking about whether it is worth to buy this game, I can wholeheartedly say YES. YES it is more than worth the price. 

In the future PM might increase the price again, so you might want to buy it sooner than later. Playing this game as it updates weekly is a unique experience, and I think that you all should experience it!


Additionally, the translation team has done an amazing job translating the language into english, with respect to the culture in place at korea.

Anyways let's be more serious for a moment. Library of Ruina is the 2nd game coming from the devs at Project Moon, and if you were a fan of them before you may be aware of the... troubled development of their first game Lobotomy Corporation. The early access of Library of Ruina also had some bumps on the road, however it managed to develop into something that I think is truly beautiful.

The gameplay is a top-notch deck-building strategy game where you heighten the emotions of both your own Librarians to take advantage of abnormality cards; (unique abilities available to each of the floors of your library)and your guests in order to acquire more books all in order to one day acquire the One True Book.

While I do truly enjoy the game part of Library of Ruina, where I think the game truly shines is in it's story and world building. The characters in the game give off a sort of... humanness to them in a way that I feel many games are unable to. Another highlight of the game would be the music, composed by Studio EIM, probably best-known for their work on the soundtrack of Maplestory.

Don't feel too bad about murdering the untold masses you will on your path to the One True Book by the way.

Library of Ruina is a story-rich deck building game that absolutely excels in presentation (art, music, world-building, etc.) The story covers a lot of deep and highly-relevant modern themes and gives respect to the multitude of arguments and thoughts surrounding them. While it does cover and elaborate on the main story beats of its predecessor, Lobotomy Corporation, there are certain emotional ties and points that may be missed if you haven't experienced that game to some degree, so I advise at least YTing it for a bit. 

In terms of the gameplay, the system is layered and complex, with many enemies using or breaking those rules, necessitating a lot of strategy changes depending on what you're facing. The game isn't a rogue-like, so every card can be treated like an equipment or skill that you just always have and finding new and interesting combinations with the every increasing number of cards and functions is really fun. Overall, I'd say that I never tired of the battles and the great visual novel sections that bookend each battle were an awesome incentive to keep playing. Two points that I wish could be addressed: 1) the tutorial does not do a great job of explaining how the finer points of the system work, so some individual research may be required and 2) the card acquiring system (basically packs earned from winning battle) appears to have been pulled wholesale from other card games where collecting and the joy of getting rare stuff is part of the experience. Given how this game works, where you basically need higher level cards to progress, it just adds a bit of a grind to an already very long game. They've addressed this in a recent patch, giving more packs and improving drop rates, but there are also mods out there that can remove this entirely if it gets to be too much. 

In summery, LoR is an amazing follow-up to LC and I applaud Project Moon for not only trying an entirely new genre, but also somehow sticking the landing with a polished and evocative experience.

If you're like me, and you enjoyed [i]some aspects[/i] of Lobotomy Corporation, but ultimately grew tired from the tedium of the player-spiting game design, you [b]won't[/b] find a more refined, player-friendly, or fun experience here. I can give the game's prequel a little slack for its jank, because it seemed intentional and thematic to the story it was telling, but Ruina manages to make me question if that narrative element was ever intentional to begin with. 

The game delivers mind-numbing game-play without any worthwhile narrative incentive to struggle through it all like the prequel had. Project Moon has taken the worst design elements from Lobotomy Corporation and re-worked them for no reason but to burden the player with challenges that, yet again, require extensive knowledge well ahead of time if you want to actually succeed in the battles. If any of that sounds fun to you, you will find something for you here, but I can't imagine anyone but an existing fan would have made it this far to begin with.

I picked the game up under the impression that it would be different, and I don't know why. I guess I felt like giving it one more shot, since I was already familiar with the first game. But, like it's predecessor, Ruina loves to waste the player's time. The game is filled with challenges that require some luck, some strategy, and an intricate understanding of the mechanics, yet fails to properly explain a lot of it in a digestible way. The methods of success (in the mid to late game) are extremely finicky and precise, and when the strategy not only needs to be understood in advance, but also relies on dice rolls to be able to be pulled off, you're constantly left in situations where even when you plan everything out and know exactly what you need to do, that victory is never guaranteed. You never have security that things will work out in your favor.

It could be any little thing. Maybe you don't draw the cards you need on that turn, or you lose clashes, and by proxy, Light, so you can't act and do exactly what the game asks of you among the many strategy-specific boss encounters. There are so many little ways the game has of leaving you in a position of little agency, and you are unable to do anything but try again if things don't go your way, so you can either continue to try smashing against that wall until you get the cards and rolls you need to win, or grind for equipment by redoing old content.

See, even when you do succeed, you aren't guaranteed ANY worthwhile reward-- instead, for whatever reason, PM has decided it would be a good idea to put loot box mechanics in their single player game, so if you win a 20 or 30 minute fight and don't get Key Pages or any of the worthwhile action pages, you have to do the entire thing all over again, only for the CHANCE to get it. 

Ruina blatantly pads out its run time and progression for no good reason and that's where the vast majority of your time in this game is going to go. This game's content could probably be experienced in under 40 hours if you didn't have to waste your time grinding to get what you need to progress. If the game would just unlock all of the pages upon winning the fight, give it no inventory limit, and guarantee the Key Pages, there would be no issue, but I'm pretty sure PM just hates their players.

So why play this or Lobotomy Corporation? I think it's an effort in futility-- just for the bragging rights. To see if you can withstand being broken by the games player-hating design. That angle was at least complimentary to the story in Lobotomy Corporation, but continuing that trend into it's sequel is just malicious and pointless. The way the story is told in Ruina really sucks too, and doesn't even have that narrative intrigue Lobotomy Corp. had-- that drive to see more just isn't there, and this is mostly because everything is so loosely tied together. There's nothing to intrigue you unless you enjoy watching random edgy OCs cutting people up and being gore-y for vapid ""lore"" reasons, and this is where PM really messed up.

The story told in Ruina isn't a story-- it's just exposition to create irrelevant lore for the sake of backhandedly ""explaining"" why all this gore-y stuff happens, and trying to justify why the characters are screwed up and do what they do and it's just stupid and convoluted and adds nothing of importance. No matter how hard it tries to convince me that the world operates with all these edge-lord factions, I'm just not convinced, and the more it tries with this silly notion, the more I tap out. The world was honestly more interesting in the prequel, when I knew less about it, because the more PM tries to explain, the stupider it gets, and it's gone well past my limit.

None of what the game chooses to develop with it's narrative matters, and the tedious combat  isn't worth slogging through for it. All you get rewarded with are vague snippets of ""world building"" told through poor stilted dialogue by characters doomed to be expository tools and then kick the bucket. The game tries to tie [i]some[/i] loose ends together near the end, and convince you that there was some progressing plot after all, but it falls flat because it fails to build up anything that matters. Ruina would rather attempt to write this grand dystopian, horror-esque world, with all these factions and ranks, and a million other pointless, made-up terms that just don't matter. It's just sitting through bad anime exposition, and that's probably a good 80% of the ""story"" in the game. It's a big ""tell, don't show"" fest, and it just never stops. 

I recognize the game is translated, and there are language differences, but even when characters try to come off as emotional, they're over here spouting out all these big robotic words about their feelings, and how [i]others[/i] may feel about [i]them[/i], and their place in the world, and blah blah blah blah blah instead of just expressing themselves like functioning people. No one in this game talks like anyone ever would. I don't think Koreans even ever say this kind of crap.

The tone is so oblivious as the game tries to create deep, yet vague and meaningless philosophical discussion among ClownKiller69XD and his gang of furries / mutants / flesh lumps over here. It's like a teenager trying to be deep and sound really really smart, while also making sure to be as vague as possible to cover his plot holes wrote this script. Like he came up with all these super cool edgy ideas and wanted to cram them into the same universe when not even the first idea was thought out to completion. Everything is just so stupid, yet it always takes itself so seriously. It's not jarring enough to be funny or ironic, and not smart enough to be deep or introspective. It's just mildly irritating and dull, and that's the worst kind of writing you can suffer through. 

That being said, story tastes are subjective, and as much as I hated it, somebody out there might like it, but even if there is something in this game one might find worth exploring, I cannot recommend anybody bother going through the tedious ordeals to experience it.

There are a hundred different ways to alleviate the issues in this game, and make this niche unconventional series enjoyable and less padded, but it's clear to me from this game that Project Moon designs their games this way intentionally. If you're already a fan of this... ""style,"" then you can take solace in the confirmation of this design choice, and likely expect more of it from the developer, but it definitely isn't up my alley, and most people are not going to enjoy many aspects of this game. Even on sale, I can't discourage this game enough. It's just an utter waste of time.",1628363166,1628650491,False,117,35,0.5817757248878479,70,True,False,False

First of all, this game is a sequel to a game called Lobotomy Corporation. You don't have to play the first game since this game is delivered in a way that people who haven't play the first game can understand the story, but I highly recommend that you check out Lobotomy Corporation or if you're not interested in the gameplay, you can look up videos on the story. I have spent close to 1500 hours on this game during the Early Access period and in that time, I've beaten the game twice and 100% the game with the achievements. With that in mind, let's begin.

[b]Overview[/b]

Pros :
- Story rich game in a cyberpunk dystopian setting with fantasy elements
- A unique card battler and deckbuilder game that combines story elements with gameplay really well
- Roleplaying elements
- Simplistic yet really satisfying combat animations
- Great soundtracks
- Mili
- Dynamic music to compliment the feeling of combat
- No microtransactions (I have to include this because some people mention gacha and might confuse them with microtransactions)

Cons :
- Might experience FPS drop
- Getting new cards and decks involves a bit of randomness
- Depending on how well you do at this game, you might have to redo some battles

[b]Full Review[/b]

Library of Ruina is a game where you can play as Librarians. You invite guests to your Library and turn them into books. From these books you can earn new cards and suits (deck) to equip your Librarians with. Getting these new rewards involves burning your books to get random rewards from a limited reward pool, something like opening a card pack. That's why I said getting new rewards involves a bit of randomness, you can get unlucky and not getting the good rewards immediately but you will get all the rewards eventually if you repeat the battle a few times.

Now for the combat, they are fairly complex and involves a good bit of reading. I can't explain all the mechanics in a single review, so I will try to give a summary for the combat system. Combat uses cards and dice system. You and the enemies have a special abilities called ""passives"". These passives will largely determine how you will approach the battles, so you have to read them carefully. Now let's get the elephant out of the room. Is the combat RNG heavy? After doing a second playthrough where I defeat every battle in a single try, I can safely say ""No"" (with an exception of a battle involving [spoiler]a mercenary and a wolf[/spoiler]). Your skill and understanding of the mechanics on this game will be more than enough to reliably conquer the RNG. If you want to know true RNG hell, try playing Darkest Dungeon or XCOM.

Now I will talk about the story without delving into spoilers territory. The story takes place in a cyberpunk dystopian setting with a lot fantasy elements. As I've said before, this game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corporation, but you can play this game without playing the first game to understand the story as this game will also explain the events of the first game to you.

Last but not least, the music. Normally, I don't talk about music when reviewing a video game because in a lot of games, the music are just there for the sake of having music. This time however, if you don't play with music on, you're missing half the experience of playing this game. Not only the music are amazing (and I'm not just talking about Mili), they play an integral part to the story and combat. Combat music also has a dynamic music system that will amplify the overall feeling of combat. Some boss music will also give emotions to the battle and makes you care about the character that you're about to face. I can't tell you enough on how amazing the music in this game is. All I can say is you have to experience the music yourself.

Overall, I highly recommend Library of Ruina as it is one of the best game I've played in my entire life.",1599220150,1628644671,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Gameplay-wise it's completely different from its predecessor, Lobotomy Corporation, an SCP-inspired management game. Library of Ruina is like dungeon management game in the sense that you lure people with valuable power and information, taking theirs if you succeed in fending them off. Defeated ""guests"" are distilled into books which can then be broken down, extracting their physical forms, abilities and combat techniques which you can combine together to forge a squad of perfect cocktails of previous victims to conquer tougher guests.

To combat guests you choose certain floors, which have their own very distinct bonuses and resulting builds that can complement them. The build diversity for the most part is really good, there are some cards that are auto-includes in a bit too many decks but I've been able to make many unique loadouts due to the passive system. The options are sort of lackluster at the beginning however, but at that point there is a lot to focus on just learning the game (The tutorial needs some improvement).

As a sequel it is great . It really gives the feeling that the developers planned for this story well in advanced and it's world building is amazing, shining a light on a once purposefully cryptic outer setting of the game while expanding upon the main events of the previous story and characters. People feared that the SCP-like ""abnormalities"" would be neglected in this game, yet they're integrated in such an intriguing way that almost feels like fan service if it wasn't for how good it was executed.

However, it's very accommodating of those who haven't played the last game, that being lended to the perspective of its two main characters, one who is a complete outsider to the previous story and a main focus of the previous story who's suddenly able to be a lot more open about her own experience. 

Overall, it's a very solid game, can be challenging but also delightfully breakable with hundreds of hours of fun for the experimental types, and for those who have played Lobotomy Corporation and have been taken in by the story the game is a must if you want to learn more about the inner workings of E.G.O and abnormalities.",1590154859,1628626612,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Both the main story encounters and Abnormality fights are quite varied and fun which provide excellent challenges for players to overcome without being overtly punishing. RNG is involved yes but generally a good strategy and properly designed decks will overcome even the toughest threats. 
The music of course is also top-notch with the Mili songs easily being the highlight. Every floor having it's own theme that builds up over the course of a battle is an extremely fun way of presenting it and letting you feel the escalating emotions of your librarians fighting to the death against their guests.

Ok let’s get Serious for a sec:
This game is probably the most fun I had with a Card Game in forever like Slay the Spire, and it shows the game not only has a in-depth and engaging combat system that gives the player so much freedom to do what they want, and gives huge deal of things to toy with. 

Not only that it’s presentation  is downright amazing form the Visual art, Music to even the way the game with style, it is certainly a sequel that well worth the praise it gets. Speaking of it being a sequel I recommend everyone who sees this review to play Lobotomy Corporation before playing Library of Runia since not only are you missing out on Project Moon’s first game that gave the foundation  for LOR it also is an amazing hard experience that only makes the Library of Runia Experience even Better then you’ll ever know.",1628623389,1628623389,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Philip can suck my dick and go back to crying. Other then that, amazing game with an engaging story and excellently written characters. I often found myself staying up late into the night to make sure I won a difficult fight or progressed to the next story beat. 

Pros:
- Excellent writing and character design
- Unique (to my knowledge) play style with large emphasis on strategy and deck building
- Music, emotion, and e.g.o work very well as a system to set the mood and enforce the power of characters in a fight
Cons:
- Some fights are necessary to progress but are generally less fun to play. The sweepers, in my opinion, took too long and their gimmick just annoyed me in the early parts of the game.
- Cards are crucial to victory, but are got from semi-random pack openings. Whilst fun, grinding for certain cards quite often kills the mood.

Cons: 
-Very poor tutorial / Unintuitive game design. After 2 hours, I still don't really get the nuanced mechanics enough to play the game. 
-Was started as a somewhat unique cyber-goth story eventually just became super creepy and weird. Like, so we're just abducting children and killing them? And the protagonist is just non-chalantly ok with this? And there's no motive for this either. 
-Resolution is super tiny. Can barely see the people/cards to appreciate the pixel graphics, which I'm usually a fan of. 
-VA is all Japanese

Pro's: 
-Devs tried something new but the package just doesn't deliver. At least they tried something fresh though. 

If you have played every single other deckbuilder out there, then sure this may scratch an itch if you can stomach the horrible story and graphics. But even the cards themselves all look the same and aren't very interesting, Nor is the ""emotion"" mechanics which was supposed to be the whole big point of this game.  Instead go back and keep playing Griftlands or Slay the Spire or so many other better games.

The appeal of this game would range from its lore, art style, music and the stacking combat mechanics that seem to be a classic with card-based games.

Part of the lore stems from the prequel, Lobotomy Corporation, although I haven't played it myself and watched an entire play through instead. It's not necessary to play Lobotomy Corp to enjoy the lore of Library of Ruina, but it gives an insight to the relationships between characters and what occurred before the Library began.

The combat of this game uses key pages and then pages, key pages acting as armor and pages acting as weapons. Later on, you'll be able to add more to that ""armor"". Key pages affect your health, stagger, resistances and passives. Stagger is another stat, similar to health, that determines how far from being staggered you are, once you become staggered, you become unable to act and your resistances become the worst rating. 

Pages are a bit more complicated as they not only have various effects but also operate on a dice system. RNG is a large aspect of this game, although there are ways to get around this until the game slaps you with certain attacks that leave you praying to whoever you believe in. The dice system has a detailed explanation in the game already, with the idea being that there are three kinds of dice that have their uses and interactions with one another and themselves. The combat itself is less complicated than the game makes it seem, though there are difficulty spikes throughout the game and require a bit of thinking and reformatting of your decks to deal with.

The music is great, with a wide range of themes for the unique floor mechanic that goes in hand with the combat. The increasingly intense music as you reach certain benchmarks in combat adds to the mood and tops the enjoyable experience that comes with the lore behind your battles.",1609756358,1628250455,True,2,0,0.509237885475158691,0,True,False,False

- Narrative driven
- Turn based
- Card collecting
- Fighting game

The series started with Lobotomy corporation, a game very close to what is essentially the meme world of SCP foundation, trying to contain and secure various anomalies. The second iteration which is the library of ruina is an almost direct continuation of the first one's story (as far as i can tell) but this time its more about taking the story, theme and ideas of the first game and turning them into something else via this card based battle system.

Curiously enough, at first look the game seems shallow with its 2D anime emoticon based bmp characters and their silly expressions straight outta a mobile phone game, but this is one of the games that completely and utterly betrays the first looks.
Immense depth in story, lore and game complexity, and successfully manages to create a world which immerses a player.
Much like the scp foundation's idea, the series is not straightforward. It will hand you a bag of breadcrumbs and lets you figure it out on your own.

While absolutely not essential (cause library is a perfectly fine story on its own) If you are interested in the overarching lore, i recommend playing or at least watching Lobotomy corporation.
If you enjoy the SCP universe and games with a bit of depth, you will enjoy what you find here. Do your research and see for yourself, just be careful with out of nowhere invitations to a library.

EDIT:
A warning if i may though. Do not skim over the tutorial/introduction pages.
Once you figured out the game its pretty straightforward all in all, but until then if you run face first against it without any idea, you will be lost. The game is above average in terms of complexity.",1627321627,1627323052,True,2,0,0.480120867490768433,0,True,False,True

Library of Ruina is amazing, which is why it hurts so damn much to say that the absurd levels of difficulty sucks all the fun right out.

Once you pass that first third of the game, LoR will unashamedly reveal how brutal it is by consistently stacking the deck against you. You'll soon see cases where you're arbitrarily outnumbered, enemies ignoring mechanics altogether and perhaps being pushed to fight multiple battles with no breathing room. And it only gets more ridiculous from there. It's very easy to make a poor play that dunks one of your team members so hard the entire group will fall through the floor. All this and the the fact there's still a grind (for ""booster packs"", which you can lose in wagers if you fail) makes this a very time consuming game.

Which is a downright shame because LoR has so much to offer: Every character has their own little story to tell, every encounter has its own feel and strategy, and when a boss blares out a whole new song and changes up [i]everything[/i], you're left wondering whether to say ""ARE YOU [b]SERIOUS???[/b]"" or ""Oh [b]hell[/b] yes...!""

Library of Ruina is an interesting game with a great deal of work put into it and clearly has much that you can get out of it. The mechanics as well as the art direction are deep and unique, I have never played anything quite like it (I have not played Lobotomy Corp, though I gather it's different mechanically).

Because you work in a library that's growing in power and enticing various victims inside, the story is free to be very open. The game primarily explores an intriguing setting through gathering bits and pieces from various characters. I was expecting to sample some interesting characters when I first figured that out. Never would I have guessed the absolutely wild places Library of Ruina takes you, or more accurately, takes people in from.

I was iffy buying this game at first since it isn't like what LC was and it is card based combat, but after playing it for a bit I was instantly hooked on. It removes management sim and focus purely on combat and those changes it self made the game more enjoyable and funner to play.
The story is top notch and adds more depth into the cast to either to enjoy or hate them even more. It adds the aftermath of LC and expands the world and lore for LC and LoR. It tackles how cruel and dark the society can be. The music is also amazingly well written and has couple of songs from Mili.
Customization of you team is also improved significantly compare to LC and has steam workshop support.
Visually it is an improvement and beautiful to look at.
While yes you will have to grind out for the cards/books, It is light grind and it isn't that bad. Story based loot used to be rng like normal loot but they improved it recently by making it a guarantee drop. it isn't super heavy grind where it will take you an hour to get the single card/book you will need.

While i can't say everyone will enjoy LC since that game is super niche. but LoR is a fantastic game and probably almost as a masterpiece that everyone should try out (unless they are triggered by gore/disembodiment, which is fair)

This is a very unique game and I haven't found any game similar to it.
tl;dr at the bottom

[h2] About LoR and why I like it [/h2]

How Library of Ruina (LoR) works is that unlike other card battlers, it isn't a rogue-like. But instead, a card battler with a linear campaign.
Because of this you can always know in advance what cards (attacks) the enemies are using and their stats via a pre-planning phase, and knowledge from fighting enemies previously.
This makes encounters less random and allow for more pre-planning. Even combat itself is less random:
In a deck, you have 9 cards. Each card has an energy cost and contains one or more die, which are your ""actions"".
These dice contain a range of values which determine when played against the clashing party's card's die, who will win.
e.g. You use an attack with a roll of 1-6 vs attack with a roll of 3-6.
You can always see what card the opposing party is going to play in combat.

At first, I didn't like LoR very much. It reminded me of TRPGs and CRPGs with its dice rolls. It was only later on that I realized that even though there are chances based on the roll you get, the game allows you to control them in various ways. Examples being able to raise or lower the maximum / minimum value of dice rolls. You can also match cards up in a way beneficial to you, such as like pitting a 3-5 attack card against a 2-4 attack card.

The reason I like the game so much is that you can always plan for combat. As there is a pre-planning phase, you get to look at what cards they (opposing party) have, what are their stagger values and then build your deck to test out how it actually plays out in the battle.
With every loss you can get to know what went wrong and apply it immediately without much penalty other than non progression. (Since its a linear story)

[b] Essentially, all RNG is in combat and only in combat. [/b] At the start of every combat, you are dealt 4 cards randomly (out of 9) and every turn you draw one card. You also get to see all the cards the AI is going to play. This means that you will need to choose which is the most suitable card from your hand even if the most optimal card wasn't drawn, [b] without the drawback that you need to choose cards you don't want to see at all [/b] compared to games like Slay The Spire where you might be forced to have an unwanted card due to the given starting deck. 

I have heard that the game consistently introduce new mechanics as you play through the story ( intended to be around 100 hours) So I would imagine that its new features keeps the game from getting stale, compared to games such as StS, as explained below.

[h2] Compared to Slay The Spire [/h2]

I will preface this by saying I own Slay The Spire on mobile, and admittedly I haven't beat it on higher levels.
However, I prefer this game over games like StS or Monster Train. 

StS being a rogue-like means that the cards and passives you gained every run is different, enemies the same and although you can manage your deck, this can only be done to a certain amount (e.g. You can only discard a card from your deck using the shopkeeper so many times)

So to get better at StS is to be aware of what good builds there are and adjust to what is already dealt, there is actually very little control for the setup of combat itself. 
I personally dislike this , as you get a standard deck at the start but you can't fully experiment with what you have theorycrafted because one of the cards you need might not be given to you or available at the shop.

The mentioned ""staleness"" primarily comes from the same type of enemies and thus the feeling of each run would get very similar if you stick to a deck that already works.

So I would say that its up to personal preferences really.

[h2] In Summary [/h2]
Library of Ruina is a Card battler with linear campaign that gives the player control over the setup of encounters.
Losses have no penalty other than non-progression.
The game rewards deck building and observing enemy stats and attributes.

Talking about Lobotomy Corporation: DISCLAIMER, Library of Ruina is not similar to LC gameplay-wise, it's a game where you use ""books"" to build decks of cards! Battles will depend on your random luck, inflicting certain status ailments, or even just THE PROPER TIMING (looking at you, Today's Shy Look!) Thankfully, the game doesn't have LC's ""permadeath/losing E.G.O"" system if you lose a librarian in a battle, so keep redoing battles as many times as you need to (as long as you have the right books/decks to challenge guests again!)

I also like the Key and Combat Pages system! It's kind of complicated but once you learn more about them + the battle system, and pay attention to the type(s) of damage/support/etc. your Combat pages do, along with keeping an eye on the weaknesses/resistances of your Key Pages, battle will be a breeze! The game is also very harsh on the main characters and ""guests"" in the Library, story-wise! It's still very engrossing, and I also love how Library of Ruina intertwines some commentary on different people's/society's views on the real world, albeit a bit more grim and intense! I think something I learned was (SPOILERS FOR WHAT I INTERPRETED FROM THE BAD ENDING:) [spoiler]""revenge only makes you bitter and will hurt (or kill) you and the ones you loved in the end,"" in the cases of both Roland and Angela![/spoiler]

Going back to the gameplay, the one small criticism I have is the COMPLETELY random luck! You constantly have to hope that the die your librarians roll are better than those of your enemies! The Abnormality pages are a big help in turning the tides of battle, but once you finish your battles and get the books? You have to decide whether to keep them so you can move on to the next battle, or ""burn"" them and hope you get good Key Pages and Combat Pages, because if you don't? You'll have to go through the battles AGAIN, go figure! It may be daunting to others, but if you're a ""former manager"" from LC like me, you will be fine if you don't care about repetitive tasks that slowly get harder to get better gear for your nuggets and the Patron Librarians!

Finally, I truly do admire Project Moon's dedication to this game and Lobotomy Corporation! I may not have been here from the very start, but I know Project Moon has been working hard to make Library of Ruina an enjoyable experience for all of their fans! All in all, Library of Ruina's gameplay is very interesting even if I'm not into deckbuilding games, the worldbuilding is rich, and the characters are carefully designed appearance-wise AND personality-wise! A lot of love has been put into this game, I enjoy it and I hope you will (or already do) like it as much as me!",1625038871,1625899575,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

TLDR: Game's good and rewarding, but has plenty of issues with the tutorials.

Library Of Ruina is the latest endeavour of ProjectMoon, and where Lobotomy Corporation was a jump into the messy world of management in an unexplained and cryptic setting, this game takes a different approach. The best way to describe Library Of Ruina is ""A deckbuilding game for the mentally insane"" or a ""Gacha Game but done right"". More on that later.
Let's take this from the beginning.

[h1] What even is ""Library Of Ruina""? [/h1]
To put it simply, it's a game where you make a team of character with specific acquired skills and cards and pin them against an A.I opponent with other skills and cards and the one that survives the last wins and takes the whole pot. It takes a page from any mana-based cardgame such as Hearthstone or Legends of Runeterra and cranks up the variety and building by tenfolds. At the beginning you'll start with cards for shitters and as you complete ""Invitations"" (AKA battles) you'll acquire ""Books"". Books are basically packs of cards and skillsets. You burn books to gain cards to apply to your characters and you'll have a chance to gain the skillset of the enemy you just defeated and gained the book from. Later on, you'll be able to mix and match skills from different books to accentuate certain aspects of the character or team.
This is literally all there is to know about the basic stuff of the game.

[h1] Strong suits and ""not so strong"" ones. [/h1]
As the title of the section implies, there is nothing intrinsically wrong with the game itself. Powercreeping is part of the deal and will happen all the time. Some battles are just massive stat-checks that ensure that you'll be ready for the future to come and so on and so on...
But why buy it? Simple: ProjectMoon knows their stuff. If you are a fan of the aforementioned stuff, then you won't be disappointed. The game sounds good, looks AMAZING - and if you're into the artstyle of the previous game, then you'll be in for a treat. It has personality out of its ass, you can create your own characters and personalize them as you please, and as you use them in fight you might even get accessories that boost specific traits of the character and mix and mash them together to create the most abhorrent being in the cosmos, or dress everyone up like a maid because [strike] you are a degenerate [/strike] you have good taste.
To top that all off, the soundtrack for the game FUCKS. And it fucks HARD. When ProjectMoon hired MILI to make the OSTs for the boss battles they surely knew their shit because everything clicks together like a milk puzzle. 17 dollars well worth of Soundtrack since it's basically a MILI album + plenty of other songs that are absolute bangers..

[h1] . . . BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT- [/h1]
ProjectMoon doesn't know how to make a tutorial, so they made wall-of-texts mandatory for you to understand any-fucking-thing, and even if you understood what is written, applying it is nothing short of a nightmare. Take me on this and just find a tutorial made by some user, or just barge into the subreddit and ask around. The community is amazing in the face of the many technical issues of the game.


To put an end to this review.
The game is amazing. Maybe not worth the 25 bucks as a whole but you'll get out of this at least a good 100+ hours of game and even more if you want to. The Soundtrack is well worth the cost, and if you can get both of them during a big sale, grab the whole pack - and possibly even Lobotomy Corporation. The prequel isn't truly mandatory since it's so far detatched from that, but it will put down the groundwork for a lot of characters that had their development there. It would be like eating a hamburger without sauces.",1625776958,1625776958,True,2,0,0.524474203586578369,0,True,False,True

These shall be my own opinion, correct or wrong is up to your interpretation, also I pretty much suck at reviews like these so bear with me lol.

- The visual novel aspect is straightforward, simple and overall great. The story provided as well may be confusing at first but don't let it discourage you, as this is worldbuilding for the ProjectMoon universe, providing you with its own terminologies, lore, characters, organizations, civilization and concept which is what makes a universe in itself its uniqueness to stand out. Unique characters are introduced as well which can pique your interest in their background and get you attached, even characters from the prequel, Lobotomy Corporation, backstories were expanded here. I commend ProjectMoon for this masterpiece.

- The game can be a bit overwhelming to understand for first-timers, with its UI and battle system, even with the tutorial and manual provided, however if you're willing you will eventually get used to the complicated looking controls and understand what each does and its mechanics become muscle memory as if it were a common thing to do as you play the game.

- The battle system is a fun turn-based card deck combat, it is straightforward at first, character select a card to use to attack, likewise the enemy does the same, then both characters will duke it out. Sounds simple enough, but you can't just do it like that all the time, as the game gets progressively harder and there are even major difficulty spikes. Most cards will have a value, effect and mechanic to them, usually displayed in the card itself to let you be aware of what it can do, this can then encourage deckbuilding as to pick the correct card deck to use in combat in order to overcome the rising difficulty curve, strategy is required since it is turn-based strategy after all.

- As above, the game is NOT meant for easy casual play and even involves some RNG, if you think you can just throw card until you win you are mistaken, sure it is possible to do that but it will not be worth the time attempting the same fight 100 times until you win. The game is a turn-based strategy and encourages you to make use of mechanics and effects to make a strategy, even allowing you to manipulate the RNG aspect, to secure victory. Of course, there are mods to alleviate this if you are not willing, no one will stop you on how to play the game, as long as you enjoy it, its all fun and games.

- An amazing original soundtrack that can get you hooked while playing the game, created by Studio EIM which I must express my gratitude for an amazing soundtrack. The game also features some songs by Mili.

- Customizability: you can customize your own characters for each floor with the librarian customizer, if that is not enough, there is Steam Workshop integration allowing users to download skins which can range from Original Characters, characters from other popular culture,[spoiler]amogus[/spoiler] and other franchises. You can even make your own.

I've been eyeing this game for about half a year now and I am so glad I finally got this game and am playing it.

The genre is RPG deckbuilder.  This is by no means a roguelite(but it does have certain elements I'll explain later), so throw out trying to compare this to Slay the Spire, or monster train. The biggest thing to enjoy the game is to manage your expectation. This deckbuilder really distinguishes itself.

This game isn't grindy in that you have to fight tons of battles, but it still struggles with some small issues. Of all card games, this comes closes to Griftlands , in that it has a full story. In my current play through, I am not sensing any replayability, which personally, I don't really care for in games (I like to finish a game and move on)
Most of your power progression will come from getting new cards, and disassembling decks you already have just to create new ones, and that is where the ""progression"" and RPG elements come in.
Your ""level"" up is theory crafting new decks based on fighting new enemies, because the way this game awards you is with 5-10+ NEW cards after each fight.  

Where it can drag on is, after you reach a difficulty/storyline threshold, you have to stop to recreate decks from new cards you have gotten. And because this is a deckbuilder, your(at least mine) natural inclination is to compare how decks are created from Slay the Spire, Monster Train. You have to be patient and enjoy the deckbuilding part of this game, otherwise it does feel like this game is dragging. Consider the fact that most deckbuilders are roguelites, you are used to short battles.

Keep in mind that this is an RPG, this game is super long and has tons of content. 

My only issue with this game, is that there are WAY too many unique battles and cards.  I wasn't expecting to swap decks based on different teams and I wish the progression was a little bit more streamlined. I'm having to swap decks using different teams just to gain some progression. That is what I mean about managing expectations. It isn't a traditional RPG, but there are still so many battles to fight. 

This game is made doubly hard if you don't necessarily care for the story.  I personally don't mind it. 

How this game could be a bit better is to just maximize card rewards, because there are some battles you have to fight twice(fine okay), but I have fought similar long battles 3 times.  and that can be a drag. 

In short:
1. manage your expectation, this is an RPG. Grindy but not in the way you would expect
2. Incredible theory crafting.
3. Card rewards and battle progression could be streamlined a bit more.
4. Great art and Music
5. I personally like the story. 

Edited review: 
I was debating on whether to give this a positive review or not. I'm more neutral about this game now that I am towards the end.  The issue; I probably won't finish this game.

In the end, the amount of filler content and grind was just overwhelming. Some battles are way too long, with some gimmicks that really test how patient you are.  In this game, a battle can have multiple acts (1-5 acts), with different mechanics, and if you lose in one act, thats it, you have to start from the 1st act all over just to be able to make some small progression. I've lost hours just because these multiple act battles drag on forever. And you have to do them twice sometimes just to get the full rewards.

Card rewards just need to be maximized. There really isn't a reason in this game to fight a battle more than once, given how much content you have to get through to get to the end game. And probably only 2-3 unique fights are fun enough that I want to play it again, but this is out of the 50+ battles you are forced to go through, not to mention repeats because losing a fight really punishes you and can set you back hours. 
Another issue, the battle system gives you options of using teams/characters that you won't because of how progression works, only to force you to use everything in the end game.

What you don't tell them is that no patron has managed to check out a book since your opening and they're here to be murdered, their souls turned into literature which will be used to posthumously bait the next group of fools into adorning your walls. More books for the bookshelves.

The story was written by an emo kid on a lethal dose of antidepressants but it grows on you.

The soundtrack is superb, I wound up headbobbing to tracks i'd never heard before while too distracted by the gameplay to realize I was doing it. The devs also keep polishing the ost and adding more, I highly recommend keeping sound on even if you're like me and don't care for voice acting. 

Difficulty is high and fair you can beat any challenge the game throws at you with your available resources but smart deckbuilding and play are often required, especially for the early-midgame where the game is balanced around kicking your ass if you don't come prepared and giving you a reasonable challenge when you do. Contrary to what some reviewers are saying grinding is almost never necessary if you ""get gud"" but not being good at this game is nothing to be ashamed of and rebuilding half your decks for every fight can become tedious.

My only complaints with regards to difficulty/gameplay are some of the abnormalities were clearly balanced around previous patches where players had less options, and certain strategies like singleton, purple tear decks, and Gebura/Mio decks basically break the game and are better than all other options. There are also a couple weird bugs, for example I killed a boss while one of my guys had been taken by his ""machine remaking"" ability or whatever and it turned him into a ghost that caused him to be targetted even though he was no longer there freezing the combat and forcing me to restart.

To give an example of the gameplay complaints, I worked my way through Gebura, Mio/Rudolph pages, and most of the content pre-blue reverberation since the abnormality challenges seemed less interesting and didn't reward cards. As a result by the time I got around to doing them I wiped out half the challenges with no difficulty whatsoever which was a problem because you can't just go afk and let the ai clear for you, it will do something stupid and your characters will die. This lead to like 10+ hours of clearing content that I was overleveled for and it only didn't burn me out because the sound and artstyle were good enough to keep it interesting. Some of the mechanical interactions are also poorly explained, figuring out when dodges/blocks were transferable to another attack and which clash would occur first took some figuring out.

If you don't mind taking your time and thinking through the challenges, if you liked Slay the Spire but wanted to control multiple characters with a long campaign, if you like books more than people then this game is for you.",1625705792,1625706161,True,19,2,0.648186326026916504,1,True,False,True

To preface this, I loved Library of Ruina (LoR) and highly, highly recommend it. If you can get into it, then it is a special game.
LoR is the sequel to Lobotomy Corporation (LC), and while you can play LoR without having played LC, I cannot wholly recommend doing so. LoR explains everything you need to know to easily understand the goings on of the game—you won’t be lost if you start out with this game. BUT none of the beats will hit anywhere near as hard if you haven’t played LC. Experiencing what (the majority) of the characters went through in the hell that was LC greatly enhances the experience. 
The game would generically be explained as a turn-based deckbuilder RPG. Barely of that accurately describes the game. Do not think to compare this to other deckbuilders, the gameplay doesn’t resemble STS or any other game. It doesn’t go super hard into deckbuilding—each character can only have 9 cards in a deck. The thing is that you can have up to 5 characters in a battle, and you will be expected to finely tune your decks, passive skills, and strategies to beat what the game throws at you.
The combat is… hard to adequately describe. Look up a tutorial vid on YT to get a good idea of what’s going on there. Trying to explain it n a review would only cause confusion.
Beware: The game is not easy. The first 30% or so of the game is ‘easy’ content, both in terms of story and gameplay. Then the game will start requiring you to optimize your decks and play. You will have to think 1-2 turns in advanced and manage both yours and the enemy’s resources in order to win. In terms of story content, LoR does not shy away from the bad. If things like body horror or total mental breakdowns are too much for you, then you probably shouldn’t play the game.
Musically, the game is an absolute delight. Between full orchestral pieces, a little metal, and some Piano/Violin duets (they paid for the whole Violin, and by god they are going to use the whole Violin), and some Mili vocal pieces, the game has a large and varied OST—all of which is fantastic. But that is not the main draw. LoR’s OST works with the themes, story and emotions, enhancing and enriching the entire experience. The game interweaves the music with the entire experience in a way I have only seen done by Nier Automata. The OST is probably only a single step below Chrono Cross and Legend of Mana, the gods of video game OSTs.
The story is centered around the growth of the two main characters: Roland and Angela, through their growing “friendship”, their experiences with those in the city whose lives they take, and their interactions with the major characters from the first game (the Sephirot). It is about whether you can be truly free, to do something you want and do it only for yourself, and whether it is possible to do so without continuing the cycle of suffering—can you pursue your own self-actualization without crushing that of someone else’s? Can you accept and face sorrow and loss?
The game makes you care about the characters, both those you play as and those you fight. You are not always (or even usually) the good guy in any interaction, and you will feel bad with some of the harm you inflict.
This game is not a SCP-centric experience. While they are a good part of the gameplay, they are not there to be SCPs. Instead they are more thematic entities, representing pain, trauma, desires, etc. of the main characters. This game is character-focused not SCP-focused.
The game does amazing world-building. Each encounter gives you snippets of the lives of the people whose lives you are about to take. Enough to build a concrete idea of the entire world, but not enough that you are inundated in lore dumps or that the world loses its mystery and magic.
LoR is a long game and encounters are long. This is not a game for short bursts. Later fights and realizations can easily take ~1hr. By the point you reach “Star of the City”, you will think you’ve reached the endgame, but in actuality you’ll have reached the halfway point. As the game goes on, encounters get larger, more complicated, and much longer.
It ain’t perfect by any measure though. Like LC, the game absolutely sucks at explaining its mechanics. You will suffer for no good reason while learning them. The English translation, while fine and lightyears ahead of LC’s, is a little rough in the beginning (beginning = pre-Crying Children/Love Town). It isn’t hard to understand, but it is a definitely a little mechanical and too literally translated. Thankfully, it markedly improves in the later acts. 
The UI is a disaster, both in menus and in combat. Keeping track of 10,000 overlapping arrows is not a skill you will ever want to develop, but it is one you must. You will accidentally right click out of a billion menus on accident. You will have trouble viewing status effects and character status screens will get in the way of combat. Navigation is painful for no good reason.
I feel as if I have written ~1k words without really describing the game. But it is more of an experience than anything else. I highly recommend it, but it is definitely not for everyone, and you need to be accepting of the jank you will encounter.

Library of Ruina is now a narrative sequel to Lobotomy Corp. Do you need to beat LC to appreciate this game however? Yes and no, the context of it's connection to Lobotomy Corp is presented to you through the story by showing you the events of LC from another persons perspective. However you will miss a lot of characterisation of the side-cast.

Library of Ruina is a deckbuilder hybrid RPG, I feel like it'd be more accurate called a booster pack builder as unlike normal deck builders you gain booster packs rather than multiple choice of singular cards to expand your decks.

++++++ A story designed to be mature and written for adults, in a sea of games written for teenagers this is a nice change pace.
+++++ Much akin to the first entry in this universe the story is top notch. It is a story of revenge, nihilism, a cyberpunk dystopia and a road to hell paved with good intentions.
+++++ The combat mechanics and how they are themed is top notch. Every major fights mechanics are heavily themed around who they are, why they are doing it and what is happening at the time. Which inevitable ties in to how you win the fight.
+++++ Amazing music, some of this will really surprise you and it sets the mood in surprising and impressive/eerie ways.
++++ Simple concept, you have a deck of 8 cards you've chosen per character and when played they have 1-4 dice on them (how many attacks you do). Your dice roll your chance to hit in a clash and the damage they deal in a single roll. If any enemy with a lower speed initiative than you is targeting someone you can use a higher speed to intercept them by targeting their lower speed and this forces them to clash with you. The dice roll in order on the card and the highest roll wins the clash.
++++ But escalating complexity and synergy everywhere; the game starts out simple but as deck builds become available, at first basic things like debuffs for burning, bleeding, paralysis. Then more complex build themes like ranged attacks, smoke (bonus damage done buff that can be spread and maintained), charge (energy you can build up and spend) and singleton (no duplicate cards in a deck) massively add to the synergies.
++++ great character customisation; not only can you name, change the appearance and quotes of every one of your units but you can load in player made skins from steam workshop if you prefer some quirky flair.
++++ build system is great; you get equippable ""pages"" which determine your speed, health and stagger resistance. Each come with a unique set of traits, as the game progresses you can equip pages you aren't using to the one you are to further build up your characters and cover their weaknesses or boost their strenghts.
++++ Abnormalities; Further build up your synergy with unique special pages that unlock through defeating bosses. Once unlocked you earn emotion points by winning or losing clashes against the enemy. At new emotion levels you get to pick from a set of the abnormality pages you've unlocked for that floor. They range from simple passives with good or mixed but strong effects, wearing the abnormality's powers and having a whole new set of powers for several turns or summoning the abnormality to stomp the enemies with overwhelming force.
+++ Despite resembling a gacha/booster pack card game the resemblance is merely aesthetic and there is no paid gacha here. Once you've bought the game there are no additional purchases in game. Also the rare pages can be gained with a maximum of 3 ""burns burned"" think booster packs.
+++ Great aesthetics which the game maintains throughout
+++ Despite having story presented through visual novel style, the game consistently has full art scenes at key moments that really help portray the world and its story well... Other games sure could take note of this... *cough* fate.

---/+++ This game has a lot of content and it'll take you a while to beat it all, some of it will seem impossible until the mechanics click with you. Take it at a pace you can manage and don't burn out at the end.

-- Game needs a restart fight button, currently your only option is going to menu and return to title and loading your save again.

But as that has to do mostly with the story, I will first talk about the combat. It is really good difficult at time and sometimes a bit unfair but if you are able to think stuff through then you will be able to complete the game. As for the story I would say that in terms of content itself there is about as much as the predesesor Lobotomy corporation but unlike LobCorp it focuses on the city and its residents instead all on the facility and what is going on in it. Which is good to be fair. But I would say it is a bit more emotional and will hit you harder in the heart than the first one. I is just really good, not better in my world than LobCorp as I love the concept of LobCorp than the Concept of this game in terms of game play; and as for the hooks the main draw for me are the abnomalities in lobcorp but instead the main draw for this game are the people and the things within the city but in my world abnomalities are much more forien to me than the city for example I was able to through just logic was able to figure out R corps singularity (their main draw) before it even appeared.

Beating this game from start to finish was 90 hours of exerting MAXIMAL BRAIN OUTPUT, with minimal repeat grinding of fights (I did not need to beat a single reception more than once until the second last section of the game [spoiler] Star of the City[/spoiler]). No two combat encounters are the same, with every single fight having unique mechanics that you must understand and strategize against, and each of these new fights you overcome gives you new tools to use against future fights.

The appeal of the storytelling lies mainly in two points: The story of the uncannily fucked up City, which is seen through snippets of the lives of the characters you fight, and the story of Roland and Angela, which develops as you progress through the story and upgrade the floors of the Library.

For anyone uncertain, this game is also a sequel to the game Lobotomy Corporation, which is a much jankier, but still pretty neat monster-managing game. If you haven't played it, you can still pick this one up and understand the story, as it is told from the point of view of a newcomer character who also has no context for the previous game. There will certainly be moments where you scratch your head and wonder what exactly is going on, but the story does an overall good job at explaining things.

The game is also largely feature complete at the time of writing this review, with the only things left to complete being the console ports, and the workshop support for custom battles (which will be some time after early access, according to the developers).

(Take all this with a grain of salt as I am a bit biased towards the games.)

This is honestly among the best games I've ever played, probably the top. It's managed to keep me entranced for nearly 700 hours at the time of review. Having this game since the very day it released has been quite a ride. So many things about it changed, and most were for the better. 
The story is phenomenal and having to wait for updates to it only made me more invested as I theorized what might happen next and what'd it possibly cause. I fell in love with the new characters and grew a new appreciation for the returning ones as everything went on. And the music, oh man the music. It's so high quality that one might forget that an indie studio is behind the game if they aren't focusing enough. 

Library of Ruina isn't perfect though, even me with my rose-tinted glasses can see that clear as day. It's quite the grindy game, even if a feature to lessen that a bit has been added. Late-game, some of the fights a little frustrating in my own opinion.
A few things mentioned by the game at multiple points never get addressed, but that might just be a nitpick with my aforementioned bias.

TL;DR: Absolutely amazing game with great characters, music, and story. Gets grindy at times and is frustrating late-game. Overall good.

Story:
The story and the worldbuilding follow from Lobotomy Corporation really well, expanding and detailing a very unique dystopian setting over the course of the game. The story is full of foreshadowing and call-backs, showing a very cohesive and consistent narrative that i found really impressive when re-watching the story.
I can't say much more without spoilers, except that i really, really liked it.

Music:
The music is wonderful, with each of the 10 battle floors having three different themes which increase in intensity as the emotion level of the battles rises. On top of those, there are wonderful special tracks for boss battles, some of which are made by Mili and really emphasizes the character you're going against.
Beware of spoilers if you're looking for the soundtrack, though; some song titles reveal developments in the story which happen quite late in the game.

Gameplay:
I found the gameplay really fun after getting the hang of it. 
There is the deckbuilding component, which is not as deep as other games in the deckbuilding genre since the player's decks have a fixed size of 9, but considering that you'll need to manage up to 5 of them in battle, and potentially change them to better match your opponents, the simplicity helps.
The battle itself differs from classic deckbuilders mainly through the 'clash' mechanic: instead of taking turns hitting each others, combatants who target each other will instead roll the 'dice' in their chosen card against their opponent's dice, and the winner effectively both deflects the incoming attack, and connects with their own. This mode of combat changes up the classic 'attack and defense' formula seen in games like slay the spire, monster train, or griftlands, and when in action it makes the characters feel like they're in an actual, well, clash against each other.
The 'dice' portion of the mechanic does give room to some RNG for the results, but in my personal experience, having a decent deck and using the cards properly is enough to guarantee victory in most scenarios.

Progression is where the game really shines for me: when you defeat enemies, you get their cards and their 'key pages', which are more or less their bodies, weapons and armor all in one. The result of this mechanic is that when facing a tough enemy, the first thing that comes to mind is that i can't wait to use all the stuff they're beating me up with. And Project Moon is not shy when giving boss characters to the player: there IS some downscaling in health, but even with that they feel as powerful as when you fought them, if not even more.
There is a small minus in the fact that when getting the enemy's stuff it is picked randomly from a pool, which might require repeating some battles (which can last quite a bit) a few times to get the rare rewards. The pool is finite, though, which means that getting all rewards is guaranteed after 3-4 tries at most, generally.

Conclusion:
I've personally really enjoyed playing this game throughout early access, eagerly waiting for a new story chapter every week. Project Moon really did not let me down when following up on Lobotomy Corporation's hints of a larger world, and i'm looking forward to their next game to see both how they continue the story and to see what new gameplay formula they'll experiment with.",1624604847,1624604847,True,2,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,True

The core of the game revolves around a card based battle system with each card having different types of dice (attack, block, evade, counter) and various special effects. Accompanying the extensive types of cards are key pages which provide stats, various damage weaknesses and resistances, and special abilities. Both the cards and key pages can only be obtained by defeating various guests and obtaining their books. This allows for an extensive amount of customization when outfitting your characters known as librarians. Add the fact that you can mix and match different key page abilities and you'll find yourself in a position where you can build some ridiculous strategies.

That being said, getting into the massive depth that is all the mechanics of LoR is daunting. A tutorial has been established at this point, but there is a huge amount of trial and error possible if you can't grasp the base system quickly. Progression will always feel like an uphill battle for new players, and certain fights are meant to be faced AFTER completing others and increasing the level of the library you operate overall. If one fight feels like its too much to handle, give it a break and try a different one, or experiment with different builds on different floors of the library. Each floor has its own abilities that you discover as you play which can drastically change the battlefield and give you the edge you might be missing.

Music is wonderful, with different genres on each floor that ramp up and evolve as the emotion level of the fight increases. There are also several tracks done by the Milli group which each I feel personally stand out and are just really nice to listen too. There is also pretty high quality Korean voice acting for all the dialogue you will experience as you play. If you don't particularly like large amounts of conversations or you don't like listening to certain main characters then it may be rough going for you.

Visually the game provides a large amount of painted art pieces that give a good look at the world that surrounds the library. From the dismal backstreets to the dream like worlds of those consumed by their desires there is a massive gallery of beautiful scenes to look through. If you want to customize the looks of your characters, there's a pretty extensive menu that has evolved rather nicely since the beginning of early access. If the current outfits are lacking for you, the game also has dedicated workshop support, and the forums have detailed instructions for making your own mods.

The plot is a direct sequel to Project Moon's previous game Lobotomy Corp, but don't feel like you have to chug through a whole separate game to get the full experience from LoR. There is enough storytelling to provide you with an idea of what happened in the previous game while also expanding on the stories of the cast. The world building is detailed; providing an idea of just what society is like outside of the library. The writers went the extra mile calling out the various struggles and conflicting philosophies that come with struggling in a world where death and far worse fates are a constant. If you're not particularly interested in a large amount of depressive or gory moments, this may not be for you.

It took me a while to get used to the battle system, but the community guides did clear up some confusion that the game has a hard time explaining. There is a lot of reading involved. (Think of it like a board game manual.) 

I think the most frustrating part about this game would be the RNG factor in combat. 
Dice rolls are involved. Each card has a ""roll number"" to determine the player's turn order and if the page/card is clashed, attacked, evaded, or blocked. Of course, the higher the numbers get the more fatal / beneficial the damage is to the player or enemy.

RNG can be really fun or extremely frustrating. It's a gamble. If someone has played 100% Orange Juice, they would know how fun or frustrating the RNG factor of a game combat can potentially be. 

Another thing would be if you lose a battle, your pages/cards are lost. So it adds to the ""grind"" factor of the game. You need to regain your losses by doing previous battles again. 

This game is a bit grindy. You need to obtain enough books to obtain pages. The pages are your cards. You need to keep one or more books in order to progress into the story. 
This is part of the replay-ability factor. It also ensures that you are prepared for the next levels of the library and the game's difficulty spike. 

The story is really good. Be careful to anyone who is sensitive to dark themes. The world of Ruina is a really dark world. My friend also mentioned that this game takes after lore from Lobotomy Corp. The previous game the devs created.  I did needed to look for context from their previous game. It's nice to know some context of the lore, yet I went into the world completely blind. I have not looked into the world of Lobotomy Corp. (In the future, I will.)

The difficulty may be a bit on the easy side (especially since losing battles only costs you the books you wager on them and can be easily recovered) but there are a variety of effective strategies thanks to various floor based card buffs and deck types.

The game's basic mechanics are as follows:
-Every card you play costs some amount of Light (action points), though a number have no cost. 

-Your characters recover 1 light per turn without special rules. Some cards can generate light when used and whenever a character's light capacity increases, they get a free refill as well.

-Your characters draw one card from their deck per turn (without special rules). When you get more actions, you are in danger of using all all cards, forcing you to waste a turn without acting. So having a card that draws cards is a good idea.

-DO NOT leave slots in your character's deck empty. The game will fill those empty slots with terrible generic cards.

-Your light capacity will increase as a battle goes on as many actions and rolls generate emotion coins.

-You only can use one card per speed dice your characters have per turn. If the number on the speed dice is higher then an enemy dice, you can force that enemy to target you instead of their original target.

-All characters (your's and the enemy) have health and stagger. A character who runs out of stagger cannot act for a turn and takes double damage from everything until their stagger is restored the following turn.

-Offense dice clashing against offense dice has the highest rolling die win and apply the damage to the victim (think showdown quick draws in the old west)

-Offense dice against defense dice work differently for dodge or block dice. Block dice only work against one roll, but will always weaken the offense dice at least a little (and can cause stagger damage if they absorb it all). Dodge dice can keep being used as long as they succeed (and will restore stagger when successful), but if they fail, you take the full damage of the hit.

-Leftover defensive dice can trigger during a turn to help protect your characters

More importantly I highly recommend it for the amazing story and worldbuilding especially if you played the previous game lobotomy corporation (which I recommend playing or at least looking up the story bits on youtube for a better understanding of the characters and more understandable storyline for the characters). I absolutely cannot wait for the next work by project moon as they have proven themselves to be both passionate and talented creators who have made an absolutely fascinating and incredible world that is a perfect mixture of absurd surrealism, existential horror, and engaging drama. The art and character design is also absolutely gorgeous and it is here where the higher budget compared to lobotomy corporation really shows. The soundtrack is also excellent and the boss themes can really compliment the action, although there is a lack of diversity in the music which can get monotonous over time and become tiresome. Another big selling point is the outstanding character customization which really helps personalize each character and with workshop support there is even greater opportunity for customization. As for criticisms there are some balance issues and it can get frustrating with some of the abnormality battles which require you to completely change and optimize your loadout and character abilities which can (at least for me personally) break some of the character personalization and become tedious even with the ability to save and load presets (especially because you have to individually go to each page and unload the deck if you want to move cards to a new page). Also the afformentioned difficulty spike can be a bit jarring because while certainly never an easy game with a pretty well balanced difficulty escalation that can be overcome with enough practice, the right deck and abilities, and a good amount of luck there comes a point in which (at least in my experience) you have to grind the level you are trying to get past and try and kill enough enemies until you have enough new cards and abilities to beat them which can be tedious on its own but can quickly becomes a chore in the later levels where you need specific rare character book drops to try again which forces you to make a choice between potentially getting their rare abilities or getting another shot at the hard level, although there are mods that can help the drop rates which makes it more bearable. Some of the abnormality battles can also be just straight up unfair and force you to really game the system and exploit the game mechanics to win which can be more of a chore than an engaging battle. Even with these frustrations the majority of the time when the gameplay is fun and engaging and the incredible story make any tediousness or repetitiveness more than worth it which is why I so highly recommend this game and I cannot wait to see what comes next.",1622728040,1622728040,True,1,0,0.514824807643890381,0,True,False,True

Short story: I found out about ProjectMoon through Mili, specifically String Theocracy, the game's intro song. The catchy tune was enough for me to look into this; back then I didn't know about the rabbit hole I was going to jump into.

First of all: This game, gameplay wise, [b]isn't like Lobotomy Corp at all.[/b] In summary, it's a deck building game, and, even if you have powerups to help you, sometimes it WILL depend on RNG if you win or not. HOWEVER, it also doesn't have L Corp's permadeath system. So if you die, you can just try again as many times as your book inventory lets you.

Talking about books, I find the Key and Combat pages system so interesting to use. To become what you defeat isn't only rewarding as you feel your power become equal to your enemies, but it also supports the message and critic I believe this game is trying to share.

Let me elaborate. This game is [b]harsh[/b] on the characters, with a lot of death and madness around every corner. However, something that I love about this game is how, in this morbid way, it points at problems in our modern world society, even if it's exagerated by a long mile. (BEWARE SPOILERS) [spoiler] The Index Finger and Yan's story is a very good example. They're forced to carry out orders, simplistic or lethal, without questioning anything or else there will be consequences. Many of us have fake goals that come from stereotypes, were pushed down on us by others, or were a product from society's expectations; and we just comply. Some can break the cycle and be happily independent, while others, just like Yan, unfortunately continue on with them and live by ""the will of the city""[/spoiler]

Going back to the gameplay, LoR's weakness come from the luck you must have. Not only do you have to pray so your speed die aren't garbage, you also have to hope that your attack die are better then your enemy's. Fairly enough, you have special pages on each floor which help you with this. BUT THEN you ALSO must pray so that, when you burn books, you get the Key Page and worthwhile combat pages, or else you must go through the encounter AGAIN (sort of like a Gacha). For me, it's only a small nuisance, but for others it can become boring really fast. If you're from L Corp and are used to repeatedly doing the same task, and it gradually getting harder, then this won't be that hard to endure.

Lastly, DO NOT think that the endgame is going to be a breeze. Trust me when I say that the last bosses are going to kick your butt repeatedly. See the almost 200hrs I have on this game? I haven't finished it yet. These bosses are BRUTAL and I'm fucking loving it.

As a closing statement, I must applaud ProjectMoon's dedication to the game. The journey through early acces has, and still is, a wild ride, with lots more content than some AAA games out there. It also has a talented workshop community so you can make your characters look much cooler than they already are.

Some things to note
1. Almost all attacks are RNG based
2. The universe is backed up by some third-party material you can find at this [url=projectmoon.postype.com]link[/url]
3. The story is loosely related to Lobotomy Corporation and if you don't play LC you are missing major parts of the story

Is the game good quality? does it have challenge? Does it have the content to keep me on for a long time? The answer is yes, BUT this game like its predecessor, is incredibly difficult for various reasons. [Warning RNG is the biggest thing]

First off

All moves in the game are a literal dice roll even the speed for who moves first are dice, almost everything is decided by chance. The moves and abilities you gain are from the enemies you beat but THEY'RE version is almost ALWAYS superior to the version YOU gain. For example the power of the move they use will sometimes be absurdly powerful and get the maximum roll consistently. When you gain that same move its power will be decreased and you will almost never see it hit the max, so whats the deal? The player despite getting screwed by RNG so damn hard, surprisingly has the advantage if you are incredibly observant. You have very odd and specific abilities that sometimes don't seem as good as the raw power enemies have in spades but when you learn the mechanics of each floor and dance around the negatives of some abilities you become a god. You (mechanic spoiler) also have the ability to manipulate passives and attribute them all to you're equipment, which if used right can make you unbeatable from raw power or unkillable from tankiness and healing, it has a limit but you're enemies will always have their set of passives which you will see and can prepare for with you're superior collection. Along with the special and odd abilities granted from each floor can make a hard fought loss into a steamroll once you finally have the right idea of what to do.

Second

You WILL lose to a new enemy in the late game almost guaranteed, even when you got the mechanics down, because they will eventually need a specific few tricks to beat and they also bring new mechanics you wont understand at all till it smashes you're teams shit in, you'd think once you have it in you're hands you will be unstoppable but that's far from true. You'll also have to use a different floor and set of passives and moves EVERY TIME in the mid-late game after having you're ass handed to you and finally having the info on what might work. It's a lot of strategy changes to move around what the enemy has and if you dislike having to constantly change the sets you made because they don't work and one stat doesn't fix all, this might not be for you.

An example (mechanic & fight spoiler)

Most of the time you will be looking for a way to overpower you're enemy but some enemies nullify all power changes and you will only have the moves base power when you fight. They're moves base power will be high and you wont be able to keep up with having to use a strong energy cost move every turn, how in the hell are you supposed to keep up? There are some moves you gain mid game that never see use because they literally make you lose power for using them and are just a handicap to waste a slot on. You'll most likely forget these moves ever existed unless someone you asked for help reminds you, they are mid game move for a late game fight most people never realized was the solution and struggled to win with the strongest current stuff. There are a couple of things that might seem weak but then specific strategies will boost them to you're best set and that is whats amazing about the game.

To close it all, the game will make you dance around whatever it throws at you especially at the end but its incredibly satisfying with the difficulty of each fight. If you enjoy such games where the enemy bullshits you but you can bullshit them just as hard then its a fantastic game you should try. However if getting screwed over by the RNG in EVERY move you make and the priority of who moves first, along with a constant power spike in the each new fight isn't you're cup of tea, just watch a play through and save you're money.",1622077337,1622077337,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I'd say longer but my memory only goes back that far. First review of pretty much any game ever but my friends are sick of me saying how awesome this game is so now I'm telling everyone else.

Whats there to break down? 

The GAMEPLAY:
This game is completely different from its pre-cursor, Lobotomy Corporation. I never beaten Lobotomy Corporation, it kicked my ass twice ways from sunday and unfortunately I am not a patient man so I did have to look up some story bits from LC before playing through this game but at its core its a deck-builder & die-roller. Its really subtle at first but as the game goes on, you get stronger cards & each of these cards have their own cute animations and effects. You get stronger versions of your earlier cards but the way you augment the books you take from guests, theres a massive number of ways to play & strategize your librarians. Sometimes you don't even need to win the fights, its simply enough to get another book or two to make yourself strong enough to *win* but its very trialing, but as long as you keep at it, you will win. 


The MUSIC:
Jazzy beats, some really sad songs in there. Each floor has their own unique BGM. Many of the boss battles all have their own unique tracks as well that really help blend the story & the significance of the fight together. My favorite is tied between Malkuth & Kether

The ART:
Did I mention how cards have animations?! 

The WORLD-BUILDING: 
Lobotomy Corp. hinted at a bit of the world here & there but its in LoR that you really see how it comes together. Playing this game has set me on a path that is an obsession with the lore of this world much to the changrance of my friends who cannot understand the fascination. I would describe it as Fallout+Shadowrun+Persona as the closest thing to how it would seem to anyone unfamiliar. I've never seen anything quite like it.

Through the guests, you see small stories play out that really add a spice of flavor to every aspect and element. You'll see how different all the factions are and what kind of people live in this world and despite all the glorious parts, all the ugly parts as well. Civilized yet as every bit savage as nature, its hard to put into words exactly what aspects make this so fascinating to me but I am eagerly looking forward to whatever ProjectMoon puts out in the future.

TL;DR
EVEN if you have zero intention of playing Lobotomy Corp, I suggest watching a video summerization on youtube before playing LoR. But if you are on the fence on whether you want to play this game or not, I say give it a try. You will not be disappointed.",1622055397,1622055397,True,4,0,0.55163043737411499,0,True,False,True

Which is the most amount of time I think I ever spend on a single play through of a game ever (not the most time spend on a game, since I have several MP titles with more hours, but still).

I could go on to descipe the mechanics, but that would take pages. Just know that over these 100 hours they kept introducing new mechanics with almost EVERY, SINGLE, FIGHT. Which is absolutely crazy. Sometimes these mechanics could be more anoying than anything, but those only lasted for one or two fights. Some stuff was seriously hard. You wont win this game if you arent at least decent in cards based games and know how to play the probabilities. It will also take a lot of mental gymnastics to understnad the flow of battle at the start).

But it was so worth it for the lore alone. This game and the previous game, Lobotomy Corporation, managed to build a mental image of a world inside my head without showing that world even once. Each enemy encountered inside the library, each new bit of story, build the world around the libarary even though you dont leave the library even once, only watch short stories of each of the guests you receive. It is crazy how well the world fits considering it was build from the ground up.

It´s also one of those crazy, fantastical worlds that still manage to feel somewhat grounded, which is something eastern companies seem to do better than western ones.

Project Moon once again apply their fantastical worldbuilding (expanding on the tale of The City, a dystopian sci-fi metropolis plagued by the supernatural) to a new genre.

This time it's deckbuilding and turn-based RPG card combat, backed up by an ongoing story, mostly told from a fresh perspective. While you don't need to have played Lobotomy Corporation to start on this, it'll help fill in some of the story blanks. It'll also prepare you for the fractal escalation of complexity.

Library Of Ruina's early game gives you small, almost puzzle-like scenarios. Learn how to level up, leverage your looted cards and counter the melee attack and defense move the enemy plays. Unlike most card battlers, turns play out simultaneously, and (in a concession to the single-player nature) you almost always get to see what your opponent will do this turn, and can formulate a defense. When attack and defense clash, dice are rolled to determine the victor. Simple enough.

By late-game, battles have become five-on-five slobberknockers where each character is often playing four cards per turn. That's up to forty actions going off simultaneously in a single move. And that's just the basics. By that point, the game has introduced several new layers of complexity in new overarching rules that affect both your squad and the enemy, as well as character-building options between fights. It's takes the player to the very limits of mental exhaustion.

I wouldn't have it any other way. It's a wild ride and completely wrings every drop of blood from its concept. Word is, ProjectMoon's next game is going to be a Wizardry-inspired dungeon crawler set in the same universe. My body is ready.",1620198693,1620198693,True,9,0,0.562844455242156982,0,True,False,True

So far there are no English dubs, however the Korean voice actors and the English translations are good so it shouldn't matter.

The story and gameplay very early on is a bit rough, but once ""it starts branching out"" they both get better, and the tutorial as of right now isnt what I'd call good but that could hopefully change before release.

The game gives off the aesthetic of a gacha game and being grindy, but they have reduced much of the *actual* grind since its earlier iterations and now if at all you generally only ever need to replay a reception twice or three times, which go by much faster than your first time through anyways.

The music is overall good and the use of said music is well done. PM hired a particular artist to make some of their songs for this game, so if you knew them before hand you'll get some good songs aswell.

The developers have listened to the community throughout the entire early access period and deserve praise for it, and for also delivering a finished product before the early access even ends.

So basically I was writing a long as heck comment about the negative reviews, what they seemed to be saying and how I disagreed with them but most of it was in the spoiler flair so I just deleted it.  i just kept rewriting this and being eternally unhappy with this so here it is.


The negative reviews are mostly Chinese for some reason, I'm guessing because of something unique to the Chinese side of the fandom. I personally think the game is great, the ending was fine and to be expected, but each to their own opinion.

Some will say that the negative reviews are full of shit and that you shouldn't listen to them. I personally think it's a bit more complicated than that. I think they were genuinely blindsided by the ending and expecting something different. If you already finished the game, read a few of them. I think someone explained why the negative reviewers were so upset on the internet somewhere so look for that. 
but I could also just be stupid so ye

I personally think anyone wanting an honest review score should wait a bit while the reviews sort themselves out. The score is being screwed by people reacting negatively to the ending and people reacting to the negative reviews. 
Spoiler(referencing ending of game):
[spoiler] Just keep in mind achieving an absolutely happy ending for the city was never going to happen [/spoiler]

Summary:
Is game good: Ye
Do I recommend: Ye
What's with the negative reviews: reacting badly to ending
Is Ending good: I think Ye but some in Chinese community think No
Should I get now or at full release: I don't think it matters at this point, it's basically done. Tutorial might be a bit confusing so some might want to wait until it's redone.

The gameplay also is not lacking in any way or form, the way it works is that your Librarians have a deck of cards prebuilt by you, with those cards they fight their enemies and claim their books to burn or progress further into more dfficult stages, by doing that you are able to get some better cards and experiment more with your decks.
And to top it al off, this game got a very good chunk of polish, gorgeus arts, good voice acting and splendid soundtrack done by Mili aas an cherry on the top.

That said, the fact that the game is getting review bombed is *absurd*. Leaving a positive review to show how much this game means to me.

Long version: This game is a sequel to Lobotomy Corperation, and deals with heavy themes of modern life, and what it means to be a person in an oppressive system. Gameplay consists of building a nine card deck, per character, and engaging in, as I mentioned, a card battler. It's a bit complicated and takes awhile to learn the base mechanics- speed dice, five kinds of attack (Three of which harm, and two defend), and it only gets more complicated when more cards and more characters are added.  It can be a bit puzzling at times!

The other part of the gameplay is visual novel style cutscenes-quite lengthy, but very well written. Genuinely had me in tears, sometimes! The writer is excellent, and the translation is broadly very good-there's a few idioms that just don't translate, but generally speaking? The localizers did an astounding job. There is a *lot* of reading in this game, but getting a free novel with my card battler is a positive in my book.

It's one of those games that's ""minutes to learn, years to master,"" but can mostly be understood well even by beginners.

The graphics are fairly unique and quite pleasant to look at. The voice acting, in particular, is an absolute treat to hear. From an overall-presentation standpoint, in general, is great. The story, in particular the setting, is incredibly intriguing! The world the characters is always fun to learn more about.

Ah, but what good is any of that if the game isn't fun? Well, I've got good news! There's fun to be had! While some fights can be a little overwhelming, if you've got a good grasp on the basics, most fights are a treat. In particular, deckbuilding is incredibly fun!

Actual Review starts below:

If I had to describe this game, I'd have to say that this game is you being a ten floor dungeon master keeping out scrubs from grabbing the treasures that lay dormant in your dungeon with a great soundtrack, great strategy, and a pretty good story regardless of what has happened before. Ignore all the haters really.

After dealing with consistently painful painful lobotomizing from Lobotomy Corp. You get slammed in the face with a book from the sequel Library of Ruina. Much like the previous game, you're playing a strategy game where your decisions matter with basically some familiar faces and new ones to boot. 

Unlike it's prequel game however, instead of being a RTS game where you can pause at certain points to decide what to do with horrible horrible abominations to deal with that can blow your face up at any given fucking whim, you are given a more controlled TCG game with quite a few quirks to make things interesting. You start out with just one librarian and a basic deck of pages to beat people up with. As you start clearing out enemies, your arsenal of pages, team, and floors start expanding. Allowing for several compositions of strategy to work around with and that's not all. Some of the abnormalities make a return from the previous game along with new ones to add into the craziness of this game with extra effect pages to help you out as a librarian. 

The story does continue on from after Lobotomy Corp's True Ending, so I highly recommend you play that game first if you wanna make any sense of the game story wise. The atmosphere for this game is absolutely stunning and yet horrifying as well. A pleasant experience really but also grimdark as outlined in the previous game. The music is also impressive and definitely adds into the game with it's mixture of several genres such as jazz, high energy piano, etc. Having Mili sing the opening as well is a plus as well. (At least for me that is.)

Overall, if you like a grimdark strategy TCG styled game with fantastic music, heavy emphasis on strategies, or loved Lobotomy Corp, I'd highly recommend this game.

-Edit-
As for an actual review:
- The game itself is great, Project Moon has been updating the balance and content constantly (Content once a week, patches follow content releases quickly)
- The fights generally require a bit of tactics to go into, as many opponents have traits that give them strong buffs or critical weaknesses under certain conditions
- There is a bit of grinding when it comes to acquiring certain key pages, though it's usually not too bad, though I could just be biased at this point
- The soundtrack for this game is bloody great
- The abnormality fights are interesting takes on their gimmicks or backstory from Lobotomy Corporation (Play it if you haven't, good challenging game)

This is what an Early Access game should be like, starting with a solid baseline set of game mechanics, a fair little bit of content, and a functional UI, then being built upon constantly with input from the community to better the game. All while maintaining good communication with the community about upcoming delays and potential large game balance changes.

Worth full price 100%

It is made clear in the very beginning that the game is supposed to be a LOOSE continuation of the story from lobotomy corp. It is made clear that it is able to be played without prior knowledge of the story, therefore, it isn't locked on rails and there is more freedom, if you are a lobcorp sweat and want everything to be depressed and fucked up all the time, the game isn't for you. 

Most of the negative reviews saying it has a shitty story and ending are the sweats that want it to be a perfect continuation of the story from the previous game, which, as previously stated, was not the purpose of them game, at all. This is noted by the developers multiple times, It's a fun loose sequel with the same characters portrayed differently and with completely different ways of developing. 

The game is not lobcorp, the game is its own story that just so happens to incorporate some story details from lobcorp.

here some points I really enjoyed about the game:
-Fitting and lovely atmosphere and OST through the game which makes you feel comfortable playing it.
-The ability to allow me to costumize decks and passives to my liking and creativity allows me to learn more and improve as the games goes.
-Nothing feels better than creating a lovely character on the new system they used instead of the LC one.

Things I didn't liked:
-People harassing PM about some updates. Come on guys, you are or can be better than that, they tried their best to give us a game with with love for us, harassing and/or threating isn't the way to express your feelings.

WARNING!!! PLAY LOBOTOMY CORP FIRST!!! THIS IS A DIRECT SEQUEL TO LOBOTOMY CORP AND AS SUCH THERE WILL BE SPOILERS!!!

Early Access wouldn't be a red flag if every Early Access game was like Library of Ruina.

It's regularly updated, the devs actually take feedback from their players like an early access game should, and they're usually pretty humble about it. Often more humble than I think they should be with some of the ""criticism"" they get, but y'know.

On the actual game though, it's actually really well-designed. The deck-building mechanics are very solid and the game is really consistent and fair despite having a deck-building and dice-rolling battle system. The game starts you off with a basic set of cards to get you used to the system itself, and slowly introduces mechanics like bleed, paralysis, burn, buffs and debuffs, counters, gun cards that always go first but can be defended with offensive cards and get exhausted (only able to use them once per battle), and a whole other slew of mechanics. It's done in a way that almost any player can acclimate to them and quickly learn.

That's not to say the game is easy though, far from it. It's not brutally difficult, but it does expect you to try and optimize your decks or else you might get turned inside out by an unexpectedly powerful enemy. 

The writing is also really well done. Every encounter you get a glimpse into the lives of the people you're gonna end up killing in your quest to find the perfect book, and it's an absolute lore feast if you were eager to learn more about the world of Lobotomy Corp after playing it. The characters are all interesting in my opinion, not just the head librarians you'll likely be interacting with the most. And some characters return in other stories, as more people hear about the Library and its enticing offers that cause those who accept to disappear.

The art present in the cutscenes before each encounter is so well done and is drawn in a style that is often as hauntingly pretty as it is wonderfully disturbing. The world the writing paints is grimy, dirty, depressing and disturbing and I think the art reflects that feel very well. But the people in the story are still human, and there are moments of levity in the story that can be heartwarming and happy. It's not endlessly depressing, and again I think the art does a good job of showing that as well by not making everything ugly and horrible like some other games I've played that have dark settings.

And the improved translation team definitely is doing a good job. There's basically none of the problems regarding grammar or spelling or poor translation that were present in Lobotomy Corp. The game has voice acting in Korean and I don't know if there is ever gonna be English voice acting, but frankly I don't see this as an issue since the game is Korean translated to English in the first place. This might be an issue for some, but being 100% honest, i'm in the sub over dub camp anyway.

Overall, I think this game is absolutely worth trying if you played Lobotomy Corp first. Especially if you weren't too satisfied with the gameplay of Lobotomy Corp. I'd gladly give this game a 9/10, and will probably update this review as it progresses in early access.",1609250298,1619160540,True,27,0,0.729134440422058105,0,True,False,True

[i]And it's not the game referenced in the quote above.[/i]


Library of Ruina is a 'Library Battle Simulator' where, rather than silence your to-be visitors for being a little too rowdy, you're instead silencing them(And by silencing, I mean a battle to the death.) for the sake of the one ""True"" book so sought after by the director, Angela. Who plenty of folk may recognize as dear Manager X's assistant. Except a little different. The entire game is fair amounts of spoilers as this is technically a sequel to Lobotomy Corp, having expanded on worldbuilding [u]massively[/u].


You, the player, are put into the perspective of a character known as 'Roland', who finds himself in the aforementioned Library and meets Angela. Who, just so luckily, is in need of a patron librarian to begin the Library's function to begin with. And that's where the gameplay comes in.


[h1]GAMEPLAY [b][7/10][/b][/h1]
[b]「Library Battle Simulator」[/b]
[i]Convoluted and yet addicting.[/i]


(Warning: This is the longest segment of the review due to wanting to clear up certain aspects I felt were awfully vague.)


The process begins with the invitation which is sent out in a style that is no different than fishing. Hook, line, and sinker. To cast an invitation out to the right people, you need the right books. So to say, it's a loop of 'invitation>fight>books>loop' as you fight a multitude of characters all of which you can learn the story of through visual novel-esque cutscenes. Which are extremely prevalent in the game. A majority of the story is told through cutscenes that begin and end with every invitation and through another type of battle I'll discuss shortly. In the meanwhile: the combat.


This game is fucking hard. The basic turn based concepts are simple. Each Act is one fight, consisting of a 'floor' or team of Librarians. These Acts are made up of Scenes, or turns, which is where your characters set their moves before acting. All characters have a sort of stamina, mana, energy that is referred to as Light. The base is 3, and a turn begins with rolling initiative. From a marigin like 1~5, when your moves proceed are determined by this speed dice. It is the amount of moves you have, with each speed die able to use one 'page', or card. Each card can have their own effects but, they are made up of offensive dice and defensive dice. And those dice can clash in chronological order(e.g. a 3 dice page and a 2 dice page clash and 1 dice will be uncontested from the former). Then comes damage.


3 types of resistances(Slash, Pierce, Blunt), split up for the two pools, Health and Stagger. Both can be damaged at different rates dependant on resistances. Once Stagger reaches 0, the character becomes unable to act and if Health reaches 0, the character is dead for the act. Simple, right?
 

Where this game gains its difficulty is how these cards scale up hard and the myriads of stat buffs and debuffs that will blow its load all over your fights. As the player, you are expected to oftentimes totally reform your floors in order to counter a certain invitation or battle. The most awful offenders being a secondary semi(NOT)-optional set of fights called Abnormality fights. All call-backs to the prequel game, Lobotomy Corp, these Abnormalities gate certain key aspects for each floor and must have prerequisites cleared before being challenged.


I have a love-hate relationship with these. Some are easy and some are debilitation hard or just plain RNG(I'm looking at you, bastard ratchild cretin hate magical goblin). All of them have some sort of gimmick that you should or MUST play around in order to clear the floor. Once cleared, they provide several rewards in the form of more Librarians for a floor and a set of three special non-standard pages called Abnormality Pages(creative, no?) which do not go into your deck. Instead, they go in a seperate deck that can be used at certain intervals. Each card has different qualities like whether it applies to 1 or all characters and might add whole new mechanics to the character played.


My overall thoughts are quite simple: you're going to spend 4 hours on a single fight at any point in the game and you're going to [b]fucking like it you-[/b]

[b]「Which ""You"" are you going to be?」[/b]
[i]Mili ~ String Theocracy (LoR's Theme)[/i]


The high concept: Cute waifus, handsome guys, jewish symbology, and your dearest Roland who needs his damn Hamhampangpang!


The synopsis: A story about a Library in a no-name City and the events that proceed due to its existence. Librarian's fighting for the purpose of collecting light yet again but this time with a little bit of healthier introspection. A robot with human thoughts and a human with robotic logic. All with a side of never-ending despair that is all too foreseeable.


[⚠️] [b]SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK! [/b][⚠️]


[spoiler]The spoiler included my thoughts on the game, betcha didn't see that coming, did you? Because man I love this game. The story was the strongest note of the game and was held back from being amazing by its sub-par translation. Expanding on the Lobotomy Corp lore in a semi-dystopic future that feels like a gameboard as it hits story notes, playing it almost hysterically straight? Meta. Especially when you consider the different aspects of world building and how it feels so cheesy. And yet how it's played gives it all a very unique feel that makes me want to see the stories of people from that place. And the game gives you exactly that. From the small short-stories in the form of the deceased character's books to the cutscenes that give you reason to care about the people that you're about to see lose all hope and lose a battle not meant to be won. Which with dialogue between Angela and the Patron Librarians, is made increasingly clear to be a repeat of Lobotomy Corp. No matter how you spin it, it is the exact same way that people were sent to death there, reoccurring here.[/spoiler]


[spoiler]Side-characters aren't given enough time to become super memorable but the Patron Librarians and Director make up for that ten fold. Each Librarian retell their stories from being Sephirah and normal researchers and the semi-philosophical introspection gives birth to sympathy for their plights. From Chesed wanting to look for a future that doesn't ignore the past nor present self to Malkuth's straight growth through wanting to be a better person. All characters are given their time to shine and they all quickly endeared to me, especially Roland. He appeared bland at first, but each tid bit of information and character exposition made me want to cheer for his happy ending.[/spoiler]


[spoiler]And well.[/spoiler]


[spoiler]Regardless, the you of the past, the you of now, and the you of the future?[/spoiler]


[spoiler]Which one shall it be?[/spoiler]


Conclusion: Binah has awakened something in me and perpetual agony is only [i]half[/i] of it.

I think the music and art are great. The game has a lot of style, almost Persona 5 level. And the atmosphere of some later bosses is breathtaking. The writing is solid, interesting characters and surprising story beats. The world-building and lore are exceptional.

Regarding gameplay, It's a fresh take on card-based combat, and that alone keeps the first few chapters interesting. Afterward, the game opens up by giving you and your enemies many complex mechanics. The one possible downside is that the fights are a little grueling. Even if you are a bit stronger than the enemy, you often still have to spend 5 minutes per turn constructing a good response, and some of the later bosses can last 20-30 turns. That's not inherently a bad thing, as I enjoy epic boss fights, but it can be pretty tiring to do 10 in a row. But that's a late-late game problem.
