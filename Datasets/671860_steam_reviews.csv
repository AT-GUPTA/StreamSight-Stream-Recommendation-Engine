One of the most polished shooters and games I've played in a long time.

The gunplay feels amazing, learning how to push each gun's potential to it's limits is very fun, classes feel like they actually matter and attachments feel nice and solid.

I also really love the customization of things, somehow it's more satisfying to kill people with my own personalized AK15 while being dripped out.

There are some little things that bother me, like gun attachments not saving when you prestige or DMRs being annoying to fight against, but those are very minor things.

To be honest, I only worry about it being bought by Epic Games, EA or whatever shitty company we have out there... Like what happened with Horizon Chase Turbo or Rocket League. :(

Obviusly this game doesn't look the greatest, but who cares when the gameplay is fun and the voice chat even funnier. One of the problems that i have with newer updates is that they rolled back the voting system to the most picked option wins, instead of having an rng system that would cast a new map and gamemode based on how the players voted.

Considering that this game has been made by 3/4 people and that it only costs 15€, I think that this game is a must if you like battlefield like shooters (despite the game's flaws).

Post 1/DEC/2023 update edit:
Nevermind. The game is getting run to the ground thanks to a braindead community that wants to remove core mechanics of the game to make it more like Battlefield/CoD. The game is good, don't get me wrong, however the community here is getting increasingly dumber by the minute, which wouldn't be a problem, but somehow these ideas get traction an eventually make it in the game.

Some of the community's ideas are:
 - remove sniper
 - remove armours and make them cosmetic
 - remove bleeding
 - add back old, crappy non reworked maps (they are in the game, this just shows community brain rot)
 - make gadgets available to all classes

Some of these ideas already made it in the game, like:
 - remove the Mario Kart like voting system (it added variety instead of having only Namak and Wakistan on Infantry)

At least this shows that the devs listen to the community, however they should draw a line before players start leaving the game (as it's already happening) because a small, loud and salty part of the playerbase is being annoying about stuff on their discord.",1701099080,1708858708,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The audio in this game as of 2/24/2024 is the absolute worst, why the devs thought hearing footsteps from several dozen feet away over the sound of gunshots right beside your ear is amazingly nearsighted and downright questionable, also the rate at which they update this game is amazingly slow now. They say its cause their working on major improvements but that still seems like a ridiculous excuse.

Well, it's changed a lot from launch. It seemed like the Battlefield the players wanted, not what EA execs THOUGHT we wanted.  A mix of old-school BF2 + Bad Company and a touch of 2142.  Old school classes (medic, support, recon, engie). Medic trains like it's BF2. Destructible buildings. Plenty of unlocks. $23AUD and no microtransactions.  Gameplay > Graphics. Yay, right?

However, the game has changed quite a lot. It seems unsure if it wants to be a milsim-lite or a CoD with more frenzied 127v127 servers.

-Everyone gets bandages (not just medic); at this point may as well just regen health
-Map voting changed= Enjoy playing the same map 24/7
-Community servers suck = the 2 in your region may be no grenades or no sniper - enjoy being forced to play the way others want you to. Plus, even more repetition.
-Audio is bad and if anything has got worse

-SMG+medic has remained OP for ages. No point having armour when you can just sprint 50kph, spin midair and laser folk from 100m with a SMG... 
-Assault is just worse medic; support class has 2-3 weapons in ~100 levels and is unattractive.
-Sniper has spotlight scope glint and trails added, forcing longer ranged camping at expense of mid range sniping

^Basically, class balance is bad and feels like devs either have their own favoured playstyle/ or listen only to a small circle of folks/echo chamber.

The focus seems on skins and charms rather than fixing issues and OP weapons.The game is a weird mix of too slow AND too fast gameplay.

It seems to be having an identity crisis - what sort of gameplay do they want? ...Battlebit seems to be making big changes that should have been decided BEFORE release: players are having the game changed from under them.

The game has changed a LOT since launch and in 6 months will probably be unrecognisable.

This game is fun but kinda hard to master just because of how fast people can master the controls and the fact some players come from other games like battlefield and just go pro in mediocre skilled matches. 

  The weapon balancing needs a little bit of tweaking because some powerfull weapons are kinda usless when players mostly go for ""spray and pray"" guns but adding something like a drum magazine shotgun with some slow full auto would be fine and go great in the assault and engineer classes. 
Shotguns would be a good adition but I also know they'd be hard to code in and do some game balancing on them.

Started as a 3 man project which is respectable, however, they failed to scale the development process with the money they made. Development has screeched to a standstill despite obviously under planned features and the death of the community at large as a direct result. The building system is clunky, poorly implemented and lacks key indicators such as how many of what structure can you build. (there is a limit per item)
Don't even think about using a flight stick in this game, the default dead zone is massive and cannot be adjusted in game. I use my stick in 2 other games with no issue.

:The Community:
The overwhelming majority of players are amazing people and groups that I loved playing with. 
:ADDITION 2/23/24:

First, BattleBit has a severe identity crisis wherein it doesn't know what it wants its gameplay to be like. Slow? Tactical? Fast? Arcadey? Who knows! There's such a jumble of features that it's really hard to tell what the devs had in mind. 

TTK is horrendously inconsistent to the point where it will make you question your sanity. I just left a game after I had put FOUR rounds into an enemy, which did NOTHING except break his armor. He then placed two rounds into me, and I was dead. Who playtests this and thinks ""yeah, this is fair and balanced""? It's jarring to die in 1-2 shots only to then see 6-7 hitmarkers when shooting at a single enemy, and makes it feel as though everything is up to RNG.
Speaking of armor: for the love of all that is holy STOP PUTTING ARMOR SYSTEMS IN YOUR FPS GAMES. PLEASE. It's all so tiresome. I blame WarZone for this.

Maps feel as though they were hastily outlined in Microsoft Paint before being fully implemented into the game. There's no flow, no direction, and of course, hundreds of spots where you can be sniped/mowed-down from. They tried rectifying this by blocking off windows, but all that did was make maneuvering around a major pain in the ass. 

The proximity voice chat was a fun gimmick for all of about 10 minutes before it started being used by rancid roundfaced redditors to blast their shitty music and repeatedly yell ""Allahu Akbar"" whenever using the suicide vest (pinnacle of humor). I played during a few of the playtests and it honestly felt as though the proximity chat then was being used for a greater purpose, whereas now it just seems like something you can, and maybe should, ignore.

Reloading takes far too long with some weapons. Even emergency reloads feel sluggish and slow despite being, well, emergency reloads. There's zero sense of urgency with your character and it feels more like he's switching mags as he chronos his gun at an airsoft field. Considering just how fast players can move, it really exposes how janky the game feels.

Sound design is still incredibly lacking, even during intense firefights and battles. In some matches, I noticed that anything further than 30 meters away from me sounded as though it was submerged underwater. 

To further reinforce the fact that this game doesn't know what it wants to be, the devs added in squad types, which include recon, tactical, default and vehicle. I think it's perfect because it resembles just how much of a Frankenstein this game is, with all of these separate parts crudely stitched together to form... something. 

Shotguns are nowhere to be seen, and apparently this is due to one of the developer's refusal to even consider adding them in. It's pretty funny considering how much they appeal to other toxic playstyles, but see shotguns as a no-go. 

BattleBit had enormous potential when it first released, but I think much of it has been pissed away, and now it's just floating on by. Never really killed Battlefield, but sure did expose a lot of its flaws, so there's a plus.",1693177958,1708667500,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a player, I find BattleBit Remastered to be a delightful blend of nostalgia and innovation. It’s a multiplayer shooter that values large-scale battles over cutting-edge graphics. The game takes me back to the glory days of Battlefield, but with a unique twist - everything is made out of blocks. This Minecraft-like world adds a new dimension to the gameplay, making it unpredictable and exciting.

The game is still in early access and could use some fine-tuning. However, the 127vs127-player skirmishes are a sight to behold, especially with the destructible environments. It’s like being in the middle of a Transformers movie, with everything exploding around you. Plus, there are no microtransactions, and it doesn’t feel like a grind to get the coolest gear.

One thing I appreciate is the class balance and the open-ended map design. It allows for a lot of tactical play and keeps the matches interesting. However, the lack of a single-player campaign or a simple Deathmatch mode might be a downside for some players. The primary mode, Conquest, works well, but it would be nice to have more options.

The graphics are simple, but this allows for smooth performance even in large battles. Each of the 19 maps is geographically diverse, offering a variety of scenarios for strategic play. The destructible buildings add an extra layer of strategy, as you can literally reshape the battlefield.

In conclusion, BattleBit Remastered is a promising game that offers a lot of fun and chaos. It’s not perfect, but it’s definitely worth checking out if you’re a fan of large-scale multiplayer shooters",1708625897,1708625897,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

GAMEPLAY:
1. Why can't I respawn on a squad member?! He doesn't exchange fire with anyone for more than 10 seconds, but the game considers he's in a combat. In 90% of cases, it's easier to respawn at the base and run to the point than to wait until the game allows you to respawn on a squad member...

INTERFACE:
1. The interface looks very outdated, as if I entered the game in 2005.

GRAPHICS:
I will not scold the game for pixels, I played Unturned a lot, but ...
1. Characters. I think they should be more detailed. They look much worse than the environment and weapons.

also development has slowed down, the content is dogwater from the lack of diversity, no way of playing custom matches with friends (if those are still a thing), and then the dwindling playerbase (at least where I live) makes this game not enjoyable anymore. Even the proximity chat that this game has is particularly useless with barely anyone using it or just using it to earrape you with their bad music/meme taste. 

after ~400 hours on this game, I still do believe it's very good; no battle pass, microtransactions, over the top cosmetics that are as useless as they look (save for the gun skins, at least most of them are unlockable), or some pay2win bs that is in almost any modern multiplayer shooter. On top of that the gameplay is actually more focused towards the gunplay and not just slide cancelling every chance you get. But with the stuff I mentioned and how this game is just not fun to play casually anymore without it getting ruined by the more sweatier playerbase then it's safe to say that it was fun while it lasted.

You cannot use any classes unless you join a Squad, This come's with a range of issues, I predominantly play sniper so the one I run into is where I get into a good position, enemy can't find me and a squad mate spawns on me and exposes the position.

Official servers are almost non-existent, Meaning you must play on community servers, I prefer 64x64 since the large pop tends to be too chaotic for me, However the only servers available are No snipers or without hitmarkers.

First of all, the game itself is good, maybe a bit expensive, but it is fine. Runs fine, haven't run into any major bugs or things.
The player tho, cant really say much, I played the 256 player server for about 3 hours now, only one squad mate talks about how to push and defend. Most of the time it just like a bunch of people running from point to point, and no one put choose the squad leader load out and put down squad rally point.
Kind of like the Squad had, before the game exploded, the core is still about the squad and communication, but after a lot of new player joined who does not  listen or talk, the game kind of went dead for me.
Maybe it is a me problem where I don't have many friends to play with, causing me to not really have much fun in the game. 
BTW, toxicity is still a thing. There are just too many player in one game, meaning you can always run into one that does not brush their mouths nor have a decent family to begin with. I really feel bad for them for having to let out their toxicity online instead of finding someone to talk about their mental status.
To wrap it up, while the game shows great promise, the lack of teamwork, poor communication, and prevalent toxicity among players held it back for me. Thus the negative review, tho I kind of feel bad for the developer, but this game try to be everything at once, and I am happy that they really tried, but I think there is still a long way to go, such as making a player preference so that people that want to cooperate with each other can get into one squad, and those who just want to rush and kill can just enjoy themselves or help in a big push.
But in the end, this is just my thoughts, you knowledge may very a lot.

PS. almost forgot the grind! If you have a life, do not think about unlocking any good attachment or new guns for just hours of game play. You need to really grind for it.

//update from 2024/02/21
it has been a while, and the game is now kind of at a stable state of around 3000 player, which is no surprise to me, lower than the number of Squad or Call of Duty even lower than BF 2042 which is the game said it would take over. The player count is just low, not to say that you wont get a full server, it is just kind of said that this game's true normal state is like this.
But the community is a lot better now and nowadays there is a lot less people cursing on the server. And the grind for new weapon has been shortened. Thus the reason why I now recommend you to buy this game.

Maybe just like Palworld, this is sort of the game that blows up and than just settle down into a not-that-popular game. 
I can see there is more this kind of things happen in the future, and if you are fine with just a game that you occasionally logs on and play for a bit, this game is fine, and you should consider it.

Now for my Chinese friends:
我曾考虑给它一个好评，但问题并不在游戏本身，而在于玩家。
首先，游戏本身很好，可能有点贵，但还好。运行正常，没有遇到任何重大错误或问题。
然而，玩家方面就不好说了。我在256人服务器上玩了大约3个小时，只有一个队友会讨论如何进攻和防守。大部分时间就像一群人从一个点跑到另一个点，没有人选择队长配置并设立队伍集结点。
有点像游戏在爆发前的《战术小队》一样，核心仍然是关于小队和沟通，但是随着许多不听不说话的新玩家加入，这款游戏对我来说变得无聊了。
也许这是我的问题，因为我没有很多朋友一起玩，所以在游戏中没有太多乐趣。
顺便说一句，毒性问题仍然存在。一个游戏中有太多玩家，意味着你总会遇到那种不洗嘴巴、没有良好家庭背景的人。我真为他们感到难过，他们不得不在网上释放自己的毒性情绪，而不是找人倾诉他们的心理状态。
总之，虽然这款游戏展现出很大的潜力，但缺乏团队合作、沟通不畅和玩家之间普遍存在的毒性问题让我失望。因此，这是一个负面评价，尽管我对开发者有点愧疚，但这款游戏试图一次性满足所有需求，我很高兴他们真的尽力了，但我认为还有很长的路要走，比如制定玩家偏好，让那些想要相互合作的人能够进入同一个小队，而那些只想冲杀的人可以自己尽情享受或在大规模进攻中提供帮助。
但最后，这只是我的想法，你的观点可能会有很大不同。


补充一点，我差点忘记了这个问题！如果你有生活，千万别指望通过几个小时的游戏来解锁好的配件或新的武器。你需要非常努力去刷。",1686947261,1708570396,True,0,0,0.231320783495903015,0,True,False,True

Here are my biggest complaints:
-Weird interface things that make navigating menus frustrating and confusing
-Repetitive Gameplay
-Skill/progression gap

Regarding the interface, I find it frustrating that you can't customize your loadout unless you're in an active game. I don't understand how this game has been out so long and not made this possible. When you are in-game customizing your soldier, I find the menu confusing to navigate. I also don't like this new squad sorting feature they have added. Like other menus, I just found it confusing to understand and navigate at first. I joined a couple of games to find a bunch of tiny fragmented squads or I don't think many people really utilize it.

I think the repetitive gameplay and skill gap kind of go hand in hand for me. It's really hard to participate in the action without getting laser beamed by a really good player that has a better gun that I can't use because it's locked behind progression that I am far from unlocking. I just don't find this game very rewarding.

I am used to this kind of progression as I sank a lot of time into Battlefield 3 and 4, but for some reason this game just doesn't quite feel as good. However, battlebit is a lot better than current Battlefield offerings.",1708556751,1708556975,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

1. The bleed mechanic is bad imho, I get that some people like it but at least make an experimental mode without bleed literally if you are not playing medic half of the time its fight -> bleed -> heal ( takes like 2-3 seconds and you have to do it multiple times ) and repeat.
2. A lot of good maps but some bad also
3. There are some elements that need adjustment like RPG has no counterplay, just a missile in a straight line that one hit kills
4. Apart from the medic class and assault if you like faster gameplay ( although the bleed mechanic will slow you every fight ) there is no reason to pick any other class, they feel inferior and their perks are not that strong

Edit: After some more hours

1. Bleed mechanic is still bad
2. Maps are okay but I dont enjoy them anymore, especially on 127 v 127 people are coming from anywhere

You have spent an hour and a half of your life desperately clinging to the momentary cling of that head shot, only to have that dopamine hit immediately replaced with anger when you get killed by unreasonable odds.

You have spent an hour and a half of your life  realising which one has the most hackers or COD baby try-hards, and switch to the team just so it isn't your tenth loss in a row.

You have spent an hour and a half of your life wishing every waking moment, bargaining with devils and pleading to gods that don't exist that everyone around you would DROP DEAD so you could desecrate their corpse and eat it out of sheer spite.

You have spent an hour and a half of your life being miserable, angry, irritated and wishing unimaginable evil on someone who doesn't know your existence, nor cares to.

-----------------------
I started playing this game during the beta test and bought it on day one. At the time of the game's launch, when it was popular, it was really fun and exciting. But now it has become frustrating and boring. 

First of all, the game has seen improvements to some mechanics, classes, weapons, skins and some maps. However, I don't think the vision the developers have for a semi-mil-sim game will ever work with what they currently have and the player base the game has brought in.

I apologise for my poor structuring, but I will try to explain:
* My understanding is that the developers want a semi-mil sim game that encourages teamwork and tactical gameplay. However, at this point both of these things are completely unnecessary to play the game. The whole game can be played by just running around the map and trying to get kills. You can do this because the movement is really fast, you can jump around, duck to avoid being shot, run around quickly and kill your opponent. There is no tactical gameplay, it is all about avoiding being shot in order to kill someone. The closest you get to teamwork is with the sniper squad, who usually camp together (which is also a separate problem). The best way I can sum up the gameplay is sweaty COD or BF4 metro lobbies. At the moment there are no tactical-only servers or anything, so this game is pure arcade, I can't see it becoming tactical any time soon.

Also the maps are not that good, they are too small, too big or have other problems. They are often too objective-oriented, to the point where certain objectives are just chaotic. The vehicles in the game also are terrible, the handling is awful, the mini-guns suck, etc. Audio is also a massive issue in the game right now, (it's bad). Playerbase is also kinda toxic.

I could go on nitpicking, but I don't want to write too much.

I understand that the game has like 3 devs, but the game is dying and has no clear vision that corresponds with the player base. I will check out the game in the future if the player base is not completely dead by then. Can't recommend buying the game if you are short on cash.

[list][*][b]Spawning[/b] - Being able to spawn on any member of a squad turns even loosely clumped squads into a massive rat hunt. Unless you want to be killed by the same few squaddies spawning on one another repeatedly (with a very low cooldown and very generous in-combat detection), you need to pressure and hunt down squads relentlessly and fully wipe them. It also tends to trivialize the need to transport players to objectives in favor of spawn-in-shoot-guy-dead-spawn gameplay loop.
[*][b]Balance and Customization[/b] - Customiziation is annoying and clunky, and prestiging resets all of it because you have to unlock all of your weapons and armors again (but keep everything else, for some reason). This makes different loadouts an excessive amount of micromanagement. Attachments for weapons generally fall into ""whichever one gives you the least recoil"". Few of the other stats seem to matter for vast majority of weapons. Lots of attachments like larger magazines do counter-intuitive things like negatively affecting all of your gun's stats (including recoil, even though a heavier magazine would probably make recoil less apparent) which means unless its on a sniper rifle they're almost always flatly worse to take. For having 20-30 attachments per gun, majority of them are recycled and majority of them are not typically useful.
[*][b]General Gameplay[/b] - It hits the battlefield itch and the scale helps make things feel alive, but there's a lot of nagging issues with some areas of the gameplay. Dropping magazines when reloading, for instance, is only slightly faster and there's no way to get more magazines outside of respawning if you don't pick it up. Schizophrenic movement patterns to evade fire are extremely common, like sprinting and jumping wildly or constantly leaning left and right which still seems to be a valid strategy depsite nerfs. ""Mil-sim"" features like freelook are included even though freelooking is largely useless due to the game's TTK being so obscenely low that any lapse of focus usually gets you killed. Supplying ammo in the field with support is largely useless as most players don't survive long enough to need it, there's no way to get more ammo to supply outside of respawning or going back to your main base (functionally respawning, and slower), and it doesn't provide very many points. Classes outside Medic, Engineer, and Recon (assault and support) largely have no niche.
[*][b]Vehicles[/b] - Vehicles feel pretty lifeless. There's a grand total of about 8 (larger transport helicopter, smaller transport helicopter, big boat, little boat, tiny boat, IFV, Tank, and a jeep, sometimes with a gun). Factional differences are entirely cosmetic and the vehicles largely don't stand apart from one another and functionally they are identical. Aircraft can get instantly disabled by getting grazed in the tail rotor, yet for some reason the Blackhawk/KA-60 can take FIVE hits from a standard RPG-7 HEAT before getting destroyed, if its not being repaired from inside. Vehicle weapons range from laser beam (7M .50 cal turrets on jeeps) to super soaker (Transport helicopter miniguns are famously almost impossible to kill anyone with despite their volume of fire, and to boot take 5-6 hits to kill someone). There's no way to resupply lighter vehicles in the field (50 cals being resupplied by supports or drops would be cool), so light vehicles often get abandoned as soon as they are out of ammo and transporting people with them outside of accidentally doing so is worthless.
[*][b]Gamemodes[/b] - Conquest is the only real gamemode I play because the other gamemodes kind of suck. To boot, a lot of official servers force gamemodes to rotate (and the developers even made community servers force gamemode rotation until the shouting was loud enough to let it be turned off). Invasion's three-objectives-unlimited-attackers ends up in a mosh pit at each point until they eventually get overwhelmed and the allowed map area is too narrow to allow interesting flanks, on top of the timer being set to 15 minutes for each group of 3-5 objectives leading to matches that drag on excessively. Frontline has less of an issue of this since it is back-and-forth. A lot of gamemodes like 8v8 aren't really even worth mentioning. Infantry conquest is fun if the light vehicles were more reliable and less useless.
[*][b]Snipers[/b] - Snipers behind every rock, corner, every side of the map, and if you kill them once from a distance they'll reappear on another nearby sniper. They'll set up a spawn beacon back there and they can call down as many bigass boxes of supplies down as they want which even with a full squad defending a point I have never used entirely. No suppression mechanics means shooting at them without intent to kill is useless as they'll just blow your head off. Zeroing is easy and getting a rangefinder is trivial. Lots of maps have chronic sniper issues or sniper areas, usually assymetrically favoring one team over the other, often letting those snipers sit inside their base borders simply requiring someone to occupy all of their time by countersniping. Thankfully at least the game lets you build cheap sandbags to ignore most snipers from a specific angle.
[*][b]Consistent, nagging lack of polish[/b] - This is hard to nail down into one thing, but there are many small things that bother me that give of the vibe of the game being largely unfinished and developers largely overtaxed or doing other things. Menus feel clunky and frustrating to navigate. Unexpected bugs like your screen staying black if you get revived right when you try to give up and respawn. The server browser is rather awkward to use. No queueing for a server solo, but apparently you can if you're in a party. Aforementioned menu clunkiness extending to the entire lackluster loadouts system making me give up on anything but the bare essentials. All in all its a frustrating end user experience.[/list]

The combat is very intense and usually rewards the better player. Stuff like red dots/holos, sights, laser, night vision are made in a quite realistic way, it's so good and responsive/interactive you forget it's a boxy game. Also there is no pay to win, you unlock more weapons and loadout options as you play (level up and get kills on weapons), so it's a fair system. Skins are unlocked by doing kills on weapons and leveling up ""prestige"" which resets your level to 1, so you have to go through lower lvl weapons again, so it's again quite fair, gives you an opportunity to properly try out every weapon. Different weapon classes are indeed working completely differently, so you can choose between various playstyles. 

However game still needs some work, gameplay pacing seems off and frontlines are getting messy, maybe movement is a bit too fast or it's too easy to spawn on allies in your squad, so people just tend to go straight to nearest enemy spawnpoint and fighting seems to be all over the place quite often. Also when leveling up prestige, game should remember my loadout on each weapon and not reset it! Same with in-game options, game should remember them, I don't want to rebind my keys again after each reinstall. And I hate snipers, man…

People are often very nice and fun to play with, and screaming things like ""my leg!"" through proximity chat when you get shot is just the icing on the cake. There's so much flexibility in the way you can play the game, it's pretty easy to do a little bit of everything. Great for playing seriously, casually, or just dicking around.

It seems like the devs are making changes most of the playerbase doesn't really like, and seeing the player count this low due to that (among other factors, such as the initial hype dying off) breaks my heart. Yeah, SMGs are kinda broken, balance is a bit wack, but I love the game a lot and I wish there were more people on to play with. I'm hyped for the next update too, and hopefully the game will see a spike in new folks on when it comes out. You can still definitely get a full 127v127 lobby here in the US pretty easily, but I'd still really like to see more players because it's teetering on the edge of death and it's a great game that I don't feel like putting down anytime soon.

If you see this and you're looking to buy the game, do it! Despite the ""low player count"" I've been talking about it's still very much active and you can find lobbies fast.

A game that brought back the appeal of the Battlefield franchise. The community was lovely. The gameplay was fun and adaptable, and the future for this game looked bright.

But over time, things began to unravel. I think it all started when players started complaining about snipers killing them from a long distance away and being difficult to spot. You know, the very things a sniper is supposed to do?

So what did the devs do? Did they properly assess the balancing and look for fun creative ways to balance things out? No! They nerfed the snipers like no tomorrow. Suddenly, mid range scopes were giving off glint giving away their position, and then smoke trails were added to sniper bullets, ensuring that no matter what a sniper did, they would always be spotted and gunned down.

Meanwhile, running around with an SMG like a headless chicken with no regard for your team, vehicles or anything for that matter became the only viable way to play and the devs did nothing about it. Suddenly the game became appealing only to sweaty COD players and the community turned more and more toxic.

But the last straw for me was when they took a perfectly good map with different areas that appealed to different playstyles (Basra) and completely remade it into what can only be described as a cluttered mess that looks like an eight year old just randomly threw terrain and buildings around haphazardly with no regard for level design.
Of course the worst map in the game which severely limited player movement got you constantly pinned by bullets and grenades and had little to no destructible elements in its environment (Namak) remained exactly as it was.

It's a damn shame. This game had everything great going for it, but the developers destroyed it bit by bit by catering solely to the worst members of the community.

Now the game is a hollow shell of what it once was and is no better than the titles it once outshone.",1708103206,1708103206,False,43,0,0.726032853126525879,7,True,False,True

Don't let the graphics dissuade you, this game is incredible. I can't say enough good things about it. Thousands of potential hours of gameplay from a $15 game. The community is light hearted, the gameplay is challenging but actually fun. Solid buy, 1000% recommend. If you miss ""old"" Battlefield, this is the game for you.

EDIT: After a bit more time in the game, there are a few glaring flaws - No choppers/vehicles in the training area - Choppers are a commodity in live servers, they only respawn every few minutes and the amount of times you get pilots that either troll and crash them, don't know how to fly and crash them in the spawn and kill 3-12 players, or do not put down the ""rope"" which is required for you to exit the chopper without dying if it hasn't landed.

The rope feature is a cool thought, but a game of this scale with this type of gameplay relies on people having the knowledge to know they need to put down the rope for players to exit the chopper and also have the knowledge to know they need to fly low enough to allow players on the rope to dismount safely from the rope.

This leads me to my next gripe - no parachutes. Battlefield has them and they work well. It seems Battlebit tries very hard to stick to it's milsim roots by refusing to add features that benefit individual players over forcing them to rely on teamwork. Relying on your pilot for the rope and knowledge to both not put you down in the middle of the enemy team while you are danging on the rope or to just never put the rope down at all until you either jump out and die thinking the rope is down and not paying attention, jump out and die because you know the rope isn't down but have to respawn because the pilot is just flying you around aimlessly, or hitting the respawn button and wasting tickets on the pause menu because you can't play the game while flying around in a chopper passenger seat.

Parachutes change the dynamic and allow players to both save themselves from inept pilots and to stop relying on the terrible rope mechanic to be put down into the battlefield.

My main gripe is that they don't have choppers in the training area for players to mess around with and learn to fly properly. Players HAVE to join live servers with real players and engage in a trial by fire, that typically ends in a blackhawk full up at the beginning of the game crashing 100 meters outside of the spawn area, killing 12+ people because the person has no idea how to fly, the players can't leave the chopper because the rope isn't down because the pilot has no idea what the rope even is, then your team has no counter to the enemy team's choppers and cannot drop players onto objectives further out in the map or behind enemies because an inept pilot crashed your chopper and your team now has to wait 1/4 of the game for the chopper to respawn.

My last gripe, which is actually a big one as well is that some maps only have a single chopper or no transport choppers. Azaghor relies on your team to capture a specific objective in order for your team to get a helicopter, so one team has a chopper and the other has nothing which is a huge advantage with a skilled pilot. Azaghor already is relatively unbalanced, with the team on the East side of the map being severely disadvantaged due to the map's design. Once the Western team captures the point for the chopper and the Eastern team gets pushed back, it's a slow roll to a spawn camping hellscape that just makes you want to leave the server and find another that isn't playing that map - again, if the devs added a chopper on both teams, there would be a way for the players to leave their spawn and get to objectives that are further away to free up the spawn camping and get back into a more level playing field, but instead, the game just carries on into a spawncamp from the enemy team and everyone just spawns as a recon and snipers from inside the base. 

Frugis has the same problem, where whichever team captures G, gets a transport chopper. It's all well and good, but it means one side has a MASSIVE advantage over the other. A 12-seat transport chopper with guns that will not respawn until it's brought down which is very difficult on Frugis because of the map design and RPG mechanics with most being too low of damage or too slow. On a map like Frugis, two 8 seat little birds would be far better than a single blackhawk that gives one team a massive advantage.

There are a few maps where some of the vehicle choices don't make sense. Rather than transport choppers on Salhan for Infantry Conquest, you get two armed little birds, one on each time, rather than two passenger little birds, which would make moving around the map and keeping the game interesting easier. Instead, you just get two choppers that fly around the map basically doing nothing, maybe transporting 1-2 players the entire game while they get a few kills until they're blown up and 3-4 minutes later, the chopper spawns again. Having a passenger little bird/8 seat little bird would be preferable on this map, because many times both sides push the enemies back to the spawn and start spawn camping. Salhan is much more balanced, with multiple ways to sneak across the map on the ground, but I think the experience would be better and the round would be more fun with the ability to drop squads on far objectives and capture behind the enemy while they spawn camp.

Again, there's a lot of small nitpicks with some of the design choices. Some maps, such as Basra were changed/updated for seemingly no reason. New Basra is terrible compared to the old version. It seems rather than make new maps for people to play on, the devs insist on changing/completely overhauling maps that people like and making the old versions impossible to play. I sincerely wish they'd leave certain maps in rotation and just add the ""new versions"" as different maps.

Another point is the voting - at the end of each game, you vote on what you want to play. Rather than it going with what is most selected, it gives each map a percentage chance to be chosen. This is both a blessing and a curse - in some cases, the most overplayed maps like Wakistan, Frugis, etc are skipped for other maps and in other cases, the entire server could vote for a certain map, and then a map like Lonovo night with 2 votes would win out and everyone leaves the server because of it. I and many others would prefer another system where the ""most selected"" maps are only available every other game or two and ""least selected"" maps, were available every other game or two to balance the choices.

My last point would be for the devs to please stop listening to streamers and reddit communities for changes, as these groups are very small minorities of the playerbase who's playstyle/meta is not what most people who play the game want. They need to have polling on the main title screen of the game that allows players to vote on what they do/do not like for future/current changes and the devs should take the input, but never act on changes solely because players ""ask for it"". Devs know the design better than most players and some choices they've rolled back such as chopper XP, adding glint to 4x scopes and under, are regressive and progressive.

The games population has been steadily decreasing and sadly this is one of the best shooters available right now. If the devs could listen to more than just a few minority groups on changes and map design by allowing other players a voice via in-game polling, it could drastically help improve the game and help by deterring them from making decisions the community will overwhelmingly dislike.",1690524979,1708102534,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Especially with servers hosting up to 126 players per team! from my experience the learning curve isn't super steep :D unlocking camos/other content isn't very grindy and can be pretty rewarding. as a fellow colourblind player there is plenty of support for UI/HUD and menu colours to help keep track of the battle ahead.

My only criticisms would really be more anti-cheat, its not really a huge issue for me personally however that's a common complaint from the community. a more nit-picky detail is that id like to have the ability to rotate my character while i customise as its hard to see the side profile.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 fucking minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",1707938304,1707938304,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

i've played a good bit of battlefield over the course of my life, they were fun, this is much better
but the game i've played the most is rainbow six siege, and i do see a lot of similarities between these too, but especially considering where siege is right now, this game is SO much better oh my god

only negative is that they are wanting to replace EAC with FaceIT, this would remove Linux support, which wouldn't affect most people or even really a few people, it would sadly only affect a very small amount of players, around 1-2%, they likely will go through with the change since there is no real reason to switch over to an anti-cheat that supports linux, though EAC really is one of the only ones

unbalanced weapons (balance team smoked crack)
lots of campers (They sit in a Wheelchair IRL)
garbage maps (Larry also smoked crack)
your team will only consist of snipers (Idk what to say anymore)

Edit: Boring as Hell game (only slightly funny with friends for like.. half a round), used to be fun and fast at the beginning but devs couldn't comprehend the hype and slaughtered it pretty much. Its slow and repetitive (while i write this, i automatically joined the 20th Round of Outskirts), but hey.. if this was their goal then this was a success!
3/10 would not recommend. Not worth the money! I would rather spend it on ""The Day Before""

Edit: Sgt.Cantmakesolidgames and the other devs hit the nail in the coffin with this update.. New Mode: Invasion, probably the worst decision of humankind. Only fat sniper virgins left (majority of players) voting Outskirts Invasion 24/7. Since their fat T-Rex hands are only good for Masturbation, this map and mode is the only hope to score some kind of seratonin in their sad lives. Changed the Rating from 3/10 to 1/10.. I wish i could tick the ""recieved this product for free"" box but i wasted my own money on this. Don't make the same mistake.

Edit Edit: Big Clans started to spam report good players on the opposing team. This is THE MOST TOXIC community a game has to offer.

Keep in mind this game was developed by 3 people if I'm right, but the point is the dev team is tiny and independent. They used to have a lot of public servers but after the initial hype the player count dipped a bit. So the dev team to cut costs cut a lot public servers. For the U.S. for example usually only has 4 public servers even during peak hours. This causes a huge issue during peak hours because the public servers are always flooded and there often no servers with any room from 6pm - 9pm. I want to say this is the perfect game but since its unplayable half the time when I have time it's not enjoyable anymore. They added custom private servers but this really didn't much to solve the issue. Private servers rarely are active unless it's the weekend, and when they are active they have toxic admins (TBG I'm callin you out). Admins will often kick you when the server is full so they can invite their friend. I really really wanted to leave a positive review for this game, but I can't.

Steam REALLY needs a 'meh' or middle option because there's times I do say 'hell yes' to this game,and other times where I go 'hell no' to it.

MOST of the issues relate to the community,and few relate to the game itself or the mechanics.

Pros:
Weapon customization is pretty good. It's not Tarkov good. But it's good enough.
Classes
Big maps with big battles
Easy on performance,easy on the eyes,runs well.
Destructible enviroments

Cons
Sniper firing squads being too common on the big selling point(127-127 battles) and sniping being so laughably easy.
Ketamine SMG users this one is minor. You can generally get around this one fairly easy compared to the snipers being everywhere.
Weapon customizations don't mean much as you generally run the same attachements for most guns. It kind of sucks because there's clear BIS options for many guns.
Vehicles are fairly weak. Tanks don't last long.
C4 spam due to C4 being on every class.
Recon drone largely useless. It's more useful as a self destruct drone with mines or C4 attached.
Spotting is largely useless.
Not enough vehicle variety
Some of the support pack skins are largely phoned in(this is subjective and to taste)
Twitch drop skins are really cool,but no alternative way to earn them.

Onto the really bad.

Sniping isn't skillful. Play other classes until you get the rank required for the M200/L96(SV98 is also good),so that means play Medic,or Support and heal/resupply.  The community can whine,cry,stomp it's feet all it wants,but if sniping was underpowered,you wouldn't see so many snipers. You'd see the twitch ketamine fueled mobility abuse medics/assaults. 

Why do I say that? The M200 is a laser. Ranging? Not needed. Long suppressor? You can one shot easily,and every bolt can two shot. It's insanely easy to hit headshots even at 1km+ due to this. 

This means,in my opinion,the best servers are the ones that restrict the amount of snipers. This too,is an issue that's plagued many other games like Battlefield. However, Battlefield does not have snipers that have 1400ms velocity rifles.

What does this mean? There's an extremely low skill ceiling to sniping,especially once you unlock the M200/L96. While yes,the skill floor is slightly higher than the other classes,the ceiling remains much lower.

Maps fuel this problem by having so many areas that don't have adequate cover. And inb4 snipers come here crying that sniping was nerfed,DMRs got buffed and most weapons suck at range due to the attachment changes(barring other snipers,and 3ish shots from a DMR at range) snipers got away largely scott free,even factoring in the scope glint and shot trails. 

Glint does not matter. Use a 4X optic and you will not have glint problems. The sniper rifles have such good velocity(With the slowest being around 900-990ms if I recall) that you don't need a 40x optic. Vapor shot trails do not matter because if you're properly sniping,you're hitting and downing one or two targets and moving to reposition.

Now onto the SMG drop shot ketamine players.

You'll see those a lot. Not a whole lot you can do other than be ready to aim down. These are a lot more tolerable than getting plinked every time you walk out of cover/near windows. But if you learn how to aim down,these guys are pretty managable. It's when you get 30 of them at once it gets a bit crazy,but since you can get C4 on every class,start hucking C4 like it's going out of style. 


So what does this mean to you,oh prospective new player? Unlock smokes as fast as you can. If you're forced to traverse one of the many open lanes,throw smoke,and be ready to duck for cover to bandage because you will be doing that A LOT on the 127 servers.  And be ready to learn how the RPG works so  you can knock down any tall structures you find.

The vehicles GREATLY need help. You can break a tailrotor with around two to four shots from an APC. The APC makes a better mobile AA than trying to shoot it with other weapons because of this.  Miniguns feel like marshmellow shooters but machine guns on the tanks and guntrucks feel fine. 

Tanks,APCs are incredibly vulnerable to infantry due to EVERY class getting C4. Tanks are not like BF where they can get thermals,and reactive armor or so on. There's no vehicle customization unfourtantly. This is why you see tanks and APCs sitting at safe zones sniping.

Audio is inconsistantly goofy. Footsteps often are very loud,while vehicles are very quiet at times.

It's a solid 6.5-7/10 but the communtiy issues(Namely with this community being full of Great Value Brand Chris Kyle's) kind of hurt it. If you manage to scoop a server that is a bit stricter on keeping Recons/snipers in line,it's a blast. If you're not,just be prepared that the early grind sucks until you learn all their hideholes and be ready to swap to a DMR shoot them out of their campsites they will inevietably build when Engineers get tired of them and start lobbing rockets at them. Throw some more maps with better cover and routes,start restricting how many snipers you can have(or make other sniper weapons more appealing to make Recon actually use other weapons) and I think it's a pretty solid successor to the Battlefield idea.

TBH. I really just want to play the old battlefield games again, and this feels like garbage. 128 players on blank boring open field maps, with not enough cover, barely any equipment to unlock for the individual soldier types, and a uninteresting gun attachment system thats been present in these kind of games for over 10 years, which is also done like garbage, because nearly every other gun is locked behind some insanely steep level walls, most of the time 40+, and the base guns feel objectively inferior to everything else.
No grenade indicators, no hud maps, the spawn system is garbage. Basically, you name a QOL function shooters have had since COD 4, and its probably not here. People constantly pop out of every direction, because the maps points are all laid out like garbage, resulting in virtually no movement flow. You spawn, you pick a direction, you run for 10 seconds, and you die to the 45 guys sitting in the bushline with snipers. Its not ""battlefield but better"".

With a mix of anticipation and skepticism, I approached Battlebit Remastered, hoping for a return to the glory days of large map conquest and team strategy.

Yet, despite its promise, Battlebit Remastered falls into a familiar trap. It's a mishmash of familiar elements from other titles, offering a quick dopamine rush but lacking the staying power to keep players engaged over the long haul. The dwindling player count on Steam Charts speaks volumes, starting strong but now struggling to maintain traction.

Let's delve into the core issues plaguing the game:

Map Design: Rather than encouraging strategic play, maps often incentivize players to camp in obscure corners, racking up kills while neglecting objectives. It's less about skill and more about exploiting map flaws.

Vehicle Balance: Implementing vehicles in an infantry-centric game is tricky, and Battlebit Remastered fumbles here. Tanks dominate with impunity, sniping from afar while helicopters feel clunky and ineffective.

Player Movement: Dolphin diving and parkour mechanics undermine strategic engagements, favoring chaotic skirmishes over coordinated teamwork.

Movement Speed: Players zip around at breakneck speeds, detracting from the tactical depth the game could offer. Dialing back the pace could foster more thoughtful gameplay.

Destructible Environments: While impressive, destructible environments are excessive, often devolving matches into chaotic demolition derbies rather than strategic showdowns.

Weapon Balance: The arsenal suffers from imbalance, with certain weapons overshadowing others. The AUG, in particular, feels overpowered, disrupting the game's equilibrium.

Grenade Spam: Grenades are too abundant and wielded carelessly, disrupting the flow of gameplay with excessive explosions.

While Battlebit Remastered may find its audience, it's not the strategic conquest experience Battlefield fans yearn for. Instead, it feels like another run-of-the-mill shooter, lacking the depth and nuance of its predecessors. If you're seeking a robust strategy game, you may need to look elsewhere.",1707684488,1707684488,False,2,0,0.504313826560974121,0,True,False,True

There's zero point in pretending you can't smell the stench of 'Battlefield' all over this, but that can't be a bad thing - especially given how badly EA are mishandling that entire franchise currently. Guns feel good, there's plenty to unlock and it takes good chunk of time to do so. Vehicles are fun, if sometimes a TINY bit unbalanced.

The maps are broadly great, with a few minor exceptions (Zalifbay, I'm talking about you - you absolute turd). The community are generally relaxed and amicable and there's almost always enough players online for you to jump into an enormous battle without delay. 

On the downside, I feel like the audio could use some work. Maybe it's the inevitable comparison to Battlefield that makes it more apparent, but the sound is a little flat on occasion. The directional audio doesn't always seem to tell the whole truth which can be a bit frustrating, however rare it may be. I've also encountered a couple of bugs, getting stuck in the spawn screen and the game locking up entirely. In fairness, this has only happened a couple of times in the 17hrs I've played.

- Snipers, despite the nerf, are OP
- DMRs are even stronger - 2-shot kill
- Sound is trash, your teammate step are more audible than the enemy vehicle passing by
- The direction of sound is even worse
- The general 'camping' is big issue, where on every map you get shot from 100s of metres because of the kids camping in the back.
- The maps are trash, either super close combat where the SMGs obliterate you or wide open where you get shot from every direction
- Unnecessary changes from the devs which satisfy nobody - sudden nerfs of guns, grouping them into random categories, restricting the usage to classes, etc.

The game I truly loved back at the release has slowly turned into a position-based tactical shooting, where everybody digs into an elevated position (yes, windmills, towers, high building - each game there are many many people there) and just camp in the back waiting for an opponent.

Have I mentioned that vehicles do it too? Each and every game the tank is taken by some camper who decided to just stay on the rock at the back of the map and just ignore the team's call for push.

I know that there will be people saying ""if the game allows it why not"" and i kinda agree with them. The 32v32 gamemode is super hard imo.

There are mostly Russians who just curse at you or tryhards. Medics dont revive nor heal, support class players think they are unkillable and never drop ammo.

As a fan of the ""classic"" Battlefield games, such as BF3 and BF4, I've been missing that simple yet fun kind of fps-game.
Battlebit reminds me of those times, as it plays very similarly, except that it has a unique flavor.

It takes some time to get used to the game, especially because of the brutal ttk, the lack of a minimap and the bunch of micro-mechanics that are hidden beneath the surface. However, once you get a couple of mates onto the game and you manage to play as a squad, this game just hooks you. 

I'm very excited where this game will be going in the future and I'll happily sink a couple more hours into it.

Ex:
Weapons not swapping (regardless of input)
Weapons randomly swapping (highly sensitive inputs)
Marking not working (despite making the sound indicator)
Spawning not functioning with no enemies around, or reviving (while working other times during reviving)
Spawn blocking not functioning when an ally is surrounded by enemies (resulting in spawn killing)
etc.

These are features that should be more tightly locked down and I can't understand how these issue got past testing.
I don't know another game that I've played that had this much problem with consistency on their main game features.

Update:
I'm not sure how the core mechanics got worse. It genuinely baffles me.

New Feature:
Anti-Grenade-Trophe has a 25% chance to not be placed. If you try to place it again, it will just appear. If you don't do that, it will function as though it isn't there.

Edit from here to below.

To clarify, the cheaters and exploiters are not just your simple ""oh that guy killed me before I killed him he must be cheating"".  When I say cheaters I mean people who, while faced away from your character, are somehow shooting you, people who pre-fire you around corners when you are prone in a bush, or even people who flick to you and instantly headshot you the second you see them run away from you out of a building.  I understand why the player count dropped.  If you don't get killed by a cheater then you encounter an exploiter who is using a broken mechanic to just wipe the floor with players.

All the focus in development was on the moment to moment feeling of the game and they nailed it, but it does feel like it lacks something in terms of the diversity of gameplay.

I have two wishlist items, firstly to have the option for small team games. Currently I think the smallest game you can do it 32v32. I honestly would like the option for CoD style game modes with smaller teams as well as bigger grand strategy maps.

Yes - gunplay and potential fun
No - idiot community and developers.

Frist off, you don't loose 94% of your playerbase in the first four months of your early access period if the developers care about the state of gameplay; https://steamcharts.com/app/671860#All

Second;
-ENFORCE TEAMBALANCE AND LIMIT TEAMSWAPS!
-finding the people in a squad that you want to join is nearly impossible thanks to the ultra-basic squad & team management layout... its so basic you could almost say its non existent! You literally have to figure out what squad they are in by FINDING THEM ON THE MAP, ON TEAMS OF UP TO 127 PLAYERS, hovering over their icon ON THE MAP, then seeing if you can join the same squad WHEN YOUR DEAD. So fucking dumb.
- c4 & frags might as well be firecrackers vs infantry, they are so fucking useless!
- community is so window licking idiotic that it makes me feel like i'm playing the roblox version of battlefield.
99% of the time they won't revive fallen allies even in cover, they won't wait to be revived in cover, they just give-up and stare at a respawn timer like the morons they are. In my sixteen hours of gameplay I found one squad that wasn't trying to eat pudding with a straw, and holy shit was it glorious... just wish there were less idiots playing the game or a more straightforward way to join a squad that you know isn't going to just run in a straight line from a to b to c like fucking lemmings then bitch about ""zomfg hax!"" when they die to the same sniper twelve times because they have the mental capacity of a thumbtack.

other than the nearly 100% downs community, the game can be a ton of fun if you can get a squad to follow orders and use their mic once in a blue moon.


---edit---
Being *REQUIRED* to agree to an overzealous  ""gotta protect the snowflakes by record your voice"" agreement in order to use voice chat is fucking stupid. The possibility of being banned from a game via the developers RECORDING YOUR VOICE because some snowflake asshat can't handle hearing someone say ""you stupid cunt"" over the mic is so fucking gay that I don't even have the words...

I've been gaming since the early 90s, I've literally heard it all and MOVED ON, because they're just words. In this game I've heard plenty of people spamming the mic... or being annoying... all you have to do is just mute them and move on. 

They being dumb? mute em.
They being racist? mute em.
They spamming music? mute em.

You can literally solve half of your ""oh no my virgin ears, I'm so offended"" bullshit by clicking a few buttons, and ITS ALMOST MAGICAL how easy it is to do. The other half of the solution is to not be such an emotionally fragile little bitch, but thats on you, not me or the game.

Listen, I get that, financially speaking, a company wouldn't want to be held liable for what person A says to person B and then person B is all ""boo hoo hoo my feelings, i'm such a fragile snowflake"" and person A is like ""well i don't give a shit those are your feelings and I have no control over them"" then person B is all ""well i'm going to try to sue the company since they aren't insulating me from reality with kittens and rainbows in a war game"". But in reality this company is taking it WAAAAY too far with this ""you must agree to be recorded anytime you open the mic channel""... I'm over here wondering about their datacenter costs for storing all the useless gigabytes of null-data when I accidentally hit the voice button when running around and all they hear is my heavy breathing.

------------

Bugs like something kills you but it wasn't any weapon or grenade. You just die instantly (not even in the red zone).
Not sure but I don't think there was any tutorial when you start the game fresh so more players learn how to ping location. Bunch of times I'm on a side that players don't know how to ping enemy location.

Servers shows green on ping but when you join it actually goes to 244ms on some servers that are in Asia, and often it boots you out of the game due to connection to server time out.
But if you join on US servers the connection are stable, but high ping so it's a disadvantage when doing CQB. 
Don't get me wrong the game mechanics are fun, it's just that official servers are VERY limited, I hope they ADD MORE SERVERS FOR ASIA that are stable, until then this will be my personal opinion about the game. 
Also forgot, There are some lame ass aimbot users so obvious just running around with headshots. 
On the brighter side, this game for me is much better than COD Warzone on FPS genre. LOL!!!",1703271347,1707054927,False,2,0,0.51126861572265625,0,True,False,True

There's a lot of good to be said of BattleBit, the guns sound meaty, the destruction engine is killer, the customization is fun and unique enough. The VOIP and open comms help keep the community feeling alive and healthy. But that's honestly where my support ends. Balancing, movement, and gunplay feel inconsistent and unfun to play against.

Full disclosure. I'm a support main, always have been, always will be - Heavy in TF2, Gunner in DRG, Support in BF3/4/1, Machine Gunner and Automatic Rifleman in Squad; you name it - if it's got a belt I'll run it... and there in lies the problem. The balancing is beyond off putting for Support: just about every single gun outpaces and overshadows the Support's roster. SMGs, PDWs, Carbines outclass the all of TWO belt-fed LMGs, with the minimal recoil and higher ROF outclassing Support's weapons at medium to long ranges easily - which frankly should be occurring. The near instant TTK and rapid mobility of the opposing classes puts an impossibly slow class like Support at a massive disadvantage for speed for how much armor he's actually allotted, and for a game that relies on rapid near-run-and-gun gameplay across the other classes - it leaves players like me in the dust. Slow ADS speeds, abysmal recoil even when prone, useless bipods, agonizingly low damage at range and a max round count of a hundred leaves support feeling... milquetoast at worst and an uphill struggle at best. If I can't reliably lay down suppressive or enfilade fire, nor can I reliably run and gun with the LMGs and LSGs, why even play him? I like the game, I like to support Indie titles, but when playing feels like a chore, it doesn't make sense to play in the first place. I still recommend the game, don't get me wrong, but if you're a player like me, I'd take it with a grain of salt.",1706933628,1706933628,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

[b]Short version:[/b]
The gameplay would in theory be fun, the graphics aside most of the mechanics are decently polished, especially for such a small dev team. But since the last few weeks the proximity chat which was one of the most enjoyable parts of the game is just unused, straight up dead or full of idiots blasting music through tin can speakers challenging your ears to burst. At this point the mixture of dead community and annoyances like completely overpowered vehicles and the dead servers make it just unfun to continue.

[b]Long version:[/b]
Battlebit is a game by three people and the early sales numbers showed the amount of potential it had since it embraced a mixture of Battlefield-like gameplay and partial milsim-like realism(like the healing mechanics) with the addition of a proximity chat that produces some of the most memorable moments in gaming history.
There is just something intrinsically funny when you teammate who just ate a grenade, flies through the air while screaming from the top of his lungs like the iconic Wilhelm scream.

Sadly over the last months and seemingly especially the last weeks the voice chat seems to have completely died, being but an empty husk of what it was in the beginning. Either not a single person is using it or people are abusing your ears by playing incredibly tinny sounding and distorted music at stupid volumes forcing you to scramble and find the right F-key to mute the person amongst the action.

Gamplay trend wise these days it's mutated to a camp or rush fest. Also seemingly none of the original servers seem to be used, if you want to not be thrown in an empty server(which seems to happen literally every time you use normal matchmaking) you have to use the server browser and filter for player count and pick one of the few that are actually filled with players.

All in all:

+ Fun weapons(for the most part)
+ A unique blend of milsim and arcade like shooter mechanics
+ No micro transactions
+ Great potential

- Dead or spammed voicechat which really drags down the experience
- Finding servers is manual labor and at certain times not that easy
- Balancing issues with vehicles
- Some maps are pretty lackluster and since you are playing on non official servers many of the same maps get picked over 
   and over, meaning that it can get repetitive qickly.
- Only few gamemodes that are actually populated and fun

I could go on and on about more positive and negative aspects or talk about the graphics which are very much personal preference( I dont mind the looks but sometimes it can get a little dull). But all in all the game would be great, it just lacks community and a clear vision for what it wants to be.
I hope that the devs find a good middle ground and can save it before it all goes since the game has A LOT of potential

Edit:
A new bug has emerged where when you die you have a blackscreen even though the game still runs... it makes normal matches even more unplayable, also every Server seems to experience massive lag spikes every few minutes causing everyone to rubberband and not be able to play",1705943580,1706904400,False,1,0,0.494505524635314941,0,True,False,True

The attachment system is also very broken, as the game has an rank system in which you get XP and levels up, unlocking new weapons and equipment, but what they don't tell you is that for attachments you need kills, for EACH weapon. So you need to spend hours upon hours just griding thousands of kills for any of the actually good attachments, again, for EACH weapon.
Also the damage system was broken after a few updates and playing the support class with heavy armor is impossible because now armor doesn't work that good and its way better to just go assault with light armor.  
Finally, theres a very clear cheater problem, mostly due to the fact that the devs are using easy anti-cheat which is a big ol joke when it comes to anti-cheating software, the nerds at reddit will say its false and that there is no cheating problem, again they are either lying, hackers themselves or just repeating what everyone else says.

Nuts and bolts software stuff - Great for low-spec machines. I had to restart for it to run after installing on my low-spec lappy, but no issues after. Default visual settings required almost no tuning. On my PC, ran perfect after install, and zero issues ever. I don't run mods, so have had zero issues with Anti-Cheat beyond forgetting to update it. 

Gameplay - Hardcore fps pvp(one-shot kills, etc), plus huge maps are new to me. I die so much. Respawning is mostly painless and made playing feel like golf: ""bah! I ****in' suck. Bottom five of standings."", yet I keep playing because occasionally surprising myself with great shots that are evidence of getting a lot better. In the case of Battle Bit, that's been busting through a wall with a hammer during a firefight, opps in the next room not hearing me with all of the other ruckus, notice their backs face a convenient wall, creep around that wall, hammer a hole, annihilate everyone without a shot a shot at me because it all happened in, like seconds. {Dopamine production skyrockets}

Development - The game is highly polished for something that's still in development and though changes always sting, I usually end up appreciating them so far and give the devs' decisions the doubt. Even the sniper rifles' medium scope nerf. I run and gun more now, and have incidentally got better at it. I know maps better for sniping it up too. Win/Win. Some will strongly disagree with me on this and that's fine.  

But yeah, I suck at this game, but still have 450+ hours in so far.",1706828548,1706828548,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is what you will be doing every minute you spend playing this game.  You're either walking or you are lying on the ground dead, easy prey to a person who has dedicated their entire life to their dream of becoming the greatest FPS player on Earth.

If you're among these contenders for ""best FPS players in history,"" then happy hunting.  You *might* enjoy this game.  Not being on that list, I wouldn't know how this game is for such people.  What I do know is that the game is impossible to enjoy for any person not on that list.

Alternately, if you are sick and tired of video games being too darn fun, and just wish you could play a game that made you miserable, bored, and frustrated, this game will accomplish that task flawlessly.  If you think to yourself, ""gee: I wish I could play a game where all I did was walk for two straight minutes and then lie on the ground for a while"" this is it.  This is that game.  You've found it.

I can think of no other reason to play this game.",1706772875,1706821911,False,6,1,0.508366763591766357,0,True,False,True

it is overarcadicized FPS shooter which is hardcore trying to implement features from squad and battlefield that NOBODY uses AT ALL. 

It feels sad to downvote this, but unfortunately, cons overweight the pros.
Potential is wasted, and developers are creating nonsense content based on player responses which make zero sense in terms of game design. Such as designing a choice for tactical squads, default squads, tank squads or helicopter squads. None of these are used, nobody cares. score is pointless. vehicles are pointless. Voicechat is never, ever used. barricades are non existent, only i ever use them. 

FORGET teamwork, anything that focuses ingame on teamwork, is not for teamwork, but for reasons to benefit a individual players. Teams are useless. If the game had no teams, the game would play exactly the same. 

Incredibly selfish and self centered community

All people really focus on is KD ratio. Thats all that this game has to offer, that is the only and one functional part of the game that really matters. Claims that it does what battlefield doesnt are monumentally dramaticized. 

Sound design is probably a subject of change, but at this moment it is just ridiculously poor. Sounds are unpunchy, have blant atmosphere, and wont bring player into the scene. they dont create face of urgency and dont really create a faculty of a firefight for player.

Get prepared that in battlebit, lots of players will somehow just steer around corners like they see you there. They will navigate the enviroment just like they know you are at that precise spot. 
Getting shot with a low caliber SMG on 400 meters, even despite the game has quite intense recoil mechanics, is quite a norm now. DMRs are underpowered and so are sniper rifles for unambitious ""game balance"".

The ""very positive"" roundup of reviews are there due to a fact that this game bluntly challanges major AAA games like battlefield. But in the end of the day, it has to offer nothing but lack of content & downright useless, pointless features.

Go back to battlefield 3 and enjoy some serious sound design and actual firefights, instead of being pinpoint shot from half a kilometer even though you are in a position where you shouldnt be seen easily.

Battlebit has massive potential, but right now it is ridiculously underbaked and its a frustrating piece to play that will force you into run n gun for no vital reason.",1689079093,1706821318,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Honestly community server is the downfall for me, personally i liked it but after the community server launched you can't almost find anyone who played on official server (Sea/Oce region). Community server isn't that bad but the server stability is really not that good. 

The game also becoming stale with slow update or any info about update at all.
server just dying at this point (there are 1-2 community server running most of the time).
I like the first few months when the game still active we got people running around, almost everyone using their voice chat and did some interact with others.

Update too slow lack of content. 
For those who want to buy it, I still recommend you to buy or wait for the ""Free Weekend"" where a lot of people coming to play again.
For oce or sea region your best hope is to play on community server and wish it went smoothly.

What is the effect of conformity on a society? In the science fiction novel by Lois Lowry called The Giver, everyone lives in what is supposed to be a utopia but the sameness of it all makes living very bland and without choice or meaning.  The main character, Jonas, gets chosen to be The Receiver of Memory, which is a job where someone is given the memories of what life used to be like before the community switched to sameness. The Receiver helps the Council make important decisions that would need more life experience to decide on.  When Jonas is receiving the memories from the old receiver, also known as The Giver, he realizes how bland and meaningless conformity has made life in his society. Conformity is very restrictive because it prevents people from experiencing the ups and downs of being human and it removes their ability to make decisions for themselves.
Conformity prevents people from experiencing the ups and downs, or necessary life experiences, of being human. The first piece of evidence for this claim is when Jonas was receiving a memory of pain from The Giver, and the author wrote, ‘It was always provided in his everyday life for the bruises and wounds, for a mashed finger, a stomach ache, a skinned knee from a fall from a bike. There was always a daub of anesthetic ointment, or a pill; or in severe instances, an injection that brought complete and instantaneous deliverance’ (109). This quote connects to the claim because the author is explaining that Jonas doesn’t ever need to feel pain, which is one of the worst parts of human life. Without pain, people cant be human because its the pain and joy of life that gives people the perspective on things necessary for being a human. Another example from The Giver that supports the claim about conformity is when The Giver was giving Jonas a memory of sledding down a snowy hill, the book says, ‘“Comprehending all of those things as he sped downward, he was free to enjoy the breathless glee that overwhelmed him: the speed, the clear cold air, the total silence, the feeling of balance and excitement and peace”’ (103). This second piece of evidence explains how good Jonas felt while experiencing sledding, a very fun part of being human, and it just shows how little fun Jonas gets to experience while living conformantly. Having fun is necessary to living as a human because it is the main upside to being human and making unique decisions. Finally, the last example of how conformity prevents the ups and downs of being human is from when Jonas is receiving a very sad memory from the last receiver, the author says, ‘“Going closer, he watched them hack the tusks from a motionless elephant on the ground and haul them away, spattered with blood. He felt himself overwhelmed with a new perception of the color he knew as red”’ (126). This final quote shows Jonas learning what blood is and experiencing a different type of pain, this he will never feel and without it he can’t be fully human because he needs those experiences and feelings of pain and joy in order to make decisions.
Conformity removes people’s ability to make decisions for themselves. In the first piece of evidence from The Giver, The Giver is talking to Jonas and the book says, ‘“But they won’t want change. Life here is so orderly, so predictable- so painless. It’s what they’ve chosen”’ (130). This quote from The Giver shows that the choices of conformity have already been decided on and neither Jonas, nor anyone else, has a way to make the decision for themself. In this second example that connects with the claim, Jonas is thinking to himself about decisions, and the author writes, ‘Jonas had to stop and think it through. “If everything is the same, then there aren’t any choices! I want to wake up in the morning and decide things! A blue tunic, or a red one?”’ (123). This second quote explains how Jonas doesn’t have any choices and is just told what to do for everything in his life. In the final quote of this paragraph, Jonas is talking to The Giver, and the book says, ‘Jonas tells The Giver, “I liked the feeling of love…I wish we still had that”’ (127). This third example connects to the claim because Jonas is telling The Giver how he wishes that they still had love and he has no choice in whether or not he can love.
	Despite the good effects of conformity such as the removal of prejudice, pain, and suffering, by taking away people’s agency and their ability to experience the joys and suffering of human life, people’s lives are completely restricted. When Jonas learns about the pain of getting injured and the joy of sledding, he realizes that the ups of life greatly outweigh the bad parts. Jonas also realizes that he doesn’t get to make any real choices because The Council has made all of the decisions for him. In The Giver,  Lois Lowrey invites people to consider how these lessons may apply to their own lives and how everyone can try to push back against conformity in their lives.

That's the question asked at the core of [i]Battlebit[/i]'s game design.  Today, EA and Dice's [i]Battlefield[/i] is one of those bloated cultural behemoths that hasn't actually been enjoyable in over a decade, but which gamers nevertheless shill out an annual subscription cost to for the latest installment of bland, samey action to anesthetize the horrors of the 21st century.  For anyone under drinking age, that's all they'll ever remember [i]Battlefield[/i] being: the Marvel Movie of first-person shooters, a game that everybody has but nobody likes.

However, once upon a time, in the approximate six-year period between [i]Battlefield 2[/i] and [i]Battlefield Bad Company 2[/i], [i]Battlefield[/i] rocked.  It had excellent weapon variety that you could just unlock by playing the fun video game, instead of throwing dollar bills directly at the screen.  It had great map variety that could be scaled up and down to different sizes and game modes.  Later in [i]Battlefield[/i]'s golden period, it added groundbreaking destruction mechanics to those excellent and varied maps, allowing for dynamic maneuverability and strategic depth while not compromising its guns-blazing action.

[i]Battlebit[/i], produced by small 3rd-party devs SgtOkiDoki, Vilaskis, and TheLiquidHorse, takes a decidedly ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" attitude towards this brief sunspot in the fetid river of wastewater that is the contemporary AAA first-person-shooter.  It's [b]so[/b] derivative of [i]Battlefield: Bad Company 2[/i] that you might as well call it [i]Bad Company 3[/i], and that's a good thing.  The big innovations it brings to the table -- aside from its low-fi indie ""[i]Roblox[/i] Chic"" art style -- are massively-scaled lobbies bordering on ""MMOFPS"" territory and a very robust VOIP system including excellent integrated proximity chat that remains active while you bleed out.  This means that players on either team can (affectionately) trash talk across the lines at any time, which is in theory a recipe for extreme toxicity, but is in-practice (and with heavy, heavy moderation) a fun way of blowing off steam and shooting the breeze as you wait for a respawn.  My favorite players are the ones who actually roleplay out their deaths, going ""oooogh, agh, ugh"" with all of the pathos of an Oscar-winning actor for your benefit after you plug them.

In short, it's ""Better [i]Battlefield[/i].""  If you're nostalgic for the old [i]Battlefield[/i] games, this is your new holy grail.  Have fun!",1706578055,1706578055,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

+Visibility is ok
+Runs on old PCs too

Cons:
-Milsim mechanics
-No minimap
-No shotguns
-Snipers and flanks are an issue
-Model clipping can reveal your position
-Camping and hyper defensive gameplay is encouraged

A very bad aspect of this game is the combination of milsim mechanics and the lack of minimap. That’s because these make the game not only hostile to casual play, but also much less accessible than it could be. Regardless of server size, you will always get spotted by someone outside your FOV, and because there’s no minimap to show you the visual information of your teammates, you will get flanked a lot. As a result, you will get killed repeatedly, and be forced to face the cycle of spawn, walk a large distance, die, repeat. And since that is mentioned, walking large distances is the second worst part of the game, and vehicles don’t make the experience better at all. Since there is no minimap, you can assume you can drop from the vehicle right outside a point, which is usually where a fight should take place, but then you open the potential to get flanked, once again, because there isn’t a minimap. This paragraph is essentially pointing out the domino effect that is caused by these 2 features combined.

The agreed upon belief of the community is that this is a casual game, but that is purely based on the fact that a team has 32-127 members (on official servers), ignoring mechanics that encourage sweating such as: slow reloading (even when you drop your mag), manual healing, manual combining of mags and overall how much your decisions matter.
After an encounter with an enemy, if you win, you would need to apply bandages, reload, heal and possibly combine mags, 2-3 decisions that take time, which isn't casual.
When people thing ""casual"", they think ""turning your brain off"" or ""having music in the background"", which you can't really do in this game without getting stomped, because this isn't a reaction-based game, it's a decision-based game, and it's the aspect of the game I'm most mixed about.

Also, a lot of matches become a confusing mess, especially in the middle of the map, which is something a good amount of people choose to avoid by ""going around"" and flanking. Normally, flanking wouldn't be an issue if this game had a more reaction-based TTK, but this game has a TTK that is as close to 0 as it can be, and as a result, you won't escape dying to a flanker (in a part of the map you assumed was safe). So, never assume you're safe, even if you're in your team's territory.

Regarding TTK: It is inconsistent as heck. Some weapons are incredibly effective, but don’t get things twisted: a Vector can kill faster than a USP, even if the USP user is more skilled and only hits headshots. So, unfortunately, you have to figure out yourself which are the best weapons and attachments. And since we learn from mistakes, it’s gonna take a lot of painstaking deaths to become decent.

In FPS games, my ideal type of combat is the close quarters one, with a fairly long TTK. In this game most encounters will be mid-long range combat, with very short TTK. Your best bet at close range is using an SMG (luckily a lot of them are effective), but you won't be able to escape getting sniped easily, which is one of the worst aspects of the game (getting killed because someone decided to camp in the edge of the map or in 500m away). Even if you are underground, there are large enough areas for this to happen, and the movement won't save you from this. What can save you is, unfortunately, building mechanics... You can build short walls and cover, it's not as bad as Fortnite, but it's a mediocre mechanic nonetheless. If this game had shotguns, they wouldn’t be very useful, but they would probably infuriate the receiver in the few times they were used successfully. This would be seen as a reason not to add them (as it is the case, I assume) but the counterpoint I bring is that: Snipers are in the game, which are by far the worst types of weapons to play against, and in case you don’t know why: Sniper outranges everything, so if you know there’s a sniper somewhere, your best bet is that he won’t manage to hit you. This seems much less avoidable than getting killed from a shotgun, especially if you consider how open the maps in this game are. The biggest obstacle players have to face in order to get comfortable with the game is dealing with snipers, and even then it can still get annoying as heck. So, yeah, sniping is by far the worst part of the game...

Overall, this game is a mess. It’s a mix of casual match settings and milsim game mechanics. If you try to play the game casually, you will get flanked, and if you try to play it competitively, you will die to something that you couldn’t do something about, because of the large player amount, regardless of map/mode. And on top of every questionable design decision, the worst one is easily the existance of sniper rifles.",1686863054,1706553727,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Fun gameplay, well implemented mechanics, and an awesome community await you.

Nearly 100 hours into BattleBit, I feel confident saying that I love to hate this little gem of an FPS.

BattleBit fills the same void that Battlefield does, though in a much more charming and player-friendly way. While most of the functionality you would find in similar large-team online shooters is present, there's also a certain degree of indie game jank that, when not frustratingly inexcusable, is immensely fun and side-splittingly funny.

I think the thing that BattleBit needs more than anything right now is much more careful attention to balancing. In games like Battlefield, it never seems like a single meta has time to completely dominate the game from lobby to lobby. The emphasis on finding a soldier kit that works best for you individually is much more important.

Here, though, the game's development cycle has allowed for more time between changes that leads to a somewhat sloppy team-game experience. First it was 4x scopes on sniper rifles to mask glint, now its snipers tucking themselves away in imperceptible corners of the map geometry that the game's admittedly poor hit reg simply can't get around.

Obviously, all of this is subject to change in a game that is constantly underdevelopment, but for new players especially, I see this being a somewhat jarring experience that could scare them away. 

Outside of issues with balancing against game metas, maps are a mixed bag I feel is worth mentioning. It seems like game lobbies either have too much or not enough space for the action happening inside them. The large scale of game lobbies makes me understand why extra space needs to be available to players, but having to run obscene distances to make it to in-game objectives where there are actual things happening and not a bunch of squadmates huddling together on a roof is simply annoying.

Outside of things that I'm essentially nit-picking to find, BattleBit is insane fun. With the exception of some questionable hitreg, combat is snappy and diverse. The game's customization mechanics are well implemented and have great variety. While map design is questionable, there's a lot of variation between them. In general, everything I haven't complained about thus far is at least good, and often great.

The thing I think is most worth saying is how awesome this community is. Other shooters like CoD or Battlefield or team-based games like Overwatch (Bleh) and Counter-Strike are loaded with toxic personalities and actual hate speech. Is BattleBit totally devoid of that? No, but no online game can be. BattleBit's community, in spite of the kind of game it is and what kind of audience that tends to attract, is welcoming and fun and much more concerned with having a good time than running up your stats. To date, I have yet to hear someone go on a tirade over VOIP. What's much more common is hearing soundboards and people playing some of the most lit rock music I've ever heard as the team makes a charge onto a contested objective.

After ignoring modders for months, one of the developers has lashed out to the kindest member of our group. He was called an incel for decompiling the game and told to give up on his projects. Our thousands of hours of volunteer work to improve the game (while abiding to TOS and having dev permission) was ridiculed after months of silence from these same developers, not giving us any perspective what so ever.

As of right now, the game is lacking a lot in content, but it is significantly better than it was on release, and with the devs planning to continue updating it, i can see it turning into a very good game in future.

The biggest issue right now is the fact it has a very dedicated player base (myself included) who absolutely dominate the leaderboards and it makes it fairly difficult for new players to enjoy the game. This ""problem"" is usually resolved temporarily during free weekends, streamer events, or other in game events that bring a lot of players back to try things out again, but for the most part, it's not the easiest game to enjoy casually unless you understand a lot of the games mechanics already. I don't tend to play the game super aggressively or use metas, but still manage to perform fairly well by utilising strategies and methods that other players don't typically realise is as powerful as it is.

Overall, i do recommend the game, especially for the price, but be prepared to not do well at first or get absolutely demolished by the higher level dedicated players.",1687254871,1706323064,True,1,0,0.511627912521362305,0,True,False,True

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he let me borrow his controller. Me and my son then played in turns and I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

Where they utterly drop the ball is with their Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), it will crash your game and force your system to restart without any evidence as to why. You may play for 10 hours, or for 5 minutes, but at some point EAC will flip a switch and hard reset your PC. The community has some of their own fixes for EAC, addressing shortfalls in the system, but it is insufficient, nor should it be necessary. I was tolerating it occurring once a day, as the game is honestly that much fun that I didn't mind it. What was a final straw for me is that it made it necessary to use a restore point to regain functionality, as one forced restart caused an endless loop of restart-crash-restart.

Such a situation is unacceptable, and I therefore cannot recommend this game to anyone until that is fixed, be it EAC is fixed or another system is utilised instead. 

I want to recommend this game quite badly, especially for anyone who misses BF3 and BF4, there's a wide variety of game modes, maps, weapons, customisation, which simultaneously feel like their own while also being congruent with (and expanding upon) the Battlefield experience, its clear the developers are pouring themselves into this.

Well, this game offers everything and nothing from above. Guns are inbalanced mess (you will headshot someone with sniper rifle, only to get 3 tapped with SMG from miles away). Vehicles like cars and roadbikes are clunky and randomly get stuck. Destruction is mess too, some walls are fully destructible, while others are not. Audio is extremely bad, so bad that when they changed it, most of the players quit the game. Skill gap is huge in this game as well, many times you get completely crushed and many times you'll crush enemy. Most of the games you will be running for 3 minutes to battle only to be sniped by someone from miles away and repeat this process.

[i](If I care enough to waste the couple minutes of my life it takes me to type one out.)[/i]

[b]Update 2.2.4[/b]: [i]Capture Time[/i]:
Absolutely insane. 8 minutes for a solo capture? Are you serious?
I've had matches end faster than that.

On paper (In theory) the change seems fine, it promotes teamwork to capture objectives.

In reality, it just alienates solo players who used to sneak into the backlines, solo-capture an undefended objective, then either stay there until they died, taking as many opponents with them as possible, or raced off to another objective to repeat the same tactic.

Now, it's literally impossible to manage such a tactic solo, which typically means having friends on your squad follow you, because relying on randos in games like this (Any Co-Op), is a losing strategy.

I have not played in a while, so I don't know if that part of the update is actually as bad as it seems, but a 480S Solo Capture Time [b]((60 * 2) = 120 * 4 = 480)[/b] is absurd. I'd expect to be given 10K+ exp for such a massive waste of time with a very small degree of success.
You really think nobody is going to notice someone sitting on a cap for 8 minutes?
2 minutes was manageable. It could be tight under the right circumstances, but it was manageable.

I would like first to cover the good things;
The Progression feels nice.
The game runs surprisingly well.
No microtransactions.
Slight vatiety when it comes to customizability.
This game is NOT grindy, and it respects your time.
This game GREATLY rewards support roles, making kills not a primary, but more of a complementary way to gain EXP.

The bad things;
I don't know about other people, but from my perspective, I've had a ton of issues with inaccurate hirmarkers and or hitreg just now working in general. Since I had a lot of times when I hit someone 8 times, white hitmarker, basically I hit them 8 times and they still haven't died.
Bleeding shouldn't be in this game, honestly, trying to stop bleeding is more of a fkn chore than anything else. It doesn't add anything to the fight or after a fight.
BALANCING IS SO WHACK. I have no clue what the devs were thinking when balancing the weapons. First there was a massive issue with the vector, now, there's an even larger issue with the entire DMR category being busted as all hell.
Some weapons are obvisouly more OP than other guns. If your purpose is to just get kills, why use anything else other than a Groza? It MAY or CAN make other weapons redundant in general.
Some weapons have whack animations, the deagle for example has the goofiest recoil animation, and it just covers a major portion of your FOV.

[PERSONAL OPINION] Flashbangs shouldn't have those afterimages after the flash disappears. Instead of the afterimage, just prolong the flash period. It'd be less dissorienting.
[PERSONAL OPINION] No map is really good. At best, I can rank some at B tier. No map at A, and definitelly no map at S. I seriously have no clue who made these maps [Wakistan, for example], neither do I understand what thought procress they had when making them. A lot of them are too narrow, some have A LOT of angles to cover, basically making every single area a potential death trap. Visibility on some maps is non existant and et cetera. Some are way to open. And some can be a combination of all these negative characteristics.


The game is, however, AMAZING. Although, I've found my self losing my shit constantly. Probably an exclusive experience considering most of the people I play with or against are eastern europeans and they can be pretentious, a lot.

You've got massive maps to go with massive player lobbies, vehicles, fully destructible buildings, players that take the game just seriously enough to be fun to play with, and little game play details, like having to zero scopes and keep track of your magazines, that make the game feel more like a real battlefield without making it feel less like a game.  On top of all of that, the game is $15 at full price, only like 3Gb in size, and does not need modern hardware to run. 
If you want a Battlefield game that, but don't want to give up 100+Gb of storage, or really just have any issues with the state of AAA games, this is the one to get.",1706046768,1706046768,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Game is well polished and tuned offering fast and satisfing gameplay, Think old school CoD meets Battlefield and Squad. In next part of my review I will list my complaints from perspective of a player who played on and off since launch and generaly enjoys the game while also providing constructive feedback. I give this feedback to you in order for you to understand and consider these before buying this game.

            Here are some complaints: Vehicles need physics overhaul and gameplay overhaul. In particular vehicles such as IFVs and Blackhawks need more features and buffs. Body armor feels useless except the exo armor, there is no reason to use medium, heavy or big vests and helmets. Weapons and classes are in much better state than during launch however  DMRs are overtuned and could use a nerf. Map design is for most part fine but maps like Azagor and Port are just pain. Long term progression got huge improvements but if you dont care about  weapon skins there is no reason to grind prestige levels. Guns feel ok but guns like SMGs, Snipers, Pistols ,DMRs as well as some ARs sound like wet farts. Weapon attachments could use expansion as well, Stocks, UGLs, Pistol grips and tactial devices like IR lasers and torches are still to be added as of writing of this review. these attachments could spice up the game and progresion a bit. Loadout presets are to be added as well.",1705931769,1705931769,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Here are my suggestions considering the way I like to play the game, and also what I've noticed would make classes feel a lot more substantial IMO:

1. An easier resupply would be nice instead of needing to manually press E by a box. I think if you stand over a box long enough, passively you should start resupplying instead of needing to take your attention away from the fight.

2. A slower resupply for gadgets would be very nice. Things like the drone are really resourceful and helpful in combat, but when it gets shot down or blows up utilizing the ability to bomb things with attached explosives.. a player needs to either wait till their next death, or forcefully re-spawn to get any further utility which also costs your team lives in the long run before you lose.

3. The Support class should be able to get the riot shield for more defensive cover, and potentially(if ever added), mortars. For one the class lacks severely in the utility department when it comes to how relevant their kit is in battle compared to something like the medic or scout, but while also applying the passive resupply and gadget resupply would be nice for making them much more useful to teammates.. playing battlefield 4, you could set up a mortar somewhere and then use it when you needed to pinch people in a hard to approach area, which was always super helpful when performing a retake on an objective.. so something like that getting added into the game would be awesome to use.

4. The riot shield should be able to be placed down for cover. Right now you cant really use it with anything besides maybe peaking a corner and backing up to gain information(which the drone does better at anyways), so having it be able to be placed down with durability would be quite nice. Also being able to shield bash would be a welcome change too.




Now that that's out of the way, here's some bugs/issues I've discovered while playing the game:


-The rappel rope from the helicopters are a bit weird to use. If you look down and hold forward you'll go down the rope, if you look up and go forward you'll go up the rope, and vice versa. This over-complicates the dropping system to leave the helicopter, so being able to simply hold forward to go up the rope and backward to go down would be really helpful in keeping it simple. 

-You can't mark vehicles very well or at all while within the drone.

-The turn speed of the drone decreasing with more weight might be a mechanic for keeping drone bombing more balanced, but I feel that the speed decrease does it just fine.. if anything, the turn speed is a minor inconvenience whilst trying to drone bomb but more-so just annoying to deal with while casually turning in general when either taking off or moving within the air. If it could be looked into more, maybe removing the turn speed change with weight would make the drone feel cleaner to use in these scenarios.

-The flashbang is a bit overwhelming, but that's not the problem. Sometimes the flash is really long and can be a bit extreme considering the pacing of the game and how much of a disadvantage you're put at(as well as the phantom freeze frame when your vision returns completely hindering your POV until it wears off), and sometimes it's just a flashlight of a blast(I've tested it with multiple scenarios whether it be directly looking at the blast, or just catching a glimpse at an angle from a distance, the difference in randomness is not much).

-The supply drop comes down quite slow and doesn't offer much that the support class already gives other than longer up-time and more uses. Keeping the ability to interact with the supply drop for instant resupply of specific gear would be very nice except with gadgets, if that change was added then instead of applying the same slow passive regen to gadgets that a support box could.. the ability for a person once per life and per supply drop to instantly get back their gadget would be decently balanced and also quite helpful in the regards of the utility to using points on a supply drop in the first place.

-Claymores are not very effective compared to Anti-Personnel mines. Instead of blunt black lines/tripwires, subtle red lasers might make them more effective in holding doors compared to mines, and though they would still be visible and could be countered.. they would still be more discreet and offer more potential to kill. 

-The repair tool has some issues when attempting to repair a vehicle like the helicopter due to it's hitbox. If you're sitting in a particular seat(such as the inside cab), even when directly looking at the ceiling or certain points inside.. the repair tool will fail to detect collision and wont repair. Sometimes it works but in a lot of cases, I find myself rotating to the outside seat on the edge to get a better angle at repairing.

-If the supports could resupply the mini-guns in the helicopter, that would be nice.




Finally, here's some ideas I have that might make the game interesting but would require some insight on balancing and also fluid utility:


1. Cameras: Being able to set a camera somewhere and have it auto-mark someone while you're on the other side of the wall would be nice for defending, but a side of this would make it break easily to explosions and also have a light shine on the model so people can more easily identify a camera(also removing any marks applied by the camera when it's destroyed). You could place a camera by throwing it at a target location to stick.

Also for more uniqueness to the gadget, you could make it similar to the drone in the regards of being able to access the camera from a screen.. but in the case you want to view the camera without pulling out your screen, you could dock the screen on a wall or the floor to stay active in combat while being able to still view the camera(and allow others to view it too). This would allow for some really nice plays where you could in real time see the position of an enemy for information to better hold an area.. or even detonate traps from the comfort of your defenses.


2. Revamping the building mechanic: I always find it interesting how a person can deploy cover using squad points.. but I find the system a bit in the way in some instances, and in a lot of cases simply spammed when bottlenecks are a problem. To give more utility to this unique aspect of the game, being able to tie this system to the tools would be very helpful in making them more prominent. I find players using explosives more often to deconstruct walls and fortifications more than the tools themselves, so adding a mechanic where players could use the tools in their loadout to create unique pre-defined defenses would make defending an objective that much more engaging.

For example: hammers and pickaxes could still do what they're meant to do breaking either in mass or in specific spots for angles, but pickaxes would be better suited and more used in scout or medic kits for constructing sniper-lookouts and tight-knit defenses, and hammers would be better for assault and support kits for creating strong and bulky sectors to suppress/block off, and approach enemies with better cover.

This in turn would simplify the building system to allow players to use construction more to their advantage in fights, instead of randomly building in an erratic manner in hopes to create defenses from a really awkward bottleneck or choke-point they're being suppressed at(while also keeping the squad point system much more relevant in the case the passive resupply is added).

Also, having a max cap of structures that just outright stops the whole squad from building is a bit momentum breaking in the case someone really likes the mechanic.. so reworking that for individual caps and to begin a decay for old structures over the cap would make it so the player can build as much as they want without overwhelming the map with too many random structures.",1701393598,1705865952,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The addition of a server list as the first option is definitely a welcome feature that 2042 notably has absent. It is nice finding an actual server populated by people rather than pressing conquest and praying that half of the players aren’t bots. There aren’t even any bots that wander like headless chickens in Battlebit so I never have to feel good about myself getting a killstreak and get disappointed when all the names that flash up are fake. The blocky graphics make information easy to process in the face of a chaotic war. No micro transactions either beside a single skins DLC; always nice to take a page out of Deep Rock Galactic’s playbook. That’s about where the direct improvements end.

It gets a bit muddy when talking about everything else. Time to kill is incredibly fast. An assault rifle can kill someone pretty reliably even from 120 meters away and a sniper can kill from any distance given proper skill and positioning. This is great for maps where different types of weapons specialize in different areas. Tensatown for example has suburbs for the submachine gun players, many of the objectives and streets for the assault rifle, and open fields and tall rooftops for the marksman and sniper. The majority of the maps on the other hand have the objectives placed far apart with little variation in the landscape for cover and/or have the objectives themselves have an abundance of cover and vantage points. This leaves little incentive for close quarters encounters when I can just equip a long range weapon and wait for fodder to walk across a mile of nothing to get to my position. This makes the 64v64 and 32v32 mode far more enjoyable compared to 128v128.

Speaking of sniping, I feel like I never contribute anything to the team when I do it. Snipping is at its best when I get into a good flanking position and pick off a bunch of people without them spotting me. However, this usually takes time and patience to pull off which isn’t very practical in the end. Usually when sniping, the best targets to go for are the ones not moving much for easy headshots. Those targets are usually other snipers. This always leads to a cluster of snipers on both teams taking pot shots at each other while strafing and getting healed by the lone medic while everyone else is actually playing the game.

Many of these criticisms can also be applied to the Battlefield games. It’s just a shame that Battlebit’s only solution to this is add a bit of shake to the sniper.

The last Battlefield title I played was Battlefield 1, but that was 6 years ago and the newer entries haven't intrigued me. These developers know what makes a good Battlefield game and have nailed it down with this game. 

Weapons, Accessories, and Camos are all obtained through a progression system, so NO micro-transactions in this game. They want to make squad communications a key focus, which is very welcomed, I believe that makes the game more fun. The maps come in varying size and setting, they all look great. So far, the foundation is pretty solid.

As of the time of this review, the game is still in early access, so things can and will change. I will make another review once the game leaves early access, but from what I'm playing, this game has a bright future. 

My only concern is the FaceIT anti-cheat that the developers have chosen to replace the current East Anti-Cheat with. From what I am hearing, FaceIT requires kernel-level access to a user's OS, which is EXTREME for a casual game like this. Not to mention it will prevent Linux users (like myself) from playing the game through Proton. I hope the developers keep that in mind.

UPDATE: The developers have made sure that their Anti-Cheat does not interfere with Linux players from playing multiplayer. BIG PROPS, THANK YOU.",1689387578,1705824929,True,1,0,0.526627242565155029,0,True,False,True

To sum up guns feel horrible/gun play is horrible (alot of recoil, no damage, they are constantly changing values of the weapons instead of keeping it the way it is and maybe upgrading others that are bad and useless), timers/delays on almost everything that you do, no cover( the terrain is  flat the building are to generic, the destructibility is not bad but there is currently to much of it/ it's real easy to demolish the walls and the whole building, the player models are to generic looking (you can't distinguish a friendly from an enemy, they have the same player model). And that's bassically it i hope they fix thesse things because the game is not bad, it has a good foundation they just need to tweak a couple of things, add some things and fix some things and they have a pretty good game that actually rivals AAA Games that are 70$ and up.

Really do your research before buying,  if you allready own it

Most parts of the map being destructible is amazing. Being in a skyscraper at night while a BTR and several people with RPGs slowly wittle away what little cover you have is certainly an experience. 
It's also very helpful. Don't wanna have to walk around a fence or find an exit through a building? Simple! Just C4 straight through it!.
The chaos of everything isn't just restricted to 127v127 maps, since most of the 32v32 servers I have joined are the same maps with most of it just sectioned off, but honestly it just makes everything feel like a meatgrinder and grenade spam simulator.
Will say, as a gun nerd, seeing a laser being mounted on the side of a pistol when it has a bottom rail RIGHT THERE, THAT WAS MODELED kinda hurts my soul, but function over form I guess, and I assume with the devs being fans of Johnathan from The Royal Armories, that they may fix this in an update.

Large lobby games are very fun and hectic. You can decide weather you want to play in a casual squad or tactical giving you the ability to pick and choose your play depending on how you feel. My largest gripe with the game is it can become frustrating very fast. Poor spawn locations, or none optimized weapons lasering you from over 500 meters away. It can be hard to determine whats a skill gap and someone just utilizing the games jank factor for their benefit.

At the start, during the free playtests it was fun - but not anymore. Now that people have had to shell out a whopping $15, they've decided to make this game their life's purpose, and spend hour after hour honing their skill and insta-killing anyone in sight.

But seriously, the players you'll often go against have surgical precision with their shots - often leaving you dead before you can even get a shot off or see them.

Additionally, the gunplay isn't enjoyable: seems everyone has the armor of a juggernaut while you have the armor of a peanut shell. If you're not a Medic class then you'll blow through your 5 bandages instantly (if you don't die, that is).

Spawns are a bit janky, making it not clear why you can or cannot spawn on a thing. Heck, teammates will not be in combat but you CAN'T spawn on them bc the game says they are - wtf? No!

Movement sucks. Hey, I know this is probably a skill issue on my part but everyone else can monkey around the map like they're playing Assassin's Creed while I struggle to hop a fence if I'm not tryna scale a mountain like a Skyrim horse. Additionally, enemy players look like they can slide and instantly go prone on a whim, while my character has to lay down slowly like a geriatric grandpa.

The server sizes are a bad idea. There's a reason most AAA titles don't go for larger than 32 v 32 battles - because it's ridiculously chaotic and unbalanced.
64 v 64 is okay but challenging, but 127 v 127... Holy moly that is awful. Can't go anywhere without dying instantly (as most gunbattles go)

In total, this game is unfun if you try to go for anything beyond a basic 32 v 32 shooter, and even then you'll probably get frustrated by the aimbot-iness of the enemy team.

Might seem like a small thing, but even if I had the attachments I'd still get sharted on by these people that play it all day or spam crouch every fight. If you want a lot of ""playtime"" this might be for you, but for me, I'm tired of being lit up by people with attachments or a gun that I don't have.

Do you enjoy experiencing constant errors on startup because EAC decided not to launch?
Do you love getting screwed over at random by netcode that can't seem to figure out if your shots actually hit or not?
And best of all, after all that are you a fan of getting banned by EAC with zero explanation and then gaslit by people refusing to believe the EAC implementation in this particular game is complete and utter broken garbage?

Well then this is the game is for you. You too can enjoy the intense experience of playing games that actually work while your appeal gets thrown in the trash and ignored despite containing proof of your innocence. You too can rest easy knowing you'll likely never get your money back and you'll never be able to play again even if you wanted to thanks to your very own hardware ban. 

In all seriousness Battlebit was the most fun I've had in a newer multiplayer game for a long time. It worked perfectly at first. Even the old playtests worked well. And then it all fell apart just like that. More cheaters started appearing, people discovered and starting abusing the hell out of the report option, and EAC is going rampant kicking and banning people while the devs are quietly switching to FACEIT probably as a way to avoid recognizing the problem and responsibility for it. It's a joke. They have an appeal system and apparently some people have had success with it, but nonetheless they won't tell you anything and you're expected to wait a whole month before you can be certain they threw your appeal in the trash. I've been waiting for 22 days at the time of this review and I'll update it if I'm unbanned so that others know you may not be completely screwed if EAC decides it's your turn. But either way I'm not gonna recommend a game, even a really fun one, that will just ban you at complete random. I think I've been more than patient by this point on holding off posting an angry review. I have thousands of combined hours in other games with EAC and none of them have ever been this awful with their implementations. And as if EAC wasn't invasive enough, now we're gonna get FACEIT. If they go through with that I'm not sure if I care whether or not I'm unbanned. I don't want that de facto malware on my PC. Maybe EAC did me a favor.

EDIT: It's nearly December. I was banned August 7th, and predictably I am still banned. Every single appeal has been ignored by EAC even though they would have the logs that clearly show my innocence. The mods on their Discord supposedly can't do anything, although several of them would have me unbanned if they could. EAC is a joke. Their one job is to get cheaters banned, and yet the game is still flooded with them while the ban wave wipes out a bunch of random people like me. Don't buy this game under the assumption that you'll actually be able to play it in the future. Eventually it'll be your turn.

EDIT: Mid January and I'm still banned of course. Only 4 and a half years to go until my ban lifts unless someone at EAC does their job and reviews my ban. But at this rate that'll never happen.",1693289992,1705498719,False,1,0,0.495956867933273315,0,True,False,True

+ Sniper rifles only one shot on headshot and have to be in close range to hit you on the move, Support gets a helmet that blocks those
+ Most weapons feel very unique from each other (Each sniper rifle is just a better version of the last one though)
+ Iron sights unlocked for snipers right away (All red dots are canted)
+ Close range weapons are optimal (glad shotguns aren't a thing)

+/- assault is the fastest class while still being one of the tankiest, no reason to play anything else except for specialized gun choice, revives, or vehicle game mode

I had 'fun', sure, but there are better games out there that are much less of a struggle to play. I gave it a good try but it just felt too at odds with itself. It is however, one of those itch games. sadly.
The UI is eh. some bad, some good, some horrible. You'll get used to it.
The maps are okay, some are really really bad and encourage hiding on points to prevent spawns. You can only spawn at the base (safe area) if anyone is hiding on all points. It wouldn't be too bad if you could spawn near to the point and come back but unless a squadmate is there and ""not under attack"" you have to respawn all the way back at base and walk without getting sniped. 
Guns are unbalanced as all heck. Rifles are okay, but they are useless up close and useless at range. If you want to run and gun go for the smg, you can kill anyone with a rifle in a matter of milliseconds and bandage yourself right up. Want to snipe? Sure i guess, they give off massive trails and glints for EVERYONE. I've used sniper maybe twice and while satisfying, you're an easy easy target for anyone with aim. don't pick lmgs or any other weapon, they're garbage and will get you killed more than anything. Higher caliber bullets don't exist in this game, so if you start firing and they have a faster gun, you die before you can realize. Faster the fire rate better the gun, no matter how strong the bullets should be. Just go SMG.
Community seems really really closed off too. like worryingly so. New players are fodder. 
The last thing is kind of a feels thing. It feels zergy.

The game isn't ready yet in the current state. The gun play is fun, but that might be the only one that's going for it. Here's some of gripes that I have with the game at the time of writing

[hr][/hr] 
[h3] Shooting Range [/h3]
Shooting Range offers tutorials, but they are... pretty minimal. Of course it wouldn't matter much if you just want to hop in the game and shoot some stuff, but I feel like it's unfortunate that the tutorial isn't as extensive as the gameplay would be. The only stuff that's explained in tutorial are the stuff you have to look for, resource management, VOIP, etc. There has yet some important stuff like :
[olist]
    [*]Classes Explanation
The game doesn't explain what each of the classes' responsibilities are, weapons and gadgets available to each one of them, etc. Some of the weapons are even overlapping with each other (why would you use DMR as an Assault if you can have DMR with RPG with Engineer)

    [*]Squad Leader
The game doesn't explain much what you can do and what you should do as a squad leader, heck i don't think that many people knows that rally point is only available as a squad leader, [i]heck[/i], I don't think that many people even knows how to place them

    [*]Buildables
Yeah, the game doesn't explain how to place/build sandbags, barrier, covers, etc by spending some of the squad points. And yet, this feature could determine whether you could win the game or not. You'd have to [i]accidentally[/i] hold MMB or press O to be able to see this menu.
[/olist]

They say that the main usage of the Shooting Range is to test out guns and attachments combination, but even then, there's no easy way to switch out guns in this mode. You'd have to respawn, switch your weapon and mix some attachment, and redeploy back onto the field, only to find out that you're back at the starting place. The game also doesn't remember how you build your weapon in the normal server, so you always start with base weapon with no modifications.

[hr][/hr] 
[h3] Weapons, Attachments, Gadgets [/h3]
The game offers an abundant choice of weapons and attachments coming with them, and also gadgets that are exclusive to each of the classes, but here's some of my gripes with each one of them :

[olist]
    [*]Weapons
In most game, weapons obtainable in higher rank would be better compared to the weapons unlocked in early game, but sometime it doesn't seem to be the case in this game. Sometime a higher ranked weapon is easy to control, but the other time the recoil would make you miss all of your shots. I think this has to do more with how confusing the stat bar are. I wish there was a way to compare each one of the weapon from one to another.

This lowkey kills the purpose of unlocking a higher tier weapon. Of course, progression isn't an issue in this game (if you can find a playable server that is), but once you have a weapon that you're comfortable with, there's no real reason to play with other weapon.

    [*]Attachments
The game offers a lot of modification for your guns, from side rail, underbarrel rail, barrel, sights, etc. There's obviously stat changes for each one of the different attachments, but they also have the same problem i mentioned earlier with the weapons, higher tiered attachment isn't always better. Heck, some of the stat changes are negligible, you might as well just stick to the ones you're used to. 

Now for sights... the game doesn't even show you how it looks like when you're modifying your gun. So you better pray that it's usable when you spawn. 

I just wish each of the attachment comes with short explanation on what it does, just something like
[quote] Some sort of attachment, increases velocity but also the chance of you missing your shots [/quote]

[strike] Tell me what does S D N-6 762 do compared to V A M B-762[/strike] 

    [*]Gadgets
Some of the gadgets come with a short text to explain what they do, but some of it doesn't. Only a few weeks ago that i noticed that you can heal yourself and other people [i]with medic's gadget, not their bandage[/i], and also how the different RPGs has their own drops and confusing sights on how to shoot them. 
[/olist] 

[hr][/hr] 
[h3] QOL and some other stuff[/h3]
These are some of the infuriating stuff that I found when I played the game, that I have no other place to put : 

[list]
    [*]The game doesn't explain much about the available gamemode, to this day, If you ask me the difference between Conquest/Infantry conquest and Domination, I wouldn't know the difference. It'd be nice if the selection comes with a picture or a short explanation if you hover over them.
    [*]Speaking of game mode, some of it is just annoying/unwinnable. Capture the Flag is a mode where you steal the other team's flag and bring it back to your base. The exception is that you[i] also need [/i]your flag to be in your base to be able to get a point. And yes, the game doesn't explain it.
Invasion is a game mode where you capture a point to push your territory further and further, and most of the time, the attacking team will always win due to how long the time limit are. Of course the devs can revamp these mode to make it more balanced and more fun to play.
    [*]Switching sides is a problem in some mode, especially Invasion. I heard it's server side but when the player count becomes unbalanced, the game is just over and unfun at that point.
    [*]Server, or I guess, the player count is a problem. At least on weekdays in Asia side, the playable server is 1, you'd be lucky to get 2 server running with people with it.
[/list] 

After that long and winded explanation, I'd still recommend this game to someone else. I wanted this game to become better and I'm pretty sure it'll be when it reaches the full release. The devs got the core mechanic right and they just have to keep the player count running.",1705401613,1705401974,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Joining a game will sometimes NOT allow you to use ANY equipment or switch weapons.. This is still a problem today... You have to relaunch or rejoin servers.

Weapon reloading is sometimes randomly slowed by half, making no sense.

UI sometimes STILL cannot be clicked or interacted with.

Sometimes Vaulting activates when you don't want it to or the opposite; It doesn't vault when you try to.

Do you want to join servers to just see ""Defeat""? This game will do that too.

If you leave a server and try to join another it will throw you BACK into the same server.

No Server Blacklist.

I am a weary gamer. One that misses the days of games that gave the player the chance at fun.
Without Paid DLC
Without All Month Downloads
Without A Subscription
Without constant time wasting screens and menus

With this game, you will relive the good old days. Back when battlefield style games did not become ruined by a overbearing need for Graphics at the cost of game play and Fun.

Pro
-Wide Variety of Weapons, some restricted by class majority are not.
-Small to large maps
-Variety of game modes
-Customize your gun
-Customize your character
-Prestige System that rewards some dope camo
-Good vehicle selection
-Challenging, but not broken Heli mechanics. (No one heli dominating the map)
-Just Easy to jump into, play a match or two
-Devs are always trying to keep a balance.
-Devs are not afraid to ban cheaters on the mass (which they do and its glorious)

Cons
-Nothing on the games end.

Seriously people.

If you like a Battlefield game that is just fun and easy to jump into, and don't care about your target being more square than normal.
Buy this, play this get a new sense of Nostalgia.

Edit as of January 2024,
The game is still very fun and the core game play of it is as fun as on release, however as the time went by the majority of the casuals left the game. Although I wouldn't call the game sweaty it is much more competitive and you cant just goof around anymore and the vibe just isn't the same as on release which is really sad.

There is NO variety in what is viable. People use the same 5 guns. Seriously, I don't see much of any of the game's broad suite of weapons outside of the 2 carbines, 1 pdw, 1 sniper rifle, and 1 lmg everyone runs. Classes are more of a flavor choice, as they are very difficult to distinguish from each other, outside of just the recon class. Every other class has access to most of the weapon and gadget sandbox, with the differentiation coming from the one class specific gadget.
Support is comically worthless, with every weapon starting with 5 or more magazines and a TTK so fast that you can usually kill 4 or more guys per mag. Assault is just poor-man's engineer, so you will usually see just a mountain of medics (cuz they have self heals for days) and some engineers (cuz they have all the best explosives), with none of the assault class's dogwater chaff. Vehicles are useless for map traversal cuz you move at speeds which would put Sonic the Hedgehog to shame, and aside from that, they're so incredibly fragile that it is a death sentence to ride one. Tanks would be worthless as well, but to compensate for the inherent squishiness, they absurdly fast. I've seen the Abrams outrun a friggin atv. 

I assume a lotta people like the game so much just because it implements a lotta features bf fans have been begging for for years: helicopter rappelling, corpse dragging, combining/swapping mags... but like, the game is so fast and twitchy that you don't really care. the TTK is insane, so mag swapping or combining mags on the fly is WORTHLESS. along with that, all the weapon reload animations are so slow that when you die, its 100% of the time going to be when you chose to try and reload. seriously, it feels sometimes like there isn't a single reload animation in the game that is under 3.5-4 seconds. When you can die in 3-4 shots by a guy who just bullet-trained around the corner at mach speed, these animations standout as at odds with the design philosophy of the gunplay. You also generally don't give a heck about dragging your dead buddy around the corner to safety when you're trying hard not to get clipped instantly like him. And helicopter rappelling sounds cool, yeah, until you realize these choppers run on jet fuel and there's seemingly no limit to the amount of guys who can rappel on a line at once, so while your squads played smarter and beat back the enemy, 30 of their guys just whipped on their piece of string tied to a hyperspeed chopper out to your rear point and completely destroyed any sense of having to use tactics or being strategic to gain an edge. It feels more like an exploit than a feature. It adds further to the sense that this game is fundamentally torn between twitchy high speed shooter and traditional big team battle shooter. Choosing your packs and armor and other stuff and that having an effect on your speed and amount of throwables is cute, though. Again, darn shame these inclusions are kinda lost on a shooter that feels like you gotta be chugging Ritalin to keep up with.
The maps are dreadful. I cannot explain what it is about them, but there's very few with actual good flow. I don't have anything else to say. They're just bad.
Also, the progression is MISERABLE. It is such a grind to get to the most poop-tier stuff starting out. You have to be absolutely nose to the ground SNIFFIN like a DAWG and SWEATIN like a HOG for xp. the weekly challenges don't help, either, as they're usually such specific tasks that you have to have an iron will to commit to them, or they're just tedious ""get fifty quadrillion-tillion points as (x) class""

All in all, I don't recommend this game for those out there trying to get a battlefield experience. It is clearly a game made with passion and a committed team, but it just doesn't stick the landing. there's just too much conflict between the game's many good-in-a-vacuum systems, and the TTK issues absolutely butcher it and take it from ""awesome bf offshoot passion project"" to ""lightspeed twitch shooter, but with enormous maps.""

- Multiple mod, but in the end, everything is just a team deathmatch. A blob of guy rushing in one direction, no strategy.
- Yeah but you can have different squad with specialty (tank, helicopter, recon,...) , no? Squad system is just useless. The only thing they are made for, is squad communication. A recon squad can have all the roles (medic, engineer,...) and can drive a tank... most of the time people just pick a squad randomly so in the end, the squad are useless... You want to go for a tank squad? Sorry, but first, you'll need to be lucky to have a map which allows tank. Secondly, you'll have to be fast coz everyone can pick the tank, even normal squad. In which world does that make sense? And you can't buy a tank for your squad of course... and if the tank die, you'll need to wait for like 6 min to get another one.
- Infantry? Well, you might be able to have some fun at the beginning when you try to understand the game. But once you'll enter deeper in the game, you'll find that the binding are bugged. Don't try to go too fast if you want to swap weapon, medic kit, etc... sometimes it won't work, or pick something completely different. Animation are bugged as hell and you'll be blocked in the terrain / building often. Your character unable to walk on a little step forcing you to jump and thus making you vulnerable of course...
- Shooting 5 bullets on someone and not killing him with an AK47? yeah sometimes even 3 bullets in the head is not enough. You'll also encounter people exploiting, hiding in some spot where you can't touch them while being able to shoot you easily.

I could continue to enumerate things like that again and again... That's sad, really sad, cause the game has potential. But all these things make the game frustrating and raging.

The recent changes have really messed it up. Though the game doesn't have one-shot kills (except headshots) and gives you lots of tools to move in cover and concealment (loads of vehicles, smoke grenade launchers, etc.), the devs have decided to punish snipers for existing. Since rifles now draw a line in the air directly to the shooter, moving with your team, flanking, and providing mid-field spawns and overwatch is punished - your position is immediately revealed and everyone in a 100m radius shoots you. Meanwhile, camping at extreme ranges is encouraged. Shouldn't this be flipped? I feel like a grumpy old man pointing out that the Battlefield games that inspired BBR didn't do this - or even have scope glint - and snipers were balanced by careful movement and good map design. (BBR maps tend to be massive, wide-open sniper-fests connecting very dense urban areas, with little in-beetween.)

Overall, I'm going to keep playing the game. This is because the community is generally positive (through no contribution of my own) and people actually use their mics. The gameplay is somewhat more fun than Squad and definitely faster-paced than ARMA. In fact, it's basically a Battlefield 4 reboot with a Minecraft engine. Oh, and most walls can be broken with a hammer or explosive, which is fun.

- The best weapon in the game is any belt-fed LMG with a red dot. They have minimum recoil and you can hold the trigger down indefinitely, with a moderate reload time. In fact, they kind of ruin the game; hence why I play with one. 
- Snipers are underpowered, as you need a direct face shot to kill or the helmet deflects the shot. If you hit helmet or body armor, your target escapes as you zoom out to chamber another round. Sniper battles are a battle of attrition that is won by who has the most bandages. Scopes >=5x have the shining light feature to grab people's attention. Scopes <5x have awful fish eye that makes using them suck.
- DMRs have a ton of kickback and are subject to the above scope issues and do even less damage. The only reason people use them is when snipers and DMRs are banned, because you can't disable DMRs as a class.
- SMGs and assault rifles are decent if you can handle the lack of ammo.
- Rocket launchers are maybe a bit too prevalent, as you can point them anywhere to blow up walls and people.
- Vehicles are pretty decent, but not as fun as Battlefield vehicles, even though they are modeled on the same thing. Viewing can be difficult.
- For infantry and vehicles, aiming down over a ledge or vehicle edge makes your reticle bounce all over the place. This includes drones, which can make spotting difficult.
- You can be revived any amount of times and restored to max HP, but every time you die, your bleedout time is cut in half. There SHOULD be an icon above your marker if you need a revive, because people with their volume off often walk right past a dead guy. People tend to waste the ticket if you try to pick them  up anyways.
- Spawning in on a teammate often gets you insta-killed by a hidden enemy.
- Dying often sends you through the wall or floor.
- Vaulting is nice unless you have to keep doing it to get up a straight slope or have to hump a wall until it will recognize that it is vaultable.

Every session, if I let myself bleed out all the way, I end up with a black screen. This persists into the menu and even if you somehow manage to respawn. The only solutions are to spawn and kill yourself or somehow close the game, even though you can't see other windows, either. This is a VERY annoying bug.

A seemingly related bug is that on anything larger than a 64v64 map, at any point in the battle, the game just freezes and does the black screen thing. Except, since you froze, the only thing you can do is restart your computer because you can't see other windows through the black. If you're lucky, you plug in another monitor and hit random buttons until the Task Manager moves to that screen and kill the game. This is very disruptive.

Other glitches include being able to shoot but not use any buttons besides movement buttons until respawn and my mic not working until I toggled the settings a bunch of times. People are a lot more responsive when they can hear you.",1704500671,1705172947,False,1,0,0.518291294574737549,0,True,False,True

Snipers have been nerfed into oblivion with multiple negative changes. I used to love sniping in this game and now it is completely unappealing. 
Sound audio was altered, and was horrendous. Their recent fix has made it even worse. Enemy gunfire sounds like it's right next to you, when they're 100m+ away. Makes you realize your own gunfire is a sure position giveaway.
Foot audio is absurdly loud, especially enemies now. I can hear people running/approaching too far away (some would appreciate this and abuse, however it can be disorienting)

This doesn't do that to you. This feels like people who play video games made a video game, and it's good.

The gameplay itself is solid, shooting feels good, gunplay is good, feedback is good, yeah yeah yeah, but you knew that already, this is probably like your fifth positive review you've seen.

It's like a healthy mix between squad and old battlefield.

What I really want to draw your attention to is the lack of monitization and the price.  This is probably the best experience I've had with a battlefield game since bf1's beta. It's 15 dollars. You earn all your cosmetics and guns and customization through gameplay. And it's not even trying to sell you anything the entire time. I can go an entire game without having to think about how much better I would be doing if I just paid 5 dollars for the skin that gives me chameleon skin, followed by a apology a week later after they make their money off it, saying 'we didn't realize that the skin that blends in with everything would be game breaking, next one will only be in the battle pass'.

What you have here is a video game. Not a store that you paid 70 dollars to shop in.

Edit: Smgs are a mess right now with the kriss vector being the meta and having a very little amount of recoil while gun almost identical to it except it does 4 damage more has over 2.6 vertical recoil making it almost unusable even in single fire.

They nerfed snipers into the dirt and when you do get an enemy sniper that is actually good they still are dominant which what was the point of nerfing them if the problem did not get fixed? The grenade spam on even 32 vs 32 is outrageous and honestly grenades should not be part of this game or at least not in there current form anyone having more than 1 grenade is stupid. the Assault class does not really have much going for them other than more Armour than the medic class and there one cool gadget the riot shield is so easily maneuvered around you are throwing if you use it. Smgs need nerfs against Armour globally so people are encouraged to run something else. Recon needs a look. medic needs nerfs such as not being able to run smgs and move that over to assault class the movement needs a look because people just drop shot and get back up before your corpse hits the ground,

 [*]Unneeded and unrequested reclassification of weapons that removed them from certain classes.
 [*]Nerfing the recon class into the ground (regardless of how you feel about it).
 [*]Horrible audio changes that make spatial awareness worse and eliminate any attempt at being stealthy or tactical.
 [*]Redundant squad changes that just obfuscate the squad system for no reason.
 [*]Working on cosmetic skins that are only available if you watch 6+ hours of twitch streamer instead of balancing content.
 [*]Refusal to nerf air strafing.
 [*]Only taking suggestions/feedback from their cesspool of a discord channel.

The game has a very bad identity crisis between trying to be a milsim game and an arcade shooter (regardless of what Oki says about the future updates not being milsim). These 2 things clash too much and the 1 dev actually doing to development has no clue where the game is going.

With the whole restructuring thing happening, nothing will change because Oki will never give up the reigns to any actual developmental changes. You can hire 20 modelers and level designers, but when the core gameplay doesn't match that content, nothing changes.

It was fun back in the summer, and I may pop in for a round or 2 a week, but that just reinforces my continued disappointment of the game development.",1705073077,1705073342,False,29,0,0.666756749153137207,0,True,False,True

Developed by a small team of just three individuals, this game has raised the bar for indie shooters and established itself as a formidable competitor to industry giants like ""Battlefield"", despite its unconventional ""Roblox"" graphics.

While the graphics of ""BattleBit"" may seem simple at first glance, they provide the game with a unique visual identity. The clear lines and minimalist design contribute to a streamlined gaming environment that enhances the overall player experience. Character movements are smooth, and weapon details are surprisingly well-crafted, proving that graphics are not always the decisive factor for an immersive gaming experience. ""After you played a while, your brain upgrades the graphics automatically""

The true strength of ""BattleBit"" lies in its innovative gameplay. The combination of fast gunfights, tactical thinking, and a variety of weapons creates a captivating gaming experience. The small development team has demonstrated that it's not just about quantity but about the quality and passion invested in the game's design.

The gaming community has enthusiastically embraced the title, appreciating the relative regular updates and the developers' commitment to player feedback. ""BattleBit"" has established itself as a serious contender among industry giants, showcasing that creative ideas and passionate execution are often just as crucial as a large budget.

A notable highlight is the extensive weapon customization that ""BattleBit"" offers. Players have the opportunity to customize their weapons down to the smallest detail, impacting not only the game's aesthetics but also providing tactical advantages. The ""CamoGrind"" – the pursuit of unique camouflage patterns and cosmetic upgrades – adds an additional layer to the game, motivating players to showcase their skills.

""BattleBit"" exemplifies that indie games with limited resources can create exceptional gaming experiences. It is not just a game but a testament to the idea that innovation and fun gameplay are often more important than realistic graphics. Definitely a must-have for those seeking an intense shooter experience outside the mainstream, especially with the added joy of multiplayer mode and exciting weapon customizations.

The player base now that the game isn't on sale is suddenly very different. The games are extremely sweaty and you die almost instantly upon peeking anywhere.

I honesty cant recommend this game anymore; the combination of the giant head hit-boxes and the .2  second TTK is just disgusting.  There is no chance to ever counter play/shoot  and it just leads to a skill-less game of who can shoot who in the back.

I guess thats why it went from 80,000 players to only 5000 players. Its just not interesting.

Still unplayable because 50-70% of players are cheaters (Don't believe me? Read the paragraph below).

It's funny that on the discord server of this game, every week people send screenshots during waves of bans, these screenshots show how half or more of the server is banned (more than 100 banned players in one screenshot). At the same time, cheaters do not care about these bans. Because the account is banned and not the PC hardware. And that's why scammers continue to buy cheap accounts and cheat. All this shows that really in every game half of the players play with cheats, do you want to play such a game? xd

The review is not written by a person who plays games like BF for the first time, but by someone who has many thousands of hours in games of this genre. 

60 Hz servers in 2023
Even after the improved hit registration in patch 2.1.4 there is still a cringe: American servers with ping 112 register hits better (albeit with a delay) than European servers with ping 33.

Some 1d1ot in the dev team thought that each player, which be 250+ in one match can have 4-7 claymore mines. Having a bit of analysis and intelligence, you can imagine what problems this causes in the active gameplay.

Also, the game has a weapon modding system, which in fact does not exist. Seriously weapon mods are 95% useless. Because 95% of those mods give 1-2% advantage and take away 1-2% advantage (some take away more than they give xdd). You'll end up using 2 muzzle mods, 1 grip, and 2 sights on all weapons...

The game also uses an outdated recoil system for 10-15 years. The system when shooting takes your muzzle into the sky xd Seriously this system was relevant 15 years ago. It looks silly now... Also, with the development of macros, it is not safe in relation to the ecosystem of the game. Because any child of 8 years old can use free macros for shooting with 0 recoil.



Conclusion

Another game killed by cheaters because of a joke called EAC.

When the developers realize that EAC is a scam, a frank scam. You are being deceived, this hyped-up, hyped sh1t does not fight cheaters. They milk your wallet.
EAC should flag the cheater on all components of the pc. If a player cheats in one game then in any other game with EAC it should be auto ban. But EAC is a joke that siphons money from developers and is useless.",1687223224,1705007686,False,0,1,0.493090271949768066,0,True,False,True

Same goes for some customization items etc. In a dev stream they say ""Expect it soon"" ""We will add it"", then nothing. I get it, this is the first time they became successful and they are excited about it, but don't speak without thinking.

I like investing my time into games. Grind, make friends etc. But it's not worth doing with this game due to this uncertain way they handle it.

A respected teacher in the local school, Adam was known for his gentle demeanor and passion for educating the young minds under his guidance. However, fate had a different plan for him, a plan veiled in the mysterious dust that lingered in the corners of the world.

One fateful evening, as Adam strolled through the forgotten alleys on his way home, he stumbled upon an ancient relic—an ethereal dust soul concealed in the shadows. Drawn by an inexplicable force, he reached out and touched the pulsating energy. In an instant, the soul merged with him, shrouding his being in a malevolent aura. The once warm eyes of Adam Chan turned into a haunting spectacle— one eye glowing with a menacing red hue, while the other emanated an eerie purple light.

The transformation was more than just physical; it twisted the core of his soul, warping Adam into a psychopathic entity that reveled in chaos. From that moment forward, he cast away his previous identity and embraced the name Dust Adam. The once beloved teacher became a harbinger of fear, wandering through the town's darkest corners with a copper rod as his chosen instrument of chaos.

The Blue Room, a mysterious space hidden from the prying eyes of the town's inhabitants, became Dust Adam's haunting playground. Within its walls, he engaged in sinister battles, his every move calculated and merciless. The echoes of his malevolent laughter resonated through the Blue Room, leaving a trail of apprehension in its wake.

Yet, amidst the shadows, Dust Adam found an unusual connection to Chan Her, a gifted piano player in the town. It was said that Dust Adam had the ability to manipulate time within the Blue Room, and whenever he entered its confines, the tempo of Chan Her's piano playing intensified, creating an otherworldly symphony that captivated those who dared to listen.

The townsfolk spoke in hushed whispers about the enigmatic figure that once was Adam Chan, now transformed into the malevolent force known as Dust Adam. Little did they know that his story was far from over, and the haunting melody of his existence echoed through the town, leaving a chilling legacy in its wake.

The characters hitbox is much larger than it seems so you get shot in the top of your head or arm when on your screen you're behind cover. 

The bandaging and bleeding gets very repetitive and annoying since you need to do it after basically every engagement.

Vehicles are underwhelming.

Weapon customization is really good but everything is just a semi or automatic rifle, it doesn't even have shotguns yet. Real magazine management is very cool to see and wish it was standard in games.

Excessive explosives, did you play Battlefield? Do you remember Metro? Yeah, the worst map in the entire game made exclusively for lobbing explosives or sniping down massive hallways. That is what this game is, but all the time on almost every single map save like 3 perhaps. 

The game NEEDS to limit the amount of snipers allowed per squad and per team and explosives need to be dialed back a lot, not in damage, but in amount. A lot of battles end up nothing more than grenade and rpg fights while if you stick your head out for a second, don't worry, some dipshit is gonna nail you with a sniper rifle while you can't do anything with any gun you've picked.

This game suffers the same problems any large team based shooter has, it is too afraid to restrict the worst parts making the game insufferable to play through a lot of the time. There is NOTHING fun about being nailed by 1 of 20 fucking snipers on the other side who do nothing but sit in spawn or on a tower and snipe this also goes for the fact that almost every sniper is just some chud who can't actually hit anything, but decides they wanna be Elite Sniper and sit in base while you lose objectives everywhere.

The fun of 1 individual shouldn't ruin the fun of everyone else and yet it does. 

Snipers. Ruin. FPS Games. and so do excessive explosives. This is a SHOOTING GAME, not a grenade lobbing game. 

The devs need to stop being cowards and limit explosives and snipers. ",1689444688,1704838833,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

One is that this is a game that's trying to be a better battlefield. But just like battlefield this game has the most unrealistic recoil worst then battlefield 2042 where you can just hold down the trigger from over 200m out with basically any gun and kill anyone of course if your a new player you don't get this your weapon will have recoil like your guy has never shot a gun in his life. You can also shot through walls like your playing COD and kill anyone. The game has this armor you can get but not if your new so have fun shooting a player that's been playing this game for way longer because 80% of them will have this ridiculous armor. another thing i don't think we need in this game is the fact that if you have no armor you bleed. Which yes in real life if you got shot you would bleed but with being a new player and not having this armor almost everyone else has its really annoying. And finally the maps they are ok but nothing to be wowed over. Of course it does have its goods too like the amount of weapons in the game for a early access. And the fact that if a teammate is down and you cant really revive them at that spot you can drag there body to a safe place and revive them there. Another big thing is all the gun attachments that are in the game there is so many. If you feel like you could set on this game and grind it out go for it but if your looking for a game that's better then battlefield 2042 this is not it in my opinion.

This is a update after playing more of the game i can say that the game is already basically dead. And that there are a lot of sus players not to mention the m200 sniper is the most busted sniper in the game.

today we'll be performing a maintenance
check on the 2006 Nissan Murano just
like in combat preparation is key
before we begin make sure you have the
appropriate tools and materials
including a new oil filter oil pan and
funnel 

step one :
locate the vehicle's oil
filter this is akin to finding a needle
in a haystack but with your enhanced
armor and tactical knowledge you should
be able to pinpoint it in no time

Step 2 :
remove the old oil filter this is
like taking out a grunt with a plasma
grenade it requires precision and
finesse be sure to place the oil pan
underneath to catch any spilled oil lest
we leave a sticky mess like the flood on installation 04.

step 3 :
drain the old oil this is where
we let gravity do the work just like how
we let gravity help us descend from
orbit simply unscrew the oil plug and
let the oil flow into the oil pan 
step 4 :
replace the oil filter this is like
swapping out a weapon in the middle of a
firefight you have to be quick and
efficient make sure the new oil filter
is properly tightened to prevent leaks
and dispose of the old filter like you
would dispose of an old Plasma Pistol

step 5 :
add the new oil

this is like recharging your energy

Shield It's the final step in making
sure the vehicle is ready for action
use the funnel to pour in the
appropriate amount of oil and make sure
to double check the oil level with the
dipstick and there you have it Spartans

changing the oil on a 2006 Nissan Murano
is just like a mission it requires
preparation precision and attention to
detail follow these steps and you'll be
back on the road in no time just like we
were able to beat back the Covenant and
the flood with our quick thinking and tactical expertise",1704774356,1704774356,True,0,0,0.471014469861984253,0,True,False,True

It is basically for people who can't afford to buy Battlefield 2042 or can afford a PC to play it.

It feels like you are playing inside a library with yourself, it just feels like a large room with very few people in it, very quiet, sound does not travel far and there is no distance or depth. 

The good thing about this game is that because of the very rudimentary cartoonish Minecraft-like graphics, it is able to run fast. It has pretty basic PC requirement to run. Again, it is really for poor people who can't afford Battlefield 2042 or a PC to play it.

Whenever I die it feels like I was one-shot Sniped. The audio blends a bit. IDK if that's the issue, but I find myself wondering WTF almost every death. Aside from that it's a great inspired by  Battlefield type game. I have been with it since way back before the early release, and the gunfight part hasn't Changed, every time I stopped playing, it was due to frustration in that aspect. so I will say thumbs down for me.

For some, this game will be amazing, for others, it's nothing special. This game is the product of the state of the industry today. It's praised because it WORKS. Not because it's special.

-You pay $15.00 and get basically a full-featured battlefield game out the box, minus the graphical fidelity.

-You get a progression and leveling system that doesn't require a battlepass or separate purchase.

-The customization is awesome, and all of it is apart of the game. No buying skins or paywalls after the first purchase (though, there is one ""supporter"" pack that gives you skins... But that's WAY better than what any AAA game is doing now. I'm sure they'll add more ""packs"" as the game gets more popular though.. why wouldn't they?).

-Customization of controls is now AMAZING. This was one thing I wanted to see change, and now it has!

-Swapping weapons and switching stances can still feel a little slow, despite their efforts to buff sprint speed, healing, etc. Since last year they've made HUGE progress in fixing this though, and the game has felt better than ever before!

-Bleeding is annoying, but not as annoying as it used to be. Maybe when bleeding, you stay at 1% health instead of just dying from it.

-There needs to be a way to turn of screen shake entirely. Even with it OFF, you still get shakes. It doesn't bother me as much, but I know for some this will definitely cause motion sickness.

What other people are saying:

-Some people don't like the grind, but to be honest the grind present is so benign that I am surprised people complain compared to other waaay more grindy games. If you only play for an hour or less a day, then there's obviously no way you're going to progress significantly.. But that's with almost every game. Also, a lot of people will ""main"" a class instead of experimenting and changing classes based on the situation... Just try more stuff? You still unlock new attachments and cosmetics for guns if you keep to one class anyways, just like battlefield, so IDK why people are whining about it. You dont have to pay for a battlepass for progression, and to me that's a WIN.

-Some people don't like the voice monitoring to try tackling man-babies. IMO, I don't really have an issue with it anymore because literally every company and government is listening in. It shouldn't be that way, but it's not something that is gonna push me away from these devs. if you don't like that, 100% can relate, don't buy the game if that's the case, just know that SOMEONE is always listening at this point, and there's no stopping ""Big Brother"". If you're the type of person who likes using slurs, maybe this just isn't the game for you (and maybe you should rethink a couple things about yourself). Just sayin'.

-Some people don't like how fast paced the game can get and how good some players are. That's just the nature of ANY multiplayer game at this point, because almost everyone in the first world is online nowadays and competition is fiercer than ever before, especially because a lot of people already have FPS backgrounds. If you don't want to learn a game, that's fine, but don't expect a shooter to baby you into it- you gotta learn the game to be good at it... you can't just be good off the start.

Still it has some shortcomings like any game.

- on the paper the game offers a lot of maps/gamemodes but you will find yourself more often than not playing conquest 
  on the same 5 maps due to the voting system.
- medic got the best utility/regen/XP and the best weapon classes. wich makes the other classes kinda subpar since he 
   exceedes in almost all situation the other classes should have the upperhand. 
- some weapons are clearly stronger than others in thier class.

Important to remind that it's a battlefied clone, meaning it doesn't reward skill, aiming or reflexes.

bad points:

* Binaural sound is probably broken: I cannot situate other players only based on footsteps, quite frustrating

* Many things are barely visible because of color/contrast/texture choices: teammate visual indicator, capture point letter (too transparent), red dot sight, sniper optic... even text is unreadable in potato mode. Probably caused by arbitrary resolution.

* maps are too complex, too many angles, always getting attacked from all sides, overlay map is not readable, cannot see if there are buildings. In many maps, I end up getting spawn camped.",1704645047,1704645047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I’ve been playing BattleBit Remastered for a few days and I have to say, it’s one of the most fun and addictive FPS games I’ve ever played. The game offers a massive multiplayer experience with up to 254 players per server, battling on huge maps with various vehicles and destructible environments. The game is inspired by the Battlefield series, but with a low-poly aesthetic that gives it a unique charm and personality.

The game has six classes to choose from, each with their own loadouts and roles. You can be a squad leader, an assault, a medic, a support, an engineer, or a recon. Each class has access to a variety of weapons and attachments that you can unlock and customize as you rank up. The game also has a proximity-based voice chat system that allows you to communicate with your teammates and enemies in real time.

The game is still in early access, but it’s already very polished and stable. The developers are very active and responsive, constantly updating the game with new features, bug fixes, and improvements. The game also has a very friendly and supportive community, with players from all over the world.

If you’re looking for a low-poly FPS game that offers a chaotic, team-oriented, and immersive gameplay, then BattleBit Remastered is the game for you. It’s a game that you can play for hours and never get bored, as every match is different and unpredictable. It’s a game that rewards skill, strategy, and teamwork, but also allows you to have fun and experiment. It’s a game that you won’t regret buying, as it’s well worth the price and will only get better with time.

I highly recommend BattleBit Remastered to anyone who loves FPS games, low-poly graphics, or just having a blast with friends and strangers. It’s a game that deserves more attention and recognition.",1704125344,1704631975,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

First off, do expect to die a lot and often with no idea where you are being shot from.  People who are dead or prone are easily mistaken for each other.  Player visibilty is a significant problem that will come up in every match you play.
On top of this, everything comes with a side of jank.  Examples would be a lengthy prestige system with no extra unlocks to help you get back to the stuff you actually want, or the very unituitive weapon attachment and camo applying systems.  Most of the menus are also very clunky to navigate through, including spawn selection during a match.
Battlebit has many other issues that plague it. The game balance is horrid, the netcode is atrocious, and the vehicle gameplay is both uninteresting and unfun for both sides.
Hopefully this helps with setting expectations of what the game is.",1697990009,1704622720,False,0,0,0.513498008251190186,0,True,False,True

I was correct, this game was such garbage that people deleted it after a day or 2 of gaming, because it simply isnt what big youtubers promised, its just a dogwater copy of squad with garbage visibility pretending to be a battlefield

lets be honest, only reason this garbage is popular is because both battlefield and cod suck, and to spite them you will enjoy this garbage.
anyways onto the actual review

The Grind: 
-- too long, becomes even longer because of shit gunplay.
The Gunplay: 
- - Recoil: am i firing a bmg 50 cal or a fucking AR, cant tell.
- - Weight feel: only good thing about the gameplay
- - Spread: Sometimes i feel like im shooting a shotgun but with only one pellet.

The Gameplay:
- - Pay-To-Win: NONE
- - Map Design: Extremely good
- - Flanking Routes: Plenty
- - UI Design: Trash[1]

- - Funny strats: only 2

1 - The UI is missing critical features such as a Minimap and 3D spotting. Making visibility 0

Little hard to see enemies it feels a bit like he who see's first kills first unless you cant shoot. I need a mini map I feel like the awareness of my surroundings and which direction I'm going in is lost. I do not even care if enemies come up on the map though it may help but more so for direction instead of constantly looking at map to figure out my location. Lots of playing time and memorizing maps would fix this but early on thoughts. Time to kill is way to fast that is one of the worst parts so far. Often I do not get much more then a glance of something and I drop dead. This leads me to think moving slow and camping wins out using sound which is pretty good. I spend most of my time putting on bandages which is boring after the first 20 ""perhaps a quick pat to show I cared and a slow heal on its own"". Around this stuff and getting used to the graphics its got a nice little feel. Some chatting which is better than most games going on even if its sly little remarks here or there but reminds you of the old style of bigger games when everyone could and would chat. Guns shoot pretty good compared to even way higher end games. Just goes to show the concept of aim is simple so leave it alone and stop trying to make it so creative. Does not feel like any SBMM I see people more lost than I am after a few hours of play time and those hardcore have not left the couch in months players. Once again a nice all around feel most games seem to be missing. Either way good little game something I will play a bit but not really a long term hanger for me personally. We'll see though maybe some of the better guns will tickle my pickle ;-).

After a lot more playing and getting a bit better... The SBMM is def a thing in here as I move up my lobbies get crazy  hard. Really one for one over and over. First day lots of odd ball people just standing around. Does not feel manipulated like other games but still there. Still hate no mini map hard to figure out orientation on the fly. Hit reg or servers are wierd. Some rounds feels like I'm melting others like it takes most of a mag with constant hit markers to drop a guy. Some rounds are lots of fun others are like why am I playing this game lol. Sometimes its the sbmm and other times its the hit reg while sometimes its the maps and modes. Not sure why we all want to get stuck at one junction for 30 minutes doing nothing in either direction but nading and hoping for kills. Flat maps are nice to take away from the snipers nipping at ya 24/7 from 1700 yards. Kinda annoying to drop from what feels like an aimbot headshot in some rounds constantly. Flat maps take away that sniper and make him able to only cover a smaller area instead of entire map from outside the objectives.

On the release the game was something beautiful, battlefield but more fun and a little bit more realistic some said. And it was true. One of the things that were beautiful in this game was freedom, you could just take any class you wanted respawn wherever you wanted and just casually play the game. No rules. No stupid excluding weapons like in battlefield games with most servers. And most importantly every class had it's own purpose with their pros and cons. Unfortunately from update to update game had become worse and worse to the state where it's simply lost it's charm. Now when joining game you are asked on what squad would you like to join and that is restricted with rules like sniper squad or tank squad. Last sound update makes guns sound worse than most of the 2000 games. In one update the community servers were added and it was a good move but sadly some of them have strict rules and most of them awful moderators (those are also on official servers). And finally balancing in this game is just a joke and clearly devs aren't listening to the players who are constantly playing the game and have some hours and know what's happening in the game but instead to the people coming from the hype and free weekends. It's just sad to see a great game like this being slowly killed :(",1704594688,1704594688,False,9,0,0.564256072044372559,0,True,False,True

It's extremely rare to play anything but Conquest (which is arguably the worst game mode, especially compared to the superior Frontline) and a few maps all during the day. The lack of variety and relatively low speed at which you unlock new things (new guns most notably) make the game tedious at times. While new gun unlocks are slow, many of the weapons are not good and are vastly inferior to other weapons, making weapon choice stylistic over functional which kinda sucks. Class balance and class variety is also very bad, with most people just playing medic or engineer because medics are the only class that can heal and engineers get RPG's which are the best tool for getting kills and basically the only thing that can destroy vehicles and buildings without getting right next to them with C4. Often it's difficult to tell what can or can't be destroyed, and many destructible walls have non-destructible walls behind them. That being said there is quite a bit of fun to be had, it captures that peak Planetside 2 energy for me. 7/10

Edit: One year later and all the problems the game had at launch still exist and to an extent are exacerbated. There's more maps, only a few are every actually played, so map variety might as well not exist. There's more gamemodes, but the only mode anyone votes on is Conquest, so every other mode might as well not exist. There's more guns, only 3-4 guns are actually used because they are objectively better and, therefore, the variety might as well not exist. Vehicles and explosives are still BiS and point farms. The leveling is slightly faster and easier than before. They expanded the usage of bandages for the other classes making Medics less important and even obsolete in many regards as their healing is slower than using a bandage, and only rez allies faster at the cost of worse gadgets, and limited gear choices. Game population has died off quite a bit, but there are still a decent amount of individuals that still play. 6/10 It's close to being an amazing game, but lack of balancing and variety bogged it down into mediocrity that gets more and more draining as time goes on.",1688538850,1704499506,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

At times ... this game looks like a grumpy mess waiting for a flush, but it plays damn near exactly how I want a modern war game to, making it a potential contender for the throne of favorite FPS in the large-scale, huge-map, fast-paced war game genre. It's really something special. They've nailed the mechanics and gunplay.

The initial progress might seem a tad slow, and the textures might be minimalistic, but once you adapt, the game reveals itself as a very competent war shooter. Because of the minimal graphical demands, stacking these matches with such high amounts of players and constant action doesn't seem to cause any meaningful slow down or performance problems. It's smooth! Which makes the chaos all the more frightening! 😈

If you've not played a Battlefield game (by DICE), then this might be one of the best entry points you can take at the time of writing this (2024). It's incredibly affordable by comparison. BattleBit Remastered encapsulates everything a hardcore FPS enthusiast dreams of – massive maps, colossal teams, drivable air, nautical, and land vehicles, upgradable weapons, an XP leveling system, team squads, and much more. It's a colossal masterpiece, and the fact that it's not crafted by a AAA studio is mind-blowing. Sure, it might not be the most graphically dazzling spectacle, but boy, does it play like a dream.

Chaos is the essence of war, and Battle Bit certainly gets this right. They've done a fine job with physics, bullet drop, class/weapon progression - and the maps are mostly great - it all contribute to an immersive experience. A few tweaks in some maps might be nice, but that's probably down to personal taste.

This was the first multiplay FPS game I've played since I was a kid that made me question who was on my team and who the enemy combatants were. I...I think I might be getting old? I'm 34 - so I'll just blame the minimal design choices throughout and chalk it up to that. It does get more obvious as time goes on (or something was improved via a patch - it is an early access game). It turns out there is a slightly green or red mark somewhere around their shoulder/neck area. One thing that hasn't improved, spotting anyone from a distance - it doesn't seem to be working as I'd expect. A bit finicky.

I've heard many complaints of hackers from other players, but I can't say I've had a single encounter that even made me question or consider if someone was cheating or using some sort or exploit or tool. It largely seems like a pretty fair playerbase - albeit some could use a lesson in microphone etiquette, but that's par for the course in any online FPS. 

With it still being Early Access, just in the few weeks I've played - a few UI changes and patches have come out. It seems regular progress is being made, balancing happens at a reasonable rate, and the devs are responsive to the community.

Still in Early Access, BattleBit Remastered constantly evolves. Regular UI changes and patches roll out, showcasing a responsive development team dedicated to refining the gaming experience. If you crave large-scale FPS battles, a robust XP progression system, fast and twitchy gunplay, and a touch of optional team strategy, BattleBit Remastered is a slam dunk, an easy win that demands your attention. Highly recommended for those who seek the thrill of war on an epic scale. I'll certainly be back for lots more.",1704483025,1704493856,True,37,0,0.73911440372467041,1,True,False,True

BattleBit, a spiritual successor to the beloved Battlefield series, has emerged as a delightful surprise in the gaming landscape, proving that a game doesn't need a massive budget to deliver an engaging and fun experience. Here's a brief review highlighting some of the game's standout features.

First and foremost, BattleBit impresses with its great variety of maps and weapons. From dense urban environments to sprawling landscapes, each map is meticulously designed, offering diverse settings that keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The attention to detail in the low-poly graphics adds a unique charm to the visuals, creating an aesthetic that is both nostalgic and refreshing.

The game boasts epic 127 vs. 127 battles, providing an exhilarating scale that captures the essence of large-scale warfare. The chaos on the battlefield is both intense and immersive, creating an environment where teamwork and strategy are crucial for success. The sheer scale of the battles adds a layer of realism and excitement rarely seen in games of this scale.

BattleBit wisely retains the traditional class system that Battlefield fans know and love. Players can choose roles that suit their playstyle, from the frontline assault to the more supportive roles like medic and engineer. This classic class system adds depth to the gameplay, encouraging team coordination and diverse strategies.

One standout feature that adds a unique touch to the experience is the death mic feature. Allowing players to communicate with their team even after they've been taken out adds a layer of strategy and camaraderie, making each life feel like a contribution to the overall battlefield effort.

The game's vehicle selection is another strong point, offering a good variety that complements the diverse maps. Whether it's roaring through the battlefield in a tank or providing air support with helicopters, the vehicles enhance the dynamic nature of the battles, allowing players to choose their preferred style of engagement.

BattleBit's rewarding system deserves praise, particularly for medics and support roles. The game recognizes the crucial contributions of these roles, incentivizing players to play supportively by providing meaningful rewards. This not only encourages a balanced and cooperative gameplay style but also ensures that every player feels valued in the overall success of their team.

Perhaps most impressively, BattleBit stands as a shining example that you don't need millions to make a fun and engaging game. The passion and dedication of the development team shine through in every aspect of the game, creating an experience that captures the essence of classic large-scale shooters without the need for a blockbuster budget.

In conclusion, BattleBit is a low-poly masterpiece that successfully channels the spirit of the Battlefield series. With its great variety of maps, massive battles, traditional class system, innovative death mic feature, diverse vehicle selection, and a rewarding system that values teamwork, BattleBit proves that a game can be both budget-friendly and immensely enjoyable. It stands as a testament to the idea that a dedicated team with a clear vision can create a gaming experience that rivals industry giants.",1704480030,1704480030,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ayy, yeaaah baby

[Verse 2: Monty]
Uh, yeah, Monty
Tell me what you see
Is it money or it’s me?

They like, ""Monty, can you be my baby daddy?""
I’m like, ""Yeah""
I got Robins on my jeans
You see the wings on every pair
All you see is Remy Boyz
You know my niggas everywhere
And if somebody got a problem
We could meet up anywhere
Now go say something
Don’t you niggas play dumb
You know where we came from
You don’t want sauce, no A1

ZooGang, you know my whole zoo near
And baby, I'm Zoovier

[Removed for album: P-Dice]
Ayy, she a cutie and she fine, make me wanna make her mine
She ain't nothing like them bimbos
If you like it, we can swerve, we can light and stain up here
Blowing, pluck it out the window
We get playing, press rewind, got her singing every time
Take a high note for me, girlfriend
Got my city looking rude
I ain't Diddy, I ain't Loon, but I think I need a girlfriend
She feeling great as I'm talking to her
She a RemyGirl, so I'm gon' pursue her
I brought a lot of loud, lot of Remy to sip on
Thousand dollars when I get my tip on
I'm off her, asked her if her fatty real
She said that's all her, got her with the happy feel
I'm 'bout to spoil her, got her with the happy feel
I'm 'bout to spoil her, oh my

[Chorus: Fetty Wap]
I'm like, yeah, she's fine
Wonder when she'll be mine
She walk past, I press rewind
Just to see that ass one more time
And I got this sewed up
Remy Boyz, they know us
All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ayy, yeaaah baby

I came back to see what the update was, also being back in the mood for a PVP game of quality. As someone who played every class depending on the need or my feeling, I don't see the point of playing anything other then rpg man or heavy armor man. as the best guns are smg's or DMR's even as a sniper and rpg man and heavy armor man have DMR's. 

Sniping is compleatly relegated to using the gun with the most damage since now even with a silencer all snipers emit a smoke trail from the bullet to you. so  no point in even trying to sneak a kill in tall grass with a enemy squad next to you since they will trace the smoke back to you. also no point in using switching barrel attachment for damage or for stealth since they removed the damage upgrade and again silencers are pointless. If you want to stealth, you just use a DMR with a silencer. the second DMR is guarantied a kill after 2-3 body hits while the first 2 snipers can be survived with a helmet making them 2 shots at worst. Since other classes have DMR and armour, why would you pick the sniper class?

Assault is also completely pointless since all assaulth rifle have awfull accuracy compared to SMGs, LMGs and DMRs. when they should be the most accurate. In fact when i first played the game there were only 2 dmr and the others in the class where assault rifles but where moved to dmr which is cross class. Assault also does not get anything special to carry like heavy ammo pouches or a RPG.

As for the RPG, the fragmentation rpg is completely useless against infantry and the HEAT and Tandem, both focused AT rounds will take out Infantry with in their blast radius, as well as do considerable environment damage and damage vehicles. 

I see no point in playing this game anymore. most servers don't have heavy vehicles to vary game play, Night time is rules by people who mess with their light settings since Night Vision wont work on any scope and scopes with night vision are horrible. Players also have glowing lights on their outfit which can be payed to win removed.

As for helicopters, the controls are arcady as heck. I can brake dead in the sky and move in all 6 direction like I was some ufo, meaning people with RPG stand no chance at actually hitting you since there is no velocity attached to the heli movement and therefor they cant predict the path you will take. Ground vehicles also have this weird behavior where reversing does not in fact reverse the steering directions. Although all vehicles have ""weak points"" I have hit helis dead on the body with the AT sabot round of a tank, resulting in minimal damage, while unloading a whole APC cannon magazine on a heli also does minimal damage. but a good hit from a rpg on a heli will result in critical damage as well as concentrated infantry fire.

honestly, I don't know what the devs are doing but they are killing the game. Devs if you see this, SMG's should not be accurate at longer range then ARs, LMGs should be accurate and hard hitting but not as accurate as AR's with out bipods and only heavy Snipers should emit a smoke trail.

It is really not hard even the british armory stated the same. it's like standard in every game where guns are in classes",1704413088,1704413311,False,4,0,0.523106276988983154,0,True,False,True

The graphics are amusing, and the stuff that matters is all there. They really nailed the feel of a lot of the weapons, the map design is pretty good and the destructibility is a literal blast. 

The community also has largely been pretty good, from the guys role playing their silly block men super seriously when calling for medics to actual cooperative team info it has been pretty good. And the options to mute and report people being so simple is the best I've seen in a game.

i don't really got any issues apart from how fast your character turns. you can do a full rotation on the spot with 0 loss of momentum. this also applies while airborne, jump and move your mouse enough and your soldier now closer resembles a mosquito

this movement can allow you to fly around the battlefield and become top of the leaderboard fairly quick, yea its fun yea im crybabying a bit because of all the sweats who also do it but you can also kinda tell movement like that isnt supposed to be in this game, go vault a barricade in this game right now, you get the full as experience of your character dragging two guns enough bullets to kill a dozen people and a bunch of other crap over the concrete menace that stands in your way. just saying you shouldnt be able to move like that in a battlefield-like game. grapple hooks (basically a deployable climbing rope, not a hook that lets you also fly anywhere you want) also sorta breaks letting you traverse vertically very easily but its not as a bad as previously mentioned in my opinion

1. Feels sluggish, max mouse sensitivity is not enough - Yes I've changed DPI to max, but now it's over sensitive when not aimed, and still not sensitive enough when aimed. This game is broken.

2. Unable to hold down W to go forward and press Z to crouch at same time. Pressing W and D also doesn't work well. Game needs multiple key input badly.

3. Many people are wayyy too good at this game - i literally died every time within a minute of spawn. Bullets come from all directions and sneaking up doesn't work either. Maybe i just suck.

4. Spawn protection should be lengthened I've been spawn killed many times within a fraction of a second.

I'm going to set the game aside for now and give it a go again later. It looks like this may have been a waste of money.",1688088298,1704330832,True,0,0,0.496510982513427734,4,True,False,True

Original review:

Surprisingly fun. For a small team, this game is great and I've got my moneys worth out of it. The fact that 90% of negative reviews are from salty children complaining about 'sweats' shows that there is little to hate here. 

Pro's
Great community 
Destructible environments
Great gun-play
Great sound design 
Great progression, never felt OP for being a higher level
Performance is excellent. 

Cons
Load in is too long- reduce it to 30 seconds 
Some of the maps are just ass
Vehicle handling could be better

I can barely tell an ally apart from an enemy when zooming in as the marker vanishes. You can spawn on a teammate to instantly die under gunfire or something. Audio confuses the crap outta me, enemy and ally footsteps sound the same. You can't tell where any shots are landing. You can't throw a grenade when you're out of ammo as the dumb reload mechanic makes sure it finishes reloading first before it throws. The scroll mechanic for weapons and equipment sucks, you can pull out something that has 0 ammo and it's just not very intuitive. healing is a hassle as you have to hold down 3 and bleeding makes no sense. You can start bleeding at over 60 hp or something and you need to bandage. I don't want to have to ever scroll onto bandages. Dragging players to safety is also a hassle as you have to press f to begin dragging em. The helicopter sensitivity and the mounted cannons and guns on vehicles are so low that it's a pain. I mean I get that motorized cannons would take more time but yeah. Also why do you even have to wind up the mini guns on the helicopter? It's irritating as crap to hear the sound of the spinning guns and in real life, you don't need to wind it up to begin shooting. It just shoots and later begins spinning. Basically, game play can be very frustrating for a beginner and if you're not a try hard, you ain't getting many kills cause the veteran players will either snipe you out of nowhere and gun velocity makes no sense. You can basically get sniped with a pistol and while the game is progression based in which you unlock scopes. attachments, equipment, and guns based off kills and game roles, it takes a long time. I'm almost 50 hours in, and I've only hit like rank 120 in which the max is 200, and you can prestige back to rank 1 to unlock more content like a clan. How does a beginner compare against veterans who've all unlocked like the highest range scopes so they can see you and kill you while you can't see them or even figure out where they are. The vehicles acts as bouncy balls and can literally fly when you move across a terrain. Basically, if you easily frustrated don't play this game. I just play out of boredom and pass time.

If you remember somehow slower gameplay on release then forget it because this is now call of duty where basically everything besides SMG is useless. best long distance rifle? probably an smg just like in cod. camos got kinda of a rework where now you can make a solid color out of a camo but there aren't any single color camos for that so bascially useless. at this point they could add sliding and slide canceling and killstreaks and there would be no difference in gameplay because of how cod like the game is. I bought it expecting realistic battlefield where bullets go where I aim and I've got big map call of duty with healing mechanics that will be probably deleted looking at which way the game goes. quick note for the devs. Stop appealing to everyone this isn't how you make your game alive. if you appeal to everyone then you are appealing to noone. make this either a call of duty or either a milsim game not both at the same time. or just make a second copy one will be for milsim players and the other for call of duty players intead of this shitshow you are doing,1687411077,1704271799,False,0,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,True

These elements collectively detract from the overall experience. At times, the gameplay can veer towards monotony, failing to captivate as effectively as its predecessor, Battlefield 4, a timeless classic that remains leagues ahead in quality. Despite its drawbacks, the game shows promising potential, notably in its support for over 200 players per match in its largest mode, offering a thrilling, expansive battlefield. However, it's evident that significant improvements are needed, particularly in refining the graphics, enhancing the HUD, and revamping the UI. These enhancements could substantially elevate the gaming experience. For those seeking a vast-scale battlefield experience, this game does deliver some enjoyable moments.

Then they had the bright idea to completely rework the audio:

For example, an enemy gun shot that is firing towards player has much more priority than an enemy gun shot that is not firing towards the player. And enemy gun fire has more priority overall than friendly ones.  [/quote]
Now for anyone who has ever played an FPS, you will understand why this type of sound update is so terrible. It's complete and utter garbage. 

I hope the game turns back around and reverses the terrible changes as well as the devs start actually working on issues that have been plaguing the game for a long time instead of these horrible game play, balancing, and cosmetic updates.

This has by far been one of the best games I’ve played on steam in ages. A few friends forced me to download it and I do not regret it. Sure, maybe I don’t have a ton of hours in it, but I also don’t have a ton of free time either. Yet this game has been worth every minute. In seconds, I was in a match in a team with my friends. I picked up the controls pretty quickly and had a blast for the following hour. 

This is one of those games where you and your small group of friends are perched upon a hill constantly being mowed down and revived by your medic in the heat of battle trying to call out the various snipers zeroed in on our position just to look up and see a helicopter blow your entire squad to bits - and it’s so much fun.

Conquests boil down to both teams doing these massive swinging blobs that are constantly chasing each other.

Fuck Snipers. No really, if you main the sniper class you need to go touch grass. I sure do love when some random dude is sitting almost across the map, and one taps me when I'm driving my truck to the actual fight! SMGs need a nerf, run and gun is the way to play.

Take the parts of battlefield 4 that made it arguably the best FPS game of all time and remove them. What you get is battlebit remastered. The massive matches are obviously cool and the roblox graphics are fun and easy on the pc. The balancing and gameplay features that were included are just terrible though. Instead of just healing like one did in all of the most beloved battlefield games, instead they use an even more cumbersome bandage system than battlefield 5 (which was a universally hated feature). Vehicles feel terrible to play both in and against as they decided to borrow from BF hardline with small arms damaging lighter vehicles (because that was certainly a feature people liked) and for some god forsaken reason the ammo of heavier vehicles is limited and requires  refill at spawn rather frequently (instead of just using the BF1 system of slowly refilling over time to avoid spamming). SMGs can easily beam people much farther than any AR can (don't really think that is reasonable) and any optic beyond like 2x magnification may as well come with a 30 pound weight to try and keep your gun from climbing to heaven (because no one enjoyed tap firing in bf4 actually being viable, I guess). Camping is absurdly powerful compared to actually pushing anything because the mass of fire becomes absurd near any objective and footsteps are about 4-5x louder than a plane breaking the sound barrier about 30 feet from you. Players are often actually pretty garbage as I came in with no experience playing shooters of this style beyond battlefield (which I played on console) and within a couple hours was working a 2-3 K/D in basically every match. Even then you won't be doing much shooting unless you have some really dedicated vehicle players or junker down hard on a contested point because the objectives are literally several minutes of running away from each other on bascially all maps. The spawn system is wayyyyyyy to cautious with what it considers as a teammate ""in combat"". In a game where bullets are constantly flying everywhere, if someone so much as shoots the building your teammate is in you best believe you will have to walk for 3 minutes before you can meet up with them because you will not be spawning on them. Reload times are straight criminal, you can literally step away from your keyboard and go grab a drink before an AR has reloaded, and you may as well just die and respawn instead of reloading an LMG. Damage numbers feel like a lie, although it may just be bad connections for some players, but I have had several incidents of hitting 6+ AR shots (which supposedly do 30+ dmg) on someone and getting quite literally beamed to 0 health by an SMG with them still standing. That or the headshot bonus is just wacky because if you get a headshot the entire gunfight may as well have not happened... you just automatically win. Engineer feels useless about 99% of the time because vehicles are best used at super long range and most can be damaged easier with a rifle than a rocket, but they are powerful when healing a friendly vehicle. Medic is just spamming 3 to revive people then 5 and right click basically the whole game (because I guess the system of throwing health on the ground was bad somehow, again a stupid decision to make healing both active and very tedious). The slow speed of all actions from combining mags and reloading to simply ADSing makes gameplay tedious overall compared to something like BF4, and don't get me started on how you cannot shoot or dive under when swimming making you an absolute sitting duck for no reason at all. I came in thinking the game was supposed to be the battlefield killer that did it all right, but instead I found out that it was a combination of all the factors from the last few battlefield games that made them worse than their predecessors. The end of the day this game is little more than a cheap ripoff of BF4 from people who clearly didn't realize what made that game so great. It sucks that we have to play it instead of battlefield because those games haven't been good for a while now and this game gets players, but it really is maybe half (on its best day) of the experience that a good battlefield game is. It does the massive online FPS part well, but on a micro level fails consistently and on almost every front compared to what it could be. If it was just roblox BF4 the game would genuinely be better than what it is now because every difference it has from that game frankly makes it feels worse. If you come in more open than I did with just expecting its own game then its decent and if the price is like $8 or lower I would say snag it up, but if you wanted something to play instead of battlefield like me then this game just isn't it.",1704014774,1704014774,False,2,0,0.501218914985656738,0,True,False,True

1. Add a more granular sensitivity controller to closely match this value from other games. Perhaps either through the menu or a config file?
2. Remove the intro sequence from the options menu for those who do not suffer from epilepsy.
Weapon balances (vector, etc)
3. Add class/character customisation from the main menu, one cannot edit it if they aren't in a game. 
4. Better scaling for people running lower resolutions (i.e., the red dot sight remaining the same size) 
5. FPS optimisation (nitpicking, I know)

Lots of funny interactions just kinda happen organically. Very fun when you and your friends move, shoot, and communicate as a unit. Clearing houses is hella fun too.
Game could use some improvements, but they're very minor nitpicks. Some menus can and can't be closed by the escape key, some weapon types aren't available to classes that, and this is only my opinion, should be able to operate with them. For instance, Medic can't use PDWs, but they can use SMGs, both of which are about the same size. The only difference being caliber.
Beyond those minor nitpicks, the game is freakin great. Love playing with friends, really fun going solo too. Over all, a solid 9/10 experience. Definitely worth the money I paid for it.

1. The fact that your camera rag-dolls with your body on death is incredibly annoying. It also allows for your camera to slip below the map, allowing you to see through walls and tell your teammates impossible information. 
2. Fix the vaulting mechanics. You should only vault while moving INTO a vaultable object. If you are crouching behind a barrier and hit space to stand up to peek, you will instead vault completely over the barrier, killing you 9 times out of 10. It's also very slow. Vaulting over a small object while running should not slow your momentum to a crawl, it should scale with your speed. 
3. Give some sort of indicator that your microphone is transmitting. Simple as.

671860,154821492,76561198429936820,209,106,60,0,60,1703956156,"Honestly in my opinion fails as a military shooter. It provides very little variety in the gameplay to keep you coming back, especially if you're a newcomer (y'know, the kinds of people you WANT coming back). 

Gameplay is basic FPS military shooter stuff, with ""military shooter"" basically just meaning the entire game is walking around until you see someone, and either lasering them down immediately or getting lasered down yourself. There's almost no indication that you take damage (minimal screen shake and absolutely zero red filter or anything like that), and to be honest getting kills doesn't even feel satisfying. Like what, am I supposed to be satisfied that I won what boils down to a wild west showdown with less tension? Because I don't. 

Keeping you coming back seems to just be weapon unlocks, which can take waaaaaaay too long sometimes. You're basically only given 2 primaries at the beginning of the game (M4A1 and UMP iirc), both of which feel pretty similar to one another. If you wanted to try being a shotgunner or a sniper, sucks for you buddy, you gotta play the game with weapons you don't like first. Short-sighted in my opinion, and killed my motivation to play the game after I played with both of the guns. 

Customizability is way too much where it doesn't need to be, and not nearly enough where it should be. You're given mountains of gun addons that usually don't end up changing much other than sights and lasers/torches, but then for player customization you're given, like, 7 different uniforms. Really? That's it? Barely any customization from therein either. I know you don't wanna add like some nonsense cosmetics that do nothing but bring you out of the experience, but come on man, you can't even give yourself a pair of gloves? Is that really that odd of a request? Speaking of, the fact that you need to play for a good few hours just for the privilege of putting a bit of camo on your gun also makes zero sense. 

Aside from the gameplay, its visuals scream early access. For models this is fine, modelling is hard work and prioritizing working on gameplay is totally justified at this stage in the game's life, but...could you really not have even put a font on any of the menus? Something other than calibri or whatever you used? It makes the game feel just dead and personality-less. It doesn't even say ""military shooter"" to me, you could put its menus in almost any game if you changed the text and images and it would feel just as appropriate. Just a little bit of font decoration can go a long way in making the UI feel alive. Obviously, again, early access, but I can't help but feel that something like that would take a minimal amount of time considering it could help the game find its stylistic footing later on.

People have said this game looks like a Roblox game put on to Steam, and I have to agree. But you also need to recognize that there are Roblox games doing similar things that, in my opinion, they do considerably better than this game does. Just take the game Blackhawk Rescue Mission 5; just like BattleBit, it's a realistic-style military shooter game with lots of weapon customization and giant lobbies with tons of players. However, for one, the game has far more variety in what you can do, especially with its incredibly fun co-op open world mode. I'd love to see something like that added into the game, though who can tell if anything like that is planned.

All and all, if you like strictly large-lobbied PvP gameplay and nothing else, this game does that and does it...decently, but I can't help but feel there's better ways to get that fix. If you want anything other than that, you're SOL here bud. Definitely good for a certain audience, but I feel that audience is far too niche at the moment.",1703956335,1703958223,False,2,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

I thought the days of Playing games like BF2/3/4 where over, a relic of the past. But no!

Didn't drop below 144hz, the physics didn't wig out, the players didn't suddenly drop ping and fly across the damn map. Blown away by the devs efforts and ability to make this happen.

The game is a large-scale, team-oriented game and it mixed 'Battlefield' gameplay and destruction with a 'Roblox'-like block-style visuals. This unique combination results in a game that is both visually distinctive and engaging in its gameplay.

It's fast-paced and fun, providing an adrenaline rush and chaos that is hard to match. This makes it an excellent choice for gamers looking to enjoy quick, action-packed sessions.

However, the game is not without its flaws (of course) which can sometimes detract from the overall experience. One of the issues is the [b] hitbox detection [/b]. There are moments when hits that seem accurate don't register, leading to some annoying situations

Another point is [b] physics and environment [/b]. Built on the Unity, and featuring a box-like environment and graphics, the game occasionally falls prey to glitches and bugs. Players exploit to access unexpected areas and kill from unknown places.

The community is a mixed. While many players are fun and humorous, there's an element of toxicity and saltiness. This is a common issue but worth noting for those sensitive to such environments.

Progression offers a decent array of weapons and equipment to unlock on certain ranks. However, the grind required to unlock specific attachments and weapons can be a bit tedious. Players may find themselves spending hours to acquire a particular attachment, especially getting a lot of kills with certain weapon to get a certain attachment, which can be a bit discouraging.

In summary, this is game with a lot of potentials. It's fun, fast-paced, and offers a unique visual style. However, it's hampered by technical issues like hitbox detection, bugs, and a progression system that feels overly grindy. Despite these drawbacks, it remains a solid choice for those looking for an enjoyable way to pass the time, especially for fans of the shooter genre.",1703927654,1703927654,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

I am sure this game is fun for people that have been playing for quite a while but it is completely disadvantageous toward new players. I do not have the time to put into this game to rank up enough to be able to use a lot of the weapons and their mods. Without those, beginner players are just easy pickings for more experienced users with far superior weapons and all of their upgrades. There is no place to even practice offline so learning the maps and potential vantage points/areas to avoid, practicing weapon/vehicle usage, are nonexistent.

The ranking system and game modes were not described in the game description and the limitation on weapons, upgrades and lack of practice courses has a profound impact on the play-ability of the game, putting new players at a serious disadvantage in multiple different ways.

Battlebit feels like the gun play of battlefield 3/4, maps have an incredible amount of destruction thinking back to the days of Bad Company 2, as well as giant map changing events similar to the ""leveloutions"" in Battlefield 4.

Some of the grass is the same color as player models, Snipers are a constant issue (either the glint, glint removal, damage changes, range changes, spotting, etc. too many patches), RPG Hitboxes are iffy sometimes, maps can have looong walks to get back into the action, and Night maps can be a nightmare sometimes.

The game has awesome maps, which you feel were designed by people actually playing this stye of game a lot. They seem based on the makers' own gaming experience and seem to draw inspiration from a wide range of shooter games, such as Insurgency, CoD and, of course, Battlefield.

The game also meaningfully improves classic BF systems, such as the Squad system, by offering differing types of squads for different playstyles.

Edit:

I must say something aloud, cause I am getting tired of it. Players can abuse their language (especially russians) with telling you ""idi na ch**"" using voice chat - no action from admin.
It is enough to just write something unpleasant in chat, to get your account banned.
I see some lack of consistency here, which can lead to people never using actual chat and just telling other people to kill themselves - zero consequences.

To comment: Of course I tested it myself, I got banned when I only wrote in chat. Previously I were testing this (e.g. saying inappropriate things all the time on voice chat) never lead to anything.

HOWEVER, considering the low price of the game and the consistent updates the game gets, i do believe it is worth your purchase, despite its flaws. Here is my original review:

(old review, i no longer agree with some of what i said)
Battlebit certainly has its fair share of good qualities, for example, the weapon customization and ease of menu navigation. but i feel that the negatives outweigh the positives, even if just for me. In no particular order, here are a few of my issues : 

1)how the fuck did i die- the killscreen is not very easily read and is somewhat confusing. 

2) where am i supposed to go? most of the maps are entropic clusterfucks that dont have consistent pushes and pulls from either side, rather, the match ends up as a homogenous mix of players, often leading to me spawning in, and then dying instantly, even on the larger maps. 

3) the maps- most of them have entirely too much empty space, like, Golmud Railway from Bf4 levels of empty space, interrupted by the occasional densely covered mosh pit.  

4) the balance- why can i be lazer-beamed down by an smg at 100 meters? Why are snipers less than useless? Why does bleeding exist, other than to annoy me?

I have other issues with the game, but there are also things i really do like about the game. However, i think battlebit has some crucial steps to take before it is truly great.

Edit: changed to ""do not recommend.""

i liked battlebit because it started out as a more hardcore arcade version of battlefield with more grounded elements. it felt like we were finally getting a game that maintained that middle-ground between arcade and milsim.

now theres a lot more visual clutter to hold the player's hand and balancing has mostly favored a very niche meta run-and-gun playstyle. it takes players away from the overwhelming amount of grounded and tactical features that make up a majority of the game's content and marketing.

this game needs to cook for a while. battlebit is having a bit of an identity crisis at the moment and thats understandable because the game is in early access. i still feel as if the devs are taking the game in the wrong direction due to a very loud minority of people gaslighting concerns and feedback on discord (which has seemingly become the dev's main source for feedback). they are not making choices necessary that would benefit the game's overall balance and unique identity, such as getting a better anticheat, restricting movement exploits, and properly balancing certain classes/weapons to be less versatile rather than nerfing other non-meta classes out of shear spite.",1688275845,1703791487,False,1,0,0.505813956260681152,0,True,False,True

On the other side from my perspective the game is way too fast, can end in a minute when you are getting destroyed which is kinda sad when you play 254 player server.

Also healing and reviving is kinda slow. At this kind of the game I would more enjoy revive via Battlefield where you just press number for defib and press left click to revive person. You know, when you play 254 player server and one grenade just blow up 5 men around you, how are you revive them all with this slow mechanic taken from squad.

Even the people who die always respawn in first sec they die, it happens a lot I go to revive someone who just die and while I revive he just leave or he just respawn.

No wonder no one is actually healing or reviving in this game, while until you revive someone you die 20 times in a row.
I´m always enjoying medic class in battlefield games, but in here I have to just stick with the battlefield ""noobs"" who just take whatever class and sit somewhere in the corner to get 40 / 0.

My computer is not quite potato but more like fancy French fries but for the most part, I'm still using GeForce Now for more intense titles. It's been a while since I was able to run a 254 player game without my computer dying under strain. 

The graphics may also be a negative who like eye candy, so your mileage may vary. It's essentially stripped down Battlefield of old. The fact that three people made it happen is impressive. 

However, this game has a lot of sweat. If you're a sweatlord - that's fine but sometimes it's really frustrating to be stacked, especially when the game of Frontline gets clanstacked. SMG enjoyers are annoying, snipers are annoying and despite the apparent stability of the game, one cannot help but wonder whether hitboxes and damage system needs additional refinement. Devs seem to be aping stuff with skins, kind of missing the point in my opinion. The report system seems to be weird and it does seem like clans seem to cooperate on simply reporting people they don't like, regardless whether they have violated the TOS or not. Encountered higher than average amount of weirdos. Could use some differentiation in stuff like Remote Weapon Systems (both Russian TIGR and HMMWV have an option of that in the game but it's just a simple blocky cube with a gun).

Probably the best mass scale shooter i've ever played. It's like the best version of battlefield, but with the blocky aesthetics. But don't let it fool you, despite the, at first, iffy visuals, it's some of the best gunplay i've seen. If you're into battlefield like games go ahead and buy it, you won't regret a thing

My only 2 critiques with the gun mechanics are that the rockets are unbelievably slow. I feel like you might be able to outrun them, it's that noticeable. The second being that when your magazine runs dry, it won't prompt a reload. You'll just stay empty until you press R. Kind of dumb considering there isn't anything else I'd be doing with the thing. Grenades need to be a touch more damaging as well. Game still runs amazing, player base for the most part is really fun, and the maps and content keep coming. These devs actually listen to the feedback. Meaningful anti-cheat needs to be top priority IMO. And the spawn system needs improvement. A LOT of instant death scenarios currently..

After 20 hours played I can say it's a great feeling FPS that is doing a better job at being a battlefield game than 2042 can hope for. I hope EA and DICE are taking notes and applying them to the next Battlefield project because this game shows that there is NO excuse for a studio of that size to produce something of lesser quality than a 3 person team. 

Having said all that, this game is not without it's faults. That is to be expected since it's such a small team and it's still in early access.

Most of the arsenal is fun but there is a bit of cheese, not really any more than what usually permeates these kind of games though. The movement is cool but totally antithetical to what they're trying to have this game be so it clashes with the map design. This game is sold as some kind of milsim roleplay game but everyone moves like a TF2 scout. Don't get me wrong, the game is way better for it but it creates odd interactions. Regardless, the shooting feels very nice. It has the tried and true ADS-centric gunplay that works very well.

Comparing this game to Battlefield is inevitable, but there are some key differences:
-Purely class-based, no heroes.
-Walls and most buildings are destructable.
-Some maps are absolutely massive.
-More freedom with attachments.
-'Realism' mechanics for reloading and health.
-Most notable: 127 vs 127.

The 127 v 127 matches are absolute chaos. While it feels like you don't contribute much to a match's outcome in Battlefield, this game exacerbates the feeling. You'll encounter many 'fronts' where you can barely peek without getting gunned down or grenaded by someone.

I won't get into too much detail because A: i'm lazy, and B: this game being in early access means many details are subject to change over time.

-If you're an FPS fan, but haven't played big multiplayer shooters like Battlefield, I recommend this game just for the experience of how chaotic the matches get.

These things all add up and it amazes me that some of the small things are not a standard in the games industry.

Update: Continued development on the title is also putting AAA titles to shame, with meaningful balance changes to weapons and maps, new content, and improved features.

Update 2: Sad to say the updates have started causing issues.  Continuous updates mostly a good thing, until a large untrialed update goes in and isn't backed out rapidly.

Just consider; This game costs 8 bucks (due wintersale), you launch the game, do a quickplay, and leave whenever you want or have to, no saving, no long ""Are you sure"", or ""But are you really sure"" messages that annoy the player as he may have to just leave.

Graphic wise, simple, yet astonishing in detail, you should only experience lag, if you're still running on a potato, if you can play minecraft with mods or other similiar games, you should be able to play this.

The only lack I see as off now, are some achievements to spice things up a little bit, like ""Sergeant - Reached Rank so n' so"", or ""Kill 5 enemies in a single life"" or just simple stuff like ""Revive 3 people in a single life"".

Last draw for me was sniper nerf with bullet rails. This is becoming so fast based action that only harcore COD players like it. 

It's not anymore Battlefield we deserve, it is CoD that CoD community wants.

Mods for weapons are superb!
Vehicles has impact on field!
Game runs butterysmooth!

Apparently, this is one of those games. This happened on an official server so I suppose poor guy was banned not just on this server but in the game entirely. This gets even more stupid since you can completely disable voice and text chat and be safe from ""racism/harassment"". If you don't want to do that, you can mute people as they speak with hotkeys. You don't even need to open a menu to do that, just press a button to immediately mute the one who is currently talking. But still... European gamedev at its finest.

Now to the game itself. It feels like (because it is) a cheap clone of BF4. By cheap I mean asset quality. Not bad, just low pricey. The gunplay is the same, the game mechanics are pretty much the same, even the maps resemble BF4 maps or copy their parts. You run through a location and you know exactly where you are and where you should go because [i]you've already been there[/i]. And it is not a bad thing at all: EA cannot make a game as good as BF4 anymore so other people take up the initiative. But the best thing is that the [i]feeiling[/i] is the same. Chaotic dynamic mess with a bit of teamplay, squads of random people, annoying snipers in bushes, grenade spam at chokepoints etc. It feels good to be back. But there are some new mechanics: for example, the enemy who just killed you can hear you in voicechat for a brief period. Pure gamer rage with some occasional gamer words really adds to this feeling. There are bugs and glitches here and there but since it is Early Access I wouldn't mind much.

The 127vs127 format shines on medium-sized maps, but the overly large ones turn the game into a tedious Walking Simulator. I tend to quit on encountering vast landscapes. Nevertheless, communication has improved; the game encourages interaction with teammates, a departure from my usual silent gaming persona.

Graphically, it's akin to Roblox, with decent options even at max settings. The weapon variety is fair, with the promise of more additions. The dragging ability for medics is a thoughtful touch. The array of vehicles, including tanks, armored cars, and 4-wheel bikes, adds to the gameplay.

The sound is passable, but some music and an announcer could elevate the excitement. Patience is warranted, as the game is still in its infancy.

The player base is robust, ensuring quick match findings even for 127vs127, and I encountered zero lag in my 5 hours of play. While I experienced one crash, I anticipate future updates will address such issues.

Gunplay and customization are satisfying and theres a large roster of weapons and equipment, loads of forward grips, scopes canted sights barrel attachments makes for an interesting experience trying out setups for different guns. Theres also character customization but ive not looked into it as I personally still dont like the minecraft/roblox looking character models because it feels mismatched to the realistically modeled weapons/vehicles/environments but thats a nitpick if im honest and is a non-factor while im playing.

Maps are pretty varied and large and ive enjoyed most of them, the day and night options are neat addition keeping things a fresh. Game modes are fun and i find that im partial to invasion as it lessens the impact my incompetence has on my team by not letting me suck down a truckload of tickets while i flail about on my keyboard trying to walk in a straight line.

TTK is really fast so minor mistakes or lack of awareness can end you really quick and its easy to get stuck into a loop of live die repeat if youre careless but I still have fun regardless. 

Performance is excellent in fact I would say that the minimum spec is actually quite overkill. Out of curiosity I tried to get it running on my 2014 HP Steam with a Celeron N3060 and its HD 400 igpu and it was nearly playable. The N3060 was just a bit too slow to really make it feasible, given that the minimum suggested cpu(i5-2310) is about 5 times faster overall than the N3060 i would say you could run this on almost anything. 

This is the first PvP shooter ive really played any amount since playing halo 3 and Bad Company 2 on the 360 and while im severely out of practice I'm having a good time.

- Lack of talking players + moderated voice chat
The main reason I wanted to play was the global voice chat, but out of the 5 or so matches I played, I encountered only 3 or so people that actually responded to me. 
There seems to be a strong incentive to not talk because the first thing you see when you launch the game is a message that voice chat is recorded and moderated and that disruptive behaviour is disallowed.

- There is no tutorial
The UI isn't explained, the classes aren't explained, the menu isn't explained. You are expected to go in blind and ""figure shit out on your own""

- The UI is horrible.
You don't see your health nor your exact ammo
You also cannot edit your loadout in the main menu, only in-game.
The video settings menu is filled with useless stuff like HUD colors, while missing most of the actually useful video settings.

- View bobbing is PERMANENTLY on

- Gunplay is not very enjoyable.
The game is insanely sluggish. Get hit? bandage that takes 5 seconds to use. Reloading? needs to be done after every kill or 2 and takes like 3 seconds. Switch to anything? Slow switching animations for you, fam. 
You only have 5 mags which all have separate ammo, you usually need over half a mag to kill an enemy, and if you run out, you are basically fucked unless you have someone with an ammo box or you again take like 5 seconds to reorganize your mags while camping somewhere

Game is fun though does need some weapon balancing. The devs are working on the game so its not too much of a criticism. The voice-chat and the fun idea of proximity has sadly waned off. I assume its because of the threat of a possible server ban if you say something that could be considered 'offensive' these days.

- - -

Gunplay is good, netcode is extremely inconsistent. Takes half a magazine to kill an enemy, but it feels you get downed in 1-2 hits abruptly. Sometimes shots don't even register, sometimes it feels like they just phase through enemies. Occasional connection issues (shot denied due to packet loss, sometimes losing connection and disconnecting from a server).

That said, it has a lot of good going for it -

257 players is outright amazing, and the fact that it all works smoothly without many bugs is further credit to the streamlined, quality development that this game has received. (BF games generally have a dump truck's worth of problems on release)

Combined arms gameplay that exceeds Battlefield in scale and chaos.

Sound is very lackluster, it doesn't have the cinematic, all consuming feel of a BF title like 1.

Graphics are absolute trash, it looks terrible and I don't mean that it's just a ""low poly"" thing. Compared to games like Polygon it still looks like shit. Characters are literally minecraft tier and when youre inside a building there is NO depth perception at all because nothing has textures and its just sheer simple colors on walls. Disorientating.

It doesn't feel satisfying shooting enemies or blowing up vehicles. Just lacks the punch and crunch of BF games (because of the low poly aesthetic). Sounds and graphics definitely bring this up. Nothing feels intense or brutal (probably what they were going for)

Definitely a monumental achievement for 3 developers, but I wouldn't play this over any BF games (probably not even 2042).",1701781417,1703396796,True,0,0,0.537572264671325684,0,True,False,True

I feel if I give my two cents, I need to let you know why I feel my opinion should matter. I am a 40 YO video game OG. I've been playing Online Games since LAN Duke Nukem, LAN AOE,Battle.NET SC and WC 2 Tides of Darkness, Delta Force in mid 90s. Lets not forget the AOL Online Game Services in 1995-1999  (SHOUT OUT TO ALL MY MAGESTORM G'S! The first REAL MMO PVP/FPS by far). 

    This game... When It comes to raw PVP/FPS energy, this game is it. It is simple yet a masterpiece! The very moment you figure this game out, its got you by the b*lls. The comments about not being able to get guns in the beginning and so on are pure trash. Go to COD and pay to win if you want that ish. It took me 25 min to get the hang of this game and I'm in love. It is what ""WE"" as gamers missed in the PVP/FPS world. Graphics are great but this game is proof that game play is number 1. This game is so good I will be gifting it to 5 RANDOM people for XMAS. I guarantee that if the developers pitch this to console it will be number 1. The magnitude and scale of this game is fantastic. The possibilities are endless if the devs stay on this path plus listen to the community for input/ideas. Point blank, if you L-O-V-E FPS games, get this. You will not be disappointed. Oh, I almost forgot. YOU GET TO BLOW SHIT UP! I know this game undoubtedly
just raised the bar for all FPS games out there. Hell, maybe all games... 

Rating 0-10:

Game-play: 10 Action Packed! Like mixing COD,BATTLEFIELD and SQUAD in a jar and shaking it, not stirring.)
Strategy: 10 Winning the 1 Vs 1 battles are great, winning the Squad Vs Squad is very satisfying but winning the war is 
                    Rapture.           
Graphics: 9 Needs more character customization and weapon skins
Controls: 9 Simple and effective
Cost: Who cares, the game is tits on a bull!

If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.
Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore.

The game at its core is very fun, it brings back the old good days of BF2 styled combat with full destroyable environments. It has good mechanics and each weapon or vehicle is different and takes different approaches how to use  it at maximum. 

A BIG portion of this game is its fluidity of the gameplay. Doesn't matter how you like to play the game will reward you and you can master your style and have a lot of fun.

A very BIG PLUS is the community, game uses all voice chat & death mic which can enhance the immersion and full of the game. Hell just listening to the players softly saying they don't fell their legs after stomp a landmine is hilarious. Community is what makes this game great, its always joy to listen to it at least if you don't have mic or don't want to speak. Community is just great at its current stage and ppl are usually joking, per my time I didn't personally experience any major toxicity in the game (except few individuals, but such ppl get banned very fast).

In regards of cheating, I didn't experience any if so not much. PPL really want to have just fun rather than cheating, and if you die its 99% your own fault rather than somebody is using an AIM bot.

Overall a great and positive experience.

@UPDATE #1:

I like this game however I need to leave a negative review after the latest patches 2.2.2 & 2.2.3.

The reason is the latest mode and its map designs. Even thou I still have fun its hard on current patch. Mostly is because a slight average < 51% of total players always chooses the new Invasion mode, the mode its self wouldn't be a problem but the way how its design around the maps is just terrible. You are locked into a small size of the map and until all points are not taken you are unable to progress it further. This may not sound serious but it opens a BIG problem, that problem is Camping and Sniping.

A big portion of this game is its fluidity of the gameplay, the new mode however takes it away as most of the players are just camping and sniping, so there is less action, less play styles available - thus less fun. Imagine this repeats game after game after game every day of the Current Invasion mode from its release. This is becoming frustrating rather than fun.

A lot of ppl like this new mode and that's why is chosen, however its oversatured and you can see ppl frustration.

As mentioned I like this game, but at the current time I am leaving a negative review, this may change, if the new mode is adjusted or at least limited so we can go and play as well other game modes....

@UPDATE #2:

Played on the new patch 2.2.4 for several hours and looks like the negatives of the new mode were mostly redeemed. New patch tuned some aspect of the time necessary to capture points. even thou it didn't completely solve the problems with the layouts of the maps for the mode, the game-play moves much more faster so camping and sniping even if still there is not so more prominent. Also the mode it self is as well less prominent during the modes choosing phase. This is good as you are not getting frustrated all the time.

this is like a time machine to that, this game is a blast - and it reminds me of what it feels like to play a fun shooter again

personally, i love playing the medic class - people are almost always talking (or roleplaying), and it makes it very fun to go around and keep my comrades alive. the amount of times i've saved someone and they go ""TELL MY WIFE I LOVE THEM"" is hilarious

it's not the most in depth gunplay but it feels great and doesn't have any artificial things to make it harder to aim (like valorant, cs, etc.)

also, as i age - my eyes aren't what they used to be, my reflexes aren't as fast, and i don't have as much time to game. 

that's where my appreciation for its simple visual language, team-focused gameplay, and casual nature comes from - it's everything i want a shooter to be at my age. i don't have time to practice or dedicate my life to a game. so this game's simplicity and play-ability is really nice. 

not every game needs to be some hyper-competitive esport

great game, easy to pick up, so far all 10 hours have been online and i have noticed non(or unnoticeable minimal) lag/cheating, love this game

the game-play is fast paced, with well defined classes, you can level a weapon and that weapon will be available across most of the classes, the maps are fun with opportunities for all play styles i haven't noticed a particular camping problem in any maps as of yet, the maps can get super chaotic bullets from all directions explosions in every direction, walls and building collapsing

Looking at the game and judging it on graphics alone will leave you heading over to a game like Battlefield 2042 for the worst gaming experience in the 2000's UNTIL 2042, unlike BattleBit which has some proper gameplay mechanics and an actual FUNCTIONING game.

But BattleBit is this weird love child of Roblox, Squad, and Battlefield, it also plays just as good as all three games ((so long as you count ONLY Battlefields' Bad Companies, 3, 4, Hardline and One in your list - because besting 2042 in 2023 can be done with a GBC cartridge like Wario World 3, hell I guarantee you that you can best Battlefield 2042 with an Etch and Sketch. I'd have to say BattleBit OUTPERFORMS Battlefield if I included EA's 2042.))

In all seriousness though, this is a game apparently designed by three individuals and so far these three have proven that, yes.

AAA Companies are absolutely useless compared to what a dedicate group of individuals in an indie company can do and that yes

A small group of individuals can make a game that, albeit early access with a few bugs here and there, can easily out perform a AAA company on release if given the right amount of appropriate representation BY it's player base, which they've rightfully earned through these three individuals and their dedication to their game.

If you're an honest Battlefield fan, and if I could show my PS3 and Xbox 360 play time for Battlefield 4 in this review to prove that I am, I'm expressing with actual honesty that this game is worth checking out. It may not hold up graphically wise, but I honestly couldn't give two cents less about graphics when the gameplay is so functionally there, it's undeniable to be a good time.

a AAA company can only beg and plead to produce a game like this, and with the developers focusing on LONG TERM funding over SHORT TERM funding, this is a game that has the potential to do what AAA companies want to dream about being able to do.

Game fixed most of it's issues
Good balancing:
No class is superior
No weapon category is superior
Bad maps got reworked, new good maps, maps are actually fun now
Gameplay loop really satisfying
XP/progression got buffed a lot, really easy to climb levels no matter what you do (offensive/supportive play)

Bad Stuff

Dead chat
Possible cheaters? idk, had many ""How did he know I was there"" moments
A lot of weapons are really high level requirements for some reason (There's nothing special about an mp5 for someone to have to grind to lvl 90 for it)

BattleBit with its low res graphics gives me a warm fuzzy feeling. It reminds me of custom servers on Day or Defeat and Coubter Strike.

They're unsure whether to push the game as a milsim or a battlefield-like which has caused a very odd divide in game design.

They've improved parts that needed improving... Far too slowly. SMG nerfs took them months, in which their playerbase fell from 80k to 20k. Progression fixes literally dropped half a year after the games peak.

Honestly I have no idea how a dev team could manage to fumble a bad b-tch this bad. They'd literally have more success if they didn't update it since adding the G3A1, since then just about every update has been a decline with only one new Support gun being added (the most boring copy-paste option that adds nothing over the L85A1 when we KNOW they had interesting options like the MG3 or M60 in production due to leaked skins)

I thought I liked this game but to be honest sometimes I love and sometimes I hate it. I’ve only been playing since October and the game has already changed so much and that’s not great. Most updates just break or ruin things that were fine before without adding much. 
I really feel that a lot of maps and game modes don’t work well or are poorly done, and a lot of maps are just not great. Also, I feel just when I start to really like a map and game mode or something a new bad map and or game mode drops, and everyone wants to play that to death instead.
Devs just keep adding new crap and breaking old crap without fixing much. Snipers and SMGs ruin everything most of the time and the maps blatantly favor them the Developers never fix game breaking jank or overpowered BS. They are too busy pumping out the next bad map or update or game mode or way to ruin everything. vehicles should never have been added 32vs32 and a lot of maps are too big or lack cover for 32vs32 leading to long walks to the front because your team is too stupid to spawn on and at least half the time you will get sniped before you reach the action or deleted by a SMG.

This game literally gets less fun every update. It could have been great and it might have been back when it peeked but I wouldn't know I missed it. All I see is a good game getting fucked over by Devs who don't know what they are doing and toxic ass community.",1697616376,1703031510,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What used to be pretty good sound in the game (proximity with footsteps, guns firing, bullets whizzing past, etc.) is now ""everything sounds the exact same at a muffled volume regardless of proximity...EXCEPT for when you get shot, then you'll hear that gun go off at 200% volume the moment the bullet hits you"".

Additionally, they keep changing the ping system, and the current iteration is the worst it's been. After a miss on their initial rework, they actually had it pretty good in one of the more recent patches (they re-added something close to the old ping system and also had a tracking ping that followed enemies for a few seconds). Now, they've made pinging pointless since everything obscures it, so your teammates can only see the ping when they can already see the pinged enemy.

It's a shame to see this game going downhill, because I assume these updates are all intended to make it better. Unfortunately, they keep sorely missing the mark.



My original review before these more recent updates:
An immensely fun take on the Battlefield formula. Great,  dynamic combat with large teams (I personally love  the chaos of 127v127) in sprawling maps that feature destructible components.",1688421028,1703025262,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Not that good.

It tries to play off that it's the new battlefield/cod but not made by those stingy triple a devs that don't have our feeling at heart (Amen to that sentiment). But then it looks at what they did to keep player retention up and said you know what? Lets do that.

Let me start off with the pro's of this game

Large battles- They can be fun and hectic but i can often lose myself in them and lose the front line but i will address that later, for this point the big battles are fun.

And that is it for the pros, short list i know but i have good reason for not liking the rest of what this game offers.
Cons time, i know that it may seem hypocritical to place a pro and a con in that is the same but

Cons
Large player count- This has fostered some of the worse indifference to battle i have ever seen. Due to the sheer quantity of people i see most players insta gibbing themselves for a quicker respawn leading to the front line resembling a wet spaghetti noodle then a front line.
Battlefield has better front-lines in most regards. BFV you can see them all around basically and the movement options made it so once the front was established you need co-ordination to push through it.

COD though has some pretty bad front-lines in terms of movement. It's too hard to grasp what point is safe and what is teeming with enemy life. Either way both games have their ups and downs for that but i give cod some slack because 32v32 is actually pretty new for COD and with the gameplay they have, it makes sense that ground war isn't really ironed out

The problem with this game and the front lines is that the MOVEMENT is the biggest issue. We have too much speed. Heck the vehicles feel even worse. Why does a soldier in like 60-70 pounds of kit (More or less depending on class) run like usane bolt if he took a hit of meth and cocaine. Just insanity with that speed

With that speed everything is way too fast. Like Extremely too fast. Which brings me to my next CON

META guns- They exist everywhere but oh dear god do they exist here. If you thought this game could escape the inevitable of developing the ""META"" you were wrong as all heck and then some. Because the meta in this game appears to be a mix of ""SMG,RPG,Some flavor of bolt action"" 

I say flavor of bolt action because they are all pretty much the same.  SMG's your going to see either a p90 or kriss vector, and rpg's just because destruction mechanics are a thing so it's extremely common to see players just volley fire rockets into a structure to get enemies out of it because that is the effective strat.

Teamwork-The teamwork is non existent that is a problem due to both the movement speed and player counts. The player count contributes due to 127 v 127 who cares about one person in a push of 30 people. that is one small speck of dust basically compared to the bigger group.

Players rarely if ever talk tactically only in a casual sense. Nothing wrong with that it's just that i would like to hear about the enemy pushing my right and not how your mom just got her new sugar daddy and you got to eat pizza tonight

Lack of vehicle usability-So basically this stems from the ""META"" as it were. Due to so many players have AT enemy vehicles are basically cannon fodder waiting to die a painful death. The use of them being relegated to either, Anti air (helicopters can be annoying) or AP (Anti personnel) But in terms of AP your just sitting in a corner sniping hoping to get a kill or two. Nothing more nothing less. But if you try to support a push you can expect about 67 rockets flying right at you ready to detonate your tender rear.

Anyways thems my gripes don't know why everyone is praising this game like it's the second coming of battlefield 1. But you know what they say. Everything ends and i don't see enough good in this game to warrant most people coming back once they you know. Beat it. 

It lacks much in cosmetic fun (I know right but maybe i want to unlock some funky gun skins or something) The maps are kinda bland and generic and lack anything to help defenders or anything like that. The game pawns that off on us by using a terrible building system that uses Sandbags made out of plastic iv bags and hesco barriers made instead of sand wood and string. It's now made out of Sand Termite infested wood and a piece of rope that was hit by a sword for 30 minutes.

All the defense structures are so incredibly weak that they might as well just be used as decorations instead of defenses.

Anyways game is not that great in terms of trying to match triple a dev games. but you know, they wanted to look good to the people so they got some youtubers and did an ad campaign after a near death launch of them doing ""playtests"" (no joke it was getting pretty bad with those play test times)  and what we got was a game that feels soulless, has nothing that truly defines it (block game is taken by like three things can't define it self by that). All in all if i am being honest. It doesn't play like any of the three games it takes stuff from.

Okay rant over TLDR 
4/10 Nothing to define itself by and what it does have is too fast and aggressive for any meaningful gameplay. Oh and also you can bandage things that you reasonably shouldn't be able to but oh well ""Arcade"".

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and we adopted our son together. Both are now 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I felt lost and unhappy. I was self-destructive. One day, I was so angry with everything spiraling out of control that I punched a concrete wall in a moment of overwhelming emotion. This resulted in breaking my fifth metacarpal in my right hand—the hand I worked with, played games with, and used to carry my children to bed—the hand I desperately needed to ensure I could continue providing.

Upon learning the severity of the self-inflicted damage, I became almost suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man, with no history of depression or anxiety. I had never experienced anger outbursts, nor was I the type to break down and cry, but I was in a tough situation that truly prevented me from seeing the light on the other side.

With nothing better to do, I looked for a game I could play WITH ONE HAND while recovering. Somehow, I stumbled upon this game and read some of the comments. I decided it was worth a try... I must admit I didn't beat the game, nor did I play as much as some of you. In fact, I may have played this game for only a day or two. That being said, after doing so, I had a new joy and hope for life. I managed to leave behind the pain and suffering that had been thrust upon me. I could experience the joy and happiness of other people. I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ minutes listening to this music, long enough to realize that I would be okay.

After realizing this, I turned off the game and went back to work. My hand hurt a lot, but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so sorry for myself and became the father I needed to be at that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving like.

Today, I am close friends with the mother of my children. We don't fight, argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents and friends.

Now I have 3 children. My third child is, wait, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my separation, and we just unexpectedly stumbled into each other's lives. We have been dating for a year and are very happy together.

Moral of the story: you never know what life has in store for you, and if I had given up when all odds were against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Review Update, BattleBit's developers created a game that everyone has asked for, but didn't fall into the usual traps.

Unfortunately, the devs now listen loud minorities on twitter or twitch and have made changes that have alienated an entire class of players.

The battlefield franchise was always attractive as a game with multiple classes that you could play however you pleased. Sniping, was one of them. Apparently a toddler on twitter didn't like the principle of sniping, and the devs have imparted changes that have effectively made sniping unplayable.

Way to go devs, now youve got ""just another game""",1700542946,1702955506,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

On launch the gun and class balance were pretty wonky, but the devs have made steady and solid changes to address it, and each class feels a lot more meaningful and important to the overall match. Gunplay is really satisfying, they feel great to shoot, (used to) sound pretty good, and the level of customization allows you to really fine-tune the stats to fit your playstyle. Recon especially has felt really good lately with the addition of sniper bullet trails and smaller scope glint cones.

Progression is another highlight for me too, as--besides the supporter pack, which I do own--everything is included with the base game, and you get unlocks by just playing the game. Like a gun? Use it, get kills, and you'll unlock attachments and skins for it. Want to use a locked gun? Just play the game and level up, and you'll unlock the gun you want soon enough. Progression is pretty quick, even if you're not playing constantly, especially compared to how it was on release.

Maps were another things that started out on release as something pretty mid, but got better and better with every new map and map remake. They all feel fairly balanced and facilitate fun battles and the destructible structures allow for pretty unique situations to play out from match to match. 

Have to mention the voice chat as well, of course, as it really adds a level of comradery and humor to the game, and, if you have friends or willing teammates, lets you communicate pretty effectively and coordinate with those nearby. Muting people is quick and easy (a single button press) if anyone is mike spamming too much, blasting obnoxious music, or just being too annoying for your taste.

Overall, a good semi-casual game that still has a pretty high skill ceiling for those who are willing/able to devote the time to it.",1702863211,1702940874,True,1,0,0.509345769882202148,0,True,False,True

First and foremost, is Battebit Remastered still worth playing months after launch? Absolutely.
I cannot describe how impactful it is for an indie game to able to have this much of a presence in an area dominated by AAA titles like multiplayer FPS as this. If you care about the quality of the games you play, as well as the respect you deserve as a consumer of said games, PLEASE, vote with your wallet and support Battlebit, even as a statement is good enough. There are a lot of things that are done right in this game that big studios can decide to do, but didn't. Battlebit is a cheap game in price and no way in its offering. It's definitely one of the must-play games of 2023, and you should not take that lightly.

With its focus on large-scale lobbies and providing a lot of tools for players to play around with, each match in Battlebit rarely feels the same. Vehicles and map destruction can provide a lot of dynamism in match progression and prevent stalemate. Even on more linear maps like Wakistan, flanks can still happen a lot, and the losing team can always maneuver around and take the lead. Or if you just want to goof around in an ATV and some C4's, there's nobody stopping you.

The highly praised feature of the VOIP and hot mic is also an undeniable charm of this game. Being able to verbally ask for ammo and scream out for medic, as well as directly speak to the enemies nearby are some things you can't do often in games nowadays. And it feels surprisingly more immersive than spamming voice line commands in any AAA games.

Battlebit's unwavering commitment to its ridiculously large lobby can also create issues, however. For instance, I can't expect myself to stay alive long enough to contribute much to the team like in Battlefield games. Mainly because the player count is so high that, frankly, I run out of bullets to kill all of the enemies in one spot. Which sucks, because in my heart I really want Battlebit to emphasize teamplay and contribution to match victory more than just personal K/D ratio.

But all and all, Battlebit Remastered is definitely worth the price in every conceivable way. The focus on the chaotic nature of online multiplayer lobbies is something we gamers sorely needs in an age where server browsers and community-focused atmospheres are rare, while matchmaking systems are handled by algorithms that make you feel like you're not good enough. Please support games such as Battlebit to tell other game companies that we want games to be fun again.",1702911047,1702911047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Most people who buy this will get their money's worth out of it. However, there are some things which you should note before you buy this game:

-Devs listen primarily to a small portion of their playerbase on their Discord server. Obviously, this presents issues for the casual players, and results and a lot of less popular changes being pushed through (super visible sniper trails, poor sound changes, invasion mode changes, class loadout changes). In addition, they frequently hold change votes on their Discord, which negatively affects the entire playerbase who get represented by a couple hundred people at most.
-Balance. Most classes are balanced. Most. Support and Recon sit behind all the others in their usefulness, while Engineer and Medic sit at the top with their speed and utility. Assault sits in the middle, but isn't anything special.
-Sweats. For a Roblox looking game, you would be surprised at how many people abuse the crap out of movement to gain that edge over others.
-Voice chat. This one only became an issue today, but the sound changes have made the game frustrating. If you get shot, you get stuck inside a tin can, and if you die you get put inside a trash can with the lid closed. No more trash talk, friendly banter, or compliments to the guy who killed you. Hopefully this gets fixed soon, as otherwise voice chat is one of the best parts of this game, because you don't get restricted by anything.
-Prestiging. There is basically no point to prestiging in this game right now. The only real thing that you get is the ability to use (you still have to get enough kills to unlock) specific skins. And when you prestige, you lose access to all your guns, though fortunately not the attachments.",1690938391,1702862836,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edited 12/17/2023.  I don't think I can recommend this game anymore.  The dev has implemented many decisions that are objectively terrible and ruining the game.  Like all good battlefield-genre games I think its time has come to an end, albeit much sooner than others of that brand name. 

Here are some recommendations to the dev if you want to make this game a success again:

1) Stop remaking maps.  They're fine the way they were.  If you don't like them, make new ones and add them to the pool instead of replacing the good maps.  New Basra for example is now just a copy of many of the others (flat, no incentive to use navy vehicles, wide open with no choke points).

2) You should notice how the player-count dropped off when you started forcing every game to play Invasion mode because you force matches of that mode instead of letting people vote to play it.  The large drop off of Conquest, Domination, and Frontline matches directly coincides with the drop off of player count.  They're not playing your new mode that you want to promote so hard, they're leaving the game entirely.

3) Snipers were fine.  When you leave nerfing decisions to vote and no one of the five classes have a majority of players using it, every vote will result in majority wanting to nerf that class.  This will repeat until they're all terrible.

4) The new sound system is objectively terrible.  Everything sounds like it's at the bottom of a well.  Even stubbing your toe makes your player deaf.  Why doesn't your own gunfire effect your player's hearing?  Why do terrain-injuries affect they player's hearing?  Inconsistent, poorly thought out and executed, and not needed whatsoever.  This is one thing the AAA studios get right over this game, testing new patches on test servers first and thinking through if they're needed at all.

5) The new class system is just plain bad.  I get what you're going for, but this isn't the right way nor even the right game to need this.  You want the sweaties to embrace this new class system but don't realize this game is mostly a bunch of casuals just having fun.  This new system will be at best ignored by experienced players and scare off new players.",1695529979,1702850615,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game was great at the start but as the updates go on and tweaks are made, it strays further from what made the release date fun. While yes some tweaks needed to be made such as the leaning and nerfing of the SMGs (Still not enough) the META is still SMG spam and light armor for COD levels of movement, armor also means nothing in the face of SMG engagements, only countered by long range snipers.

And speaking of snipers, snipers got nerfed bad, adding in Battlefields notorious scope glint for 6x or higher and bullet trail meaning they'll get picked out fast by everyone unless you're way out there in the back. While more so the DMR's are safe and unaffected by these nerfs, forcing snipers into a playstyle they don't want to take part in.

Then there is the QOL, head bobbing while neat, is not for everyone, there needs to be a setting to turn this off for the users or server wide, like the flashbang effect being a blackened screen compared to a white screen.
Character customization needs to be more streamlined and expanded upon with a viability to actually having armor on vs having none. Especially for classes that you'd expect to be better armored, such as the support, assault, or engineer class having better bullet/ explosive protection.",1691540331,1702850263,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

Hopefully they will think about the Linux people. 

But, if you have a Win PC, I highly recommend this game for you.

Update: The player base has slowly ruin this game for me. If you try to criticize the game, they will tell you no criticizing it. Even for a feedback!

Honestly a complete and total piece of shit compared to what it could've been tbh. It'll never be as good as it was during the early days of the closed alpha/beta. Game went from actual ""battlefield franchise to killer"" to ""waiting to be killed off by the next game to use the formula"" with just a few bad updates

They nerfed the damage of pretty much every weapon to the point where nothing one shot headshots anymore, even most DMRs and sniper rifles, the true Battlefield experience. 

Cheaters are rampant ever since early alpha/beta and basically nothing has been done to stop them

They also ruined RPGs, basically unusable now, they fire rocket propelled marshmallows now

The dev refuses to add shotguns for ""balance reasons"" lmao. 

And of course adding head-bob was a massive mistake, don't understand why they'd ever even consider it let alone implement it without the option to turn it off or reduce it like you can screen shake

It is an okay game, but unfortunately, it is not a battlefield-like game as advertised, at least from the conquest gamemode standpoint. People take a couple of direct 30 mm shots to die, and if it is not direct, then forget about it. The tank's main cannon, or coax hardly kills anything. Now I know that it is a game, so it doesn't have to be realistic, but it is so bullshit that it is gene-altering. There is a chance my future child is going to hate me for playing this game and tell me, ""Dada, why yoo do dis to me?"" if he/she/it can be called a human at this point. I am scarred forever, and my only wish is that mutations are somatic instead of germinal, so at least my kids will be free from the consequences. Vehicle physics makes you think it is some sort of parody of Battlefield. Unfortunately, I am unable to jump on the bandwagon and recommend it like everyone else, as I see that even the bandwagon is suffering from the physics of this game. I cannot recommend a game with this kind of vehicular gameplay, as your shots barely do any damage to the infantry. Your muzzle velocity and accuracy are so bad and random that it's laughable that you are driving a modern vehicle, not to mention the RNG that comes with it. Since I bought the game expecting at least ""okay"" vehicle gameplay, I am beyond disappointed, as I could have improved vehicle physics just by opening CMD and bashing my pen*s against the keyboard. It feels like shooting cotton balls at the enemy and driving bumper cars, and it is one of the worst of its kind I have ever seen. Even Unreal Tournament 2004 had better vehicle physics, and that game is now almost 20 years old. Hell even Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing was ahead of its time compared to this. It is only somewhat good if I am going to ignore vehicles, but even then, if you are wishing to play a game with no vehicles, I would recommend CS2, R6...

Now i would like to say i understand how Hard it is to balance Sniper in games like this i know you don't want everyone choosing the Sniper class and every one and the mother trying to oneshot kill from across the map ive played games where that is a prevalent issue but when it come to sniping mechanics of the game its now WORSE then every FPS out there, you now have 4 Means of detecting Sniper rending the class practically useless. 1st you got the noise, this game has Great audio and clearly hear the direction of foot steps and shots being fired and i understand this mechanic but you had to go out of you way to increase the noise detection up to 2000+ M for sniper rifles. now i would understand this if this was for specific rifles but there are some sniper rifles that use the same rounds as Assault Rifles and LMGs but they are not magically louder. 2nd you have Hit detection i have no complaints with this one i understand fully why this is in the game. 3rd you have the Glint Which makes NO FREAKING SENSE and for this one ill just link this Article https://armament.com/articles/glint-in-military-history/#:~:text=ARDs%20use%20a%20unique%20geometry,without%20depending%20upon%20individual%20action. Now im gland you reduce the Glint view to those only in your scope sight line when your sighted in i would be happier if it was removed all together but at least your on par with COD and BF. BUT ALL OF THAT WORK THE FIX THE GLINT IN THE GAME FROM SCOPES IS NEGATED WITH THE 4th ISSUE, FREAKING BULLET TRAILS WTF. i though the glint in the beginning of this game was bad but you had to be kind of paying attention to look out for Sniper BUT NOW ITS ALL GONE. any 5 yearold can follow a line its taught in most elementary schools. there is no point any more using the Sniper class any more unless you play it like COD or BF Run and gun and go for those quick scopes. theres no point in trying to be a overwatch sniper covering you squad as the cap a point or set a bomb or defend a target. there no point in sneaking behind enemy lines and take out player that are bottle necking a area of the map because as soon as you fire EVERY KNOW WHERE YOU ARE WITH THE BULLET TRAIL. Now i am not saying the developers are shit they are fantastic and they have made a wonderful blend of arcade shooter/milsim but i think the the sniper class and sniper class in any game has to go in one of 2 ways either Arcade style of sniping or Milsim Sniping there is no in between, you either make all the other classes happy and make Sniper lives hell or you make snipers happy and all other classes suffer the pain of good snipers, and i do think that once you make this decision the game will improve because it will become a core mechanic. People will have to Improvise, adapt, and overcome and formulate strategy on how to deal or use snipers going forward into the future of the game no more back and forth of making sniper good bad good bad good bad because it annoying. but all this beside sniping you should get the game for every thing else",1689181763,1702713386,True,0,0,0.491972476243972778,0,True,False,True

really great game love how a small team can do a much better job than EA.
its really good that they are taking feedback and looking at suggestions on the battlebit discord there is a main issue with this. there are hardly any casual players left. so anything that gets nerfed mostly movement and SMG's is met with the sweats getting angry

-SMG's need a nerf since they pretty much do every guns job even using them to medium range sniper works just fine.

-C4 is still overpowered. BuT YoU NeEd To PrEsS LeFt CliCk AND RiGhT CliCk. ok? its one extra input (dealing with the stickybomb launcher for 10 years its braindead easy to do) it does too much damage and you get 7 at most just make the ""Anti Grenade Trophy"" be able to delete C4

-It's fun when you actually get to have fun. It plays exactly like Battlefield, and that experience is something I dearly missed, but I'm not finding it here consistently contrary to what others claim. 

Drags down the experience: (all taken from 32v32 non-vehicle modes, all servers played on less than 35 ping):
-There's no tutorial. If you wanted any explanation of anything, you'll figure it out after you die. 
-Advertises destructible environments and levolution, and half-heartedly delivers. Not every building is fully destructible, but all the stairs are, so you'll constantly fight enemies that'll hold a building, blow up the stairs to prevent anyone from flanking or killing them, and they'll sit there having an uncontestable advantage for the rest of the game.
-No spawn protection when spawning on an ally who isn't in a ""safe"" zone. Did you want to wait five seconds before spawning on an ally right before he gets shot and killed, only for you to immediately die as well to wait another five seconds? Sounds fun right? Better get used to it. Additionally a LOT of maps have spawns that simply have no protection for you. You'll spawn in, and within 5 seconds of exiting ""spawn"" you can get shot and killed because the enemy has a clear sight line to where you exit from. 
-Spawning in general needs work. The actual spawn areas for all the maps and modes are placed seemingly at random, seemingly without understanding where the objective is, how players can get to it, or what natural advantageous terrain is around that can be used by both teams. A lot of maps on Rush will spawn you in the middle of nowhere, or in an open area with no cover right in the line of fire of the enemy, leading you to die frequently, constantly, and frustratingly. Additionally the spawn mechanic itself will frequently bug out, and just drop you wherever it feels like, rather than the spawn you clicked, or the teammate you clicked. 
-Having allies block your line of sight cause they're sitting right on top of you is annoying as hell. Gotta figure out how to fade people out while you're ADSing when they're too close to you. 
-Maps vary wildly between having way too much playable area, leading to you constantly dying to someone 200 meters away with a sniper rifle that no one can contest because there's only one way up and it's a ladder that someone else is watching, or too restrictive with its own playable area, leading to having only one way to assault an objective that everyone spams with explosives. Especially on Rush, the playable zone will often always have areas that aren't part of the enemy spawn, but you can't get to it because it's restricted, while said area has enemies in it that shoot at the rest of the map without repercussion. Or it'll be the flipside, where the enemy will push right up to your spawn zone and shoot you as you're coming out, and there's nothing you can do about it. 
-Speaking of, explosive spam is a thing, no matter the map or mode. 
-Tries way too hard to be ""mil-sim"" but fundamentally lacks any of the realism or decent implementation in order to be mil-sim, leaving all of the implemented features to feel clunky, and out of place. Bleeding is a poorly done mechanic that simply serves to screw you out of an engagement, or become an immediate death sentence by forcing you to cower in cover and wait to bandage yourself and then heal IF you're playing the Medic class. There's no health regeneration. Armor serves no purpose at all other than to be frustrating to play against, because you will shoot someone directly in the face with your red-dot planted perfectly on their nostrils, and the game will tell you you hit their armor. You will be cheated out of multiple kills, constantly, frequently, frustratingly, because the game says you hit their armor and did nothing else at all. The game plays best as a blocky arcade reboot of a Battlefield-esque type shooter, and all these added mechanics do nothing for the game and its strengths, and simply drag it down. 
-Hit-reg is very poor at all stages of the game. Again, you will lose fights because the game cannot keep up. This will happen constantly, frequently, and frustratingly. Nothing's more frustrating than shooting someone in the back, only for them to whip around and kill you because the rest of your mag disappeared. If you haven't noticed it, it's cause you're choosing not to look. 
-A lot of people are cheating. It's not super blatant like a 360 spinning one tap monster, but when you've played around 4000 hours of Battlefield, it's pretty obvious. A lot of people are toggling walling to watch for flanks, to prefire, or to line up instant headshots to win fights. There's a very clear difference between people who are actually good at the game (who you will encounter a lot, and it'll feel like they're cheating at first, but they're not.), and people who are actually cheating. It's very clear the EAC isn't working well, and hopefully overtime their anti-cheat gets better.
-SMGs dominate every stage of the game, because they're the best at practically all ranges. Add onto that using one increases your move speed, and you're constantly left in situations where the other guy simply jerks their mouse around while reloading to look like Neo from the Matrix before they flip around and kill you. It just gets old after a while. Its frustrating to play against because there's literally nothing you can do except have perfect tracking, but even then it won't work because of the hit-reg and depending on your weapon, slow bullet velocity. 
-Audio doesn't work, everything is just LOUD. Footstep audio is sometimes helpful, and other times very unhelpful. It's hard to distinguish where the enemy is, whether they're above or below or beyond a wall, etc. etc. vs. what's a friendly footstep, and it's not really well done.
-Kill-cam is completely worthless. Instead of giving you any information at all, it just zooms in on your legs. Battlefield 3 came out 12 years ago, and it actually gave you useful information with its kill cam. Zooming in on my dead legs is worthless. 
-Progression is still slow and awful. Now you level up faster, which is a nice added boon, but because the attachments are still given to you based on kills with a gun, rather than maybe points you can use like in Planetside, it leads to everyone sticking to the starter weapons because why would you bust out some new gun that might not even work at the 280 kill mark, when the M4 has ALWAYS worked? 
-Weapon and attachment balance are incredibly poor. Starter guns are too strong with their near 0 recoil and fast fire-rates, while later weapons often make you choose strengths vs. weaknesses without actually giving you a significant enough strength to make up for said weaknesses. Weapon attachment choice is 100% meaningless, because none of the options significantly impact a weapon outside of Vertical Grips and Tactical barrels. It's really hard to justify using anything other than a Vertical Grip, with its -0.20+ vertical recoil, when every other option either INCREASES your overall recoil (why?) or give you paltry -0.05 changes. 
-TTK is too fast and you will often simply just die within a split second without being able to meaningfully retaliate, and it just gets stale when you have to wait to respawn as well.",1687842843,1702625002,False,6,0,0.54869920015335083,0,True,False,True

It's not one thing, but a consistent stream of decisions and foundations that have become too much for me to enjoy what can be a really great experience.,  And the works and mentality of the devs should be something praised for trying to replicate the experience of older BF titles and FPS experiences without resorting to microtransactions and other features of modern gaming, save one. 

But I can't get over the graphics, they look awful.  I grew up on the SNES, you can make low poly game look good, and this is not that.  Everything looks drab and blend into each other, simply ugly brown or yellow to look at.  But worse than that everything you need from your eyes to play is handicapped from the how the game looks.  Friend/foe identification, whether the opponent is dead or prone, and depth perception make acquisition in this game a chore, and putting glow sticks on people's heads do not fix that.

As soon as I played this game, i knew the movement meta was going to be trouble. Leaning, going to prone, and strafing simply do not slow down the player or adversely affect aiming nearly enough, As soon as veterans picked up on the meta, this game does not look much different than the twitchiest COD shooter, and I hate it.  Those not able to keep up are reduced to camping, so now you can't move or be beamed by snipers only to be smashed by twitchers if you push in.

This game does have one problem of modern gaming, the live service/early access model.  But not in the same way as season passes or gimmicks, but that weird decision making that flips the meta and ideas are there.  
Now I was at first optimistic that maps I did not like were getting reworks, I felt I was being heard.  But I have found every reworked map to be worse than the previous, full of clutter and confusing pathing that made traversal and flanking a nightmare, at least for me.  Just as I feel comfortable with a map, it is gone.
I love the idea of changing less used guns and equipment before adding new ones, but I feel rather than making every gun and playstyle fun to play, it feels like a complete reset of my brain, too much to learn and adjust to, and to save time I resort to use just one method of play or just folllow the meta and not bother with the rest.  This hurts when that one playstyle is drastically affected by the update, causing yet more frustration.  
But the updates change so much so fast. Pinging goes from fine in one update to gone in another to overpowered in the next, same with sniping, DMR's, explosives, bandages, medics, assault class, and I'm like Stop!  Let me and the community adjust to one and grow and make small changes and test things before you wildly change the meta, I can't keep up.

I could say more (vehicles?!?, game pop, cheating/banning) but I have bashed enough,  and even the end I still have much respect for the devs refusal to go the way of EA and Activision, but these things are too much for me right now.

i dont like the direction the devs are taking with the bandage system, it feels like medics are becoming irrelevant as anybody can just heal themselves and they keep boosting how many each class can carry and increasing healing speeds while medic stays pretty much the same. i think there should be +/-75% healing cap (or something) unless you are a medic to balance it out. 

they also ruined the voting system. whole server wants to play a specific map? too bad. really sucks when devs force you to play their way and not let the players just have fun how they want. still a fun game, though

The Good:
-Good gun play
-Decent sounds
-Huge lobbies
-Destruction
-Local VOIP which makes some situations so much funnier

To improve:
-Quick join will sometimes stick you in a lobby with a queue of 80 people and you are either stuck waiting forever to load or ALT F4. Quick join should either not put you into a queue (ideally) or give you an option to back out of it.
-No way to edit loadouts or view gun stats in the home menu without going to gun range or in game.
-No description of game mode, some game modes are not clear and there's no easy way to see a description of the game mode (Would be good to place on the ESC screen)
-Would like to see small XP rewards for unlocking attachments on guns to help promote trying different guns and leveling them.
-No way to view stats of friends, would also be interesting to see challenges pop up between friends, maybe a weekly thing of who can get the furthest headshot, or most revives in a game, something for fun competition between friends weekly.

If the graphics don't deter you, then what you have here is an incredibly tight, well made shooter with tons of content. Battlebit boasts around 20 maps, has tons of different guns with various attachments you can apply to your heart's content, along with character customization, gadgets all spread across 5 different classes.
Every class has a solid purpose in the game, from healing, scouting, destruction, ammo supply etc. and every weapon despite the simple graphics is modeled and detailed excellently. 

The community is pretty entertaining, often screaming for help when on the ground incapacitated, cracking jokes and doing light roleplay. Sweats are usually rare, typically ignored and you don't even really have to have a mic to effectively play the game. Due to the large scale battles you can play at your own pace without people getting frustrated at you, battles are typically incredibly chaotic.

My only gripes are the lack of shotguns, no planned jets or other vehicles really aside from ground vehicles, helicopters and boats.  Lastly the progression takes a LONG time, once you have a gun you like expect to spend a good 5-10 hours unlocking everything for it. Hundreds of kills are needed to unlock scopes, barrels, stocks, and other attachments for any given weapon and some weapons absolutely SUCK without proper attachments.

Sniper rifles now leave a bullet trail that lasts for 3 seconds.
The sound of a sniper's bullet whizzing past is now distinct from other weapons.
The glint angle of sniper's long-range scopes has been heavily reduced.

I love the new mechanics for the sniper. The fact that the bullet has a different sound than a normal assault rifle allows you to realize when a sniper has you in his sights. I also like that snipers leave a trail when they shoot since it It gives the enemy a way to locate you without revealing your exact position at every moment, making you have to change position to stay hidden. The fact that snipers are now making more noise finally gives meaning to using a silencer. They just need to eliminate the glint or lower it to the minimum. so that the sniper class is fun to use without being op. If they finally do it the game would have at least 2 Classes to play with because the only one that works the way it has to work at this moment is the assault one. Don't get me started on the support class xd....

Plus you can give yourself a battlefield bad company color scheme! so id be lying if i said i wasnt having fun and the game wasnt good. However, the devs are their own worst enemy at this point. Im aware the team is just 3 guys who came together to make this game. But seriously, when a large amount of the community says they dont like something, the devs double down and ignore then complaints. The biggest issues at the time of writing this are snipers, instead of actually balancing the class they choose to try and make the class as unappealing as humanly possible. within the span of a couple months snipers have received around 4 major nerfs. Making them practically useless, one of those nerfs was, get this, nerfing snipers for staying in the back line. Yknow, the literal only thing snipers excel at??? and that seems to be a pattern, instead of actually balancing things. the devs try to strangle playstyles to force players into another role. It happened with medic, before medic was the only class to heal others. They were invaluable to the team, they could revive faster, and heal others. As the time went by however, theres not really a reason to play medic besides faster revive times. All classes can heal themselves, all can revive, only thing missing is seeing bleeding teammates. And now theyre doing it with sniper. strangling the class to try and force a playstyle instead of giving us that agency to choose. And beleive me, this is just the tip of it, i can write a novel about how the devs have ruined the playstyles or ruined things in this game.

Now another issue ive seen, is the 3D pinging system. We went from static pinging to a 3D system, and normally that would be a  nice change. But the way they did it is just atrocious, not to mention, last i played you couldnt ping while aiming down sights. if you saw someone you wanted to mark, youd have to stop aiming, open the clunky ping menu, and then ping the person. and honest to god, ive seen fat mexican kids run faster than this pinging system in HS. and brother was 300 pounds. On top of that, this ties into what i was talking about before. The devs being their own worst enemy. You see, they cant make up their minds for the world. for example, sniper, in the midst of all those major and heavy hitting nerfs, they buffed a single aspect of sniper. and thats the ping. it lasts a little bit longer than other classes. Keep in mind, this was the same update they removed pinging while ADS. So you cant watch a group of enemies with your scope and ping them (youd be spotted by the braindead glint system) like you could before. Instead if you see a group in the distance that you wanted to mark, youd have to stop aiming, open the menu (you cant move the menu mind you, youre stuck looking at a single point) and hope that you were both, on someone when you selected ping, and that the enemies didnt run past your focal point. Again, they say one thing and do another.  

As it stands, i really cant recommend this game. not until the devs make up their minds, start listening to feedback, and quit forcing playstyles for no real reason. If it werent for the devs screwing up over every little thing, then the game would literally be perfect. But we arent in a perfect world sadly",1701558319,1702510267,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

For a while, glint coming off your scope whenever you were looking down it was like a bright sun to other players. Latest patch makes that glint be visible in a smaller cone, so that's a slight buff. The trade off? Now your bullets leave a stupidly obvious trail that immediately gives away your position anyway every time you take a shot, as if your sniper bullets were goddamn jet propelled. The change to glint is pointless when now people don't even need to turn around to see your glint, they just look at the smoke trail that only snipers produce and can immediately start moving erratically or get to cover.

You took your time getting into position to cover a point for your teammates, so enemies attempting to take it or defend it have a harder time? Too bad, now if you take a single shot everyone around the area will know where your shot came from so they can avoid you and you have to reposition all over again. After killing just 1 out of 127 players on the enemy team. Unless they're stupid of course and do nothing about it, but balancing around people who can't handle getting one-shot because they were standing still or moving predictably in the open is never a good idea. Sniper has plenty of counter play but I guess the devs got bullied back in high school by sniper players.

The game is otherwise pretty good. But I'll come back to it when the devs actually know how to properly balance a sniper without making it a chore to play. I wouldn't be surprised if the devs add a permanent 3d spot on Recon players so they are constantly visible to enemies at all times the way things have been going.",1702504080,1702504158,False,6,1,0.523344933986663818,0,True,False,True

Plain and simple: I love it. It is a mixture of BF2 and BF3, but with added gameplay mechanic to it that make it pretty fun to play. For example, the proximity chat is useful and sometimes hillarious. The destruction is a major plus, especially since I run as an Engie. I love destroying peeps hiding behind walls, destroying cover with RPGs and C4. The gunplay is pretty good too with DMGs, ARs, Carbiines, DMRs with many attachments that add to the progression. Love the grappling hook system similar to what BF2had, it should have been like that in 2042. It has a Server Browser in which I use every time I play. Like you said, doesn't take too much effort to run the game, so it's easy on my CPU and GPU.

It's still not perfect.
CONS: I dislike that they allow adding C4 and Mines on Drones to get 4-5 multi kills. Also Suicide C4 vests is wow, why devs?, thankfully I hardly get killed by that cheese. Not a fan of having so many modes, I just stick to Domination and Conquest and its variations. While I like the self-heal with bandages mechanic, I don't like fact how easy you can bleed which in turn slows down the fight for non-medic classes. Maybe reduce that a bit, another thing is sniper spam sometimes, but learning the map helps avoid them.

Compared to BF?..So I've had too many hours in BF4, BC2, BF3 servers are dead. BF1 gunplay has weird and casual mechanics and no way I'm going back to BFV; much less with BF2042.

BUT this game commits my largest pet peeve as an MG player: the light machine guns do just as much damage as an smg, some smgs do more!! Coming from Hell let loose, squad, where machine gun classes are actually dangerous, this game infuriates me on that. It gives NOBODY incentive to play that class or role. The common argument is ""yeah well big magazines make them more dangerous"". It doesn't matter if it has the same TTK as an SMG, MGs are meant to be used to wipe out groups, and this is impossible when they have the longest TTK in the game. This makes this game just another game where the weapon choice is either: sniper, or really fast smg dude, nothing else actually matters, and it shows if you spectate a game.

The game has no sense of teamwork beyond medics, anyone could easily solo a group of they have an smg. It brings the best of battlefield to the table and I love that. But it also brings my least favorite aspect of COD and BF too.

- Maps are a mixed bag of really bad, ok and kind of good. This is more opinionated but I really do not like most maps. Would like to see more city, tropic themed or inhabited beach-side towns. Too much washed out/autumn aesthetics.

- Game modes are just average. It's constantly domination, conquest, frontline (kind of), invasion (cause it's new) and never ctf and stuff. Part of it is the community, the other part is the modes being just typical fps modes. Doubt there is a way to fix this but it does get boring after awhile.

- At a certain range, environment objects like grass and shrubbery do not render at all. This means players with far sights like snipers will see you and kill you. Sure snipers contribute practically nothing, but they are a massive nuisance and kill the vibe. The nerfs to snipers did not affect the rifles, so most people switch to those instead. So long-range/snipers are still a pain to deal with.

- Bullet drop is barely a problem. Most weapons can kill you from a far distance which does at times feel bs. Getting killed by a sub-machine gun from sniper range makes sniping a pain so it sort of balances out the previous point.

- There are hackers but they aren't as bad compared to other fps games. Still the anti-cheat system needs improvement.
Like a few hours into a game I saw a ban wave of like 20 players banned for cheating. That does not bode well for the game.

- Abuse of the report system. Someone can decide to report you even if you did not do anything. This means a group of people can basically kick you or ban for no reason.

- A fair bit of toxicity. Some of it's trolls, and others are just pricks. This is both from chat and voice chat. It ain't as bad as other fps games, but would not be surprised if it did eventually reach the same level.

- Voice chat. It can be hilarious at times and enjoyable, other times it's just mic spam of music, really loud toxic yelling, etc. Not much of a way to fix this problem, just going to have to live with it.

- Can't change loadouts outside of a match. You have to be in-game to change anything.

- The same matches over and over again. Same maps, same game modes, cause people want those. Wouldn't be so bad if it worked like other games with custom matches or something. Like servers dedicated to gamemodes or even to a single map (TF2 for example). For now the match finder system is not that great.

- Vehicles are paper-thin. Sure it's realistic but I rarely see any ground based vehicles survive for long. This is at least a problem on 64v64 or 127v127. At least vehicles like the jeep respawn quickly.

- Currently drones are very broken with the fact that someone can just send out a drone and mark the entire enemy team (a bit exaggerated but point still stands). 

None of these by themselves are alone major problems but it does add up when put all together. It's still very fun, but expect some sour moments.",1702437663,1702437663,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's great for about 5 minutes if you are lucky. Most every engagement involves you dying in one shot across the map by anything but a sniper rifle. Armor is meaningless as you soot someone and it appears to work for them. However when you are shot at it acts like paper and you along with your entire squad die wondering how. The weapons in this game are to far from being considered as balanced. Every engagement you have that is in your favor the person you are shooting at 180's you and head shots you after you've fired an entire mag into them, and you being left there to be confused how they did not die. I love the amount of involvement the devs have but the game is not in the right state, I had the most fun during the play tests, but as soon as the game became readily available to more players. I've sen such an increase in players with impossible movement, reaction time, aim bot accuracy, invincibility, spawn traps, and game breaking bugs. The game has just been increasingly impossible to play. I want to see this game succeed but in the state that it's in now and has been since early access launch. This game is sadly becoming just another broken Battlefield wannabe title.

                 4. 6 out of 8 players in every squad are snipers

Sniping and long range combat has been nerfed to pointlessness. Every update seems to move the game away from the original milsim light concept towards a more arcadey shooter

Select weapons like the UMP, Vector, M4A1 that can be modded to not recoil like a wild mule vastly outclass the numerous that do. You'll quickly notice that about half the population is running around with the same ~5 weapons because guns that land their bullets will always outclass ones that don't no matter how the DPS or whatever other 'mathematical balance' pencils out on paper. Snipers take you out from a km away, at least you can try to spot and ping them for your team to ignore and it doesn't seem like they contribute much to the match, still infuriating. Bunch of maps but the community picks the same 5 over and over. Occasionally the comms are hilarious, but usually it's someone yelling into the cheapest microphone imaginable, preventing you from hearing the footsteps of the enemy soldiers running in the back door of the building you're occupying.

Still more fun than any Battlefield I've played in the past 15 years. If you like the type of game and can just accept that random bullets from someone 300 yards away are going to by fluke chance embed themselves in your skull, or you're going to step on a landmine in a bush that you had no way of seeing, or someone's going to walk up behind you and kill you before you can even turn 180 degrees, a lot, you'll probably enjoy it.

There are a few irritating balancing decisions in my opinion, especially with the way armor works and how much attachments can slow down your movement speed. It is rarely worth using extended magazine attachments because they typically slow your movement speed down by 10-15%. Armor can make the time-to-kill (TTK) feel very unpredictable, as the TTK increases dramatically the heavier the armor someone is wearing. Overall though, it is an amazing game.

They added 3D spotting to the game. They continue to nerf the weakest class in the game. All sniper scopes regardless of magnification have scope glint.

But, as happens with everything else, the devs listened to the community, and now it just sucks, particularly if you played from release day. They added community servers, which largely scattered the player population, as well as made ""improvements"" to the server selection screen, which is essentially pointless now, because say you wanted to hit refresh until you saw the map/gamemode you wanted, it won't happen. The function is still there, but with the way servers are set up now, your Night River match (or whatever you were in the mood for) ain't coming. 

All of it is basically off-putting when combined with changes to the weapon system. Vector needed nerfed a little bit (just because too many people were using it) but beyond that things could have been left largely alone. It was a game of low-poly graphics and comical gameplay, and as soon as the BF players showed up and started demanding stuff, that aspect of it was gone. Save your money. It WAS worth it.

I'm just going to back to single player games exclusively. Anything multiplayer is subject to the same flaw, which is over-development as a result of pressure from (what is usually) the loudest minority.  Because gamers think they know what they want, until they get it, or what they want is poorly implemented, but the community is usually the party responsible for destroying the things we claim to love. So screw you fellow gamers. There's Baldur's Gate 3 and soon enough, Starfield. And then an election which we're unlikely to survive. You can't even vote in correct game changes...I have no faith in you to elect stable leadership :P

UPDATE: A friend said ""come back its fun again"" and I did and it was, although not the same as it was, it was passable. I was about to change my review to a recommendation...but then this patch they added trails to sniper bullets. Like World of Warships style shell tracers. This completely ruins playing recon. The whole idea behind snipers is their stealth and ability to keep the enemy guessing as to their location. It is the only real defensive capability they have, and there already multiple ways to find one. Flashlights, tactical flashlights, flares, a TARGET DETECTOR attachment now (point toward where you think hes at, and crosshairs coming close enough highlights him with a triangle over his head) so the trails then completely class-breaking overtinkering designed to cater to like four or five people. Or maybe one of the devs has an idiot cousin or something who needed a handicap applied game-wide. CHANGE IT BACK AND QUIT FUCKING WITH SHIT

I can only conclude Battle Bit Remaster's (BBR) title as a ""runaway success"" is what has compelled the developers to persistently employ a heavy hand in ""rebalancing"" the game. The transformation of BBR into a [u]""live-service game""[/u] due to these changes is the primary reason I cannot recommend it.

It is evident that BBR initially launched as a nearly finished product, drawing significant inspiration from the Battlefield series. It offered a refreshing, low-render take on solid gameplay mechanics that accommodated a wide range of playstyles. However, as the game approaches its 1.0 release, [u]the updates have aggressively extended past the publishers roadmap[/u] and have become sweepingly [b]balance-breaking, meta-shifting, playstyle-killing, gameplay focused changes.[/b]

The developers have shown a lack of sympathy when implementing changes that isolate playstyles not aligned with their current vision of BBR. These changes in no way resolve the more substantial issues the game is currently experiencing, such as the unstable and janky vehicle platform that has been ongoing since launch.

What these updates have accomplished is limited and narrowed the range of gameplay options, [u]promoting a Skinner-box gameplay model.[/u] This involves removing gameplay options that could hinder the reward seeking behavior designed to keep players constantly engaged, alienating those who purchased the game for the liberties its Battlefield-like roots originally offered.

These changes lead me to believe that the developers have shifted away from their initial Battlefield inspiration. Instead, it seems they are now focused on [u]creating a game space that maximizes cheaply retaining players attention and opening opportunities for monetization.[/u] This shift is evident in their recent ""deal"" and in-game advertisements featuring the United States Air Force. 

Irrespective of your preferred play style, the updates this game has experienced have been so drastic that it no longer resembles the game I initially purchased. [u]Updates since launch have gradually undermined various playstyles, rendering them virtually unapproachable.[/u]The developers have proven themselves very capable at launching a title, but they are [b]objectively deficient at understanding a live environment, incremental change, and multiplayer balance at a fundamental level.[/b]",1702327044,1702327414,False,72,4,0.707944929599761963,8,True,False,True

A $15 early access game puts AAA titles to shame.

Game feels polished to me and the developers update frequently. Runs fantastic (low settings at 75fps) on my AMD Ryzen 3 4300U with IGPU.

awful, truly horrible maps for an FPS game
devs unfortunately listen to the reddit/discord shitters

could be great, if the devs accepted that it is a full arcade game and treat it accordingly
you have a game with solid movement mechanics, build upon that with content and GOOD MAPS
