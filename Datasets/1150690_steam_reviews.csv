I would describe the game as similar to Undertale in style if the main driver was tragedy and loss instead of comedy and hope. The whole game has the overarching feeling of the g-route in Undertale but more personal and melancholic.

The game is a JRPG with turn-based mechanics, but with a twist in that the dynamics are based on the emotional states of the party and enemies. I think the battle system is fun and meshes very well with the story, but if you're absolutely sick of turn-based battles then you might find it to be a drag. Although, there are no random encounters; all encounters are activated by touching enemies visible in the overworld and you basically don't need to grind, so you don't feel slowed down. I think the pacing is excellent.

The game contains very heavy themes and disturbing imagery, so keep that in mind if you're sensitive, especially to depictions of depression and suicide. It's a psychological horror game, but the horror elements ultimately serve to make you sad, not scared, although it can be pretty frightening.

The artstyle is supremely charming but watch the trailers to form your own opinion. The music is also fantastic. The game has a couple of different routes which gives it some replay value, but the central mystery is the main appeal and this can be approached through two main routes. Expect your first playthrough to give you at least 20 hours of gameplay if you don't rush through, and probably 50 hours if you want to see everything.

Now I already knew that this was going to be a depressive game from the start, and that this game can give people depression. That was completely fine, as I am feeling a bit depressed myself, and I like to play emotionally intense games, especially ones with mental illness themes. It helps a lot with putting myself in the place of other people like the characters within this game, and it allows me to feel more seen with the mental state I am in. I guess that says a lot about me to play these games mentally unwell lol.

One emotion that remained constant throughout the time I played this game is the empathy. I relate too much with the characters that I feel sort of fucked up in that way. Sunny's fears and loneliness, Aubrey's [spoiler]sense of being misunderstood and[/spoiler] raw emotion, Basil's anxieties. They all remind me of myself. The game does really well in exercising the short and long term effects of anxiety, depression, and loneliness through the eyes of the protagonist. It does it in a manner that is not over exaggerated. Each character has a mountain of depth waiting to be unpacked in the scope of OMORI's breadth. During your exploration of the game's maps, you can listen along with the amazing soundtracks that have been a joy to hear, ranging from chill adventure music to intense bangers of boss fight music. The world building is resonating enough to exude nostalgia to those who long for the days when they could have the imagination of a young child.

Despite what many say about turn based combat, I find it exciting, especially with the feature of utilizing emotions to lay out a strategy against common foes and challenging bosses alike. It not only adds some difficulty, but it feels unique in the way that the game portrays emotion in combat. It integrates the game's thematic focus on emotions into the gameplay itself.

No, I'm not bawling my eyes out at 3 in the morning. You are!

OMORI is truly a game you have to experience to understand. 
I don't know how to feel about it. The story is both heartwarming and heart-shattering at the same time. 
Seriously, if you somehow haven't gotten this game spoiled for yourself, go play it, now. It is one of the most emotionally powerful games I have ever played and one of the few games that made me genuinely sob at multiple points in the game. I don't know how a story can go from 0 to 100 that quickly without feeling some tonal whiplash, but somehow, someway, OMORI pulls this off brilliantly multiple times. It portrays trauma, guilt, depression and fear so well that I just stared at the screen processing what the hell I just saw multiple times. The ""something"" that follows you around the whole game is absolutely terrifying at times with me being unable to move in-game and irl out of fear.
It sucks that this story unfortunately trips at the finish line. The big reveal at the end of the game is great, but it just leaves a plot hole that can sort of be ignored if you squint really hard. I won't say what the plot hole is for spoiler reasons, but it's a plot hole that exists depending on how you look at the game. If the stars aligned perfectly in the game's story, then this plot hole technically doesn't have to exist.

The gameplay is not as amazing as the story. The battle system is great, but everything else in terms of gameplay is just okay.
The battle system, like I said, is great, however the battles themselves are... not that great. Like, the boss fights are amazing, they are some of the game's highlights, but the battles against regular enemies are just too short and easy for me to actually think about what I'm doing. Most regular battles are just spamming attack with all of my characters until the enemy dies. The boss fights are great because doing only that isn't going to work. I actually have to think about what skills synergize with what and what emotions my characters should have (I know, strategy in a turn-based RPG, crazy right?). It's a shame that the game doesn't have that many really hard bosses, because that's when I had the most fun with the battles. 
Now, the gameplay outside of the battles, isn't much better. It's split into two parts: the Headspace segments and the Faraway Town segments. One of them happens in the protagonist's head and the other one is in the real world. 
The Headspace segments are great but man do they drag on for wayyy too long. Like, some areas could be completely cut from the Headspace segments and the game would honestly benefit from it. A lot of them are just filled with boring padding where nothing meaningful happens. Like, in terms of the game's story, that makes sense. It's the protagonist trying to supress all the messed up thoughts that he has. But this translates to the gameplay being so god damn boring sometimes. Thankfully, the Faraway town segments are amazing. I don't have many complaints about them because it's where stuff actually happens and characters actually develop. 
One thing I can't stand in both of the worlds is backtracking. I missed SO MUCH content on my first playthrough solely because I almost never went back to areas I already explored. Sure, that's kinda my problem for the most part but it was a little frustrating missing an entire area because I missed a train station in the very first area of the game. Although, I will give the game credit, if you're someone who looks around everywhere and I mean EVERYWHERE, then there is a good chance you will be rewarded for your curiosity.

However, unlike the gameplay this game's soundtrack rocks! There are so many good songs in this OST. Especially the boss themes. 
A lot of songs utilize leitmotifs in such clever ways where I can't even tell it's supposed to sound like another song from the OST, but when you listen closely you can hear it and it's awesome. For example, I love how the Faraway Park theme has this part which sounds so similar to the Headspace Playground theme yet it also sounds nothing at all like that theme.
And oh man, the way this game uses music to play with your emotions is just soul crushing. It knows exactly when to play THAT theme (if you know, you know) and I would be lying if I said I didn't start sobbing when it starts playing.

The visuals are also amazing. Most of the game is in pixel art which is really good, especially the animations, but the battles and cutscenes have this hand-drawn looking style which I absolutely adore. It makes me wish the whole game was in this art style. 
I also love the animations that visualize attacks in battles because almost each attack has it's own unique animation which adds so much charm into an otherwise visually bland battle system.
The game also uses low quality realistic photos for some backgrounds and joke enemies which are pretty funny imo.

[h1]TLDR[/h1]
The story's great with one big ""idk how I feel about it"" flaw and the gameplay is perfectly servicable. Music goes hard and the art style is fantastic. Probably gave me depression for the next couple of months. Definitely recommend.",1701570872,1708642153,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

It's a rough diamond, but easily a must-play if you haven't seen *any* spoilers before stumbling here. It's perfect if you waltz in blind.

No, it's not Undertale, and i know that it's promotion (and some of the early-game, be that with Something or... anything else) makes it seem childish. It isn't that.

It's a generally well-written game with a quite likeable cast, making you feel bad for said cast, it has room for interpretation and discussion, nice art, good music, interesting-ish plot, pretty high attention to detail, leitmotifs that count as detail, foreshadowing, and memorable events of a variety. Basic things being complimented as if they were unique, i know, but the game just does well in all aspects.
When it hits a peak, it hits a peak. The moments where the game is at it's best are just perfect.
All of that meshes together pretty well.

A bit of the type where the player would wish to lose their memory to re-experience it. 

The large amounts of good is dulled and dented by a few things, one of the more apparent issues being the *slow* beginning the game has, along with non-excellent pacing on some other parts, which causes people to say that the entire game feels like a slog. I didn't really notice that, aside from minor annoyance during some parts that people generally liked, which is... funny? Sort-of?

Shouldn't forget about the issues that rise if you aren't bent towards what the game wants you to feel, or just having a distaste towards a few aspects.
Though, as you somehow will not notice any of the mild issues and inconsistencies that don't change much (if you even realise they exist, that is), you'll be fine, because there is stuff to awe over. As i said, the game's a ride, and besides, most people weren't bothered by it at all.

Ignoring the last (negative) part, it's certainly one of the better games that i have played recently, maybe ever. The positive traits make up a great game, which... well, obviously has something to do with the Overwhelmingly Positive ratings and some people describing it to be life-changing. I don't know if the game is ""lighting caught in a bottle"", but some feel like it is. The negative traits or issues don't ruin it, but you can easily have an issue with them. 

There's a reason that i kind of had an obsession with the game (Or ""brainrot""), as have other people, despite some of the things that i had disliked. I won't actually mention them particularly, because, in-case somebody actually reads this, their experience could be tainted.

Also, maybe ignore that about... 36~% of the players reached the ending, i can't say how or why. 



And... that's it. Feel free to ask questions, as the comments are not locked.
Maybe look at the other positive reviews of the game if you want to, though, they are *far* more positive. Negative ones also tend to lead too heavily into negativity, so it would be hard to find a balanced take.

Alright, have a good day.

Admittedly, the combat does get mildly boring after a while, but I feel like OMORI easily makes up for that in its story. So much so to the point where I've literally witnessed myself become emotionally attached to one of the main characters. Hell, I would go as far as saying that this game quite literally has changed my life. Because if I had never seen or got interested in this game, I would've never met my partner.

It actively discourages false positivity, toxic nostalgia, and mental repression. You cannot ""fight"" away your past or sweep it under the rug; you [u] MUST[/u] face it head-on, no matter how much it may hurt or how devastating the consequences may be. We're also talking well beyond the realm of mere uncomfortability, as OMORI deals with some very dark and traumatic subject matter. Despite this, OMORI also advocates for patience, understanding, and personal responsibility, reminding us that those we love will be there for us when we need them, and, as painful as it can be, reality will always be more comforting than a world built on falsehoods.

Some things I like: I like OMORI's soundtrack. A lot. It is atmospheric, unsettling, sentimental, emotional, and heart-pumping (in more ways than one.) Some of my favorite battle themes are It Means Everything, World's End Valentine, GOLDENVENGEANCE, You Cannot Go Back, Underwater Prom Queens, [spoiler] OMORI [/spoiler], and Whale Whale Whale. Some of my favorite other themes are Remember to be Patient, H20:HCL, A Home for Flowers (Daisy), Sinking, Lost at a Sleepover, Poems in the Fog, Clean Slate, and Spaces In-Between. The skillfully crafted hand-drawn art present in battles and interspersed cutscenes is nicely evocative of a children's book. Also, major kudos to OMORI for not using the common trope of disparaging medication and/or therapy. I don't agree with stories about mental health that put down real-life resources that can make a significant positive impact on people who are suffering.

Some spoilers follow:

[spoiler] My biggest gripes with the game are with its pacing and certain aspects of the real world. Some RPG sections drag on for too long, and as the combat/gameplay is quite simplistic (but still satisfying, I must mention), you might find yourself wanting the pace to pick up a bit. This was more of an issue for me in my first playthrough, as the psychological horror-tinted teases for what really happened are so tantalizing that I wanted to get to the truth as quickly as possible. One thing I commend the devs for is how quickly you earn EXP, especially towards the end. Grinding never felt like a slog. As for the real world, I found some of it too silly for my liking. The game clearly wants to have its off-kilter, Earthbound-esque indie RPG small town with all of the wacky trappings like fighting other kids and doing part-time jobs (which is strange in and of itself for someone who hasn't left their home in 4 years to want to do), but I felt this approach didn't mesh well with the extremely silly and bizarre Headspace existing already. I would've appreciated it if the real-world segments were just a touch more mundane or perhaps more complexly written to be better balanced out against the dream world. That being said, there were segments of the real-world I really enjoyed, such as Basil's despondency and especially how they handled real-world Aubrey and her struggle to navigate her dissonant feelings of abandonment, grief, and justified rage. [/spoiler]

Through effective use of symbolism, humor, and horror, OMORI's impactful story encourages healthy responses to trauma and guilt. Things can get better, but it's up to us and how we want to handle confronting our issues.",1708381459,1708482441,True,4,0,0.56204378604888916,0,True,False,False

The game play is not commendable. With this being said, the story is more than to compensate for the game lacking game play attributes. I kept the game running over night (which is the reason for my heavy hours in this title, Omori) in Humphrey's headquarters because to close the game and reignite the sequence would result in you needing to re battle Medusa and the other two scientist and listen to tedious dialogue. After being deficient in resources that had diminished prior to the Humphrey's battle I looked at the meta on how to beat Humphrey, I recommend this YouTube guide for people disadvantaged alike myself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu9U_xGm8wQ&t=357s

This game has a very heavy drive on story which positively reflects this peace of art and negates other issues Omori might have. 

I won't give the full detail because the game is well established with many constructive reviews. What I will say is, Snaley was an enemy from the start and don't show symphony and be deceived by the unfortunate circumstances inflicted upon the fella!

Visually, Omori is a treat for the eyes. The game features vibrant and colorful graphics that contrast with the dark themes it explores. The character designs are charming and memorable, adding to the overall appeal of the game. The soundtrack is equally impressive, with a hauntingly beautiful score that perfectly complements the atmosphere of the game. The combination of stunning visuals and captivating music creates a truly immersive and emotionally charged experience.

[b] Reception and Recommendation [/b]

Omori has received widespread acclaim from both critics and players alike. It has been praised for its compelling storytelling, unique gameplay mechanics, and thought-provoking themes. The game's ability to tackle sensitive topics with sensitivity and depth has resonated with many players, making it the best title in the RPG genre.

However, it's important to truly note that Omori may not be for everyone. the game did contain depictions of depression, anxiety, and suicide, which may not be suitable for all audiences. It also included bright flashing imagery that may be triggering for some individuals.

In conclusion, Omori is a gem of a game that should be recognized for its innovative storytelling, captivating visuals, and emotional depth. It offers a unique and thought-provoking experience that will leave players reflecting long after they have finished playing. However, it's important to quickly approach the game with an open mind and be aware of its sensitive content. If you're looking for the best game that RPGs have to offer and explores complex themes, Omori is definitely worth checking out.",1643772475,1708189763,True,0,0,0.494505524635314941,0,True,False,False

One day it was my brothers birthday, i bought omori for him. He tried a bit but never played it, my sister got omori too she quit too. 1 year later i got it. It was pretty fun, then that got my brother to play in about a week i quit on sweetheart while my brother beat it, and he said it was one of his favorites ever. Eventually about 3 months later i got on and finally beat sweetheart. After that it was an AMAZING expirence. Once i beat humphrey. I finally got to the end of the game. Without giving spoilers lets just say i got the  ""Abandoned ending"" i was mad. Then i watched the good ending. Finally about a 4 months later i decided to beat it again. That time i flew through the game beating it in 15h. I got the good ending and it was offically my favorite game ever. 

Story
The story is amazing probably one of the best stories ever it tricks you into thinking its a happy game. The charachters are so amazingly designed that it feels like they are actually real and you feel emotion when somthing drastic happens to one of them.

Gameplay
Some people are not a fan of the fighting style (it is an rpg) in my opinion its very fun its sort of a pokemon style fighting based of turns. Most rpg games have some sort of ""this is weak to this and that"" this game uses emotions which is highly unique.

Tips
I wanted to search up the ending when i quit, my advice DONT its all worth it in the end. I hope this brings u to buy the game it is truly a master piece",1689816006,1708185100,True,1,0,0,5,True,False,False

This game was very good and the story was golden. The game looks like a kids game but is pretty fucked up. There is suicide, depression, murder, guilt and more. Thankfully with the cannon ending (sunny route) You get a satisfying happy ending. Honestly cannot forget of this game. Its a game that will sting and stay there for a while. I love it.

It is an incredible game that is often poorly paced. It both opens and closes incredibly well, but the middle sections of the game were often dull. Its 20h story could easily be cut down with the removal of certain moments, or even entire areas, to make for a more focused experience, which would solve almost all of its issues. Additionally, random combat encounters feel entirely unnecessary, and removing them would help to bring the game closer to a more appropriate 10-12h runtime, and only make the boss fights, which are mostly really good, feel even more significant.

However, despite these issues with pacing, Omori뗩 story is an incredible one, which tackles its themes with incredible precision. It뗩 very difficult for me to properly express the exact reasons for which the game뗩 story is so good, without spoiling it, but I can say that its last 3h were what properly convinced me that Omori is an incredible game. Backing that brilliant story is a phenomenal soundtrack. It features a lot of music traditional for a pixel rpg, with a very fitting, psychedelic touch. It really shines, though, in the game뗩 boss fights and more significant story moments  again, especially in those last 3h or so. And the game뗩 visual art is exceptional, featuring vivid pixel art and beautiful hand-drawn images, which effectively convey the emotions of the story. 

Ultimately, Omori is a phenomenal game which, despite poor execution in some moments, wholly deserves the high praise it receives.",1708016003,1708044205,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

But I am going to give a spoiler-free list of a few things I wish I knew during my first playthrough:
[list]
    [*]To reach the Good ending, the only things that matter are that you open the door to Kel on the first and second morning, and that you don't go back to sleep or go outside during the sleepover at Basil's house. Everything else is fair game. Nothing that happens in Headspace will matter in the long run.
    [*]At one point you'll reach a game of opening randomly strewn doors. Open every black door before touching the red one. You'll recognize the last black door in that it takes place on a playground.
    [*]Install Photo Album Extended mod. It makes one of the best parts of the game even better by letting you read the hidden descriptions of photos at the end.
    [*]Avoid reading anything about Sunny, Mari, or Basil, if you care about spoilers. I thought I didn't and I regret it to this day.

The artstyle in this game is amazing. The pencil-sketched aesthetic has an unassuming quality that perfectly matches the world we see through the eyes of a child. When the game starts to reveal its cards, certain figures and objects have jarringly different styles that help emphasize the dissonance. Color and motifs are carefully planned and packed full of symbolism, more than I know how to talk about.

Music is absolutely banging. The bossfight tracks are especially great, super hype when half your team is toast and you're desperately trying to hold on. Throughout the story, you hear a certain melody, in various incomplete/distorted electronic forms. Then you reach this certain point in the game, [spoiler] after everything has built up to a climax, you finally hear the full, clear, instrumental song, [/spoiler] and the emotional weight hits you like a truck. That's probably my favourite moment in the game.

Difficulty was just right. Hard enough to keep you engaged but never a real struggle. There's some leeway in team builds, if you don't care about combat I'm pretty sure Omori's SAD POEM + Kel's MEGAPHONE wipes the floor with most enemies. Progression is natural and there's not much backtracking. 

I love all the little details in this game, from the punny enemy designs that are plays on words, to how all the sprite designs in battle have small variations depending on what emotions you inflict on them, to the goofy side quests and characters, to obscure interactions like Kel using FLEX will cause the muscle mussel enemies to lower their attack because they're insecure.

I won't say anything about the main story itself. Not because it falls short,that couldn't be more opposite. Absolutely go into it blind, don't look for any more details. You won't be disappointed.

OMORI gave me wishful nostalgia for memories I never had, and wry smiles at the quirky humor. It broke my heart utterly and gave me hope at the same time. And it told a powerful message I'll be thinking about for a long time. Please play this game.",1707983556,1707983556,True,1,0,0.5,0,True,False,False

As a JRPG, the mechanics of the game are just as well though out, even if battle balance tends to be on the easy side and fights tend to drag as you progress through the game. Yes, it's a game about somewhat real, somewhat fake Americana (tm) that sometimes veers into trite territory, and the NPC-to-NPC, setpiece-to-setpiece quips and humor seem like a mirror image of that series. If OMORI was just trying to be a carbon copy of that series, I wouldn't be writing this, but as you may be able to tell, there's more than that to this game.

OMORI opts to do something that its inspirations (or nearly any other game) didn't, couldn't, and wouldn't do: pull you in and suffocate you with its horrifyingly dark undercurrent. The scenario for this game is horror in its rawest sense, drip-feeding you implications about the story that only manage to get darker. Making the player choke up in terror from the storytelling, art direction and music when all is revealed is its greatest accomplishment, delivering point-blank one of the best endings and emotional payoff in a video game ever.

[spoiler]...or you could just not get this payoff. There's a way to just not resolve the plot and live in denial, failing everyone and persisting in the doomed escapism you created. For a game about undercurrents, the darkest and deepest undercurrent is one that most players won't even see, but the mere existence of makes me legitimately nauseous.[/spoiler]",1707850691,1707851877,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

good luck

with that being said, this is one of the best story focused games i have ever played ever. PLEASE DO NOT SPOIL THE STORY TO YOURSELF, GO IN BLIND!!!!. The only critic i can name is at some points i was too invested into the story that i just didnt care about the Head space game play. thats it, besides that this is my favorite RPG ever made and i highly highly reccomend it.

idk what all the hate is about i think its the Dev OMOCAT has pissed some people off but i looked into it and it just people being babys, if you are offended of anything shes ""done"" then just seperate the art from the artist i guess idk

I won't say it changed my life or anything, but it was clear that this is a one of a kind experience, and it really did blow me away. It's a heartbreaking story of grief, acceptance, and a kind of horror that is horrifying because of how real it is.

This isn't a story that tries to make you feel good or tie up all the loose ends neatly by the end. Instead, you can't help but cry alongside the characters with the same pain and reflect on everything that happened afterwards.

Sunny definitely reminded me a lot about myself and reminded me about what it takes to truly move forward from painful memories. I'm still doing my best to keep at it. 游뗵

If it weren't for me playing NieR:Automata prior to this, it would have easily taken the spot for my favorite game and that's only really due to my personal preferences.

One thing I don't understand is how this game doesn't have steam cards nor any emojis or stuff you'd expect from other games, there was definitely care put into the achievements yet no steam cards or emojis / steam backgrounds? And there's apparently exclusive console content for Omori as well... a big pity it's not on the steam version..

first of all, id consider this a 10/10, straight up. this to me, is a master-craft in storytelling.

and third, the art styling, the worlds and locations, the characters are amazing. (Hero and Aubrey are my favourite.)

Omori is the type of game that can ONLY be experienced once (at least personally) so going in 100% blind is the best way to play this game.

like Undertale, Deltarune, Ori (blind forest and will of the wisps), Cry Of Fear, God Of War (and Ragnarok), Firewatch and Detroit: Become Human

Only downside to the game, in my opinion, is that it kinda 랁orces you to be good at fighting and managing boss fights. First of all,  there is no save button right before boss fights, meaning that if you need to setup your characters differently, you have to lose a lot of progress. Second of all, bossfights are hard, and in my opinion they kind of interrupt the flow of the storyline (not mentioning all the fights during exploration).

Apart from this small imperfection, the story is amazing, I felt shivers multiple times from how involving and well designed the scenery and music were. 

Definitely one of the games that got me caught up emotionally the most, very highly suggest it.",1707561698,1707561698,True,2,0,0.50354611873626709,0,True,False,False

cool things about the game:
- very good art. the style is very pleasing.
- banger soundtrack (favorite track is Fermentation Disorientation)
- story was very heart breaking, would experience the pain again fresh if i could.
- battle system is good, the follow-up commands are ok, i use the same tactic most of the time though.
somewhat annoying things about the game (for me): 
- i'm not a big fan of fullscreen so, i do wish the regular window size was a little bigger, and didn't have those black bars on the side.
- some areas are way too dark for me to see anything, though i can understand its really for atmosphere and its intended but i wish it was a little brighter as my computer brightness doesn't help.
- post-game areas feel very unfinished. I can understand why, but still a bit disappointed.

would i recommend it? yeah, enjoyed every hour of this game. exploring was fun too, found a lot of cool and scary things and the side quests were a bit fun too, my favorite was the ghost party one.

The story depicted in Omori is quite gripping with a healthy dose of humour added in just the right places. However when the narrative requires it, the funny quips and one-liners are cast aside in favour of powerful writing that will most definitely tug at your heart strings. Omori was capable of making me laugh, bringing me to a verge of tears and make me tremble in fear. 
Moreover to give credit where credit is due the gameplay is very fun and creative. One criticism that could be levied at Omori's combat system is the amount of random encounters which at times got a bit tedious to say the least. This issue is especially prevalent when backtracking through a location. However it is important to mention that this did not make me dislike Omori's gameplay, quite the contrary. Even if repetitive at times, the combat and exploration were very fun and rewarding. The bossfights were also a highlight of my experience with the game. Every boss we face in Omori is beautifully designed and full of personality.
As i have mentioned the art style is also a major apeal of the game. Every character is unique not only in how they are written but also how the look. In other words the visuals perfectly complement the narrative. The same applies to a certain degree to the enemies we face during our journey through the Headspace. Although some more variety in this case would be a welcome change it isn't a major criticism on my behalf. Especially taking into account that this is addressed by the creatively nightmarish creations we sometimes get to face. I will gladly accept quality over quantity and let me tell you that quality is most definitely what we get.   
To summarise Omori is overall an amazing, fun and emotionally engaging experience. I wholeheartedly recommend it.",1707447562,1707447562,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You all live in a small town where everything is a walk away. You have the most nurturing, fulfilling childhood that humans can have together. But you cause a grave accident that brings about its destruction. You lose everything about which you care and bury the past in the deepest, fragmented recesses of your mind, hoping to never find them again. A few days before you move away, years later, you're faced with the choice to heal from the past and rekindle what was, or hide in thoughts forever.

Now, imagine playing Omori: an experience that's as much of an idealist-existentialist as it is a pessimistic fatalist. The happy moments are satisfying, nostalgic, and extremely funny thanks to plenty of bizarre humor, and the sad moments are, aside from being macabre and grotesque, spawned from the loss thereof. This experience uniquely juxtaposes both the good and bad parts of living, in equally vivid and saturated ways, to breed nostalgic love, and painful regret. The experience is augmented by the brilliantly intelligent and intricate intertwining of visual and sonic motif, and verbal profundity, all of which elaborate on an overarching cacophonous symphony of a tale which can ultimately be interpreted as an ideological epitome for living one's life. With every possible artistic trick employed, Omori is one of the most real representations of the complete continuum of the human experience: good and bad, happy and sad, nostalgia and crippling anxiety, hope and regret--life and death.

Thank you all for sacrificing your time, effort, and artistic virtuosity to create an experience to share with so many people. Thank you for making Omori.",1707379472,1707379472,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

- great atmosphere
- makes you cry
- easy on the hands, no need to fight intensely since it's strategy-based
- beautiful soundtrack that I listen to regularly
- interesting story
- nice animation 
- unique style
- cheaper than therapy sessions
- insanely good at understanding your depression, anxiety and phobia's. I felt really seen and a little less alone. 
- interesting characters
- tonal shifts are done well

cons:
- battle system gets old after a while
- if you want to do a different routes/endings, the main section of the game can feel somewhat long. (although a tip for reaching alternate endings from me would be to keep a separate save near the end) 

I really enjoyed this game. It's heartbreaking and sad and sometimes disturbing, but it really understands how depression feels like. The story was very captivating and mysterious until the end. The game is both really comforting and unsettling, and does a good job of making you scared and (intentionally) confused. The different endings really put perspective into how one's mind can work, how even slightly different circumstances can change so much. It also doesn't try hard to be a cool game or to appeal to certain people; it's story is one that, I suspect, the creator wanted to tell, rather than a company wanting to sell merch. Overall, I would recommend this game a lot, especially if you like things like Undertale.

some things to note in terms of trigger warnings, if you're like me and want to be informed well: (mild spoilers)
- The game has themes and imagery that some would consider disturbing. If you can't look at things like gore, blood, and have trouble with seeing themes of anxiety, suicide and depression, I would recommend leaving the game be until you're better able to process it. However, Omori never romanticizes these themes. It's part of the story, and if you're feeling down, it might feel good to be understood. 
- People with arachnophobia might be scared by this game. I myself am terrified of spiders, and got jumpscared a little. That being said, it's never insanely scary, at least to me.

This is a masterpiece and deserve to stay next to the great games of all time.
This game made me laugh loud with pure joy. It made me cry several times. It brought so many emotions, all mixed up at times. It made me think. It made me feel. It changed me.

Thanks Omocat and all the people involved in this masterclass in gamimg experience.
The characters are so charismatic and the story is so rich and engaging.
The soundtrack really sets the mood and the gameplay is superb.
It made me remind of better days when everything was simpler and more innocent.
It also gave me hope and strength to move on.

""Life gets better""

It sure does.

Compared to games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill this may look cute and kid-friendly but do NOT think that. This game is very deep with its topics of grief, depression, suicide, and trauma. These themes are mainly in the later half of the game with them being extremely sad and even the ""good"" ending still being extremely dreary to watch. I have never played a turn-based RPG and I probably won't again unless Omocat makes a sequel because this game is so damn good. The combat uses different emotions such as Anger, Happiness, and Sadness which all have their benefits such as sadness giving you more defense, and anger giving you more attack power. The horror elements in this game are very well executed with jumpscares being at a lower rate, with dread and tension taking hold. The story of this game is incredibly great with a cast of likable characters, a sad and interesting plot, and an ending that is honestly the worst part of the game depending on how you feel about it. Speaking of endings there are multiple with varying degrees of depression they will leave on you.

The art ingame is awesome, love the pastel colour palette; which one generally doesn't see in games. The music is fun too.
If I need to give some critiques, some parts felt a bit confusing, as in where to go and what to do. Some parts were a bit tedious, (having to walk around... do this and that, stuck at things that feel like they don't contribute to the story, etc.), and I personally felt the ending was a bit too confusing/open to my liking. But that is a personal preference.

This game is wild in the sense that it tries it's best to balance extremely childish humour and banter, with extremely dark topics relating to depression and trauma. Sometimes the shift from goofy and pleasant to depressing and terrifying can be... jarring.

So, in conclusion... Well... Let's just say that after playing this game, I too, have received some trauma I need to overcome...
No, seriously, I came in with a very specific view and expectation of how this game would be, and the fact it ended up so differently is... My worldview is shattered. It's a great game but I don't know if I have the heart to ever play it again. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I genuinely need to recover.

[spoiler] Having to accept Sunny's past and guilt as technically my own in real time with the peak of his internal battle- it's really something else. Because what do you do with that? How the hell do you live with that? [/spoiler] Learning what even some of the simple prevalent imagery actually meant throughout the game? Haunting, chilling, brutal.

Here's the thing about this game too: A large chunk of the play through is this really fun pokemon-esk adventure/party battle sim with cool quests and everything and you can feel there's a meta-textual layer going on behind everything, but the game was able to lure me into this false sense of security for long stretches of time battling critters and exploring. So when the psychological thriller parts DO happen, it's like everything grinds to a halt. And I remember that I, like Omori, am escaping something dark and inevitable.

I highly recommend giving this a try. It's well paced, extremely fun, with an emotional story that will grab your heart with both hands and not let go.",1706773035,1706773035,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

idk. all in all, omori is an incredible game and i highly recommend it even if it will tear your heart out and smash it into pieces (and then put it back together). it's very depressing and you should heed the warnings, but it left me feeling hopeful.

OMORI is like, THE game you gotta try, it's all warm and heartbreaky. 游꿕 The story's like a rollercoaster of emotions, from cozy to super intense in a blink. Seriously, if you haven't spoiled it for yourself, go play it NOW. It's like, crazy emotional and made me legit sob at points. 游땴 The ""something"" following you around? Absolutely terrifying. I couldn't even move in-game or in real life, total fear vibes. 游땸

Okay, so the story trips a bit at the end, leaving a plot hole you can kinda ignore if you squint really hard. No spoilers, though! 游뗻 Gameplay is okay, not as wow as the story. Boss fights are awesome, but regular battles are just a quick spam fest. The Faraway Town segments are where things happen, so yay for that! 游

Headspace segments drag a bit, like, could've cut some parts for the game's benefit. Faraway Town bits are where the magic's at, with character development and stuff. Backtracking? A bit frustrating, but if you're a super curious explorer, you'll find cool rewards. 游돗勇꽥勇

Now, the soundtrack rocks! 游꿨 Boss themes are on point, and the clever leitmotifs in songs are mind-blowing. The music knows when to hit you in the feels, and it's just soul-crushing in the best way. 游눖

Visually, it's a pixel art wonderland with cool hand-drawn style in battles and cutscenes. Unique animations in battles add charm to an otherwise visually simple system. Low-quality realistic photos in the background? Hilarious! 游꿛

TLDR: Great story with a quirky flaw, gameplay's cool, music rocks, and the art style is fantastic. Probably left me in a mood for a while. Totally recommend it! 游깯九",1706661152,1706661152,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

The pacing is tedious, the characters are based on overused tropes and their relationships are shallow. Two thirds of the game you're obliged to grind and get through mind-numbing combat and an even more lackluster story, only to realise it was nearly completely irrelevant to the actual plot and is a complete waste of time. Getting to the plot twist/climax is not worth your time either.

The art and music are nice, if they made the last bit of it into a short game or VN and all the pointless fluff before that were erased it would be much better, or at the very least more bearable.

Most of all I condemn how the topic of self-harm was tackled and portrayed throughout the story. It was mostly disrespected and abused as a cheap shock tool and if not that used as a way to make the audience feel pity.

For the best experience don't spoil yourself at all until you have reached the credits. Overall I'd say it's a must-have if you want to experience a great story

Pros and Cons here at the beginning, full review below.

Pros:
- Probably the best story I have ever experienced
- Great artstyle (a mixture of a pixel art overworld and hand-drawn cutscenes)
- Amazing soundtrack
- Unique mechanics
- Indie developers
- Cheap price
- Long (15-35 hours for a first playthrough, depending on how much time you spend on side-quests)
- 2 drastically different routes and several endings depending on your choices
- Perfect difficulty (easy if you take your time getting equipment/upgrades, hard if you rush through it)

Cons:
- Gameplay can get repetitive after a while
- Some achievements are grindy/annoying to get
- Some parts of the game can feel like they are 'dragged out'
- Low replayability, because it is mainly a story game

In short I recommend playing the game if you want to experience a great story. It has great plot-twists so whatever you do, do NOT get spoiled about anything in this game. Unfortunately some the community consists of people who are too young/immature for the game's intended audience, which leads to people joking about the plot even unprovoked. So to be safe I recommend just ignoring anything to do with the game until you have reached the credits because apparently a part of the community just wants to spoil people for some reason. Anyways, if you are not that into stories or reading and instead are looking for riveting gameplay, this might not be the game for you. 

The story felt weird and dull to me at first and I even considered refunding, but the mysteries introduced at the start kept me in and I have not regretted playing the game ever since. And regarding the 'horror' tag of the game, I recommend playing the game even if you aren't a fan of horror. Only about 10 % of the game is horror-esque and it is psychological horror that is mandatory for the game's story to be so good. I don't want to go into full details about it for spoiler reasons, but I'll just say that dark elements are essential parts of the full story.

Thank you for reading this review and I hope this helped you with your decision about whether to buy this game or not. 



Now here at the end I would like to give you a tiny hint about what you should do to achieve the 'correct' route/ending, which you should do on your first playthrough to get the full story. Feel free to ignore the rest of this review if you want to go in 'fully blind', as I did. 

What I mean is that if you make the wrong decision near the beginning of the game, you might miss out on the full and true story of the game and thus are left mostly clueless. In any case you'll be fine as long as you pick rationally.

this is a central point in alot of reviews but the game feels way too slow with everything having a little animation to it, including but not limited to, the dialogue. while you shouldn't really skp the dialogue this makes it a bit more tedious if your returning to the game for the second time. and don't get me started with the headspace drag which if i will admit was really interesting at first but soon after it kind of just becomes something you speed run to get to the end of the game.

great if this is your first time, but if your playing this game again i'd recommend watching a lore recap video of the game",1672410908,1706363456,False,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

There are so many details and theories to be made, so many side characters and story that you can discover. It  pictures trauma, depression, anxiety in a beautiful but realistic way, which is hard sometimes but also makes the game so moving. Cried countless times too ! The game is a bit slow, the dialogues and fights were a bit long sometimes but I felt like it really echoed to how slow time seems to be when you're hurting. Also it forces you to take time, breathe, truly delve into the emotion. 
For me, a true masterpiece. An emotional journey, both conforting and also devastating : I would pay to play this game all over again for the first time. Also, try to really be in a peaceful setting when playing to truly appreciate the emotion !

[spoiler]This is one of my all-time favorite games! The story is rich and emotional, the characters are lovable, the flavor is fun, the soundtrack is phenomenal, and the way that the game uses psychological horror never feels cheap. The game play is simple, but there are a few puzzles sprinkled in, and the emotions system keeps the turn-based combat fresh. This is a great game for completionists, and has a fair amount of replay value with two vastly different play-through possibilities, and several optional bosses and side-quests. (Although there is a large amount of dialogue/perhaps too many cut-scenes in some parts, and your subsequent playthroughs will never quite live up to your first one.) Its style is reminiscent of Earthbound, and the amount of detail and number of Easter eggs is insane. The depictions of mental illness, trauma, grief, and guilt feel real and the way that the gameplay and ost support the emotion in the game is incredible. This is an amazing use of the medium of video games; if it was a book, movie, etc. getting the same kind of emotional impact would be impossible. I can't recommend this game strongly enough.

The story is key here, split across two realities, and the way the game slowly unravels the machinations of its core twist and how that has informed everything else about the game is both riveting and extremely unsettling. The contrast of the cutesy, pastel dream world and the awful things that hover just beneath the surface of it make for an incredibly engaging playthrough, and I enjoyed every minute of it.

In terms of actual RPG elements, the combat system has a lot of charm and appeal on the surface, but in practice, I found that even the bosses don't pose much in the way of a challenge - or, the challenge comes from enduring waves of damage and then finding the opportunities to dish out your own waves. I found a general combat arrangement that worked for me almost right away and basically never deviated from it for the rest of the game because I never saw a need to change my process, but I still had fun with the fights, particularly the theming of the bosses, both in the dream world and elsewhere. It's a system that has a lot of depth to it that I suspect is only truly unlocked on the combat-heavy alternative route, but it's still fun enough on the standard route.

The characters and the way they're connected and interact with each other is the real prize of OMORI, though - the story told of a childhood trauma shattering a friend group, and following the aftermath of that trauma to see where everyone has ended up, is extremely well done, jumping between the dream world of the protagonist and the real world he's tried to leave behind. Without getting any deeper into it than that, the characters of the dream world in particular are frequently hilarious, with a charm and whimsy to the writing that comes through in every single line of silly dialogue, and provides a lovely palate cleanser and contrast for when the horrors come back around. And the horrors are horrible! The way the game doesn't flinch at the truth of the core trauma, doesn't provide anything in the way of a justification or an out for the people involved, is remarkably dour and amplifies the impact of it when the entirety of it is laid bare. 

OMORI's not a perfect game - the sprite assets aren't anything special compared to the character art, the combat can become rote and tedious, and sometimes it can feel like you're kind of blindly groping around trying to figure out what to do next, but on the whole, this is a fantastic, unbelievable experience, and to come from a small indie developer on their first swing is mind-boggling.

This game has some pretty excellent writing that makes use of the medium of game storytelling in some subtle but genius ways. You really feel attached to the characters, and towards the end you really feel like the entire world is pulled out from under you. It is kind of the platonic ideal of ""indie game"", given that it's a quirky top-down pixel art RPG about mental health, but it performs that very well, and has some utterly unexpected elements.

This game is far from perfect, in fact I'd go so far as to say there are a lot of problems and quite a few things that I just straight up think aren't very good, but I think the overall package makes up for it.

Problems:
1. This is more a personal problem but to me turn based combat is just boring as hell. If you have some interactivity like Undertale or Paper Mario that makes it better, but this game's gimmick (the rock-paper-scissors battle mechanic) is a bit clunky. It makes encounters more strategic, but also drags out encounters with a lot of non-attacking actions.
2. The game is buggy as hell, I had to turn it to windowed because fullscreen made it crash every few minutes.
3. While the hand-drawn animations look great, with the line-art drawings, the pixel art can often look kinda trash.
4. There were probably about 3-4 hours of amazing content in a 20 hour game.",1706067856,1706067856,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

First time players will find it quite difficult to get through some of the hurdles this game has, as it offers no real assistance in itself (at hard times) in guiding you to your next action (which can leave you stuck sometimes, racking your brain), or reminding you where you need to go if you left off at a save point, or the spam of intentionally annoying common enemies, or straight up locking you in a bad route for one vague mistake you might've made without thinking of the drastic consequences. To me, that's a bit of artificial difficulty and a mild annoyance.  

There are a ton of guides out there for you to watch if you're stuck, or if you played through once and don't want to repeat for multiple endings.

I passed it off as another quirky Earthbound clone with cliche mental health topics added to be #relatable with the kids, not to mention that it's synopsis of ""psychological horror"" was  off-putting for someone as squeamish as me. However, I was pleasantly surprised with my experience. 

Besides a somewhat abstract and scatter-brained last 30 minutes or so, the story was a pleasant mix of wholesome fun and cold reality, which is only heightened by its incredible use of colour to weave the emotions and the events into one. Combat is the familiar ""rock-paper-scissors"" system of most turn-based RPGs, using emotions as the elements, which not only works well with the story, but also allows for clever twists and alterations to be made (e.g. being afraid or being miserable). Whilst some of the pixel art leaves a bit to be desired, especially considering that's how characters are portrayed most of the time, most of the sprites are well-made, and the in-battle sprites are extraordinary.

The highlight of the game, however, is the general theme, topics and mood of the game. I was sceptical at first, but the thoughts the game left me with throughout feel like nostalgia of the experiences and troubles in my own lifetime. The only way I can think of describing it is like a time capsule, kind of like listening to a song that brings you back to a specific point in your life, how you were feeling at the time, what your problems were, etc. in a way that feels like a shared experience, and I'm sure it will act the same for the time I'm in now, should I choose to revisit this game. In a simpler way, Omori uses its overarching theme and story to serve as a mirror to our collective past, making key plot points hit harder, as they feel like metaphors relating to our own lives by pulling heartstrings on our childhood.

I won't go into too much detail with negatives, as I feel most of them are minor personal complaints, and I truly believe this is a game worth playing. However, my main gripe with the game is the music. Most of the pieces that weren't the classical piano and violin arrangements (which only play at very specific times for impact) I found to be an ear-ache, repetitive or annoying.

All in all, Omori is both a fun time and a story that leaves you thinking. 8/10.",1691972421,1705947150,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Im now halfway through the other route, and WOW is it good, after you complete hangman, you get into a diffrent area with doors that have many diffrent things in it, some of them remind me of when your playing classic pac man and you get to the max score then all the visuels just die, it reminds me of that

OMORI is my favourite game of all time, and has been for just a little over a year now. The emotional journey this little indie RPG took me on was incredible: One I enjoyed, one that made me feel dread and unease, and one that hit me right in the heart.
I'm going to start with a non-spoiler overview of OMORI. I do want to say, please mind the content warnings. OMORI can be subtle, definitely, but a lot of the depictions of depression and suicide especially are not mild, and no matter how great this game is, if you are triggered by that type of thing, please, don't play OMORI.

One thing I've actually seen complained about often is the gameplay, so I'll get that out of the way first. Personally, as somebody who is super into and accustomed to RPGs, OMORI was highly enjoyable for me. It was unique, fun, pretty, and I loved almost every second of it. However, as some have pointed out, a lot of the sections in this game do tend to feel a bit like a slog, especially if you're not doing much but trying to progress. I didn't really feel that way, like I said, but a good number of people who did enjoy this game thought the gameplay was a little lacking in some areas, so if it's super amazing gameplay you're looking for, I'm not sure if OMORI will deliver for you. It's good, great even, but can get a little so-so.

OMORI, at its core, is about friendship. Or not just friendship in itself- relationships, the bonds you share with people close to you, or rather, people who used to be close to you. This premise is depicted beautifully in the game.
Another thing- the characters. The story in OMORI is spectacular, but it's the characters that really make it, that set it apart. The game does a really great job at getting you attached to all of these characters early on with their dynamic, relatable and lovable personalities, so it can tear your heart out and stomp on it later with them.

And finally, the horror aspect of OMORI. Man, do some parts of this game make you feel uneasy. OMORI isn't a jumpscarey game, as you may have been able to tell. It terrifies you in a completely different way. It uses memories, things you've already seen. It lulls you into a false sense of security only to creep back on you when you least expect it to, and make you feel that awful sense of dread once again. Basically- the horror is really good.

SPOILER SECTION - ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE WILL BE SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED OR FINISHED OMORI YET, AND IF WHAT I'VE SAID HAS CONVINCED YOU, GIVE IT A SHOT.

Okay, so the truth segment is what I really want to talk about here. I know it won't hit as much with other people, because it depends on my experience. But there's people out there that it will resonate with too.
Specifically, MARI and SUNNY, two characters I relate to too much.
When I was younger, I was told that playing an instrument would be the best gift of my life. As OMORI puts it, a rewarding hobby. But as OMORI also puts it, ""nothing more than a nuisance"". That captures my feelings so, so well.
When I started playing piano, I wasn't doing it or continuing because I wanted to. I was just told that it would all be worth it in the end. Maybe it will be, but it's not a hobby of mine, and I don't feel that way about it. An instrument that might be cool to learn, but when I actually put it into practice, my fingers just can't seem to move right.
I was also always MARI. I've struggled with a really deep perfectionism all my life. Everything has to be perfect. MARI's my favourite character in OMORI, because we only ever see her for fractions of the game, and yet she's fully fledged out, and deeply relatable. That deep, hungry competitiveness and perfectionism, the feeling that you always have to overdeliver, and be perfect, no matter what- that's something I struggled with, too. It was so, so refreshing and surprising to see that in a character I loved.
But it's not about that. It's about what happened on the recital night with MARI and SUNNY.
When SUNNY pushed MARI down those stairs, when I first heard the truth captions for myself (yes, I know these aren't in the game, I found them on the internet) it felt all so real. Even more so because I've been SUNNY before. There have been times I've lashed out. Times that lashing out causes me to do something I don't intend. I think everyone's been SUNNY at some point. It felt like I was reliving every single day I'd lashed out and messed up so badly in the process that I felt so... emotional. Sometimes, we do cause harm to the people we love, if it's on accident. But the thing is, we still love them either way. And most people will get to apologise and make up.
SUNNY never got to do that. It feels so hauntingly real and unfair, it feels like I'm the one who just pushed my sister down the stairs. What would twelve year old me do? SUNNY was a scared kid who made a mistake. It's so hauntingly real.
And I've been MARI too. Again, we've all been MARI. We've hurt the people we love unintentionally, and we've been lashed out at. You understand their perspective, but you still feel hurt. You feel angry. Anybody would.
And yet she forgives him.
I won't get into the debate on whether the MARI apparitions are real or not but gosh, everyone of her speeches to SUNNY hurt me inside. ""Maybe I pushed you too hard. I'm sorry.""
For a character like MARI, that would be so hard to say. I know. I'm so, so like that too. But she said it.
At the end of the day, SUNNY and MARI love each other. More than anything. And they each hurt one another, unintentionally, in a spur of the moment.
But it was overcome.
SUNNY knew MARI would forgive him, even deep down when he was flooded by guilt. She always would because they loved one another. And that love is what helped him to learn to finally forgive himself.
Then the game got worse, and built up even more, and then it all came to a breath taking conclusion with its final moments: the final battle against OMORI himself, the final duet, SUNNY finally gathering the courage to confess to his friends and relieve himself of the guilt that was weighing him down for years. I could hardly believe OMORI was real, a real game that I could play out there, that was so great.

The fact OMORI is a game makes it even better. It just wouldn't work as anything else, be it a comic, a book, a movie etc. Because actually being in control of SUNNY and OMORI just adds another layer of realness to the whole thing. It's heartbreaking and devastating, but bittersweet, knowing that you were able to make things better by your choices just breaks me. But it's not you- OMORI puts you in SUNNY's shoes and makes you feel like him, without you actually feeling that you are him. The whole silent protagonist switcheroo was brilliant, with OMORI and SUNNY having the general appearances of protagonists in which the player is meant to project onto, and not speaking so you could insert yourself in their place, but then  continues to flesh out that character. We explore SUNNY and OMORI's personalities, we see the people they care about, the things they enjoy and don't enjoy. They're not just you- you feel like them, but at the same time they're their own people, and you cheer SUNNY on until the very last moments.

OMORI doesn't show you your friends, the characters you got to know for its whole runtime, reactions to what SUNNY tells them. Which is perfect. Because OMORI isn't about getting others to forgive you, it's about forgiving yourself. Evolving from your mistakes, and moving on, and stopping blaming yourself.

Overall, I give OMORI a 10/10. Masterful, and I recommend it. OMORI feels like a part of me, the empty hole now filled, with these beautiful characters and their beautiful story, that made me laugh, cry, and even afraid.
OMORI truly did hit right in the heart.

The scenes with Mari always seemed to make me sad and happy at the same time, showing how she forgave Sunny and how she wants him to forgive himself. Basil and Sunny's fight also made me sad to see how much the truth hurt them and see how much Basil has been going through the past 4 years. The good ending is probably one of the best endings to a game I've ever seen as it doesn't matter how the others reacted to the truth, all that matters is that the weight of the truth has finally lifted off their shoulders and that they have both come to terms with the truth.[/spoiler] The battle mechanic is really cool too, I love all the bosses I encountered and beat.

The story was very touching and unique. At first, I thought it would be quite generic following usual troupes of trauma and depression, but I was so wrong. It had many complex twists and turns that blew my head away. It's my genuine belief that this game can truly change how a person perceives the world. Even though I never cry playing games, there were multiple moments when I just couldn't hold back my tears. Only for the story, this games deserves to be remembered as one of the greatest games of our time.
The gameplay was also surprisingly fun. As I mentioned before, I hate turn-based combat, but here I actually enjoyed it. The thing that made it stand out to me was how stylized it is. Every move and mechanic were very fitting to the world and immersed me. There also some complexity to the combat with emotions and follow-ups, but it's simple enough, so a player like me that never played turn-based games could get a hang of it very quickly.",1705514109,1705514109,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

This surreal RPG adventure, available on Steam, weaves a compelling narrative that seamlessly blends captivating storytelling with visually stunning aesthetics.

From the moment I delved into the world of OMORI, I was struck by its unique art style  a harmonious fusion of charming pixel art and evocative illustrations. The game's visuals serve as a portal to a beautifully crafted universe, and each environment is a testament to the developers' dedication to creating an immersive and visually striking experience.

The storyline is a poignant exploration of emotions, friendship, and self-discovery, masterfully presented through the eyes of the protagonist, OMORI. The game's ability to effortlessly transition between lighthearted moments and deep, thought-provoking themes is truly commendable. As I navigated through the richly detailed world, the characters' personalities and struggles became deeply relatable, forging a genuine connection that kept me invested in their journeys.

OMORI's turn-based combat system is both strategic and engaging, with a unique twist that adds depth to battles. The inclusion of a ""emotion"" mechanic introduces a layer of strategy, allowing players to leverage the emotional states of characters to gain a tactical advantage. The result is a dynamic and satisfying combat experience that complements the narrative seamlessly.

The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it expertly enhances the game's atmosphere. The emotionally charged music, ranging from tranquil melodies to intense compositions, serves as the perfect accompaniment to the unfolding story, immersing players even further into the world of OMORI.

Beyond the main storyline, OMORI offers a plethora of side quests, secrets, and optional content, ensuring that the adventure is both expansive and rewarding. The level of detail in every aspect of the game, coupled with its replayability, showcases the developers' commitment to delivering a comprehensive and fulfilling experience.

In conclusion, OMORI on Steam is a captivating journey that transcends the boundaries of conventional RPGs. Its emotionally charged narrative, stunning visuals, strategic combat, and immersive soundtrack make it a must-play for fans of the genre. I wholeheartedly recommend OMORI to anyone seeking a deeply enriching and unforgettable gaming experience.",1705487737,1705487737,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

It can be frustrating with certain enemies, but the game's content is fairly easy to get through if you learn how to play! The plot and the details and the way it portrays certain things is very pleasing and the music was the cherry on top. It was amazing.

The game's fighting mechanics are turn based, and your characters unlock different skills as you progress. This way of fighting was very enjoyable for me. The way they handle emotions and give them different effects and weaknesses add even more ways to defeat the enemies. It's great.

[spoiler] The way Sunny had to fight Omori to overcome his troubles was amazing and well thought out, and the way they revealed that the real way Mari died kept me on the edge of my seat. Basil being slowly forgotten in headspace was also something I found to be a good addition, since it really shows how distracted the others got with other things. This game also portrays depression and mental illness very well with all of the horror and entities you find late game. The different bosses coming back later in the game like Sweetheart and Space Boyfriend was also very entertaining, as they are good twists to end off different areas of the game.

Is also a must buy for story game lovers.

Have you ever played a game? Crazy, right? Well let me be the first to inform you that your favorite game sucks unless it is this game.

Omori is unlike anything you have seen before, and I'm finding it very difficult to write this, not only because words cannot describe how absolutely immaculate it is, but also because going into any level of detail at all would put me at risk for spoiling it. The main thing with story games (and especially this one) is that playing blind is the penultimate act of good you can do for yourself. There are many aspects of the game that I was skeptical of initially that rebutted quickly and effectively; which I will go over now. Then, I will discuss the unique vibe the game gives amidst the story progression, and finish off with things that related to me to better explain my love for the game.

First, I will go over the gameplay basics that made me doubt the game at first glance. By far my biggest concern was this: I hated horror (games) as well as RPG turn-based combat and gameplay. Even in the first 20 minutes of the game I was pleasantly surprised at how well integrated it was with the overall flow, which prevented me from hating it. [spoiler] The combat, instead of using types like Pokemon to create interactions, instead uses emotions; which is not only a unique concept, but it also has major relevance to the story, such as heavy foreshadowing. [/spoiler]. Despite having practically zero RPG game experience, I found it incredibly easy to get into. As a whole, the game introduces itself exceptionally, and as a result, allows the story to show itself at a perfect pace while allowing people such as myself to get a hang of it.

What is more, it has a very fantastical atmosphere. The game primarily goes back and forth between two types of segments, which each have their own flair. Throughout the experience, you meet many interesting characters, both main or otherwise, that really enhance the world and encourage you to explore and visit everything (which you should definitely do). The soundtrack introduces new motifs at every corner, and the incredibly diverse settings always pique your interest. Although it shares many basic aspects with other RPG maker games, it puts a subtle twist that makes it feel off. It puts up a very pleasant front that slowly shows its true nature as you progress through the story. Despite the fact that you return to the same areas you have been through before, they somehow still manage to feel different despite being identical. It's a strange feeling; it's like when you speak to somebody you haven't spoken to for years and they seem like a completely different person. You get filled with this odd sensation of uneasiness that feels like it's progressively getting worse as stages of the game reach their end. I think it is this feeling that really puts the icing on the cake for the story immersion, and it hangs around with you until the very last moments of the game.

Lastly, I will go over some parts of the game that I found generally relatable in such a way that made it hit different and stand out. To give you context of how impactful this game is, I'll tell you this so you understand why I'm so passionate: Even after almost a year since I played this game for the first time, I still think about it everyday. There is zero hyperbolic intention or exaggeration in that statement. Let me compare it to another game I love to death, Red Dead Redemption 2. Don't get me wrong, it was also an absolute banger of a game, but when I played Omori I couldn't help but think RDR2 got put to shame. The story and setting was also beautiful in its own right, but I first played RDR2 three years ago and I don't really think about it often. Even during the first year after I played it, it was often a background thought. Not Omori though, not Omori. In addition, many of the settings carry their own auras that any given person is bound to relate to at least one of. They give you that awesome feeling of being a kid again, which the game successfully attempts to induce (that last bit makes more sense if you've seen the main store page trailers). 

In sum, there's much, much more to the story that you should find out yourself. Don't worry though, it does not matter what kind of person you are. Even if you take little interest in facets of mental health, or you're scared because mental health is a sensitive topic for you, it's not a big deal. The game eases you into it, so you're not bombarded immediately. In fact, it's quite the opposite. Story beats are incredibly vague and always leave you guessing. It sounds like horrible story design, but it all catches up to you in the end as one massive depressing, but gratifying, haymaker. Except, the game's metaphorical fist is covered in barbed wire, and you're standing on the cliff edge of a volcano. Despite all of this, I still feel like I have not done the game justice, and I don't think it is possible with a review, either. It's just one of those ""you have to play/do it to understand"" type of things. As disconcerting or unhelpful as that is, I promise you that this game fulfills that title more than any other game out there.

I loved the concept, the art, the characters and the story for the most part. The head-space was an amazing idea and I loved the parallels with the real world with it. The game play was easy but I didn't care about that personally because I liked the story. The sense of progression felt nice, the buildup of the story and the ""mystery"" of what happened. I enjoyed Sunny learning to calm himself with the struggles of anxiety. I loved the friendship between the characters and the banter, sure the dialogue was cheesy but it was cute and I liked it.

Spoilers: Basically I hate the story, the plot twist that Sunny killed Mari and Basil helped cover it up at 12 years old is so stupid. Like its disappointing that the build up of the game was Sunny forgiving himself for making an oopsie of killing his sister and covering it up. It makes the story so much more shallow. Just because a twist is out of left field does not make it good at all. It makes the plot not make any sense at all, a 12 year old doing that and nobody apparently noticing the bruises or other brakes Mari's bones made falling down the stairs. Its like a family guy episode levels of bad storytelling. It makes the last 20 hours you play less impactful and disappointing. I was so excited for the climax for it to fall on its face, it gives it so many potholes and feels rushed. And the good ending is him admitting it to his friends and leaving with no consequences basically for killing his sister.",1705267807,1705267807,False,8,0,0.501117169857025146,1,True,False,False

You have to be willing to explore everywhere, talk to everyone, and interact with any bit of furniture you see, because you don't know if it will have a spare item, or piece of equipment, or key item, or sidequest, or hidden boss, or flavor text that hints at the plot. It is certainly a much bigger game than I expected - I've apparently only scratched the surface of the side content. 
The game itself has great use of colors with its colored pencil style and the combat is pretty good - though you'll fall into tried-and-true strategies after awhile just to push through some of these boss fights.
Story grapples with guilt and blame, and its fairly good, though, after the reveal, I don't know if I would forgive Basil. That was kind of sick. 
In any event, pick this one up if you're looking for a slower game heavy with dialog and exploration with some JRPG battles mixed into it.

Completing Omori was like torture for me. The only reason I didn't drop it is its score.

Most of the time, what you'll experience is a very slow paced and uninteresting game, full of bad jokes and boring dialogues. The game rewards you from time to time with great art and soundtracks but not enough to compensate all that. The game could be like 3-4 times shorter without any drawbacks.

The story itself is decent it's just that you have to torture yourself first to get it.

i mean that's what i'd normally write since i've written it for dozens and dozens of games
so there it is
but honestly
game's pretty good
on a general note i might recommend that you use combat mods such as ""new energy system"" to make fighting less of a chore because things can get VERY tedious and it can often take away from the story if it feels like too much of a drag

i won't spoil anything
frankly
go in blind
give it a few hours of playtime and see if you like it honestly

First of all, this is NOT a game to play if you don't come in with a strong mindset, or are currently in a bad place. If you are, I recommend at least playing with a friend. That psychological horror tag is no joke, folks. This game can get deep very quickly.

That said, everything about this game moves you emotionally in both a good and bad way, with good mechanics and a great artstyle to boot. It's just as cute as it looks, but filled with so much depth not just story wise, but game wise- completing this game fully will take you a while (unless you're like me with way too much free time).

The people of OMORI put so much love into what is both a JRPG with slice of life elements, while somehow still being a sort of mystery game. There are multiple endings to get, which are sort of obvious to spot in the relevant story places, but this game does not hold your hand (except in the very beginning, naturally). There are many game references, jokes, easter eggs and even different generic NPC dialogues you can choose between that have no effect on the main story. It's a game jam packed with everything you can think of.

I would recommend this game to everyone. It WILL move you emotionally. And even if you find you don't hold that strong of an attachment, the story that you reveal has enough of an impact to go ""yeah, it wasn't your average story."" And I think that's way more important, since not everyone feels the same way about just one game.",1705049527,1705049527,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The 2 and a half weeks i spent playing and later 100%-ing this game will forever be burnt into my memory,while as a video game Omori has some hiccups,some part were drawn out and boring,some mechanics being a bit too simple or underused and the inability to skip the cutscene.

But all of them are minor oversights in what Omori managed to successfully create,the most raw and masterfully crafted story i have ever got to experience,playing this game has made me feel emotions that i never ever thought is possible through this medium and nothing i have nothing but respect to everyone that help making Omori what it is today,from all the kickstarter backers that believed in the game,the development team and especially the composers for creating the most fire soundtrack ever.

I urge everyone,the people who tried and ended up dropping the game due to reasons,people who thinks the game is just edgy or people who dont even like this genre at all to please,PLEASE play this game and see it through the end,Omori is worth it all and you will be rewarded for making it through to the end.

A beautiful work of art.

I only knew it was dark and I guess it was gruesome with themes and horrificly spooky at times but it could have gone furhter. There were things that this game did which I enjoyed such as tons of side stuff, the emotion mechanic in battle and the different bosses were all really fun. However there were also things I did not like such as the unneccesarily long build ups to multiple reveals and when choices came up on the screen too slowly so I accidently clicked an option when I was trying to advance the text. The music was alright, somewhat good. The art and cutscenes I was not a big fan of and it didn't get better as I played through it. I found that the gameplay was enjoyable but had no real ""payoff"" in the end when you leveled up. Overall I would not recommend this game. I didn't enjoy the major plot point of the ""story"" and it was so slow.

The story is intriguing, the visuals fantastic and the music poping but every time I was faced with the concept of spending the next few hours walking through the most simple dungeons with some of the most basic, press attack 4-16 times to win combat I have ever seen I couldn't do it.  I get why people love this game but I genuinely believe that games can't just ignore gameplay as a core part of what they are, staple together the laziest RPG mechanics imaginable and call it a day, and worst than that have the gall to make you play that bare bones combat for HOURS.  If you couldn't make the combat interesting than just cut it down, or remove it entirely.  I genuinely this would be a better game with no combat.

The character development of the characters throughout the game is well thought through however some scenes do not really add any value to the story or their background.

This is the kind of game you want to experience at least twice. Once completely blind, the second with all the knowledge of your previous playthrough.

The depiction of fear, guilt, and trauma in this game is extremely poignant. One thing I really like is how alive Faraway town feels, despite having less npcs than Headspace. The npcs in Headspace feel pretty flat too, outside of the ones who are developped, I don't know if this was intentional, but it makes the shift between the two worlds all the more jarring, and drives forward the point that this really is just a story the protagonist is telling himself, as immersive as it can get.

Omori is one of the best game I've ever played. The gameplay is great. The combat isn't really that difficult once you get the hang of it, but there are some variations to the enemy and the special abilities that keep the gameplay fresh. The world that this game has to offer is interesting. There's so many places, quests, and secrets you can discover throughout the game. The places also changes when each day passed, so there are reasons to coming back to the same place. But the best thing that this game has to offer is the story. You'd feel all sorts of emotions as the game progress. The distict athmospheres between the fun, happy section for most of the game length, makes the more horror, depressing, and sad moments stand out and more emotional. The ending really broke me. This game motivates me to become a better person and face the truth no matter what the outcome may be.

I find myself longing for the connections that I developed with Aubrey, Basil, Hero, and Kel, despite them being fictional characters. This game is so well written and has such a good atmosphere that the characters feel they could, and at some point, did, actually exist.

Good, but not without its flaws. The story is pretty solid, and is definitely an emotional adventure with a bittersweet ending. It also features really nice graphics and fitting music.

However, this game's engine and filler are not great and drag it down. You will also need to install a mod to get the new console/Microsoft store content on the Steam version.

Regrets are apart of life, and mistakes, no matter how grave the consequence, are too. You need to speak out about your problems, deal with them, talk with other people to cope with them. Allowing something to be regressed means it's going to build up, and, if not taken care of properly, damage you mentally. 
This game deals with this idea. The idea of suppression, and how you deal with events. This game shows how trauma, if pushed down, can hurt not just you, but others as well.
This game is amazing for that.

Buy and play Omori.

The only non-spoiler thing I wanna say is that an update introduced a bug that ruins the atmosphere, but you can find different methods of fixing said bug online so make sure you sort the fullscreen bug before you play if you decide to get this game.

Extremely small spoiler here:
I don't like this game. For every interesting and fun character there are at least two others that are massively annoying in the extended cast. It's a good thing the main cast are good characters if we count only the playable party, Basil, and Mari, but the clownish NPCs are just grating on the nerves most of the time. Don't even get me started on Sweetheart. Her scenes just drag on and on and on and they have nothing to do with the main themes of the game, it's so infuriating.

MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

Then there's the main plot, which is as dumb as it is confusing. You're telling me I'm supposed to sympathize with a kid who murdered his sister to avoid a recital and his insane best friend who helped him cover it up? Not just that, but also I'm supposed to believe the police either never figured it out, or that, if they did, the parents and the neighbors and the pastors all chose to hide what really happened from the other children? What about police reports? Mari would have been severely banged up from her tumble down the stairs, so everyone would know the false suicide was a bad cover job. Sunny and Basil should have just left her at the bottom and hid the photos to pass it off as an accident and the story could have been the same, but the dev wanted imagery of her crumpled on the floor and hanging dead from a tree so came up with this convoluted way to have both.

And the trope of it all being in a character's headspace makes the overwhelming majority of the game feel like a pointless chore to get through in order to get to the actual story. The real world sequences were mildly narratively interesting while I was still riddling out what really happened, but were mechanically boring as Hell. The more mechanically interesting headspace parts also became mechanically boring very quickly, since the energy system lets you start killing most enemies on the first turn if you're any good at RPGs. Do well in a few optional fights against some tough enemies and your only reward for overcoming that challenge is being bored out of your mind for the entire rest of the game since you're now very, very overleveled. There wasn't that much to even do, so why not have a max level at 20 or 25 to keep the power-level in-line with the whole experience? I didn't fight anything with my level 40+ party at the end that I couldn't have beaten with much weaker characters and some items.

The story feels like a weird middleground between Undertale and Night in the Woods that doesn't succeed at being either, or even close to the same level of immersion and quality, subjectively speaking. While the game failed to pull me in, I can see a lot of interesting ideas in Black Space being very moving and upsetting for a lot of people. Personally, though, I was checked out and didn't care about anything that was happening to the fake mental projection people and just wanted to see what the Hell it all actually meant. It's hard to feel bad about what the protagonist is ""doing"" to ""their friends"" when all of it is just a nightmare they're having about how guilty they are over some other, actually real thing.

I got the good ending on my first run, but I'm not sure I even want to see the others. The depressing fact of playing as either a murderer, or the murderer's evil self-projection in a nightmare realm torturing and killing his partner in crime for daring to... to help cover up... the protagonist's crime? I just don't like it. I don't like this protagonist. I don't want to play as this protagonist. They do nothing to characterize themselves, and the game never sets up any choices of consequence to make the player feel responsible. You can't just let the player name the character at some point and then assume they'll take on the guilt of stuff the protagonist did before the story even began. I don't identify with this dead-eyed psychotic murderer.

If you can easily identify with a murderer, enjoy this game! If you can't, well, it isn't without other merits, but I honestly wish I could have my thirty hours back to have spent on anything else. I know Toby Fox loves the dev and was really hyped for this game and I respect his opinion, and the opinions of others who call this a masterpiece. I just simply don't agree. I want to be able to recommend it, even though I didn't like it, but I can't fathom why anyone does like this. It's not scary, creepy, or horrifying. It's just disgusting. Gross. I don't have any desire to touch this game again.",1704040287,1704046649,False,3,0,0.447075873613357544,0,True,False,False

could be a bit harder and more engaging during the headspace segments though n the hikikomori and true routes seem a little flipped in terms of [spoiler]everything in black space. the game hints towards basil's dream world death being the cause of headspace resetting because omori is killing the last reminder of what happened to mari, but instead you kill basil in the true route because ????? why ????? you could still have that amazing scene with the music box in the bedroom after basil's death once he returns in the reset, it really doesn't make sense to me at all. its cool that black space 2 is hikikomori exclusive because he's repressing reality more so the built up guilt is even more potent + it adds more content to a route that strips away the entire main story. the other hikikomori content feels halfassed and lame. the abyss is cool but it couldve been so much cooler if it was expanded upon, snowglobe mountain just sucks. wish they fleshed out the content and added even More content considering youre missing out on a huge portion of the game in the hikikomori route and thematically it only makes sense if omori conjures up more complex fantasies after finall suppressing the truth[/spoiler] the route thing is kind of a major issue but it doesn't Dull the impact of the story too much i just feel like it wouldve hit harder and made more sense if it was flipped

This is going to be a LIVE kind of on-going diary/review for the game OMORI as I play it blindly. I am going to be pathetic.
I will have a proper review finalized by the time I beat it. I'll start off with bits about myself. I am finally playing this game because it's been over a year since my best friend said goodbye, and someone else had advised me to play the game. My best friend liked this game, called it cute and said it dealt with dark subjects. She also had a pfp of Aubrey at some point.

I think the game started off being unnerving to me from the get-go, and I'm already guessing about subtext as I play along through the prologue. I am a paranoid/hypervigilant person, and I really am sensitive about stuff after all. Later I got to a certain point where a video-game genuinely terrified me in over a decade, I wound up all curled onto my bed. I'm texting my friends and snapshotting my monitor with my phone's camera to show my progress. I do that instead of simply prnt-scrn'ing the game because I didn't want to leave behind my support blankets and stuffed shark. 

I did finally come around to the game's budding charm. I got advice from Aubrey, which lit a lightbulb in my head about something I was struggling with. IDK why but the thing her advice helped me out with just seemed spectacular to me - in the sense that my mouth became agape with a grin. [i]She[/i] was right: [i]the game is cute[/i]. It's also, as cliche it is to say, ""oozing with atmosphere"". From the scenery to story... and suggested subtext, as well as the charming characters that I come across and travel with. G-d knows exactly how much this game is going to snap my spine, and which way I'll bend.

To me, Omori is good ONLY if you're someone who instantly sees something 'deep' and is impressed. Sure, it handles complex themes, but the actual gameplay sucks. A forced battle system, poor pacing, and the such, combine to make a terrible slog of a playing experience.

+fun battle system with it's emotion and follow-up system
+good balance between horror and non-horror.
+I really like the drawing style this game tries to pull off. It took a bit of getting used to, but now I like it, because it conveys the characters emotions really well
+good story

-battle system is at first quite confusing, because of the lack of in depth tutorials
-sometimes the puzzles felt more like a chore rather than a fun thing to solve and often they are simple, but tedious
-side quests are very hard to keep up with. Often times you'd check how far you are in a specific quest route, only to receive a very vague description. Other times you are supposed to meet the quest giver x. However, if you don't remember who x is, then good luck finding them. If this wasn't a problem, I'd have for sure done all quests, since this game doesn't seem to be swamped with them.

Overall an excellent game. If you like RPGs with a good narrative/characters, or are looking for a more serious story, then this game is for you.",1689079804,1703791039,True,6,1,0.606299221515655518,0,True,False,False

The story is great, some things didn't quite make sense. I wish the gameplay sections were better, as the story and characters in my humble opinion trump anything else. The combat system can be slightly more fleshed out, enemy variety (especially in some parts of the game like the castle) could be 10x better, but that is about it.

The portrayal of depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues feels so realistic, the music, and the way it pulls you in with its false atmosphere to make you forget that it's even psychological horror. It made me feel so emotionally attached to the characters that I felt like they were my friends. I can't think of another game that had such a deep and emotionally impactful story as this. The world building is immaculate. 50 hours into the game and I'm not even finished with all of it. It may just look like another Earthbound inspired RPG, but it's much more than that.  [/spoiler]

[spoiler] I've played many games but not one has been as emotionally impactful and has brought me to tears as much as OMORI. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] It's a reminder of the friends that I've lost over the years, the friends that moved away, and it has an important lesson  of moving on and forgiving yourself.  [/spoiler]


No other game has ever made me feel the way that OMORI has. 


Pros.

An absolutely phenomenal experience with a charming art style, likeable characters, and incredible music.

The character development from the beginning to the end, 

The incredible writing.

[spoiler] The combat and the unique emotion system. [/spoiler]

The world building is incredible.








Cons.


Depression.




[spoiler] The final battle between OMORI and Sunny ripped my heart out of my chest and made me cry throughout the whole fight, every single line made me start crying. The duet scene was so emotional and really showed how Sunny grew throughout the game. [/spoiler]

[spoiler] also I'm afraid of stairs now. [/spoiler]

10/10 absolutely phenomenal.

Lore/Storytelling is amazing, albeit a little hard to comprehend sometimes. Was extremely new to the genre of the game (psychological horror), but overall was a pleasant experience and 100% stuck with me. Can't really say anything about the story itself (no spoilers), but I can attest to the fact that it is extremely touching, and emotionally draining. No game has made me experience this before - 9/10. 

Design and art style is amazing as well, and I found that it conveyed emotions very well. Not a spoiler, but one way they do this is through making certain things/objects more pixelated than others (A realistic scary object behind a pixelated background, making it more creepy). Also, the design choice makes the game less scary when compared to other ""horror"" games (due to its cute like nature), but instead makes it all the more creepy and ""emotional scary"" in a sense - 10/10.

Game-play was a little mediocre however. I found that the fighting system was sub-par, and that the design of items, etc. was not amazing by any means. The game follows the usual game-play mechanics you would see in similar 2-d games, with the fighting mechanics following a turn to turn basis, making it pretty bland imo - 5/10.

Overall score: 8.5/10 100%, would recommend.
Absolute traumatic game - your life will be scared permanently lmao.

Well I'll tell you where I went! (in the bathroom to cry) But also I went to try and get my friends irl to play this. OMOCAT may be a controversial figure (I personally don't think any of the allegations and controversy surrounding her is based in any substantial proof), but her game was well worth the long wait and honestly? It's worth every cent. The narrative is rich and emotional while still managing to keep things light with the headspace sequences, and the psychological horror, while scary, is more bone-chilling than knock-your-socks-off terrifying, iykwim. The artistic choices to depict the uncanny feeling you get from this game is incredible, as is the art in general.

SPOILERS DO NOT READ IF YOU WANT TO GO INTO THIS BLIND

.
.
.

You play as Sunny, a sixteen year old boy, and Omori, his twelve year old self. It's not DID. Omori is the avatar in which you traverse Sunny's complex mind and trauma. He is the embodiment of Sunny's trauma, the part that desperately wants to forget the incident that caused it. Omori will do *ANYTHING* to keep Sunny from remembering. Sunny spends his days and nights locked up in his room, as a Hikkikomori does, sleeping and dreaming his life away. He's pale, without friends, and practically mute. A great depiction of living with mental illness. His dreams are worlds from his imagination that stifle and sit atop his subconscious, where the memories of his trauma are trapped by them. The worlds are expansive, vast, bright creations that hide the nasties underneath.

Omori lives his life peacefully with his friend group, a friend group that Sunny used to have. There's Kel, bright, resilient, and fearless. He can also be dense, and Aubrey  kind, stubborn, and strong  always bickers with him when he fails to read the mood or annoys her. Basil is Omori's best friend, sweet, shy, and optimistic, always with a flower crown and a camera. Hero is the designated ""big brother"" of the group, both in his caring and brotherly nature, and literally as he is Kel's older brother biologically. He's the ultimate alpha male, with a certain charm and an affinity for cooking and cleaning. Mari is the ""big sister"" of the group. She is beautiful, graceful, and kind, and she is also Omori's older sister.

Basil goes missing, and the RPG aspect of the game kicks off as Omori, Aubrey, Kel, and Hero all set off to find him. And the closer you get, the more the memory of him fades, the more Omori works to hide the past from Sunny.",1703549271,1703549271,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

Turn-based RPGmaker depression spiral.  If you grew up on drowning yourself in escapism to deal with your own bad situations, OMORI is designed to stab specifically you in the chest with bitter nostalgia.  It strikes hard at the anxiety that every good moment is fleeting, and will eventually have to crash back down to reality.

It's hard to sell OMORI because it doesn't have an immediate hook.  It's slow burn as hell and doesn't leave you perfectly satisfied, but goes a lot of places other games don't dare to and commits to it extremely hard.  What you get out of the game by the end, upon reflection, can feel like a metacommentary on how letting narrative influence gameplay can craft a more memorable experience.

But putting analysis aside, it is a memorable experience.  OMORI is a game that frequently sets you up to dread what's coming around the corner, but that doesn't mean you can't find things to enjoy on the way.

A sometimes fun, sometimes disquieting 20-30 hour romp, with a fair amount of replayability.

Update: Unfortunately, since the time of writing, a Switch version of this game came out with more content, being an objectively superior version of the game.  They seem to have no plans of supporting the Steam version any further so I no longer feel comfortable recommending it.  Personally, I think it is a very scummy move for a developer to screw over the earliest supporters like this.",1620587333,1703549114,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

An oceanic climate, also known as a marine climate, is the temperate climate sub-type in K칬ppen classification represented as Cfb, typical of west coasts in higher middle latitudes of continents, generally featuring cool summers and mild winters (for their latitude), with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Oceanic climates can be found in both hemispheres generally between 45 and 63 latitude. Other varieties of climates usually classified together with these include subtropical highland climates, represented as Cwb or Cfb, and subpolar oceanic or cold subtropical highland climates, represented as Cfc or Cwc. Subtropical highland climates occur in some mountainous parts of the subtropics or tropics, some of which have monsoon influence, while their cold variants and subpolar oceanic climates occur near polar or tundra regions.",1703547242,1703547242,True,2,4,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

So yeah, OMORI. I have not finished it yet (though my playtime is this high... lol) and can only say one thing; like funky no-sense colorful and creative dream worlds? Like unpredicted yet mastefully pulled off short horror sequences to chill you to the core? A story twining itself in between two realms of the same, strange silent child, this game owes it's namesake to? No fear in the face of disturbing topics and, but simultaneously enough love for games with strategized fight sequences, items to collect which one may or may not need later, stunning art and character work? Well, then this just might be something for you to enjoy. 

I wouldn't recommend it for children who are sensitive in the light of topics such as (TW) suicide, body horror, self-harm or depression, but for anyone else fitting the bill- you're welcome to give it a try! A friend forcefully yeeted me into the fandom and I am stuck, but hey, at least I can cause more of you to be stuck with me :)

I don't think it's as good as these games, but I might be in the minority on that one judging by the other reviews. Let me explain what I mean.

The developer of OMORI clearly had a lot of faith in their character writing, plot, art, and music, and I will say, it's not misplaced. These are what make OMORI worth your time, and I can't imagine being too disappointed with these elements.

The big problem I had was with OMORI's pacing.

The strengths I just mentioned started to wear thin about 9 hours in to my 18 hour playthrough. Make no mistake, this is a JRPG, and like most JRPGs, OMORI tends to drag on a little longer than it should. Eventually I started rushing because I wanted to see what happened next, and my general lack of interest in just about anything else happening in this game. I think someone taking their time could have a relaxed playthrough well over 30 hours- it's not Dragon Quest or Persona or anything, but I think a faster pace would have vastly improved my experience of the game.

JRPG combat does not generally interest me, and OMORI did nothing to change my mind on this, but it functioned. There is too much farting around in [spoiler]HEADSPACE, especially Sweetheart's Castle[/spoiler], and I just don't think the combat, sidequests, ""puzzles"", or any other non-story content is strong enough to justify how long this game is. Even some of the story moments drag on too long, which for me, ruined a couple of big moments and reveals because I started feeling impatient. I think if someone is mashing through the climax of your plot, there's something wrong, and I'm sure it's not just me who felt this way.

Anyway, I've said my piece, and I still recommend OMORI to a patient player who likes JRPGs in this style.",1671949937,1703531959,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I adore games like Off, Undertale, etc. I love turn-based combat. But the combat in this game is such absolute trash, which is a shame, because the art is nice, the music is fantastic, and... well, I didn't get far enough into the story to really care, so I won't comment on that.

The combat makes absolutely no sense. Much like Final Fantasy 4, there is no logical reason for why enemies do the damage they do. You have to spend hours, upon hours, upon hours grinding to even keep headway against regular enemies, who will chunk half your HP or more in a single hit, except this is where the game has led me so I have to be ready for this place, right? I mean, I beat the boss so handily, THEY weren't doing this much damage to me, so why are the regular enemies suddenly decimating my party?

It's just no fun and I refuse to waste more time on it.

I don't know OMO, I don't know anything about them, the Kickstarter, the extra content. But I will state that if they're an enjoyer of shota content, that's fictional and not pedophilia in any way from a legal standpoint, the FBI doesn't care about anyone's anime waifus or husbandos, and saying such is an insult to people like me who are not fictional and have actually gone through such trauma as children.

I think what sets this RPG apart from the rest of the lot is its story: Omori is SO good in puting you in the headspace (wink wink) of its titular character, Sunny/ Omori. It's portrayal of depression/ psychological trauma is so well played to a T that it almost hurts to watch all of it unfold. Speaking from someone who has quite similarly ""lived in my head for as long as I can remember"", this game will win your heart (and will haunt you forever).

Omori flips over the ""it was all just a dream!"" troupe onto its head- delving deep into its psychological implications. This game may seem ""quirky and random XD"" at first, but don't be fooled- it's all intentional and not at all what it seems at the same time.  Although the Earthbound series undoubtedly pioneered the whole ""quirky rpg aesthetic"", I would argue that Omori takes this a step further through connecting its art style with its story and message. Every bit of seemingly negligible area or plot point in this game has a purpose- and the game best shines through its attention to detail. Omori takes the best aspects of its inspired source materials and personally sets the bar higher for any future indie RPG I am to pick up next. 100/10 would cry again.",1703007023,1703340018,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

The story is just so powerful and so amazingly delivered, and it plagued my mind (in a good way) for weeks after I had finished the game. Everything is top notch - story, character writing, art, music, gameplay - and you find yourself completely absorbed in the world and characters in no time.

Playing this game has influenced me so much that I don't think I'd be the same person I am today if I had decided against seeing it through to the end. I'll try to keep it vague to avoid spoilers, but do know that playing without a single clue as to what to expect will likely bring the best experience.

  First off, my biggest criticism of this game is the description. ""The path you've chosen"" is literally one decision at about the 3-hour mark of the average playthrough, and if you've went in completely blind, you will have absolutely no idea that you just secured yourself into playing the game ""incorrectly."" If you need to know: [spoiler] Open the door, let Kel in. [/spoiler]
  In my first playthrough of the game, I didn't do that. As a result, my playthrough was immensely unfulfilling and felt purposeless by the end, leaving nothing but the thought: ""That was it?"" Through it all, I felt that this was a unique experience that I would never be able to feel again, and honestly, I had hoped for the game to answer my own questions about myself for me. Had I left it at that playthrough, I would've left feeling miserable.
  Then, I watched a review of the game, and surprise, it turns out everything I did had absolutely nothing to do with the ""main game."" Still, I played through the game again, knowing basically every major plot point now, no real surprises left for me, including [spoiler] that door choice [/spoiler]. Here I am, praising this game for being my favorite game, and I already knew everything about it before I had made that jurisdiction.
  OMORI can be a deeply personal game, though as implied, that depends on who's playing it. Those who can relate to many of the game's aspects may find themselves either finding comfort or sinking further into whatever dread that had found a connection to the game. Lucky for me, this game provided a scenario that let me ponder on my own thoughts as I played through it, both in and out of Headspace. I can still go back through the game's soundtrack and remember almost exactly what I was feeling and thinking when I first heard each individual track.
  I'd love to keep gushing about this game, but it's really only been my own experience with it. When someone who's just looking for a good story plays this game, although they might not relate to the game as hard as some others, they can still find an enjoyable and emotional story that they're likely to remember.
 
  I have problems with this game. The gameplay is disappointing; I really think the combat's emotion system could've been so much more than just fancy stat labels, and there isn't much variety in how to approach said combat. Headspace, too, feels largely unnecessary, being a linear path of what is effectively filler meant to waste time ([spoiler] and yes, I know that's the point, but I still think it's a bad execution of the idea [/spoiler]). The story, in my opinion, plays rather ""by the book,"" really just being a blend of great qualities, but nothing really ""flavorful."" It's what it wants to be, grounded and emotional, and that's about it. That isn't to discredit it's quality! I'm just saying that if you want something unique and one of a kind, you might want to look elsewhere.
  Also, the developers. I haven't looked into any of the controversy surrounding them, but it seems that they're constantly wrapped in it, and there are accounts of the game's development being very problematic. Just knowing what I know, I don't feel comfortable at all supporting them.

  That's what I think. OMORI isn't the most emotional, nor is it the most inventive, innovative, or even realistic depiction. I do think, however, that its critical acclaim is justified. It's not a game for everyone, but it's still ""general"" enough to fit into a wide criteria. Go in with an open mind, letting your own thoughts entertain you through the silent noise of filler. Let yourself feel; you might find something unforgettable.",1702925317,1702925317,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

omori is an amazing experience that every person on earth should be required to play, and im only half kidding.

as somebody who suffers from ptsd, it captures every single aspect of it phenomenally. the guilt, the repression, and eventually, coming to terms with the fact that you need to remember it all.

theres nothing i can say about this game that hasn't already been said. it's an amazing game with funny dialogue, an interactive story, and a soundtrack that gives undertale and risk of rain a run for their money.

even if you're not a fan of horror, those segments are broken up by other interactions and are honestly the best parts.

can't recommend enough.

Omori is an Emotional Psychological Horror adventure game. You play as a young boy going between a happy colorful dream world he뗩 made in his mind and a dark gloomy real world. This game had such an emotional and great story with such good representation of mental disorders such as depression and derealization. The Soundtrack was great and always set the scene with catchy fitting music. Each character was unique and likable. I do warn people though this game is not for the faint of heart it may look all happy but it뗩 very grim in many moments.

Now the soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing. It can be beautiful, sad, scary, funny and more (just like the game itself) and there are tons of bangers in the ost.

Just buy the game and play it, It's so much better than you think.

Omori, drawing inspiration from the holy trinity of ""Yume Nikki, EarthBound, and Undertale"", manages to create an engaging and thoroughly enjoyable experience. The storyline, a complex web of emotions and revelations, left my mind in disarray. My hunches about MARI and the unfolding events proved accurate, yet the game's execution left me utterly shocked and enthralled. The dual endings, one melancholic and one hopeful, captivated me, refusing to release their hold until I saw both.

[u] 2. Visuals and soundtracks [/u] 
 Visually, Omori is a masterpiece, with each detail crafted purposefully and with love. The art style, drawstyle, and attention to detail elevate the game into an immersive and visually stunning realm.
The music, a hauntingly beautiful composition, strikes a perfect balance between calming and eerie, setting the tone for every emotional beat in the game. It's a soundtrack that lingers, enhancing the overall experience.

[u] 3. Charackters [/u]  
Character designs and personalities, initially met with ambivalence, evolved into a deep affection for every member of the cast. The pain, the coping mechanisms, and the struggles of these kids unfold into a tale that tugs at the heartstrings. Every character is relatable, each carrying the weight of their experiences.

[u] 4. Good elements [/u] 
 Omori's humor, influenced by Undertale, injects a layer of levity into its melancholic narrative. Silly moments and jokes, deal against the backdrop of a bizarre dream world, manage to make players smile amidst the emotional turmoil.
Plus the genius references, from Touhou to Fullmetal Alchemist, add another layer of charm. These nods, both silly and familiar, are scattered throughout, rewarding players with moments of recognition and amusement.

[u] 5. acceptable play hours [/u] 
Clocking in at the perfect duration for an RPG maker game, Omori strikes the delicate balance between a captivating storyline and a manageable playtime.

In conclusion, Omori is a masterpiece, a testament to the creative genius of Omocat. As I bid farewell to Mari and Hero, I am left in awe of the emotional rollercoaster this game has taken me on. Thank you, Omocat, for delivering an experience that will linger in my thoughts and emotions for a long time to come.",1702602162,1702602344,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

To be honest I thought the ending didn't make much sense, but if you ignore the main plot the rest of it is really really nice. The characters, moment to moment dialogue and all of the side stories were really sweet and well written. The horror elements were also very good. Soundtrack is really excellent. Also, a decision really early on completely splits the game into a whole other path that is totally different, and I just respect that massively for the amount of effort and commitment that takes.

Do not read the following before you have played the game.

[spoiler]
I do not believe the main twist makes sense based on what we have been shown of the characters involved. Mari has been piling pressure onto Sunny over the recital because of her perfectionism, and Sunny lashes out by breaking his violin. An argument ensues, and Sunny kills Mari by pushing her down the stairs in a moment of anger. Basil witnesses this and helps Sunny to disguise the murder by framing it as a suicide.

Let's start with Mari piling pressure onto Sunny due to her perfectionism. Her perfectionism is really not covered in depth by the game I feel, it's alluded to in small ways here and there but overall it's not really shown in any major scenes of the game or any flashbacks. She is otherwise shown as a sweet and doting sister to an almost absurd degree. She consistently prioritises Sunny, to the point of putting her own life in danger to protect him by diving in to save him when he almost drowns, and she is in floods of tears when he is finally revived. After this event she insists the group no longer hang out in their favourite spot to prevent triggering Sunny's trauma. She swaps beds with him when she notices that he has trouble sleeping. Overall, she puts her brother above herself in many if not all situations. I do not believe, from what we are shown of her character, that she would put enough pressure onto Sunny to cause him distress, and certainly not to the point where he would lash out physically.

That leads neatly to the next point - Sunny smashing his violin. This violin was gifted to him as a christmas present by all of his friends, many of whom go to lengths to get the money to afford it. This violin would absolutely be a cherished, if not treasured, possession of his. I do not believe for a second that he would destroy it, and especially not in some kind of petulant tantrum over his sister making him practice too much. Sunny is shown as an incredibly passive character, to the point he barely even talks, and he is also shown to treasure his friendship group to a fault. He is not shown as having any history of outbursts, especially violent ones, so I just don't see this event happening.

These reasons are also a large part of the reason I just cannot believe that the two siblings have their confrontation at the top of the stairs. Mari dotes on and protects Sunny, and Sunny is a passive and generally caring character. Mari would not have even started yelling at Sunny, and Sunny would not have violently lashed out, based on the information we have been given about the two characters. I note that this scene is never shown with any kind of hint towards the dialogue between the two during this confrontation - I think this is intentional, because were any to be written and included in the game, I think it would be much more noticeable how much of a flip for specifically Mari's character this confrontation is.

Once Mari has been pushed, Basil then tries to protect Sunny from getting in trouble for his crime by suggesting that they frame the death as a suicide, and then single-handedly hangs her from the tree in the backyard while Sunny sits in a catatonic state. This is a character who much like Sunny, is shown to be incredibly passive - he's a sweet little boy who likes flowers and taking pictures of his friends. Where he would get this horrifying idea, let alone actually suggest it to a boy who's just killed his sister, is beyond me. Again - we are not shown anything of Basil's character, any dark undertone or other inclination, that he would even be able to fathom this kind of plan, let alone suggest and then execute it. You could perhaps argue that he isn't thinking and is acting on some kind of instinct to protect Sunny, but I don't think a panic response would elicit something as dark as this out of nowhere, especially at 12 years old. 

Also, while I'm nitpicking, are the police in this town just non-existent? Hanging a body that clearly, from any kind of basic inspection, died from blunt force trauma and would be covered in bruises and is implied to be bleeding (Sunny's sheet music has blood on it) is a terrible way to cover up the murder. I could suspend my disbelief for this if the rest of the twist was believable, but since I already don't buy the twist, this just sticks out as something else preventing me from getting invested in the story.

Overall, I think the twist could have been more believable if the player had been given more indication that Mari would inflict her perfectionism on the other characters, or even just Sunny, and that Sunny was shown to react with panic/violence when put under pressure or from people intruding on his personal space. How you would fix Basil, I really don't know... I guess he would have to be shown to have a darker side or be willing to do dark/violent things to protect his friends. Perhaps if he was older also, as I just don't see a 12 year old coming up with the idea of staging a suicide.

Going into the game, the vibe I was picking up from what I was being shown is that Mari had committed suicide, blindsiding everyone, and that the various characters were coping with their grief in different ways. Dream Basil is removed from the dreamspace because he suddenly remembers Mari's death and Omori does not want to confront it. I was expecting a fairly heartfelt story of dealing with grief and sudden loss, but I feel like the game kind of threw all that away to have a big dark horror twist and a (as a result of the unbelievable twist) forced message of facing your past mistakes and confessing them with honesty, even if it means people might not forgive you. If the game had done more to show these darker sides/character flaws, and made more of a point of carrying the message of self-forgiveness and confronting mistakes from the beginning of the plot, it might have possibly landed better.

I really want to buy into this story, but I just can't based on how it set things up, and that's a shame - because it is otherwise incredibly well written, atmospheric, and clearly had a lot of love put into it. I do still believe this game should be played, but I just wish it had more consistency in its portrayal of the characters.

That being said, this game might challenge your patience.

Said moments are interspersed between long segments of RPG gameplay that can get stale in spite of the unique Emotion battle mechanic. Overall I think this pace is still forgivable and makes plot developments hit harder, but your mileage may vary.

     My first gripe is less with the game, and more with how the developer handled the game after the Kickstarter campaign was funded. I won't go into detail here, since you can look it up if you're interested, but I felt it was worth mentioning that I do not like OMOCAT, and this review is tinted by the lens of someone critical of their work.

     The game starts off strong with a lot of intrigue. It gets you invested in the world and has you wondering what the hell is going on. There are a lot of things that leave you confused, but it's easy to tell that those things are symbolic and will be explained in time. As someone who's a fan of the psychological genre, I felt they hit the perfect balance of bewilderment: enough to lure me in, but not so much that it was off-putting.

     Unfortunately, after those first 2 hours of intrigue, the game falls flat on its face and stumbles around for the next 25 hours or so. All of a sudden you're no longer playing a psychological horror game, but rather a stereotypical RPGMaker game that tries really hard to be Undertale. With practically no exposition whatsoever, the questions you had at the start go largely unanswered and ignored. Thankfully, the NPCs are written decently, and some of the scenes were amusing, I guess.

     The battle system is half-baked and easy as all hell. None of the party members felt like they excelled at anything, except for the healer character who was good at, well, healing. You end up just spamming basic attacks, and then the occasional AoE ability that all of your characters have a near-identical version of for some reason. It's just not fun, and that's coming from someone who enjoyed even DQXI's simple turn-based combat.

     During the last four hours or so, the game relentlessly dumps exposition on you. You aren't even really playing a game, it's practically just an interactive movie. It did a fantastic job of delivering the exposition, but what the actual hell? Like, why am I getting a feature-length movie of all the exposition that could have been given to me throughout the 25 hours of boring questing? The promise of exposition would have made those awful battles at least bearable to play through, because the story truly is interesting.     
     
     OMORI feels like a 6 hour game that OMOCAT somehow bloated to 30 hours, completely sacrificing the integrity of the game and cadence of the storytelling in the process. It flat out is just NOT fun without the psychological horror aspect or plot exposition.       

    I'm happy I bought and played through OMORI, but I can only recommend it if you're a fan of the psychological genre and are willing to sit through 20-ish hours of bloat in order to get to the game's phenomenal finale.",1636265770,1702362581,False,2,0,0.443864226341247559,0,True,False,False

Credits just starting rolling. And some bits were so dark that I had the hardest time seeing. Usually in the Yohan segments and during the credits. It was rough. But I loved the art and characters. I enjoyed the battling when it was more simple. I liked the emotions during battle. So I뗛 give this a neutral rating if I could.

Sure you have a role, as a player, of a game, but then things get so much better from the world around you turning so much worse.

You can choose to avoid everything, or you can try to put in the effort to change the world for the better. Sure, it might only make things worse or put you through your own personal hell, but at the end of day, it's all done for the friends you've made along the way!

Amazing characters, great soundtrack, unique visual design, and contains deeper psychological themes that most games will not dare delve into today. The gameplay is an interesting take on the classic RPG style but instead with emotions which can all have strengths and weaknesses. This game contains 3 different endings, which are all worth checking out and this is one of those games that I think it is worth getting all the achievements for since there is so much detail in this game. These are some of my favorite characters that I can certainly relate and empathize with, as they are just written so well.

That contrast between endearing and edgy makes the experience that much more unsettling. With the help of superb soundtracks and fantastic art style, OMORI really managed to touch my heartstrings.  

My only complaint is that the game is too long for this type of story, and it ruins the pacing. Some obnoxious characters that overstay their welcome and distract from the actual plot. Although I admire the amount of content they crammed in, I think in this case less is more. 

If you like JRPGs you probably already played this. If you don뗪 like JRPGs know that there is a worthy experience if you can force through some repetitive combat and boring side plots.

ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW

[h1]An impossibly human experience.[/h1]

...

[spoiler]
I fucked up my life so much.
these 24 hours felt like playing back the 24 years of that life.

they were just set in front of me and I was told my very own dilemma to my face and asked:
""OK? And?""

and...

I never really realized how much I needed that.
because I didn't have anyone to ask me that

I ran away from them

and by the time I looked back, there was no one there


I truly fucked up

...
but it might not be too late.
...It isn't

I'm still here
...
Everything will be OK.

It also helped that the art style was very well done and the game has several emotionally impactful moments that made me really want to push through the grindy bits to see what happened next. 

But then the ""twist"" landed and tossed the entire narrative into the trash, with a sprinkle of plot holes to boot. I haven't been this disappointed since the last season of Game of Thrones.

Edit:
I did this review at about 91.8 hours of game time, and will be doing an actual review of this game now that I have an additional 200 or so hours logged.

OMORI is a story-driven indie RPG that was in development for 5 years. It is phenomenally well written, with tons of symbolism that all ties to the story's focal point. There is not a single detail in this game that does not serve a purpose, which is incredibly impressive. The gameplay is quite easy, despite the complexity of the mechanics. I've done several challenge runs across my nearly 48 playthroughs of this game, as the surprisingly deep mechanics lend themselves to a lot of variety. Unfortunately, some of the options available are simpler, and downright better. Like nuking every boss in, at minimum, a couple of turns with kel's run n gun skill. The story is the focus, so I can forgive the gameplay on some level. OMORI has one of the best representations of mental health and trauma I have seen in a video game, and its usage of psychological horror is top notch. OMORI lures you into a false sense of security with headspace, only to catch you off guard with the horrors lying underneath, in a way that flows incredibly well. Even if you dislike horror, you might like OMORI because of the vast breaks in tension that headspace provides. After all, this is a quirky indie rpg with compelling characters. I absolutely recommend it.",1629023622,1701915737,True,1,3,0.505494534969329834,1,True,False,False

And I just couldn't get into it either time. I love these kinds of games too. Anything inspired by Earthbound is gonna usually attract my attention but I felt the story was disjointed. It's telling two stories at once, the story in the dream world, and the story in real life, and they just feel so separate from each other. I found myself constantly wanting to get back to the story in the real world and just felt like I was forcing myself through the dreamworld segments that were throwing out a lot of charm and silliness but I was like ""Okay thats great and funny and all but its hard for these constant stream of silly jokes to land when I feel there are more pressing matters at hand.""

I play a lot of games, so very few of them have any effect on me. After finishing this game, it took a few weeks for me to not think about it every day. It is a really good depiction of how a person might deal with whatever life threw at them. It is completely filled with emotions, and the game conveys so much of that by just visuals, faces, how things are drawn, actions etc. instead of text. You sometimes just look at a thing, and you will think of that for days. I am listening to OST and I tear up, I played this game a few years ago like, bruh, what the fuck? Can you stop your influence already, I want to be able to like other games again.

Okay I don't know how to describe how great this game without making you play the entirety of it. I've played like 500 games or so, and this is in top 5.

The one and only criticism I could have is that some portions of the game is kinda boring and drawn out, which totally makes sense in the context, but some players might get bored of it. I do encourage to push through, but if you cannot stand that kind of a thing, be warned. Also, game has content warnings. So yeah.",1701878589,1701878663,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

Please for the love of God play this game and under no circumstances spoil it for yourself, the only thing I will say in this vein is, if given the option ALWAYS OPEN THE DOOR.

I am a very, very unemotional person, before playing this game I probably hadn't cried since I was a young child and the only thing that has made me cry since playing this game is things relating to this game (notably a song that plays towards the game's end), Evangelion and Hashihime of the Old Book Town, all of which are things I engaged with (at least partially) because I explicitly wanted to feel what OMORI made me feel on my first play-through (and it only was ever even challenged by Evangelion).

...and not only does this game have a heart wrenching story, almost every other aspect of it is either the best in a video-game or above average for what the game seeks to achieve.
The music is the best I've seen in any piece of media except music itself by a wide margin, even years after playing, tracks like GOLDENVENGEANCE and My Time (Bo En) still give me chills and other tracks make my eyes water and one has even made me cry with the music and it's associations alone. I also listen to the more ambient tracks quite often in the background.
The art (directions & execution, not graphical fidelity) is probably the best I've seen in any game, the pixel art while being quite generic in style, is incredibly detailed, pretty and instantly recognizable as uniquely OMORI, this game also includes hand drawn and animated scenes and images which pop up quite often, and are executed as best as I think you could with the art-style.
The game-play; compared to a typical games like say Call of Duty or Mario Kart isn't great; but first of all it doesn't need to be and second of all, for a JRPG it's pretty good and quite creative. For me at least, the game-play kept me completely entertained for  full play-throughs of both of the main routes (one of which is much more game-play heavy than the other).

(Minor Spoilers for the names of certain routes ahead)

I have played through this game fully 4 times as of yet. My initial playthrough, where I got what I think is the 'intended' ending, the 2nd where I did the Hikikomori ending, the 3rd where I got the achievements I didn't get on my 1st and 2nd playthroughs, and a 4th where I simply replayed the game for enjoyments sake. I constantly tell myself, OMORI could not have been as good as I remember it being, and every time I have replayed the game, I find it IS as good, I find that the game still has the same magic as it did on my first playthrough, and although I don't think I will ever feel the way my first playthrough made me feel, OMORI makes me feel a way that nothing else has ever made me feel. I have cried every single time I have played this game, at least once, usually twice, my eyes still water up when I hear Mari's signature tune and OMORI still gives me gives me chills constantly. I don't think I could possibly explain how OMORI makes me feel with words, all I can say is, please buy this game. The only thing that holds this game back from a perfect 100/100 (Which has never been achieved in my eyes) for me is that some parts of the game can drag on just a tad once you're on your 3rd or 4th play-through.

The horror is definitely a little bit scary at times especially when it happens at points where you don't expect it, but once you get hooked on the story you'll probably be more focused on that then on a couple of spooky encounters.

Pros: 
-An amazing art style.
-A really good soundtrack.
-Some really amazing story telling.
-Multiple endings.
-Absolutely at no point do you need to grind, which may be bad for some but I'm going to consider it as a pro.
-Spooky moments.
-it's a decently sized game and the multiple game endings gives you a lot of content for how much you are paying.

Cons:
-There is no difficulty options so if you are looking for a harder experience you'll probably be a bit dissatisfied with that.
-If you are looking for a horror game that will scare you, this may not be the right place to look. The couple of jump scares you get won't scare you that much compared to something like Outlast.
-The reverse of the last point, if you are looking for a cutesy game then technically this would work however I am pretty sure when you get further into the game you might get a little freaked out.
-At one point in the game there are some pretty easy puzzles, but if that's not what you are into it may bring you to a halt and probably to a walk-through, (they aren't that hard so probably not though.)

Well anyways that is my review, I would totally recommend buying this game if the pros from earlier interest you! If it's on sale then I'd say even if this isn't something you would normally like, try it out anyways and see what you think. If you get the game I hope you enjoy your play-through! :>",1630876081,1701568139,False,0,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,False

When I think about the kind of games I want to play in the future, Omori is one of those titles that make me go ""I want to play another game like this one day."" And by that, I mean that this game is very special.

GAMEPLAY:
Omori plays out like your typical run-of-the-mill rpg, where you move around the world and interact with objects and people. But what makes this game special is the story behind it, that puts weight behind those actions. The combat is turn-based, and has a unique mechanic primarily revolving around three emotions: happiness, anger, and sadness. Happiness makes you weaker in exchange for boosting your luck and speed, anger boosts your attack in exchange for lowering your defence, and being sad raises your defence in exchange for being slower. As well, enemies could be inflicted with emotions as well, creating a rock-paper-scissors scenario of what status beats what (e.g. attacking a happy enemy with a sad attack is super effective). This battle mechanic felt fun and fresh, while also not being forced upon you as you could brute force through most of the overworld enemy encounters. As someone that loves high damage values, I sincerely apologize to Hero, Kel, and Aubrey for keeping them mad 99% of the time <3.

At some point during the game, you can play slots at a casino. And this holds a very special place in my heart, as the slots are always randomized regardless of if you reload your save. That is, I reloaded my save over and over again until I became filthy rich <3 Thank you OMOCAT for blessing me with this gameplay experience. It was the best hour of my life and if I got the chance to relive it, I would in a heartbeat.

NARRATIVE:
The story is where it really hits home with this game. As much as it's funny, quirky, and happy, it can be sad, tragic, and dark... Lines between reality and delusion blur, and the game makes you scared. Scared for the characters, scared of the past. Scared that the characters you've come to love and care about won't have a happy end. There's so much that I could say, but this is a story you have to play for yourself, without hearing about it from others. If you haven't experienced OMORI's story, yet, all I can say is: enjoy.

GRAPHICS:
The art style is so cute. Battles are so charming and full of life because of all the expressions the characters have, and can we talk about how you become a piece of toast when you die in game? Obviously, this game isn't all about being cute and Omori absolutely delivers on the unsettling and eerie art as well. I love the dichotomy.

SOUNDTRACK:
Just like the graphics, the music for this game is sometimes cute, sometimes eerie, or a little bit of both! Says a lot about this game. Needless to say, the music is amazing, fitting, and enhances the player experience.

OVERALL: 5/5
Recommended for those that like feeling emotions and getting depressed. Upon finishing this game I laid on my bed and thought about life. We need more games like this <3",1701498782,1701498782,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,False

Gameplay wise, this is a pretty huge game as well that, on a fairly completionist run, lasted me 50 hours in the first run, probably more counting reloads and stuff. There are alternate routes, pretty big ones too, so this game can last you a ton. Like Hollow Knight this game is extremely worth its price off sheer content alone, which manages to remain of high quality and made with a lot of visible care through the whole thing.

The only criticism for the game that I can come up with is that, if you're into RPGs, the game mechanics are interesting but for at least most of the time you're not really required to optimize at all in order to progress. Most bosses can be beaten on first try without many issues. On the opposite hand, if you despise traditional RPGs then the story is still totally worth it but you'll still have to go through a lot of RPG stuff in order to get to the meaty stuff.

Issues with personal preferences aside though, the game is objectively well made both in story and gameplay, and it's a must try for indies.",1701465368,1701465368,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

At the heart of Omori's brilliance is its soundtrack, a musical marvel that deserves special mention. Composed with finesse and emotional depth, the music not only complements the game's surreal atmosphere but becomes an integral part of the storytelling. From hauntingly melancholic tunes that tug at heartstrings to exhilarating compositions that amplify the intensity of battles, the soundtrack serves as an emotional conduit, enhancing every moment of the journey. The synergy between the visuals and the music is nothing short of magical, creating an immersive atmosphere that is rare to find in gaming. Each note feels purposeful, drawing players deeper into the enigmatic narrative. Whether wandering through the dreamlike landscapes or facing the emotional complexities of the characters, the soundtrack acts as a guiding force, accentuating the highs and lows of Omori's intricate tale. Beyond the music, Omori boasts a unique turn-based combat system, inventive puzzles, and a captivating narrative that weaves through dreams and reality with finesse. The hand-drawn art style is a visual feast, complementing the game's dreamy and occasionally eerie ambiance.In conclusion, Omori by OMOcat is a triumph in storytelling and game design, offering a rare blend of emotional depth and immersive game-play.

I don't usually spend more than 5 seconds reviewing a game, but this game truly deserves some more attention.
This is the only game I ever played in my life that made me cry, made me think about past mistakes, and changed me as a person, and that's all good.

This review will contain spoilers, and details of Omori which are better experianced than watched or read. Basically Go play the game first! I will have the first paragraph spoiler free if you would like to have an informed decision before buying the game. 

Omori is a 2D retro Disturbing Rpg Thriller (thats a lot of words at once). It combines elements of Mother, Undertale, Doki Doki, and many other titles. It is unique in many ways including its emotion system and cast of characters. I would say most play-throughs of the game will last 15 or more hours. Two things to know to decide whether Omori is for you. Omori is a Slow game, this does not mean that parts of the game are entertaining but they are slow and are meant to be savored. Secondly Omori is a very disturbing game, this game dives head first into suicide, murder, child abuse, child endangerment, and more. It is not for the faint of heart and will Fuck with you. 
[spoiler]
***Spoilers Ahead***
(spoiler)
Discussing the story
 Omori begins in a fantastical world where you and your friends battle bunnys, space boyfriends, and alligators. After learning its Mechanics you are tasked with finding Your friend Basil. You and your friends search for Basil in a plethora of zones like in the space-like Otherworld, underwater Deep Well, and the spider infested Pyrefly Forrest. These sections of the game are filled to the brim with Comedy, heartfelt moments, interesting characters and interactive fights.

Interludes take place inbetween these sections when ""you"" Omori (Who's real name is Sunny) wake up to find out that real like is not so dreamy. Your friends are at eachothers necks, youve all grown distant, and something terribly wrong has happened to your older sister Mari. She has [strike] died [/strike] gone and it has driven all of you apart. It is three days until you ""Sunny"" move away. So you must get your affairs in order helping your old friends reunite before you leave.

These sections of the game tend to be more of Fetch quests going around town picking up items or running chores. They are cozy, real, and uncertain.

Ive neglected one last aspect of the story, [strike] Mari [/strike] her. Something happened and it has taken a hold of us. Why is she after us? Why is Basil afraid of us? WHat did she dO?! WhAT DId hE dO?!
...
what did we do...
...?
Omori made its way into my heart, into my mind, and finally into my fucking Nightmares. Jesus this game fucked me up. Omori has a story like no Other where you can never be sure that what you know is real or true and it gracefully unveils this knowledge in its final act. 

Discussing the Gameplay
Omori uses a turn based combat system with Party building aspects. You can't change the members of your party but you can change your party members skills, weapons and Charms. This adds a lot of versatility to the game making combat heighten towards later game. Bosses can be challenging yet satisfying to beat giving you clear roads to success through memorizing attacks and patterns in combat.

Combat in Dream world offers a lot of versatility whilst real life is less open to mistakes. For the very little combat in the real world most encounters are meant to show credible writing rather than flawless game design. These fights are most often repetitive and crushing as you only have a couple options and some of those options are clearly not viable.

The last bit of gameplay I wanna discuss is the Nightmare fights. Often you face nightmares in which you will be forced to learn a new character development like calming down, persiting, or focusing. These have added benifits to dream and real world. Most of these are quite short and are meant to be story driven what particulary aches in me though is the Finale. The finale is basically a 1 to 2 hour nightmare. It takes far to long to collect all the memories, then to go through all the doors, and then cut off all the fingers, ect. This part felt like it dragged on and on. Parts of it were particularly memorable like watching basil die multiple times. But parts of it needed to be trimmed down. Especially because the Final fight between Omori and Sunny was basically a forced complete through specific button presses.
[/spoiler]

To summarize
Omori sucessfully delivers a game that will force you to think, act, and change. Its gameplay revitalizes turn based rpgs by using new mechanics and cutesy art to keep you entertained. The characters will make you hate, love, and laugh at them.  Omori is a game about childhood, depression, and change.

I enjoyed the first 30 mins but after that nothing interesting has happened in the 15 hours since then. The game started off with an interesting premise of finding a missing person but after that it feels like I've just been doing irrelevant side quests for the whole time I'm playing. The combat is really boring and tedious on top of the game throwing so many fights at you. 

I think the game would be much better as a visual novel style game with a much more concise and better paced story.

Edit: I ended up finishing the game many sessions and months later. The last act of the game was much shorter and to the point; it did not have any of the grueling combat and actually focused on characters/story. The ending was quite poignant and definitely makes slogging through the game feels much more worth it. However, I still wouldn't not recommend the game as it was often miserably boring. Doing something I did not find fun for ~25 hours for a good payoff just doesn't feel great. I've probably dropped this game 10+ times and I really had to find the willpower to sit through it until the end.",1684692939,1701234873,False,38,10,0.657931029796600342,9,True,False,False

No one wants to be the guy that made YIIK. Yet unlike Undertale, Omori doesn't take refuge in audacity or silliness. Unafraid of being dismissed as corny, it bares its heart, plays its plot very straight, and doesn't shy away from extremely heavy topics.

I don't doubt that a lot of players will be upset by the sting in this tale - it verges on the unforgivable. Yet, lacking the clear black-and-white of a typical RPG, its story was one I thought about long after the end credits had rolled. For that, I feel, the game deserves credit.

That, and its unique art style, and its unsettling undertone of horror, and for how it captures the wistful feelings of a youth that will have passed most of its players by; so much so that the real-life sections are more absorbing than the fantasy ones. Omori is a game that feels like it was made for 'my generation,' because who else would laugh as hard at an Internet Explorer download window being a video game boss?",1701097800,1701097800,True,2,0,0.540069699287414551,0,True,False,False

At first i didn't really get this game and i found the huge map and lots of side quests and things to do a bit overwhelming. But holy hell does this game get fun and addictive later on.

The [b] [i] soundtrack [/i] [/b] is also amazing, all around this game really comes together with all of the small details that make it close to perfection.

One con that id like to point out is that the game renders in a smaller resolution box so if you're playing on a [b] [i] bigger monitor [/i] [/b] ([b] 31.5 inches [/b]) with a [b] [i] higher resolution [/i] [/b] ( [b] 1440p [/b]) like me, it will be really [b] [i] shocking [/i] [/b] when you launch the game at first which is quite an immersion breaker for some. In that case i strongly suggest you upscale it trough the settings as much as you can and maybe check out a few mods like this one:[url=https://mods.one/mod/widescreen] [/url].

I have played many video games in the past, but there has never been one that could close the gap to my heart as effortlessly as OMORI has. The first hour or so of this game is misleading, probably intentionally so. I thought this was going to be a cute lo-fi aesthetic RPG with some, quite frankly, sluggish combat, or something along these lines. But as I progressed through the game and the first major plot point, I realized: I wasn't playing OMORI for the gameplay, no, there are clearly better RPGs than this. But the story, the world, the characters... now this is something worth exploring. And believe me when I tell you that in the end of it all, I regret even thinking of doubting this game at the beginning.

I can't say much without getting into spoiler territory, but I can tell you this: OMORI has so, so many powerful ways of gripping your heart, tightly so. One moment you'll find yourself with a glowing grin and watery eyes, then moments later you'll be feeling the painful chills down on you as you slowly explore the horrible truth. You CARE about what is happening, without the game making you do so. It is the most meaningful game I've ever played in terms of presentation... the world building is meaningful, the horror aspects of this game are meaningful. Everything matters, and this game will make you realize this thoroughly.

What is even more astounding, is that such a brilliant game was made in RPG Maker. It just shows that a bold vision can shine adamantly even on restricted environments. Five years of rough development that paid off tremendously. A tiny group of individuals that wanted to create something beautiful. Even on RPG Maker, this game looks amazing. The little details in every level, the gorgeous pencil-drawn animations, the expressive character portraits, complementing each other to deliver a bizarre, colorful world... the soundtrack is very beautiful and very well achieved...

OMORI is sad, it is happy, it is terrifying, it is a macabre ode for young people, it is a message of love and forgiveness. OMORI is a warm smile in the cold fog, in the endless void. It is a reminder. A reminder to look ahead, past the overwhelming darkness. There, somewhere, you'll find the smiles and love of the ones waiting for you. So don't keep them waiting...

because of this game now my life is miserable. 10/10",1700885335,1700885335,True,148,1,0.918189764022827148,0,True,False,False

OMORI has good, even great, soundtrack, but it isn't a masterpiece. OMORI has awesome art style, but it obviously isn't mind blowing or anything like that. OMORI has fine gameplay, but for many, at some point, it can become not exciting enough and then the game just kinda turns into grinding your way through many a bit repetitive levels. Still it's worth pointing out that even though the gameplay is simple, thanks to few tricks, the limitations of the game engine aren't that noticeable and it still can be very fun. And finally OMORI has an absolutely incredible story. It is for sure its strongest aspect. Very rarely a game is able to invoke such emotions in so many people, while adjusting to their decisions in the way that feels mostly fair and reasonable. Apart from that, man, I have never played a game that made me go trough my entire phone photo gallery to relive memories with my friends and actually greatly appreciate it, while being grateful for them. Until now.

I don't know if I should be worried or relieved that this game had made me have the raw emotional reaction that I had. Happy tears, followed by sadness followed by... I don't even know how to describe it but i never thought a game had the ability to change me like this one did. It may seem like I'm overplaying it by saying it changed me, but it did. It showed me a whole new perspective in life that I've never seen before. It showed me that there's road to forgiveness... a long. painful. gruelling road to forgiveness...

[spoiler] There is no easy way to write this but, the game made it so easy to project my experiences into the plot of it, might have been by pure chance, but being a musician with my sister and her being the reason as to why I started learning to play might have made it more painful when I discovered the truth in Omori's plot. The fact that something so bad can happen that trauma disables you for a good part of 4 years...[/spoiler]

I'm baffled as to why this game didn't recieve any awards and how it isn't talked about more. It's message is very important, especially during the pandemic as everyone has experienced isolation to some extent for the better part of nearly 2 years. Probably it's just a matter of time until some famous youtuber picks it up and drives tons of people to play it (vicariously or not) and talk about it.

This is my favorite game as of writing.

The characters are very well written: dialogues are creative and filled with puns, jokes and funny interactions between them. 
The story is engaging and interesting: plot twists and secrets won't be missing.
The art style is very unique, as in being a mix of various genres that work great together. 
The gameplay is fine - it's a RPG adventure with horror elements to it. Personally I find it to be its weakest point, but I was so absorbed into the story that I didn't care too much for the lack of depth of the combat system. 
Overall a great game, possibly even a must play, even tho it could be a bit too niche to reach that status. But personally I would highly recommend it.",1700202357,1700202357,True,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

but here goes:

omori is a turn based rpg set in and outside of a teenager's dream.

its fantastical and fun elements of the dream parallel and contrast the real life sections of the game, making for something serious with a lot of heart.

this game is like a rollercoaster, but it truly is a perfect blend of humor and sadness.

also, the energy mechanic during battles is such a neat idea that im gonna be sad to play other turn based rpgs that dont have it.

don't let anyone tell u otherwise.

and [i] don't ever let anyone tell u that it's too late to tell the truth. [/i]

it never is.

please purchase this video game so there can be more like it.

I would even say it is worth playing for the art style and characters alone. Combat is engaging and fun when fighting enemies and bosses for the first time.

The story itself is best gone into blind so I will not get into it any further than saying that it was not at all what I was expecting and that it was very enjoyable to go through.

Not a big deal for me personally since every single thing else is perfect for me, but I can easily see this turning someone off from liking the game to it's fullest extent.

This game stays with you. The story, characters and environment of both the real world and the dream world are beautifully designed and written.

The endings are all heartbreaking but all fitting. This game is definitely worth the money.

There's not really a good way for me to describe it, but I feel like after beating it now it's one of the most well crafted, emotional, and beautiful narratives that I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. I don't consider myself to be emotional, but even then I was basically bawling during the credits.
I could go on and on about how I related to the game and how it helped me come to terms with so many problems in my life, but I feel like it's better to just say:

play the game.

The main thing to note about this game is the sense of nostalgia, especially with the headspace area, that definitely shows strokes of Earthbound and honestly the entire 90s decade. This is furthered by the Faraway Town portion of the game, which is basically like a 90s hangout with your friends made into a game. This is balanced superbly with horror, as the games more intense imagery (i.e. blackspace) could have been too much if not for the happier headspace areas. The battle system is great too, though I think the emotions mechanic could have been utilized more than it was.

 I would highly recommend playing the game yourself first. especially blind, onto the review now.

My first play-through was a quiet night. Being completely alone and isolated helped me understand this game correctly. The first few hours were something I've never experienced in a game before, little things like the title screen, the music, and the recurring themes of familiarity of this dream world through its fantastic soundtrack, The music seriously enriches the player's understanding of this overall plot-rich/traumatic experience.

OMORI뗩 gameplay is in the form of a turn-based RPG, with a lot of exploration on the side, really simple and easy to understand, and can also be very rewarding in a very satisfying way, A lot of what you do in this game is explore with your friends and relive old memories together, while also making new ones which I found to enjoy a lot personally. especially with its story that heavily revolves around its lovable cast of characters, They all have their unique personalities, and their own lives which isn't dived into too much, but a lot of it is hinted at in a way that's realistic during the story.

the only criticism I would have for this masterpiece is its pacing, There are quite a few areas that drag on a bit too long for my liking especially when trying to interact with everything in the game. I find this game to be very hard to be able to replay with that in mind, especially for the many different endings it has to offer.

I really enjoyed OMORI and its wonderful art style, It's a game I will remember for years to come, It's had such a massive impact on me as a person through the story and tells a really important message that I think I needed to hear during the release of the game when I played it, which it delivers greatly on. definitely will be a steamroller of emotions and bangers once you launch this game.

The excessively large amount of dungeons bloats the game (especially in the final dungeon) and overall dampens the otherwise enjoyable story the game carries. The game feels as though it was not confident enough in its story to simply allow it to progress naturally without massive multi-hour sections of minor, one-note character moments, relatively boring rock-paper-scissors gameplay that tows the line of being mildly fun, so easy its boring, or so damage-spongy it's unbearable (looking at you, Humphrey), and slog-filled dungeons that only serve to meet Kickstarter goals and distract from the gripping story of the Real World sections of the game. Though this is likely intentional, showing how Sunny uses his Headspace as an escape from the stresses of the Real World and the trauma he has experienced, it does not translate well into the pacing of the game and after Pyrefly Forest, I was just wishing I could get back to the story and learn more about the real characters, not their watered-down, idealized Headspace counterparts.

I suppose this is all to say that the story of the Real World was so enjoyable and intriguing that the game left me actively wishing for more. Unfortunately, it only takes up around 5 hours of gameplay. Kel, Aubrey, Hero, and Basil are enjoyable characters and feel almost real, making their plights more interesting and making you feel for their characters. Watching the characters process and attempt to grow from their past is enjoyable and the overall message of moving forward from past actions and trauma is one that should be seen more in media and I am glad this game went to the effort to flesh out its messaging.

I'd recommend watching a let's play over playing the game yourself, since that way you can trim the fat of the game if you want to avoid the overly long Headspace sections. There's one section towards the very end I'd say is worth playing, but it's so late in the game I can't justify telling someone to spend $20 just to experience a 30 minute to 1 hour long section when you could get the same experience as it from Yume Nikki or its various fan sequels or clones for free with the added bonus of a better atmosphere.",1699200896,1699200896,False,5,1,0.494971662759780884,0,True,False,False

I usually start with the things that are good about the game but i am doing the opposite with Omori.
I know this point will be kind of subjective to some people but I value replayability a lot in games, I like going back to games I played to replay them, but I do not feel that way with Omori.
There are just some things from this game that affect this factor, which I will list right now:
1. The pacing was way too slow.
I don't mind when games are supposed to be slow and omori is a game that takes time to complete, but this one felt a bit too much.
That kind of hurts some moments of the game where sometimes i felt kind of bored and wanted something to happen, and this is not a game where I wanted to get bored at times, rather intrigued due to the story.
2. The game was a bit too easy.
Now, don't get me wrong, I get why this game was super hard, and hey, I am not saying games being easy makes the game overall worse, but I have to admit that it can hurt when replaying. At least for me.
3. Game was a bit too long.
I am not including extra content or other things to do here.
Sometimes it dragged way too long about things or certain sections just took an unnecessary amount of time to move on to another thing.
Again, I get why it's this way, but there was sometimes too much dialog, or some events could have been faster, yada yada.

These 3 things also can hurt the gameplay a bit, and gameplay is quite important for a game.
I also do not feel like the RPG part was something special, it's not bad tho, it works very well specially with the emotion system, but it's not amazing.
I would have liked if the side-quests also gave you ""better rewards"". Because sometimes they take the longest to complete, and is return sometimes they give you some clams that you could have gotten elsewhere or in a faster way. I am not saying I don't like them, they are a cool addition and a little extra, but they don't feel rewarding.

Gameplay and replayability is something I really care about, but that's pretty much the things I have against this game.
The rest of the game tho? It's amazing!

The story is perfect and original, there aren't a lot of games that speak about topics like phobia or depression in the way that Omori does, it's pretty unique in that department.
The characters are also perfect, there is absolutely nothing wrong with them, they are charmy, they are iconic and their designs are really cool.
The music is also insane! I see nobody talking about Omori's soundtrack but it fits both the RPG part and the topic that is covering, music is super important too and honestly, I wouldn't change a single track.
The style of the game is also really well done, mixing pixel-art with some realistic images and some anime-style drawings and characters was executed surprisingly well, specially for an RPG.
There is also quite a lot of stuff to do in this game, between side-quests, or secrets, or leveling up your party members, or getting some achievements. RPGs have a common flaw that is not having anything aside from the main story, so Omori doing this is a blast and I can see why 100% completing this game can be quite fun.

Overall, this was an incredible game and a great experience, specially the experience part that I would recommend.
It does suck that the bad things about it are kinda big for me, but if you do not mind them, you will think this game is amazing, and it is.
And for those saying this game is mid, no it's not mid.

RECOMMENDED!

The writing in this game is not convincing or engaging. Many features of the story felt very unbelievable (I don't mean the fantasy aspects, obviously). The characters don't act their ages and they don't have convincing reactions to the events they've gone through. They talk like characters in a children's cartoon, which is jarring for a game that deals with themes like suicide, mental illness and [spoiler]murder[/spoiler]. The different pieces of the game also didn't seem to add up to anything -- the whole thing felt like a collection of disparate elements that had nothing to do with each other. For how much story you actually get, there was a disproportionate amount of silly filler that wasn't entertaining (a lot of lame, forced humor) and didn't connect in any way to the real plot. All the side quests/plots are tedious and unrewarding.

I kept going because of the driving mystery (eventually skipping everything but the main plot actions), but in the end, the final reveal [spoiler]that Sunny killed his sister and he and Basil framed it as a suicide[/spoiler] made even less sense than the rest of the game. [spoiler]Why would Sunny, who never had any violent tendencies, suddenly do something like that? How and why did two twelve year olds come up with such a morbid deception? If it really was just an accident, why did they feel the need to present it as a suicide? How did anyone not notice that Mari's death was caused by blunt force trauma, not hanging? How did Basil manage to keep this a secret for four years?[/spoiler] The [i]reason[/i] for these events is largely left up to implication and only explained in some game data. [spoiler]But even given the explanation that Mari was putting too much pressure on Sunny before the recital, it was never shown that Mari's perfectionism had led to harsh treatment of anyone else.[/spoiler] 

It also feels like a major piece of the payoff is missing, since [spoiler]you don't get to see Aubrey, Kel and Hero's reactions to Sunny's revelation[/spoiler]. It's implied that [spoiler]they simply forgive him[/spoiler], which also rings hollow -- [spoiler]as sensitive, traumatized teenagers who have just been through serious emotional turmoil, it's likely that it would not be easy at all for them to adjust to this new understanding of events, even if they choose not to blame Sunny[/spoiler].

I don't know what to say. This game is indeed quite good. Not as insanely good as some say it is but still very good. Great soundtrack, decent gameplay (emotion system was neat but nothing that blew me away), and of course, the story. The disturbing underlying secret beneath the whole cutesy facade is what ACTUALLY makes me like the game as it has my favourite kind of horror.  A creeping horror that inexorably crawls up on you until the truth is slowly laid bare. My biggest complaint is the games pacing. It basically boils down to wandering around the dream world, something creepy happens, real life event, wandering around the dream world, something creepy happens, real life event, etc. At times it feels like some wacky thing happens for the sake of just giving you more game before you can have the next creepy bit revealed.
All in all, quite good and an easy recommendation. 8.7/10 I admit I shed a tear at the end but didn't full on cry like I did with mother 3.",1699044794,1699044794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The emotional rollercoaster that I felt while playing will be forever stuck in my heart. The sadness and fear from the perspective of the main characters are really well done in a way that I could see myself feeling the same thing. The love and friendship were really impactful as well, to the point of wishing I had a group of friends like that when I was a child ;u;
The goofiness accompanied by the visual and sound effects also made me laugh out loud most of the time (never thought I'd laugh from throwing things at a sad scarecrow - poor guy, I wish I could take him with me to explore the world)

I came back with a friend after a few months and we both thought it had a lot of great style, but leaned too far into absurdism (one of the supposed jokes in the beginning was about a nose talking to a leaf about a bunny...no punchline or context to pull it together, just random words together in a sentence), visuals for the sake of visuals, uneven pacing and definitely tonally uneven. The gameplay also seemed disjointed. There are no horror elements in the beginning. Instead, after 30 minutes of slice of life, absurdist, fluffy walking and reading text, the game then introduces battles. After 10 minutes the gameplay then shifts to that of an RPG Maker horror game, complete with a very telegraphed jump shock. I was having a very hard time holding interest both times I played, and by the time the turn based battles and horror aspects were introduced, I had a hard time being invested.

I did think the game had great style, especially with all of the hand drawn elements. I didn't think it all fit with the pixel style of the graphics however. I also thought there was some inventiveness in the combat with the different statuses, the positive and negative buffs in each, and how the statuses form a rock paper scissors weakness system. I also enjoyed all the tracks I heard.

This game has an overwhelming positive score and quite frankly I am very surprised. However it seems some thematic elements such as depression and suicide, as well as the art really resonated with most people who played it. It's possible that this game is just not for me, and that is fine, but I can't really recommend it to anyone.",1698902266,1698940382,False,5,0,0.445383548736572266,0,True,False,False

You ARE the main character. The main character IS you. You and the main character share the same mind. What you're thinking is what the MC is thinking. This game will make you think and feel what the MC is thinking and feeling. I can't explain how and why without spoiling the magic.

You may think MC is a non-verbal blank slate for the audience to project themselves on but that's far from the case. Despite being silent the whole game, MC is very well characterised and you'll have a very intimate understanding of him by the end.

Combat system is simple but allows for organic combos and strategies. Although, it is easy to find a winning strategy early on and stick with it for the whole game.

Wonderful artstyle all throughout with the exception of the pixel art which is okay and gets the job done and only excels on a few occasions. I wish more than just the main characters had dialogue portraits.

Some section go on for too long.

There's no quest log so you probably want to make your own real life notes about side quests and even the main story at some points.

When my patience was waning, I just had to wait until the next fight.  Combat is engrossing and engaging, supported by a banger soundtrack that makes you feel like, hell yeah!  This matters.  You'll find so many opportunities to mix-and-match strategies with a long line-up of skills and equipment pieces.  It really feels like you're playing as a team of friends, making the story feel all that more impactful.

It ruined my outlook on the game quite significantly as it sort of shit all over the character development that happens throughout the game [/spoiler].

It took me about 23hrs to clear with a few side quests completed, so I feel the pricing on it is fair and tbh this is my sweet spot for game length. I didn't feel like it dragged on at all, and it was long enough to explore things nicely. The music is a 10/10, art is 10/10, gameplay is a solid 8/10 and I'll recommend the game, but I have conflicted feelings about just how genuinely my recommendation is given how cheated I felt by it.

Music, art direction, gameplay, dialogue, and story are all amazing. Here I need to break my gripes into 2 sections, story and game gripes. For those avoiding spoilers, ill save you the time and say I got this at like a 5/10 for me personally. The final 3rd of the game just really ruined it for me. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone I personally know, but if you want a Horror JRPG with some badass music and dope combat give it a shot.

Gameplay: *Possible Spoils* The gameplay loop is Dream World (Bulk of the gameplay) into the Real World (Bulk of the Story). When I got to the 3rd Dream World section, the pacing really fell off for me personally. Its the longest of the DW segments and the back to back bosses was unnecessary. Everything else was fine and unique. 

STORY: *ABSOLUTELY SPOILERS DO NOT READ*

Ok so I know this will get hated, but what was that ending? Regardless of what Sunny did being on purpose or accident, why am I to feel bad for him. It really feels like the game wants me to justify his redemption due to all the ""trauma"" hes been dealing with. But what about the pain and suffering he inflicted upon basil? Not only did he put basil through the ""accident"", he hung his ""best friend' out to dry. What about the pain he caused to all of his friends? WHAT ABOUT THE FUCKING CAT? Most killers start off by killing helpless animals. Also makes sense because what is the most common enemy in SUNNY'S Dream...........bunnies. Completing this game gave me a heavy SH2, except trying to get me to justify James is a good guy.

THIS COULD ALL JUST BE HOW I INTERPRETED THE STORY! I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE DEEPS DIVES EVERYWHERE! This is just my raw feelings after just completing the game.

Part of me was expecting this game to play out the tradition of survival horror (simple puzzles and running away from things). Having played it now, I can say the turn-based combat is actually really fun :-)

Naturally, you have the option to grind, but i found that simply fighting the enemies encountered in your quests gives you more than enough xp (to comfortably fight bosses). While combat is not the sole feature of the game it does makes up for the majority of gameplay. Having unique combat themes for different locations really helps to build the atmosphere and it also stop the game from feeling repetitive. The sound design is crisp, consistent and varied, which I appreciate (and i also appreciate not listening to something that makes my ears bleed jrpg fans if u know u know). Also, the bosses have unique personalities and the casual dialogue with them helps to break away from all the seriousness.

Visually, the game's art style is simple but at times really beautiful. I found myself admiring even the really simple things (like potted plants?!). Each area has its own terrain palette and theme, and the homes that house the npcs all have intricate details that give them subtle character. There are also some cut scenes that feature hand drawn animations, these are all beautifully illustrated by omocat and hold the game's melancholic undertone.

I used to follow omocat's Tumblr so I've actually been a fan of their work for a while now, and when I first heard about the game I was really excited for it. Some time has passed since but I'm really glad I decided to give this game a shot. I've only completed one of the endings so far but I look forward to replaying the game.

The characters are charming and likable, and the story is full of twists and turns that keep you engaged and invested. Overall, I would give Omori a 10/10, and would recommend it to fans of RPG games or anyone looking for something a bit different and quirky. OwO"" (no idea why the OWO was added lol)

The reason why I'm giving a negative review are the following:

1. The console versions which released over a year ago, had some extras for an alternative route in the game, which have not yet been patched into the steam version.

2. The xbox version, the only version with said extra content was pulled from the xbox store for some unknown reason. If you only have a PC, you cant play the extra stuff.
Again, if you only care for the story and not the gameplay, this doesnt really matter.

But 3. The xbox version was the only one, which had a perfect german translation, no other version, even for other consoles, are available in german.

It has been month and there has been no update what so ever (the microsoft support confirmed that it was pulled by the Developer and that they are working on it).

This lack of communication is, first and foremost, extremely frustrating, not understandable  and unprofessional.

Again, the game is a masterpiece, but play it on console if you can.",1668797212,1697560488,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Something I could feel and that was proven during replaying was the lack of QOL for certain things. Especially not being able to skip some bits that can drag, and the game structure that is quite punishing for some achievements if you didn't plan for it.

What I really loved on the other hand, and that were still fun on the third/fourth time, were the bosses. It all meshes really well, the emotions mechanic merging with the character of the bosses, their banger theme, and their moves. It wasn't just battles, but experiencing them.

During most of the story, I had a small fear that I would be disappointed by the resolution somehow, but when reaching it I was conquered.

The gameplay might be simple, but the battles are fun in their way of using a sort of stance dynamic through emotions. It's deeper than expected, although making it tend on the easy side but I don't mind that at all.

The art style is also something I really enjoy, something with childish substance made with skill. This game is quite clever with a good amount of fun and integrated references.

The game was endearing and the combat worked well for me, it was worth experiencing.

(SPOILERS!!!! IF YOU HAVENT PLAYED IT DO THAT)

ok, genuinely this game is by far my favorite, its way of handling horror in such an unsettling way is immaculate, and how it shows headspace starting to crumble as soon as sunny goes outside and sees his friends again is incredible. I love how it shows how omori is trying to 'keep sunny safe' by leading the party off their quest to rescue basil by creating whole new areas when sunny overcomes his phobias. I absolutely love how at the end of the game basil has become erased from headspace and from everyone's memories and how kel goes to the length of kicking basils flower crown into the void in humphery because he didnt know it belonged to basil. The foreshadowing for this is awesome from the cut scenes where we see aubrey and kel attempt to draw basil but cant recall exactly how he looks, as well has the scenes in humphrey where we see their memory of him dissapear. I have not played any of the omori or neutral routes as of writing this, so i can't speak on them, but the ending for the true route is amazing and i love how omocat left how the group reacted to sunny telling them the truth about mari up to interpretation. i love all of the visual and sound design for this game as it made it very fun and exciting for me, not to mention how much i would dance around my room during battles because the music was so good (im looking at you, world's end valentine). this game is wonderful and i love it with all my heart. i am so so glad that i went into this game blind because it just made it so much more emotional and personal. i cannot say this enough but this is my absolute favorite game ever. 10/10",1691954480,1697245379,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The first time I played this game was on game pass, and I sobbed the whole way through. I loved it so much that I had to buy it here and play through it again half a year later. This game is a piece of art. Its characters are super well written and loveable. The visuals are cryptic, vibrant, and calming, and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal.

The gameplay is simple, yet closely linked to the story and its themes. I think it is safe to say that its comparable to any turn based rpg (like Earthbound and Undertale)

The visual art when battling foes is quite stunning. It always looks like the main protagonist drew it with coloured pencils. 

The soundtrack is perfect and captures the situation it wants to paint to the player. I still listen to it in my day to day life. I plan to also buy it so I can keep it in my music collection. 

But most of all, the story is the strongest aspect of the game. For me, it achieved in trying to convey what the main character felt and it was highly emotional. Fear, despair, loneliness, grief and others. I was not a joy ride, but it was one that I am proud to have seen through the end...

EDIT:  Okay, now that I have sufficient time and distance from finishing the game for the first time, I can offer a more expanded opinion.

I left this game feeling hollowed out and as though I will never play it again. This is because I got what is widely considered the Good Ending, and it broke my heart. But don't mistake me: This game is a masterpiece.

What tons of modern media attempts (and fails) to convey, Omori manages. Through music, color application, and player choices, Omori so clearly expresses what it's like to lose oneself. Often it does this with bright pastels, wacky characters, and dreamworld logic. You find yourself thinking, ""This is so cute! What is that?"" Charmed by the absurdity, the painful parts are *more* painful. The terrifying parts? Anxiety-inducing. I left this game sympathizing with characters I never thought I'd sympathize with, for actions I still don't completely understand, even though the outcome of those actions was genuinely distressing for me, the player.

Omori wrestles with huge emotions, and it does it through a pixelated, nostalgic lens. I walked in without exposure to any of the spoilers, and I was completely unprepared for the way it crushed my heart in my chest.",1695521348,1697021276,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

[spoiler]I, too, accidentally damaged my friendships because I had fallen too deep into my own sulking and isolated myself, without realizing that the extent of my self hatred ended up affecting my friends too and they didn't deserve that. But I guess it's not easy to be a good friend when your mind is too busy creating a parallel reality where time doesn't pass and also trying to convince you to end your life.[/spoiler] Hopefully this time with the help of my therapist, my life might get better :3
ok enough venting on steam wtf what a loser sorry but this game is important to me, now here's an actual review: 

[b]pros: BEAUTIFUL artstyle, compelling story, lovely characters (some better than others...) fun gameplay (well I'm a rpg fan so I might be biased) 

cons: omocat didn't milk her beautiful artstyle in this platform by adding trading cards/points shop items, so I can't buy and wear an animated Kel avatar like god intended me to. That sucks... [/b]

Not many games manage to pull off this fine balance. The combat isn't amazing, the graphics are clearly made on RPG maker, and the game has a couple of annoying bugs. Yet none of that really matters. This game will take you on a wild ride exploring yours and Omori's psyche. 

Be warned though that aspects of this game are incredibly dark and as such this game might not be for everyone. I wouldn't classify it as a horror but it's a hell of a psychological thriller.

Many people have compared this game to Undartale, and I can see why. The mechanics and the the style of the story are quite similar (both so serious and absurd at the same time). And just like Undertale, Omori demands hours of playtime and makes you want play it again and again.

I mean, the game is quite long and it feels like it shouldn't be that way. And there's a lot to keep in mind, which is kinda hard since the game switches between two worlds, with every turn taking enough time to forget what you did before you switched. And also, there's a lot of emotions to deal with, a whole spectrum of them, starting with happy (also sad and angry if yk what I mean) moments, finishing with uncertainty and confusion about some of the characters' stories.

All these points are kinda controversial, I know, and I totally wouldn't recommend this game for everyone. The thing I liked the most was digging through the stories of characters, their motifs (are there any motifs for something you didn't mean to do?), feelings , thoughts and I could keep this list going. This game gave me space for thinking, which is why I liked it. It just feels good to do some thinking from time to time, you know. Like, would I act the same way? Would I feel the same? Why did it happen like that? What could it mean? Stuff like that. I also enjoyed finding little secrets (it implies backtracking, which I enjoyed too, it had its little details), thinking through battle tactics and hoarding. Plus, I don't mind some grind, so there's that.

Art and soundtrack are judged subjectively, but I liked those a lot, it's simple yet it fits so perfectly. I'm into this kind of aesthetic, so yeah, that counts too.

And I know the line of thought in my review is scattered all over the place, so as my thoughts about this game. I started playing it 3 times, 2 of them I quickly lost interest, the 3rd time I'm finally close to finishing it. At least I think so. Would've I lost a lot, if I hadn't played it? I don't think so. Would I recommend it? Yes, somewhat as a piece of culture, if I may say so. It's something that you should play and think through for yourself. The story was quite controversial for me, I don't agree on some things, I don't believe some things, but it made me think a lot. Give it a try, maybe you'll like it.

This game will unveil truths and thoughts about yourself that you might've never even known existed, and you can never forget. There is no turning back after you play this game. 

By this point, I've played a fair share of games dealing with mental illnesses/psychological horror, but I don't think any game is able to grasp it as well as Omori. It steadily and subtly introduces new horrors to the player, but most of the time, not in a way that feels forced or ""jumpscare-y"".

This is probably the best game I've played in the past 5 years. The art style is one of the most creative and recognizable art style's I've seen (I'm also a bit of biased in the form of pixel art, so I understand if not everyone likes that). In addition, I don't think most of the horror/emotional parts of this game would hit so hard if it wasn't for the music. The entire soundtrack has a mix of action/happy/nostalgic/depressing songs, with some songs in particular managing to achieve multiple emotions at once (something I find quite rare in music). The gameplay, for the most part, is pretty standard for a turn-based RPG. Furthermore, I never really found it too difficult (I never got a game over in my first run). That being said, Omori has it's own unique elements that make fighting enemies a lot more fun and creative.

The theme and writing of this game is unlike anything I've seen before, but I want to leave this mostly spoiler free (and trust me this is way better when you know little about it going into it), so I wont be diving deep into that.

For me, the BEST strength of this game are its music and sound design. Everything you hear fits perfectly with the vibe the game is going for in the given moment. But the art and story are also FANTASTIC. On a second playthrough, I find the story in particular to be a lot more detailed than I first realized. A lot of thought went into how things are presented to you and why they are presented to you that way.

The RPG element is pretty unique too, though I found that aspect of the game got a little tedious halfway through my playtime. Luckily, you shouldn't really need to grind that much... unless you're playing to get all the Steam achievements.

Not a good game to play when you're not in a good headspace, they aren't exaggerating the content warnings. I wouldn't call anything in the game that ""visually graphic"", although it's a pretty mentally heavy game all around. 

Really, it's a lovely game that covers themes that include having relationships with friends and family, growing up, and facing the things you are afraid of. You'll finish the game with a strong desire to go hang out with your friends.",1690598469,1696263865,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I was looking forward to the segments set in the real world and white space. But if that's what you're playing the game for, it just isn't worth playing the game. Very little time is spent in those segments, and they don't reveal much.  To enjoy the game you have to basically treat the story about the protagonist's trauma as an unimportant C-plot happening in the background.

You need to be thoroughly focused on what's happening in the otherworld, which is not much: You're searching for this character named Basil. You explore an area, sit through goofy Undertale-style comedy stalling antics, do some very easy RPG combat, and the characters say ""welp, Basil's not here, let's go check the next area"". That's the otherworld plot and you'll be spending 95% of the game doing that.

The otherworld plot tries to mimic Undertale, but the devs don't seem to understand what made Undertale work. Undertale antagonists have a personal reason why they're trying to stop the protagonist, and the touching moments involve the protagonist in some way. Omori antagonists are just random characters who show up to harass the protagonist for no reason in particular. I do some unimportant quest for a few hours, this character just suddenly attacks me, and then says ""Yeah I have no idea where Basil is. Okay bye."" Several grueling hours later I'm still looking for Basil, have gained no new information, and the antagonist maybe had a nice moment with their own friends that had nothing to do with the protagonist at all. This is just stalling the plot for nothing.

It isn't doing something subtextual, and while things in the otherworld are certainly modeled after the real world, they don't really symbolize anything. I.E., a place in the otherworld is named after a place in the real world, that's all. The otherworld segments are not saying anything deeper than that. The game has some interesting ideas with the emotion mechanics and follow-up attacks, but it's pretty basic, you don't have to be trying much at all.

As for the real-world story about the protagonist, it's more stalling. The prologue gives you almost nothing. After several grueling hours, the end of chapter 1 finally reveals some things about what's happening with the protagonist and his relationships to the other characters, but it features even more characters showing up to attack you for no reason and speaking but giving no info before leaving, just to pad the game time. While it does finally tell you something at that point, it's hard to even be invested in what's happening with Basil in the real world. The times you ""save"" him from the bullies... he was actually just harassing them in the park and they were yelling at him to leave them alone... then I guess to show that they're bad people, they attack you for no reason when you show up. And then after four more hours, the end of chapter 2 gives you literally nothing - it just repeats the same plot points it showed you after chapter 1. No new information has been introduced, and it totally skips whitespace in a cutscene. Four hours of gameplay and nothing about the plot has changed whatsoever.

My main complaint is that some sections feel boring and drawn out. Sections with comparably little interesting in way of gameplay or lore happening. They dont happen that often but often enough to were you start to notice boredom set in, especially if you dont come from a RPG maker game background which frankly arent known for their amazing gameplay. 
The game does have an interesting combat mechanic it introduces called ""emotions"", but sadly it falls flat since most enemys, including bosses, are too easy to offer any sort of challenge and dont make good use of this. 
The lack of challenge helped add to the overall boredom that quickly began to set in during later stages. Especially since fighting random goons felt more like a chore than anything else and running away from those encouters became mandatory to eliviate their annoyance.
Side mission vary in enjoyabilty, plenty of them are fetch quests but plenty of them are not.
At the same time the side characters themselves are pretty cool and add to the the overall charming atmosphere ""Headspace"" has.

Still, the Artstyle/Music and Setting carry the game heavily.

In the dream world, the story is all over the place and dialogue felt like it was written by a middle schooler, which might be what they were going for, but i just found myself dragging through story and characters i just didn't care about, like the shark guy and the pink princess. The real world segment was incredibly enjoyable though, and i found the contrast between the dream world and the real world really appealing. The story touches on some dark topics like depression, regret, fear and self hatred and the game managed to pull it together really well. Overall 9/10, the story is incredible, although the repetitive gameplay loop stops the game from being a 10/10 in my opinion.",1695795647,1695795647,True,0,0,0.493421047925949097,0,True,False,False

I bought this game on a whim because a girl I had a crush on mentioned it in passing. Initially, I didn't think much - I'd blow through the first few hours, enough to start a conversation about it. What happened next fundamentally changed my life. OMORI is, without hyperbole, the single greatest, most ecstatically beautiful, unabashedly charming, heart-wrenching piece of art I have ever experience. The overwhelmingly positive score this game has does it a disservice - it is not good, it is not great. It is without flaw. Every pixel and every second of this game was an emotional and visual thrill. The scenes, the characters, the music, the story - all of these things have fundamentally altered every major aspect of my life. When I finished this game, I took a good ten minutes just to sob at my desk. In a time where people are finding themselves alone, uninspired, and existentially lost, this game shines through. OMORI is what the world needs. I know this 100 percent sounds like meatriding, and I get it. But play this game, and you'll understand.

Its an amazing experience in anyway that I look at it. The art and art direction is beautiful and will always keep up to match the game's themes, the soundtrack I could listen on loop, the characters are charming and the writing wanted me to interact with every little thing in the world.

Im a fan of RPGs and I never found the combat to be lacking, the emotions mechanic had me planning what skills the characters should use and it felt very rewarding.

Omori's art and combat are really great, but that wasnt what kept me coming back to the game. The story is phenomenal, which has probably been said by a thousand other players, but its true. It did feel confusing at time, but im 99% sure it was intentional. The story isnt exactly spelled out for you, so when it clicks it felt really good. 

To simply put it, this game is amazing and I love it.

OMORI has something for the casuals and the masochists. some achievements are incredibly grindy, time-consuming, or rng-based. however, a casual or non-completionist player can just avoid these, which i would definitely recommend at least on your first play-through. 

i would recommend OMORI to anyone in the right headspace, regardless of their background in video games. it is very user friendly and easy to pick up. there are challenges, too, if you wish to seek them out. much love, and thank you OMOCAT and all the wonderful folks that brought this project to fruition",1671763772,1695614832,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1) Story-focused RPG - less emphasis on combat and more on exploring the world and interacting with its characters, but still has a combat system that feels nice to use (in my opinion).
2) Godly soundtrack. Not every song will make you get up off your chair and start dancing, but they all have a place. If a song comes off as particularly grating or annoying to you, it's probably intentional.
3) Interesting and engaging story. Has a compelling narrative that still leaves the player room to fill in the blanks with their own imagination. Works well with the 'find-it-yourself' manner of uncovering the story in the first place.
4) Pleasant art style that is expertly manipulated to fit vastly different situations.
Be aware before purchasing the game for yourself or others that it contains references to and/or depictions of: self-harm, gore, suicide, mental illness, and embarassing childhood friends that you can't seem to get to leave you alone.

I haven't 100%'d it yet, but I'm gonna finally stop waiting to write this review. I already did everything there is to do on the console release and I certainly plan to 100% this version of the game as well.
This is one of the greatest games ever made. Genuinely, the only story in any video game to genuinely bring me to tears. It is absolutely beautiful and it's depictions of trauma and grief are absolutely incredible, as you get to see more than 1 side of both. You get to understand how all the characters grieve for their lost friend and you get to see the differences between how SUNNY and BASIL handled their traumatic experience. The only thing I can even slightly complain about is the gameplay, which is boring and repetitive once you've figured it out. I highly recommend installing mods to increase the difficulty/add more diversity in how you play the game.

Omori is a masterpiece no doubt and the story is just amazing, the way you get thrown in right away and be playing the game thinking everything is fine and you are just living your best life as Omori... 

Then after the first time you wake up in Sunnys bed I realised that thinking ""everything is fine"" is very wrong and now I was stuck on creating the wildest szenarios in my head...

The further I progressed I thought ""wow... I am so excited to collect all the letters and finally find out about the true story but im quite sure i figured out like 80% of the story myself""

Omori gives a remarkable projection to the sorrows of life, from the lens of innocence and vulnerability. It뗩 not one that is easy, but it뗩 one that is sincere. This game had me both deeply terrified and sad, but all at the same time, more compelled to continue. Not many have this capability.

[h2]Rating: 5/5[/h2]
[h3]Music: 5/5[/h3]

[h3]Gameplay: 4/5[/h3]
- Fun & deep turn-based combat
- Exploration through an open world that is pretty much always rewarding
- Has surprises on how different systems can be recontextualized

[h3]Graphics: 5/5[/h3]
(idk how they could be any better)

[h3]Story: 6/5[/h3]
- Interesting & lovable characters
- [b]I have never felt emotions from any media as strong as I have felt from this game[/b]
- Funny
(Not really spoilers, but whatever)
- [spoiler]Multiple layers to everything that kinda like interweave and interact with each other in crazy ways that you don't expect yet make sense[/spoiler] 
- [spoiler]Multiple endings[/spoiler] 
- [spoiler]Ends up being also realistic to what its trying to portray[/spoiler] [spoiler](PTSD)[/spoiler] 
- Its just great

[h3]Length/Price[/h3]
- >30 hours of content for me (I did like 2/3 the side quests)
- I would think it would have been worth if it were 40 or even 50 bucks

[h3]Criticisms:[/h3]
- Occasionally it wants you to do a specific thing, but (very rarely and for really not that long) your not sure & you end up going in circles or doing backtracking
- Basic movement is a little bit boring, but doesn't matter most of the time and is only a problem because of above
- Saving only happens a certain locations, not when you close the game. There are plenty check points in most places, but can be a tinge of annoyance
- I am a person who has a real hard time understanding extended metaphors & this game has a lot of them & does a much better job than 90% of other things with them. However the last couple hours of the game get a little more 'abstract' (not a bad thing & necessary for what it is trying todo) and I was only able to partly (mostly) follow along. If your a normal person then you should have no issue
- This game sucked my life away and from the point I started to the point I finished, all I could think about was this game (I will probably continue to for a couple days into the future too)

That is literally all of my criticisms. Everything else is perfect. And each item is really small, they are only keeping the game from a 6/5.

The story is amazing, and is only further perfected by the emotional music and the incredible characters who you can easily get attached to. The game is $20, but it is absolutely worth every dollar. I highly recommend playing this game without looking anything up as to avoid spoilers because nothing beats that first playthrough where you don't know what's coming next.

A brust of wholesomeness came into the room
Suddenly we started the old gang just like the old manner

And kids they be
Play hide and seek
But then one of them just flee 
And a black hole they all see

What doki doki it might be
Cause years passed by a blink of a second
And nobody see it happen
And the protag changed never
And as always as ever
Flirting with death it seams that
Someone take the knife before someone he hurts
And now i might just finished the song
Cause this is just until where I'm gone
Well i just got a little bit inspired from nowhere
I might had to finish the review with the song but whatever.
The game is kinda boring i understand the all depression thing
And the all childhood world building
And then they came to the staff teens
And started to compare characters

But the game is very dragged out
And they both even trying to hidden it
Just a simple 'mixtape got lost'
Become an hour of searching the trash 
Cause""it might be useful""
And then they even pull a bigger prank at you and you have recycle each piece of trash manually by yourself

And they didn't used this time for . Idk
Building characters
Or atleast enhancing characters

Or something

The game also have the classic formula of touch every thing at the screen cause it might be connected to the progression

Also bumbust you with an uncountable amount of quests witch doesn't say a thing

And it sad cause the game really having an insain potential""style-isticlly""
Some of the most unique I've seen with its imagery and visuals
But it sad to see what it really showed so far

To be continued (most likely)



Omori review part two although what I've wrote in part one I've came to appreciate the game much more especially the combat system
Combat systemticlly speaking is completely unique
With the emotion system which have a great statistical depth and it's just overall very rewarding to really learn the system and to figure out a very specific way to defeat the mobs and especially the bosses which took you a long time
And there's the skills which coming into this which make it more deep with hero which healing the gang with his magical cookies or omori just basically denote who the enemy will attack with his grooseum hands
And on top of that the ""spacial attach system""
(I really don't know how to call it)
Now you have to also think where you gonna invest your points and with ten of them you will be able
(If none of your gang friends became toast that is)
To unleash a super duper attack that uses the power of friendship to do buzzilion damage
But the grind might not be worth it

But sadly after all of that greatness i awarded the game's combat with
I still think the story ain't really good
The only way i could describe it by it was a favorite child and a very talented one
But he was abandoned young and because he got a little messed up and messy

I know there's a great thing about emotion here but didn't really got any indeed in it

All i can hope is i will when finished the game that I'll connect to the characters better
Like... I like the characters but can't really relate to them and ain't freaking too much of a depths in them
Just likes them cause all of the wholesome staff happening

Ohh BDW in wholesomeness the game's top tier

The side quest stuff were very random, and there were many times where I kept asking myself if what I'm doing was even relevant to the main plot. It was very mentally exhausting to explore and progress through the game, so I could only play up to around 2 hours at a time.

The fight with the 3 tentacle sisters was kinda sus

->P L O T
The player assumes the role of Omori, the alter ego of a teenager. The world is split in two sides: Faraway Town represents reality, while HeadSpace (as the name suggests) is an imaginary place, Omori's escape from reality. The story follows Omori and his friends on their journey to find someone missing, oscillating back to the teenager's reality and so forth. The main themes and motives include friendship, family, grief, redemption, anxiety, depression, suicide ( and many others ofc). 

As a depressed fellow myself, there were many aspects of the story I related to on a deeply personal level. Regardless, I find that the story can be appealing to just about anyone, as it is a wonderful mix between wholesome and disturbing( on a psychological level). OMORI combines joy and sorrow, tangling these two polar concepts successfully!

( TLDR: This game will heal your poor little heart and then stomp on it with no hesitation. Then heal it again and repeat the process. You will ugly cry for hours)

-> G A M E P L A Y
The lengthyyyyyyyyyyyy duration of the game is no worry as it keeps the player entertained with lots of fun and exciting mini side quests (optional) , as well as diverse foes (some cuter than others) to challenge using your own skills, weapons, charms and so on. Grinding is possible but definitely not necessary to advance. Difficulty is easy to medium, any foe can be defeated with a bit of planning and strategy, if none at all,  in this humble stranger's opinion. Even after finishing the game, I intend to play again knowing there are still loooooooooots of things to do and discover.

(TLDR: Very fun, will keep u constantly entertained. Friendly for noobs like myself)

->G R A P H I C S
Stunning. Fantastic. Amazing. Spectacular. Marvelous. Splendid. Excellent.
I was captivated by the charming 8 bit pixel style, as well as the hand drawn sketchbook visuals. Wonderful use of colors (or lack of when necessary). 

(TLDR: Pretty af)

-> M U S I C
The soundtrack of OMORI has become my favorite after finishing the game. It has everything from catchy playful tunes to heartbreaking sounds of piano and violin. I find it hard to describe music with words, but in terms of feelings the soundtracks adjusted to them accordingly. I have never felt so disturbed by ominous and eerie music before. It makes you feel....the sound of emptiness. Of course, heartwarming joy, happiness, or relief is also present when needed.

(TLDR: It's like a shawarma with everything. That everything being every emotion on the spectrum)

-> P R I C E 
Maybe not the most student friendly at first, but after playing, I can proudly say that i would use my entire life savings on this game if I could. Omocat, please take all my peasant money.

->C O N C L U S I O N S
Overall, this game was a 10/10 for me, I have nothing but praise for the work put into it. 
It is heavy mentally, so I advise being careful before playing. It triggered unpleasant memories in me, but even so, OMORI has a special place in my heart after such an impact. It was really wholesome and funny, bringing a smile to my face while playing. There is a high probability that the game will change your perspective in life. Thank you, OMORI, for showing such raw, pure, nostalgic and infantile emotions to me, taking me back to an uncensored past and back again in the reality where my life goes on, but grows from every memory I have created. 

And THANK YOU, kind reader, for reaching the end of my review. I wish I could re experience OMORI, but I hope you have/had as much of a special experience with this game as I did :) .

P.S. I strongly advise you to have a couple packs of tissues prepared before playing. Have fun dear <3

As a matter of fact, they are a necessity to remind individuals such as myself to forgive ourselves, trust ourselves, love ourselves and simply remember that our mistakes, imperfections and scars don't define the rest of our lives and who we are. To be able to deliver such strong messages is no easy task, but Omori just nails it splendidly; Although this game starts its storytelling process with a bang and there's lots of tension, mystery and suspension there right from the beginning, Omori takes it time beautifully to build everything up and prepare you for one of the most gut-wrenching endings in video games history. The shift between the tones of the more lighthearted parts of the game and the bleak and scary parts is the magic of the storytelling of Omori. Yes, all the sweet details here and there and the metaphorical and environmental storytelling is great, but what makes Omori unforgettable is the hard hitting dose of protagonist's real life in contrast of all the cute moments in Omori's universe or all the funny interactions between the gang... It just gets you.
Not wanting to give away much about the story, let's move on to the gameplay! There's a lot to unpack here! There's this unique and interesting take on jrpg's turned based combat style in which offers you some new mechanics that are really fun to play around with. At the beginning of the game, the combat might seem a little confusing to the players who are not that familiar with turned based combat systems, but there's no need to worry cause the game does a great job at explaining the mechanics to the player. Just remember that if you want the combat to remains challenging. avoid grinding... Specially at Orange Oasis' Pyramid; You can just fly to the maximum level there. Aside from the combat there are many of puzzles and some mini games to keep things fresh and more fun, but not all of them are right there in front of you; Keep an eye open for these rewarding experiences.
AND what can I say about the gorgeous eye candy art-style and character design of Omori that hasn't been said thousands of times before? The visuals are one of the two most important selling points of this game. You just gotta see everything for yourself.

I pirated this game before and then I made a decision to buy it after finishing the game because Omocat deserves my money.

Never has there been a game that has managed to make me tear up like Omori. 
The writing is excellent, the gameplay is basically like any other JRPG, the art style is such a vibe, packed with content and whatever.

The biggest flaw of this game is how easy it is to lose track what you're supposed to do in the real world part.

however, that is not what this game is. it's also gonna make u feel afraid, deeply sad, upset, maybe even hatred. an incredibly important part of OMORI is that those experiences are inseparable and inescapable, but also not inherently at odds. the one critique i have is that at times the two aspects of the game sometimes do feel at odds with each other, as if you are switching between two different games. however, OMORI always is able to draw you back into the fact that it is both and make you feel happy, uneasy, afraid and brave all at once. if you're prepared for some fucked up stuff, and love quirky RPGs, it's a must play.",1681851583,1694125939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

there is so much to do. U can either just go along with the game or do side quests and stuff ( trust me, theres a LOT )
if u like unexpected things, pixel graphics, AMAZING story and uniqueness, THEN WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???? GO BUY IT
but in all seriousness the soundtrack is AMAZING, the story is immaculate, the stuff u can do are endless
i recommend going in blind ( as in not having watched any tutorials or playthroughs )
u should never use the wiki ( or have to use it ) and please don't too, its much better when not knowing what to do and just going along. I recommend picking up anything and everything that goes along ur way.

It's difficult to explain the wide range of emotions I experienced throughout my playthrough, because it made me think and reminisce about everything that has ever been in my life thus far. I consider myself a person that is never truthful about how he truly feels and someone who never shares their feelings and thoughts, I am someone who doesn't cry in front of others and never complains about how bad it is, and that's fine because that's just the way I had to grow up to survive.

I've never played a video game that has made me just sit back and [b] really [/b] think about everything that has led me up to this point in time. Many memories resurfaced again, it made me think about the childhood that I never had, friends that I could never get, things I never got to experience, about someone that was special to me, and about people that have long left the world. 

It all made me realize how truly miserable I feel, because I've always believed that I was numb to everything, but the reality is that I was feeling so much to the point where I've had to subconsciously numb myself to run away from it. I think the reason the game resonated so much with me is because I saw myself in Sunny, because we aren't really that different, we both locked ourselves away and shut out the whole world in order to protect ourselves and cope with the pain.

Throughout the game while playing as Sunny, I was trying to right his wrongs and guide him down a better path, because in a way it felt like I was trying to fix my younger self while also making sure that Sunny doesn't end up the way I did. I've felt constant anguish ever since finishing the game and even now while writing this wall of text I still feel the same. I cannot help but think about the past that could've been and wishing that things could've gone differently. 

People always talk about seeing the light at the end of the tunnel and how things get better, but my approach to life has always been to just try and be comfortable living in the dark, because it doesn't get better. But if there was a way to start life all over again then I would gladly take that chance, the things I would give just to be able to go back and have the things that I never got, like being a kid and have a chance at a normal life while being surrounded with love and having tons of friends to hangout with without having a single care in the world. 

But it's too late for that.

(i have about 500 hours on the switch plus hours of research. i know, a waste of my life.) blackspace though its meant for the repressed memories hidden away for sunny to forget, is meant to be dark.. though yet there are some jokes in there that unexpected such as encountering omoli. though you must do a specific task before being able to talk to him it ends up (in my opinion) being perfect.

the story is about a boy named sunny, a hikkiomori who is moving away in three days, you have the option to either stay as a shut in or go out and connect with your friends, attempting to make up the past 4 years you have been staying inside. after a tragic accident it scarred him so he resorted to bottling up his feeling and sleeping and having dreams about before the incident happened. Most of the game takes place in headspace. i cant explain more than this before i start bringing up other topics. just play the game.

[b] In the language of flowers, it symbolizes the phrase [/b]
[b] ""My thoughts will follow you into your dreams. [/b]
[hr][/hr]
August 26, 2023, a night of indelible memories and a dawn that shall forever remain unexpunged from the corridors of my mind, accentuated by the mellifluous serenade of birdsong outside my window, juxtaposed against the ineffable tears tracing their paths down my visage. On this date, I completed [b] OMORI [/b] for the first time.

[b] This game, profoundly, embraced my soul. [/b]

I pen down these words while reflecting upon each nook and cranny of my soul that [b] OMORI [/b] has touched, gently yet unabashedly. The fingers that grace my keyboard now are the very ones that aspire to caress the melodies of ""Duet"" on the most delicate of pianos and violins. Even though my vision is blurred by tears that could form rivers, never before have I perceived with greater clarity the message this game aims to convey, in the most exquisite manner I have ever witnessed.

The beauty intrinsic to this game is a concept that eludes my capacity for expression, given the deeply personal and intricate impact it has evoked within me. The most intriguing fact is that, on a personal note, I've always been passionate about writing. However, [b] OMORI [/b] has proven to me that words often fall short in capturing such significant moments. In addition, an enduring passion of mine has perpetually been photography, owing to the profound ability it confers upon us to encapsulate moments within the unfathomable expanse of time. In the pulchritudinous universe of [b] OMORI, [/b] however, the art of photography beckoned me into a cycle of unbroken introspection before my mirror, compelling me to inquire into the very essence of my emotions and thoughts.

[b] OMORI [/b] prompted me to revisit a vital query pertaining to the continuity of our existence concerning what we can express, in its raw and unadulterated form, as human beings: 

[b] What constitutes art? [/b]

Art, that effervescent alchemy of the human spirit, stands as the purest manifestation of our pursuit of transcendence. It does not merely interlace pigments or sculpt forms; rather, it is the language of the soul, unveiling the concealed mysteries of our inner world.

In [b] OMORI, [/b] as exemplified by the duality between Headspace and Faraway Town, art in the form of expression confronts us with reality and dreams, often concurrently. It presents the hues of the heart and the nuances of our deepest aspirations. Every brushstroke, every note, every line traced is a glimpse of our being, an invitation to delve into the mosaic of human emotions.

Through this art, we embark upon realms that elude the grasp of time. The creations are not mere artifacts; rather, they are gateways ushering us into realms of contemplation and connection. The dance of colors on a canvas, the evocative melody of a song (The notes of [b] OMORI's [/b] soundtrack reside eternally in my heart as evidence of immortality), the silent narrative of a sculpture  all these are intimate dialogues, resonating with the echoes of our innermost thoughts.

In the most profoundly personal sense, [b] OMORI [/b] has been, is, and will continue to be a journey of self-discovery, an introspection that surpasses the superficial and delves into the depths. Art unveils layers of our psyche that often lie unexplored. It challenges us to confront our fears, our hopes, our emotional scars. And, in doing so, it aids us in embracing and comprehending our very [i] humanity. [/i]

[b] OMORI [/b] has taught me that art is the poetry of our existence, translating the nuances of life into forms that elude the limitations of language. It enables us to scream in silence, to smile with tears in our eyes, and to dance on the wings of imagination. In every stroke, there is a sigh; in every hue, an echo of the heart. It is the dance of life and soul intertwined, a testament that we are more than flesh and bone - we are the very essence of expression.

This game has not solely imparted to me insights into the resplendent concept of art through my personal interpretation and experience, but has also become a haven for an inquiry that arises as a contemplative quandary for all individuals who dare to cast a fleeting glance upon that which, in its profound essence, finds refuge within our souls: 

[b] What truly defines love? [/b]

The response pertaining to the aforementioned subject guides us towards an answer that intertwines with a question: 

Can [b] art [/b] truly encapsulate the essence of [b] love [/b] within its definition?

[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] forgiveness. [/i]
[b] Love [/b] embodies [i] hope. [/i]

If, by means of simple words, we are able to encapsulate the expansiveness of this concept, then in culmination, I write:

[b] OMORI [/b] is an art form.
[b] OMORI [/b] is a manifestation of love (hope).
[b] OMORI [/b] is the embodiment of the artistry of learning to love and forgive oneself.

This game is a fragment of my love.
If you, specifically you who knows that you are you, are reading this, I hope you always find the significance beyond the lexicality of ""less than"" to ""hash"".

If you, reader, have perused this review, which has functioned as an endeavor to articulate an array of ruminations and sentiments dwelling within my soul through the conduit of writing, until its ultimate culmination, my aspiration is that it has stirred a resonance within you.

If you find yourself adequately poised for this, play [b] OMORI. [/b]
[b] P.S. [/b] However, I want it to be clear that this game is [b] not [/b] for everyone; it is exceptionally unique in how it addresses sensitive subjects.

In the event that your decision leads you to embark upon this experience:
I sincerely hope you uncover the depth of conceptualizing your own unique [i] humanity [/i] throughout this game, one that has reached the depths of my soul in a manner beyond adequate articulation, I aspire for it to similarly resonate with your own being.

The technical lexicon of a meticulous analysis of this game can never truly equate to its abstraction. 
Words would never suffice, regardless of the allowed character limit.

No game has been, is or ever will be like [b] OMORI. [/b]

Remember, we do not transcend our fears by obliterating them, but by embracing them in coexistence. We must acquire the art of self-forgiveness and extend that forgiveness to the world that surrounds us.

The writing I did has only one goal: to make a conclusion of my own thoughts and emotions that came up in my mind throughout playing this game.

I came to Omori as a normal, mentally stable fellow, without that many sad and depressing thoughts before playing. I consider myself a person who will never complain to somebody about my emotions and thoughts. I'll never cry to anyone and will never say how bad I'm feeling; that's okay for me. I never had depression and expected nothing from this game. A month ago, I decided to finally quit video games because of the intensive studies that are going to begin this September. I'll have to move to a completely new country for me, alone. I will work hard, and there is no way I could spend my free time in front of a computer. I considered Omori as my last single-player video game of my teenage years and for the foreseeable future.

My first play was at night. Being completely alone helped me understand this game correctly. My first session lasted for six non-stop hours, and I've never felt what I felt during this play. There is no other video game that is able to make you feel that blank post-gaming syndrome constantly, like Omori did. I felt it from the beginning until the end, whether I was in front of a computer or not. I'm still wondering if this ""hollow"" feeling will ever fully leave me. When I decided that this is enough for today, I went to the bathroom and spent almost an hour there, thinking. The main subject was my childhood.

The thoughts of my childhood became a sad ghost that follows me every night and day. I think about it every time I have to solve some task about my university admission or studies, every time I walk through a place that was special only for you and a few people you knew back then. Do they still remember it as I do? Do they still cherish it as I do? Will they ever come back here with a desperate hope of seeing some of us or just to see it again?

That night, I felt completely miserable. There is no way to get back there. There is no way I could ever talk to all my good old friends again, no way we could gather again and do the things that kids like us usually did. Some part of them is lost in a big city with their own troubles. I'm sure that they have forgotten how great it was together. Some have left the country forever, and some are even dead. Money wasn't a concern in my childhood. There was no war, and I wasn't afraid that I'd never see my parents again due to a Russian rocket attack. When I was 12, my only worry was spending another summer with my friends, with a stash of snacks prohibited by my mother, and that limited version of Coca-Cola that is no longer produced. I never thought about all of this before playing OMORI. I never missed my childhood times and never dreamed about those times. Omori's headspace is a mirror of our infantile times we all had and miss.

This masterpiece is not about gameplay, graphics, or storyline. There is no way you can rate it separately from your own mind and the changes that occur in it during the play. This game is about nostalgic, infantile, pure emotions that emerge from the hidden part of your soul and will never leave you until your death.

There is a theory of the ""last dream,"" which means that when you die, your brain will produce a last, long dream답ome even call it heaven. I am sure that this ""heaven"" will be some kind of headspace, but with your own friends, games, and troubles. I hope that I'll be able to feel these emotions of a little kid who just minds his own business, playing games with friends and dreaming again. Wait for me, my friends. I'll play with you once again, someday. Even if I have to die for this, it'll be a worthy reward. 10/10, the best game I've ever played.",1693011172,1693011596,True,101,6,0.881557047367095947,0,True,False,False

Edit 8/25/23 

So I switched my positive review to a negative only for a few reasons. 

1 the new content on the other versions of the game as to the players that gave this game life and supported it from the ground up. I'm sorry, you don't hide content from those that gave the game life, Idc if its as small as a changed rock down the line, everything should be available anywhere and you can't tell me its because they needed new content for other people to pick it up on other consoles, the game is worth the price no freaking doubt on the mind weather its $20 or $40 But you don't force people to pay even more just to see new content, especially if those original people gave your game life. 


2 The blatant silence on this whole thing, people have asked on twitter and other means of asking to nothing getting answered, its frustrating to see people think it might come around just because they won't answer the question. if its coming let us know, If its not- Then just fuckin say it- The only info we got was a discord server not working with omoricat saying its perma exclusive. that's it. no one knows how real that was so of course some still have that hope.

I get the idea of new content for specific versions of the game. like Nintendo switch getting some Nintendo easter eggs and playstation getting playstation easter eggs but these are whole ass boss fights that we can't see or fight unless we buy the game again or just watch someone play it, Its shitty to do whatever means it might be. imagine backing a game all the way and thinking your gonna be getting all the content just to find out they locked shit like this. its even more irritating as the windows gamepass has the content that this version does not.

Not really that great as i expected as the hype/trend years ago. Well im guessing the game is popular in Japan due to the mods, idk if it was that hyped outside of Japan. The game are not really that scary, just creepy vibes and some usual disturbing stuff. Idk maybe for me it is just not that creepy as i thought it would actually be lol. 

[h1]Short review of my experience playing the game (very minor spoiler dw)[/h1]
I would say the game horror aspect was on point at the early and the late part of the game, but in the middle ([spoiler]i think around capt spaceboy until humphrey[/spoiler]) i really forgot about the horror aspect of the game since most of it just focused on battle lol. 

Other than that i think the game by itself is pretty good in terms of quality. The story plot is fine, the game does make me wanted to know the story more the more i played. At least it is not some mid half ass made storyline lmao. The game has two separate route so the story wont be too linear and it took around less than 20hrs to finish one gameplay til the end.  The game soundtracks is good (sweetheart battle soundtrack the best imo), I really care about soundtracks for games like this and they pretty much nailed almost everything. The scenery and atmosphere of the game is good.

For in game mechanics, it just works the way rpg game works. There are battles in the game, some boss fights need some strategy and equipment but at least u can get by with just enough snacks and skills. The level is there but u might not need to level them up that much by farming small monsters. Speaking of small monsters if u dont want to waste time fighting them like i do, run is definitely what u would do though some needs few turn to run from them which at times can be quite annoying lol.

[h1]Conclusion?[/h1]
The game is good but to me not so much in the horror aspect maybe bcs i have experience much worse rpg horror game like corpse party or ao oni lol. It is recommended to go blindly for proper experience of the game. I just hope there is an in game feature that let me navigate myself through the whole 4 days easily for the purpose of completing the achievement but i dont think i would see the game updated just for that anytime soon lol. Nonetheless, this game overall is good for casuals and the game is quite worth the price especially during sales. I recommend this if ur a casual gamer looking out for rpg horror game for the first time.",1692813156,1692813240,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Personal Notes: If you have never heard of/played Omori you are seriously living under a rock. Omori is probably the best Story game ive ever played and ever will play, dont let the pixel jrpg let you off on this game, it makes it better in my opinion. Omori's story and atmosphere blew me away, I was never bored exploring the dreamspace area of the game. The music in Omori is another part that just makes this game a masterpiece, over 179 Ost's for it and i dont dislike a single one.
Omocat and her team really did do an amazing job creating this psychological horror jrpg. Omoris modding community bringing the rating factor up so much as well, its a very active community and some of the mods ive played are really well built and have a lot of effort put into them. The characters of Omori are some of the most well written characters in gaming , without spoiling too much each character has there own problems which u learn throughout the game and is truely depressing once youve completed the game. I love every ending in Omori (I think there is 5) some are good and some are bad BUT you should experience those for yourself. 10/10 The definition of a Masterpiece, try this game out now.

I seldom see a piece of media present themes like depression in a way that isn't 'in your face' with it's messaging, but OMORI manages it with flying colours. OMORI doesn't tell how the protagonist feels, it puts you in his shoes and makes you feel for him.

I know that many people are put off by long, story heavy games, but I say that OMORI is a great starting point if you are one of those and is looking to try something new. It's hours long, and finishing can be a considerable undertaking for people with bigger priorities in life, but I assure you it'll be time well spent. The story touched me deeply, and while I won't be giving any spoilers here, I'll say that it pulls the carpet from under your feet in the later part of the game with a big revelation.

For me the price of the game was money very well spent, and I cannot recommend it enough.

*UPDATE*
This game has a great story and the way it unfolds in bits and pieces was pretty cool but I rather would have watched youtube play through of this than actually played it myself because the gameplay was incredibly boring and so drawn out. I do want to check out the other endings if there are any but I can't sit through 20 hours of this pile of shit gameplay. 

The quality of life aspect in this game is HORRIBLE.Theres so many unnessary fights you are thrown into where you are sitting there rinse and repeating the same combat moves over and over and over again and then having to see the same 10 second victory animation. The horrible and annoying repetitive background soundtrack was making my head hurt too when im trying to read the text.

Overall I think a large portion of the games positive reviews is because the ending of the game and its story resonated with alot of people because it does touch on the topic of depression, guilt and how it stays with you as you grow up but you have to swim through an incredibly long and drawn out game with unnecessary combat and missions to really enjoy the effects of it.

I have no actual words to explain what I've felt during this game. Friendship, sorrow, mental illness, horror, happiness, losing hope and more. Omori is one and only kind of experience in my words. Sometimes it made me feel like shit, sometimes like a hero. The sad and tragic story behind this game is not given you at the beginning, although it is shown a bit different than what it actually is, you'll get absolutely shocked by the plot twist at the end. 
I wouldn't say Omori has the best mechanics but I would tell you that it's unique. Once you understand the emotion chart everything becomes much much easier as the game wants you to use it.
I actually do not want to say a lot about this game because you as the reader, should have absolutely zero hesitation giving this game a chance and it would make me happy if you learn about it by playing it yourself.

Do yourself a favour and buy this game immediately play it.

The default resolution options are awful, either forcing you to look at a tiny window and strain your eyes or make all of the beautiful visuals extremely blurry and low res and ruining your experience. I could not reliably control my character because of how small everything was and how I was unable to see anything clearly. 

I'm also not impressed with the start of the game, I have only played for about an hour and I found the game's writing very uninteresting when the horror wasn't at the focus of the scene. I can only assume that it's a slow start and it'll get better as you go. But with that and in combination of being unable to see much of anything without harming my vision, I'm probably going to refund this if I can't find a workaround for the graphics.

Edit: Finished it after getting a better computer and some hardware related accessibility fixes, cried. The game has pacing problems, and drags horribly for about 7/8th of the game but then when that ending hits, it hits hard. It's worth staying around for, and all of these accessibility issues are very prevalent still, but it's a solid 7/10 purely because of the ending payoff.",1667369115,1692088902,False,6,0,0.483686059713363647,0,True,False,False

but if you wish to listen, here is my two cents:
omori is especially great at making you feel the way it wants to make you feel. it makes you anxious when it wants you to be anxious so that you can feel comforted when you finally return to a cold white void. it makes you attached to your 'friends' so that anytime you are alone feels twice as much so. it makes mari and her picnic the safest place to be so it can make the whole world feel cruel when she is gone. it makes your mind white and empty so you hate it when the skies turn black and that void is now filled with things. things you dont know what it is but things you want gone. things you want to forget
yet you must realize that there is no point living like this to progress. Life itself is a rebellion against entropy itself. and happiness can only be achieved by moving forward no matter if it feels uncomfortable or even painful. it is always important to go at your own pace. slowing down or speeding up when you think you should but deciding you want to stop at this moment and relive it over and over will lead to no happiness

but there is something I neclected to mention
sunny never overcomes what he is going through alone. if he had never answered the door when kel tried to help him he would not have ever gone outside of his house on his own. And that is true for all of us. There exists no such human that can live alone. and yet you must open the door to let kel in. You must make your problems known so that ones ready to help you even at their expense can help you. And you must trust there will be people that want to help you no matter how much you believe otherwise.
There may even be someone trying to help you right now. Not someone else but you.

but those reasons are just arent there in reality. they are just reasons you made up because you cant trust yourself, you cant trust yourself when you tell yourself that there are people that love you and that you can become better. 

you must trust yourself you can be better so you can get help so you can be better. You are the person that can help you the most but a friend just there to listen to you ramble about your problems and how you are goes a very long way.",1690279864,1692031596,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

I heard of the game Omori a few years after its release, thinking it was just a classic, funny, inspirational mix of other games like Undertale or Earthbound until I actually played it, and that's when I slowly became very emotional but in a good way. I bought this game around Christmas and despite running into a few spoilers, I still gave the game a shot because of its wonderful art style and story-telling and I also admire how they go in depth with each character and their lives. This game kept me switching between depressed and excited (and now I'm a bit more careful about stairs.)

(SPOILERS BELOW)

What really got me emotional was the library in Headspace. During the playthrough, I couldn't figure out what the boxes [_] were for a while, but now that i know it hits even harder. More importantly, Omori portrays many responses to loss and guilt very accurately, with elements like ""Something"" and other wacky characters. I'm glad Kel (the best character) had enough dedication to knock on Sunny's door for probably days? And thankfully, the story eventually led to reuniting the group again. The ending for defeating his phobias and Sunny using the final duet was so beautiful that I almost cried watching the whole thing, it was precious seeing someone defeat the literal form of trauma. 

Overall, this game made me feel conflicted for days but thanks to the ending, I feel complete and I'm happy Sunny got his good ending (at least with the ending I chose. Now i have the word ""close"" in my head everytime anyone falls, so yeah...) I'm so glad i played this game :)",1656652706,1691903937,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    Sunny was born into a harmonious family, and he has a gentle and considerate sister [b]Mari[/b]. Mari is a perfectionist and she's good at playing piano, also, Mari has a boyfriend [b]Hero[/b], they were almost a match made in heaven.
    It seemed like Sunny would live a happy life like most of our people, however, the fact was not like this...
    On one of his birthdays, Sunny received a violin that his friends and Mari gave him together, with this violin, he could play with Mari. Under practice day by day, Sunny could finally play with Mari on the same stage.
    However, on the morning of the performance day, everything changed: Sunny accidentally broke the violin, and because of this, he had an argument with his sister Mari. Didn't know if it was out of anger or accident, Sunny pushed Mari down the stair, [spoiler]and because of the damage of falling...
    Mari died, by falling.
[/spoiler]
    All these scenes were fully captured by Sunny's best friend [b]Basil[/b] who just came to Sunny's house.
    [spoiler]Under intense fear, Basil and Sunny chose to cover the truth: they carried Mari into the forest outside the house and hung her on a branch with a jump rope, creating a scene of Mari committing suicide.[/spoiler]
    After this thing, Basil became depressed, and Sunny became autistic, never going outside his home.
    After all things happened, Sunny's family decided to move. During the days Sunny still stayed at home, he started dreaming. In his dream, everything seems beautiful, the dream world is another world that contains every happy and positive thing Sunny experienced in his childhood: the Space Husband, the Sweetheart, and her castle, and so on. The Sunny in the Dream has another name [b]Omori[/b](as you can see, it's the game's name).
    And that's where the player's games start.
    During the gameplay, you have to act as Omori and explore the dream world with your friends in it. In the morning, the dream will temporarily come to an end, and you're going to act as Sunny to explore the real world. When the time comes to night, you will enter the dream again.
    When you enter the dream, A silent land below a dreamy purple sky will come into your sight, the first time I came to this scene, I had a strong feeling of peace and loneliness, everything seemed to convey a hint of beauty and serenity, and it almost made me think this is a wholesome game before I got the news of Mari's death.
    Although this is a psychological horror game, most of the time I spent in the game was about Sunny's dream, which entertained me a lot and made me linger on with no intent to leave the dream world. I bet this game's scene shaping is impressive, the first time you enter the dream, you will feel happy and peaceful, but gradually, you will get an intense feeling of loneliness, this is what everyone will get during his playthrough. The dream world is sometimes absurd, almost every scene is dominated by dreamy purple-pink and light blue tones, it well shapes a world of dreams, the space, the Sweetheart's castle, the world under the sea, and Humphrey's body, they both create an absurd world belongs to Omori.
    What is quite praiseworthy is the background music, they both have a dreamcore style, which can make you immersed in this game. (By the way, my favorite music in this game is By your side, this is the music when you enter the plot related to Mari)
    The reality world is kinda heartbreaking, you will soon learn that Mari is dead, the game seems to have reached a turning point at this moment, and from this time, you have to search for the truth [spoiler] about why Mari died. (Well, at this time you don't even know the cause of Mari's death)[/spoiler] 
    The last day in the real world is really with one climax following another, on that day, all the truth will come to light, and the game will also come to an end. 
    When I finished playing this game and watched the final duet, I suddenly found I have no strength to utter a syllable, my heart was fulfilled with complex feelings, happiness, sadness, emptiness...
    Omori disappeared, the dream disappeared, and I'm empty inside. I don't know why I had this feeling of emptiness, the game had already had the best ending, Sunny defeated his demon! Gradually, I came to know why I felt sad and empty, I was totally inside this game, I HAD BECOME SUNNY HIMSELF, I started escaping from reality, I felt scared every night I woke up in my home, and I always couldn't wait to enter my dream only because in my dream, my friends always went on well with me and I could have a perfect wonder world. And so, that's why I felt lost when Sunny stepped out of his dream.
    But soon, I found that there was no need to be upset, I have to face reality, and I also have to face my life, Sunny did so, why didn't I?
    Although Sunny's story seems far away from our life we are all Sunnys, we always make mistakes, and we are always afraid of facing mistakes, and we also want a world in which are no mistakes, no pains, and no sadness, just like Sunny's dream, so it's normal for us to try to escape from reality.
    I think Sunny's story doesn't only tell Sunny to face reality, it also tells us to do so.
    I don't think that I will ever play a game that has touched me deeply as this one, I've played games that have made me cry, I've played games that have made me feel pain, and I've played games that have sometimes made me depressed, but I don't think I have ever played a game that's made me think and feel like this before or more it was just a journey, I don't think I will ever be able to forget this game.
    I don't know what to say anymore... I'm glad I did play this game, honestly even if no one liked this game, it doesn't matter, this was the game I needed to play and this was the game I need to experience and enjoyed the journey, and I enjoy everything about it.
    I haven't felt these emotions for a long time, what makes me feel over everything: keep your friends close man, and cherish them as much as you can, you never know when they'll be gone, besides your family your friends are the most important people in your life, and if you do right by them, they'll do right by you.",1679670225,1691811733,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But seriously this game has beautiful writing and is painfully realistic for those experiencing mental health issues. Each character has their own struggles and is painted as one of the five stages of grief, allowing people to relate to them even more. I was left sobbing and blankly staring at my computer screen for ages after the true ending, I can't even begin to describe the emotions I felt when I heard the final duet. The music in this game expresses emotions so perfectly to the point where if I even hear the first note of that damn piano I think I'll burst into the tears again.

The psychological horror aspect of it might make people think it's unrealistic but it's really not. Hallucinations are real. Nightmares are real. Escaping to a different reality is so common in those experiencing grief. I love this game because someone out there could actually BE Sunny, or Hero, or Aubrey, or Kel or even Basil.

I also just wanted to say that the foreshadowing of what's to come is perfect, it can be so subtle sometimes that you just walk right past it in your first play-through but when you replay it, it's like your stomach drops when you realise. Two of my favourite one's are the sign in orange oasis saying 'You did it!' with a jump rope next to it, and another is the dialogue of the religious statue - 'It feels as if it is judging you.' You pass it off as a gag/joke that it's staring at Sunny weirdly, to later on realising it can have a double meaning.

To put it bluntly, this game is long. Super long. The average playtime to finish this game is 20 hours, and most of that time is not spent progressing the plot. It뗩 spent doing endless fetch quests, roaming around, fighting hordes of enemies, and reading so much dialogue that it can put some people to sleep.	 

HEAD SPACE: While I could write about every single part of the game, and critique how it could뗬e been better, the entire rest of head space is essentially the same thing and so boring it can be summarized in a few paragraphs. Basically, you spend about 90% of your playtime in head space where the plot does not move forward. You just do a bunch of boring, pointless side quests that take forever. 
You do puzzles that are painfully easy. You fight billions of the same enemy, and most of the time turn your brain off and just spam the attack button, and this isn뗪 even scratching the surface on how boring head space is. It got to the point that it took me a month and 13 days to finish this game because I kept taking breaks after enduring this slog fest. 
This whole thing combined leads to a repetitive cycle where you trudge through headspace hoping to reach the point where the plot progresses and you enter the real world, which usually only occurs at the end of each segment of head space. So you get a quick spooky event about the 랎ruth, then get sent to the real world.

THE REAL WORLD: The real world consists of a few fetch quests and missions, and has some of the main problems from before. The best thing though is that it actually moves the central plot forward, and isn뗪 entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things. However the main problem with the real world is that there are so many moments of character development that should be mandatory, such as the description KEL gives about HERO뗩 depression when you interact with the Gravestone. I didn뗪 even know about this in my playthrough, and it's a pretty big plot point that should be expressed.

I뗛 also like to elaborate on the combat for a moment. The combat system with emotions is unique, but rarely utilized. Even if you wanted to use it for yourself you have 4 party members whose emotions need to be turned. That means 4 turns of using Cheer, or Sad Poem, or ㄹnnoy, (Plus an extra turn if the enemy뗩 emotion needs to be changed) In these 4 turns, you could deal so much damage, or be dealt so much damage that it becomes entirely pointless. (And yes, I am aware of the items that make your entire party or foes a specific emotion, but those are later in the game and are classified as items, so they are meant to be single use and 랋owerful.)

Finally, the main part of the game that even kept me playing: The story and writing. To start, the game is very cheesy when it comes to its characters. I thought that this would be isolated to head space alone, but no, it carries over to the real world. Since the writing style stays the same, and none of the teenagers speak like teenagers (They rarely curse at all. This game talks about suicide, so the game can handle curse words. Curse words are usually the best way to separate fantasy from reality because yes, people do curse in stressful situations and it helps emphasize the importance of the situation), the game ends up being pretty unrealistic and feels like you're reading a manga, not seeing an actual friend group going through a hard time.
A good example of this is AUBREY. In about 3 days, after seeing SUNNY fully basically for the first time since MARI뗩 death, and going through various mental breakdowns, AUBREY goes through the classic Family Guy ㄹw geez, I뗬e been a real jerk, then makes up with the entire party of friends. So you're telling me a person who held a grudge against their prior beloved friend group for years, to the point of which doing physical harm to them would just lose that grudge in days? Yeah, okay.

This game also terribly conveys depression. Suicide is a game mechanic, for some fucking reason, which is so insensitive and strange. The bad ending of the game also is just SUNNY killing himself with a (banger) song playing, which is just edgy and unnecessary. These moments seem to be just there for shock value, nothing more.
The game wants to convey that SUNNY has depression, but instead shows that SUNNY is scared of spiders, heights, and swimming, and does not want to go outside. So basically SUNNY just has a bunch of phobias, and is extremely fucking guilty because of the twist (more on that in a moment). 
SUNNY is also never smiling, ever. Which is strange, because most stories about suicide (with personal experience here, too) are shocking to surrounding friends and family because the person who committed suicide never seemed to express being depressed, or them in a state where they뗛 want to commit suicide
But OMOCAT has a very 1 dimensional view of depression. The game portrays people who are depressed as Depressed people are sad. They never smile. They commit suicide, when it is far more complex than that.

Now, coming to possibly the worst part of this game, the twist ending. We learn that SUNNY and BASIL killed MARI by pushing her down the stairs, then framing it as a suicide. So everything prior, SUNNY and BASIL뗩 띿epression, it's not depression. It's guilt. MARI was never suicidal, she was killed. Which essentially means that what could뗬e been an interesting take on depression (as MARI was always so happy and vibrant) is destroyed by the fact that she never committed suicide and that it was framed. So all portrayals of depression in this game are fucking stupid and do not compare at all to the real world.

Also, the twist makes no fucking sense. So MARI gets pushed by SUNNY down the stairs. Then she falls on a fragmented violin. If she wasn뗪 bleeding before, she is now. Then, SUNNY drags her bloodied corpse back up the stairs, and lays her in her bed. So now there is blood everywhere across the house. Then, SUNNY and BASIL take her body (which is still dripping blood everywhere) to a tree, hoist up her 15 year old body with 12 year old noodle limbs, and then proceed to tie a noose around her head (which is harder than it looks.) 

Then the police had to either:
A: Be extremely stupid and not notice the violin shards in the body.
B: Not to be called, and the murder scene covered up by the parents. Also, we have to assume that SUNNY뗩 mother did this on her own, because the father presumably left SUNNY because of this incident. Leaving your entire family is a big thing, and it would make no sense for the father to cover up the murder and then leave. He would most likely keep the murder to himself, but leave in disgust.

Then the game portrays SUNNY and BASIL as sympathetic and innocent. Are you fucking kidding me? The plan to cover it up as a suicide is ridiculous enough for 12 year old 랄nnocent boys, but even if they did come up with this plan, the adrenaline rush to cover it up would뗬e been long gone after SUNNY put MARI back in her bed.
This would be actually very interesting if the story was more of a 랑ho-dun-it, and we were watching psychopaths coming up with their plan, but instead were supposed to be watching innocent boys who made a mistake and are supposed to be forgiven and tell the truth. Yeah right.

The thing is, there was even no need for this twist ending. I understand how subjective it may be, and you can fight tooth and nail claiming that The ending is believable, it's about being honest with yourself, etc. But if the game really wanted to dive into depression, it could뗬e instead explored the very real situation of a person who appears to be happy and vibrant committing suicide. Instead we have a twist ending more because of 랍hock than because of telling a good emotional story.

I have completed and reach the end of Omori

I don't play many RPG games unless it has something I really love. With Omori, it was completely different.
Battle: A simple RPG type with a fun little rock paper scissors gimmick to the battling
The Music: Holy shit, The Music, It's so fucking good especially the boss music, especially Sweetheart, really love the mix of violins (correct me if I'm wrong) and Pianos. Never thought that would go hard in a RPG like this
Characters: are really good, Hero is especially my favorite out of the 4 party members Sweetheart is also a pretty comedic character throughout the story I like
Story: It got me bored at first until SOMETHING got into the story and when they started to show the real world of the game, really shows you get to know some characters and how it reflects in the dream world
Last But not least
Art:The Worlds are fucking beautiful , Especially the final world with all it's color 
And even the cutscene art is more amazing

[h1][b][u]REVIEW:[/u][/b][/h1]
Waiting for something to happen?

A fair amount of people enjoy cats, and they always want to pet them in the game; I do too! The thing is, you can't pet the cat in this game, but you can pet a shadow dog! ......You can't pet the cat like I said... BUT.... you [b]CAN[/b] kill your cat! Dissecting it, actually! Yep. This game is nuts.

I'm not even too sure how I found this game, honestly. I do, however, know that it caught my eye when I saw the tags included turn-based JRPG, mixed with psychological horror. Now that's my type of jam! I was all in for this. The result? It scared the hell out of me and left me feeling lots of sadness, albeit some happiness at others.

Even though I haven't replayed this game, I know I'll be returning to it in a year or two. Seeing all the different endings is something that I really want to do! On my first playthrough, I got the good ending. I've searched to see if there will be some sort of OMORI 2, but everyone doesn't think it's likely.

Well darn. Hopefully in the future, there will be some sort of spinoff or new characters and story with the same base concepts. This is a must play game, even if you don't like turn-based games. The story is impressive! Meow!

[h1][b][u]THE RUNDOWN:[/u][/b][/h1]

[u][h3] STORY[/h3][/u] Fantastic. I don't want to give away too many details, but if you're wondering if a game with a nostalgic Pokemon feel can actually scare you, you'll have to try it out for yourself. ONE SPOILER THOUGH! I뗬e even heard of a scare where something happens and the game crashes (on purpose) which would뗬e scared the hell out of me if I wasn뗪 spoiled over it.

[u][h3] GAMEPLAY[/h3][/u] Great. Sure, there뗩 a bit of flaws with it, as sometimes it feels a bit too easy, but overall it was fun. If you want to buy this game for the gameplay alone, skip this title. You WILL NOT like the game.

I enjoy switching between the White Space and the real world to see what happens with Sunny (Omori's true self), and vice versa. In OMORI, the breaks for real-world activities resembled Persona. In OMORI, however, the breaks had a more significant effect on the plot, making me both excited and scared to find out what would happen next. Hands down my favorite part of the game.

[u][h3] VISUALS[/h3][/u] Visually stunning and really captures the theme of the story, which makes me like it even more. Honestly, I might not even like the game as much without it looking the way it does. Wait, horror put into this adorable pixel-art? Amazing and well executed, and incredibly unique!

Upon entering Black Space, the once charming pixel-art style takes on a disturbing quality. It scared the hell out of me. I loved it. Bravo, OMOCAT.

[u][h3] DIFFICULTY[/h3][/u] Average. I wish there was a difficulty setting, as sometimes I advanced too easily (considering I뗬e played a few SMT games), to have that many problems. There were a couple of bosses that I appreciated with the difficulty spike raising up, though. It was alright at most points.

[u][h3] MUSIC & SFX[/h3][/u] Great. The music feels good, the horror elements and audio scares are good (and scary) as well. My favorite music track in the game was It Means Everything., played during AUBREY뗩 boss fight. So surreal, so sad and so catchy.

[u][h3] VOICE ACTING[/h3][/u] N/A.

[u][h3] GRIND[/h3][/u] It can be there if you choose so. It's not a biggie, but you may want to grind a bit for those difficulty-spiked bosses I mentioned. Just do a few sidequests, and you뗣l be fine. Speaking of which

[u][h3] EXTRAS & SIDE QUESTS[/h3][/u] Pretty good and fair! There's a bunch of 'em, and sure, there might be some that make you feel baffled trying to figure out where to go. It's just about as good as any other game with simple side missions.

The extras, however, are amazing. Considering how many multiple endings there are and even some REALLY... scary areas, etc., this is impressive. More about that in the replayability section!

[u][h3] GAME TIME[/h3][/u] The game doesn뗪 overstay its welcome; it뗩 just about right. Maybe there could뗬e been a few more areas along with 2-3 more days in the game, but for most people, it뗩 well paced.

[u][h3] END-GAME CONTENT[/h3][/u] N/A.

[u][h3] REPLAYABILITY[/h3][/u] Definitely replay this game a few times. There are multiple endings and paths to choose when you play. Choices matter in this game. Let things unfold naturally without researching them first. If you want the biggest impact for yourself, play without Google, at least for the first time around!

[u][h3] PRICE[/h3][/u] Undoubtedly great, and I hope more people support this indie studio! So glad to see it뗩 coming to consoles soon, which is exciting! I think everyone saw that coming.

OMOCAT actually started out as a clothing brand. You can now buy new artwork, plushies, and various other things on OMOCAT뗩 site! In fact, if I뗤 not mistaken, OMOCAT is an actual person? And that's your daily dose of fun facts! Nice!

[u][h3] BUGS[/h3][/u] None. No... (MAJOR GAMEPLAY SCARE SPOILER) when the game crashes after you collect all the hangman keys, that was supposed to happen!

[u][h3] PC REQUIREMENTS[/h3][/u] Pretty low. I put Decent above, but honestly a potato could probably end up running this game! Not a bad thing, though!

[u][h3] AUDIENCE[/h3][/u] Strictly for adults. Okay... maybe some teens. Apparently, this game brings comfort to some people. I am not sure how, as it was pretty darn depressing. I뗤 going against the majority and telling you that if you have depression or suicidal thoughts, you should probably stay away from this game!

The few sidequests are simple nothings. I feel no connection to the main world of this game due to the very premise of it being a fantasy of twee concessions and power. I understand it's supposed to be this way. Your friends are supposed to be simple caricatures. The whole world is, but it isn't worth twenty hours. Sad pirate man or repetitive laughter lady isn't worth twenty hours. 
I know what they're meant to represent, but it's under-baked.

Mechanically, the combat is decent for most of the game. Its simplicity is complimented by interactions between party members and how they synchronize. The phobias are hardly relevant aside from sadboy aesthetics and roadblocks. The few plot points smash you over the head more fervently than a semaphore at a whack-a-mole convention. By the time the plot's mysteries are uncovered, Omori stumbles over the intersection between real world complications and surrealism (when it should've focused on the latter). This is relevant because the late sections agonize over these points for so long that it becomes the gameplay via walking simulator. The Yume Nikki slop has some good bits in it, but there's little reason for it aside from intertextual hooplah. Travelling through every memory already repeatedly mentioned throughout the game adds more head injuries to count.
 
I spent a while deciding whether I liked this game or not. I still played through it, which says something. I've grown up on rental junk, with some games being wildly ambitious treasures scuffed by odd decisions, or even improved by ones normally counter-intuitive, yet evocative of the human experience in a way that sparks my neurons. 
This isn't one of those games, but it's filled with 'stuff'. It's artistically well-made, intricate stuff. It's musical stings that only appear for one fleeting moment. It's specialized animations for everything. It's digipet rock-paper-scissors. There's so much stuff just floating about, but it doesn't have much to serve.

Summary:
There is nothing more banal than a neet's imagination. It's full of sound and fury, signifying nothing until the tantrums stop and it recedes into a forty hour moe binge.",1667967123,1691456133,False,9,2,0.489964574575424194,0,True,False,False

[i]-Omori to the mirror[/i]
[hr][/hr]

[b]Omori[/b], an RPG about exploring a dreamscape of it뗩 main character.
That뗩 the shortest description I could make for the game, however this game is so much more.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Let뗩 start with gameplay and mechanics:

You simply explore the dreamscape talking to characters and encountering enemies in aim to progress the story by getting done whatever situation or problem is at hand.

It뗩 an RPG game, so expect experience, leveling up, equipment, skills/spells and 띾lasses (this last thing in the loosest way of the term).

Battles spot a simple, yet dynamic system of interchanging strengths and weaknesses paired with a rock paper scissor mechanic, where one status (or emotion in this case) will be always weak to an emotion, and strong against another one, so learn how to swap, manipulate and play around with them to ensure victory.

[h1]Story[/h1]
This game strong suit, accompanied with a very cute 랋encil and pastel art direction, it will grab you for a journey through a young man working through some stuff that happened in life
And I뗣l stop here not to spoil anything more other than saying that writing may be a little generic at the start and middle point but picks up speed in many moments and especially in the later part.

[h1]X-Factor[/h1]
This title is one the best example of a game tying narrative and gameplay mechanics as one.

[h1]Downsides[/h1]
Sometimes you뗣l end up wandering directionless because you뗬e missed a detail, some other times some sections of the game where not much happens drag on for a bit to long, but these are just nitpicks not actual criticism.

Let me explain; as in HEADSPACE, our internet friends are not real. They can't comfort you nor stay with you by your side if you are feeling depressed. In fact, they can betray you, backstab you, doxx you, and more with no consequences which is worrisome to even think about it. They do not do it at first because it is their ""good will"" but they can always do it if there is any reason or motive to do so.

Maybe ""real"" friends are not perfect but i think it is the better choice, reality always beats fiction although it could be a more pleasant experience.

On the other hand, escapism is an option if you don't have any friends. It may be your only thing you have to cope with[/spoiler]

Now in long, I think this game really captures a specific feeling. It's story is very relatable, I've been in a similar situation with a friend group falling out and everyone doing their own thing. It's easy to get very distant in those situations and this game captures that feeling super well. However, when I was younger, I lost a really good friend. He would come over all the time and we'd play with action figures and watch batman, yk really cool stuff. At the time, I can't remember how I took it. All I remember is the funeral, and referencing the silly things he'd say while playing with his stormtrooper figures. While playing this game, he's all I could think about, and I appreciate it for that. Because it's not often that I can relate to feelings that games, movies, or songs capture this well.

The game has my favorite main character of all time, and you just can't help to love the story because of how it's planned out and written.

OMORI is a turn based RPG game which centres mainly around the main cast of characters in the dream world and the overworld.

PLEASE [i]PLEASE [/i]PLAY THIS GAME BLIND, THE STORY AND CHARACTERS ARE THE STRONGEST PART!!!

The ONLY downside of the game is how long it takes to beat. Even just focusing the main story will probably take you about 15-20 hours. It took me 45 on my first run trying to do everything I could.

EVERYTHING ELSE is perfect:
- The turn based gameplay is deep, progressively more challenging and really rewarding
- There's a TON of stuff to do, lots of areas, sidequests, items, battles, and story stuff
- The characters, both main and side, are amazing and all really interesting and unique
- Dialogue is great and it's really fun watching all the characters interact
- Music varies between decent and ABSOLUTE BANGERS, but always fits the mood of whatever's happening
- The story is really emotional and INCREDIBLY good, especially with how it slowly unfolds without giving everything away, but just enough to hint at what's actually happening
- Seriously play this game for the story if nothing else, battles might be a grind but trust me it is SO worth it

This game is terrifying. It absolutely NAILS the horror parts. Maybe 90% of the game is normal and friendly, so when the horror kicks in you feel it. There's a few jumpscares, but most of it comes from how god damn unnerving the game feels. The slow increase of strange and creepy things is something you notice and can tell is happening but just having to push on through. Weird things hidden all over the place that you're not sure if they have meaning, or are just some strange thing to find. The slow move to full psychological horror at the end of each segment where you are completely helpless and can only go head on into whatever nightmares await you is amazing. The atmosphere and vibe of the game will flip immediately. When the game turns on nightmare mode, it makes sure you know it.

In conclusion, if you like turn based RPGs, an amazing story, a really great cast of characters or any of the above then PLAY THIS GAME.

I love horror games, but I can never play them because I hate running from entities and I end up spamming and dying, which is an inconvenience. I only had to run about 2 or 3 times, which I can understand. I could understand every characters view, especially Sunny's. I also share a name with one of the members, so that was funny to me.
