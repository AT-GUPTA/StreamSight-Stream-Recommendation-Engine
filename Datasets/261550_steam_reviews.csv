I have 2000+ hours in Mount & Blade, 700+ hours in Fire & Steel, and 1800+ hours in Warband (all single player). So why do I only have 300 hours in Bannerlord? Great question. The answer is MODs. They are mostly not on Steam and I don't want to go through the effort and the possible exposure to malware to get them elsewhere. They also break every time there's an update. 

The main game feels like a rehash of Warband with some improvements and better graphics. So, despite the new additions it got boring fast. Thus, my next course of action was to go for the MODs, and there are some beautiful looking ones out there. Not on Steam though. The few that exist are not well maintained. It seems that the either the developers, or Steam are hostile to Modders, or Modders are hostile to Steam. The game mostly lost me regardless. On a good note, It opens up several niches in the market for other developers to make some money.

Gameplay :
-sliding effects on movement (is the most annoying part ruining the whole gameplay) - you can push a player by moving on him. The sliding effect also was a little bit on warband but way less, it intensified as in bannerlord you also run faster.
-physic based makes the melee inconsistent (mixed with the sliding effect and the ping, this game is a pain causing out of reach hits being registered hits even with a <30ms ping)
-poorly animated skeleton for melee (right 1H swing as one single exemple) a deep downgrade again
-horses are way extremely manoeuverable, considering the sliding effects it feels like ice skatting

Balancing :
-badly balanced (so was native warband) but bannerlord a lot way more (one handed are the only viable weapons since it often outreachs 2H on a right swing and close to equal in damage, perk system is shit and brings only one optimal build anyway)
-classes system brings even more unbalanced features - again another deep downgrade
-skirmish ladder is not a good idea (many people leaves ongoing matches), the elo system is broken since you often gets ingame with people that first started the game against a whole team of 5k hours opponents, it just fills up the lobby. It would have been better with a single server like there was on warband, a battle server with autobalance - a deep downgrade 

Connection, crash/bugs and server availability :
-game crashes are very frequent
-unstable connection with the game (requires a VPN in order to login sometimes), often logs out
-some meshes (like stairs) can get you stuck if youre jumping on the edge and some barns wooden pillars...
-only available native servers are team deathmatch and siege but you get bored really quick and you have the skirmish ladder where half the players just leaves randomly (probably because of crashes) - duel servers are active
-persistent empires is the persistent worlds (credit to Lazlo) son but for bannerlord, just the same thing and actualy active and fun
-cRPG also is in this, not merc tho (maybe dead forever unfortunately)

Warband was better in terms of gameplay, balancing (surprisingly), stability and overall activeness (at his prime which lasted longer), warband is still active (like 30 to 90% of bannerlord approx). Good thing for bannerlord are the siege weapons and destructible walls, whole ambiences with sounds, light/shadow effects (which I don't care as I only play in low for best performances). Also the game interface is good looking and simple. You can buy cosmetics for farming official servers' games. Bannerlord is ok for singleplayer (even if there are abuses - smithing as an example).

I have much love for original Mount & Blade, but Bannerlord plays like it's still in early access or I'm playing a stack of mods on top of the original. It's not particularly pretty given it's a 2022 release and the worlds still have that lifeless feeling and repetitive voice acting as the original Mount & Blade. At one point I checked my graphics settings to make sure I didn't accidentally lower something.

Multiplayer is dead aside from some modded communities, and for good reason - it's not very fun unless you really want that original Mount & Blade feel. Captain mode is kind of neat, but the servers are mostly empty. Matchmaking is empty or broken; I've never been able to get a game on either east or west NA and have always had to join a custom server

Don't get me wrong, this is still a unique title with few alternatives for this type of game out there, but it comes across as though Bannerlord is still resting on mechanics that haven't gotten any fresher since 2008.

[h2]TL;DR Summary[/h2]
• The combat system and attention to cultural detail are the strong points of Bannerlord 2.
• The lack of explanation in the campaign mode, the steep learning curve, and the need for more immersive role-playing elements limits the enjoyment of the game.
• The game could benefit from more varied quests and activities to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

[h3]The Campaign[/h3]

In campaign mode you are given the option to join up with an existing kingdom or to create your own. I attempted to make my own kingdom on my first play-through [i](who wouldn’t, right?)[/i], and let’s just say that was a very poor decision. I was ultimately unsuccessful in uniting the kingdom, AI dominated my fiefs and obliterated my armies (while playing on the default easy settings), and after putting in so hundreds of hours of time only to be taken out so easily, with no feedback as to what I could have done differently, I was left feeling frustrated and overwhelmed with the thought of going back and re-playing the entire game to give it another go.

I ended up restarting the game after having gained insight from others by researching strategies online. It appears as though the best action to take is to stay an independent clan for as long as possible, so for my second attempt that's been my current objective; Build my clan up to a power/influence level beyond that of a minor kingdom, do mercenary work, generate a ton of wealth, obtain and build up family and fiefs, then, after all of that, declare my decision on whether to serve a kingdom or make my own. I feel that in a campaign mode all of this should have been better explained to players in the game's tutorial or along the way.


[h3]The Positives[/h3]

[b]There are a couple things Bannerlord 2 has done very well:[/b]

• One of the game's strongest aspects is its combat system, which offers a unique blend of strategic planning and action-packed battles. The ability to control and command troops on the battlefield adds an extra layer of depth and strategy to the game play. The combat system does take a little practice to get used to, but after mastering it I’ve found it to be a lot more dynamic than other games where you “Press X” or smash together combo moves to hit the enemy. I got a lot of enjoyment leading cavalry charges and attacking/defending sieges with a bow and arrow. A big draw for me restarting, despite the frustration my first play through created, was the combat system. Knowing my preferred fighting style has also helped me to spend my talent points more wisely.

• The game's attention to cultural detail in its cities, arenas, and soldier ability archetypes helps to create a more immersive world. Each culture has its own set of pros and cons, and while you do ultimately choose a culture to belong to, that didn’t limit your ability to obtain troop types from other cultures.

• I like that relationship reputation is an aspect in this game. I'd like to see more RP dialogue and cut-scenes, but overall I enjoyed having to woe a suitor and like the concept of having to keep my actions pure to maintain a better reputation.


[h3]The Negatives[/h3]

[b]The game has many areas where it could be vastly improved, and my consensus [i](after reviewing a lot of input from the Bannerlord community[/i] is everyone generally feels the same.[/b]

• The tutorial system in the campaign is extremely lacking and does not adequately prepare players for the complexities of the game. Many aspects of the game aren’t intuitive or straightforward. I understand that most players want to jump in and immediately start battling [i](weapon skills are covered in the campaign tutorial)[/i], but without a proper statecraft tutorial explaining all the other important elements of the game you’re left feeling not quite sure what to do or how to go about things successfully. I suppose from a sandbox game  perspective this is intentional and perhaps maybe even desirable, but when playing a campaign I want a more linear approach that explains things as I progress. This doesn’t happen currently, and because of this I've ended up having to watch a lot of videos online and read other players' input to figure things out. 

• Side quests feel repetitive and not worth the time investment [i](or maybe I’m not understanding the benefit to increasing relationships with commoners in random towns?)[/i]. As you get more powerful as a clan, quests should change to reflect that. When I'm commanding large armies I shouldn't be given quests to transport a herd of 25 sheep, for example.

• The personal customization options are limited and could definitely be expanded. I would like to be able to adjust the hairstyle, hair color, and voice of my family [i](siblings, spouse and children)[/i]. The color of my horse [i](and troops' horses)[/i] should also be customizable. I never got to a point where I could dress my character or wife in royal clothing while in town even though I started my own kingdom. A king and queen should have access to royal clothing and head wear.

•  Fiefs are upgradable, but when you upgrade things nothing cosmetically changes within the game. I want there to be noticeable changes in my fiefs upon upgrade completions. Additionally, it would be nice to have upgradable towns in addition to fiefs.

• I would like to have some aspect of town, fief, and kingdom interactive citizen management where townsfolk or other lords/ladies bring issues to my throne room for me to address that are things outside of war conflict.

• The concept of losing a party member to marriage makes zero sense to me. Finding out you not only lose your party member, but also all of the gear you’ve equipped them with, wasn’t enjoyable. There were many things like this that occurred while playing where I had to stop and reload an old save file because I didn’t understand the implications of my decisions, or some RNG happenstance occurred [i](like my wife dying in childbirth)[/i].


[h3]Closing Thoughts[/h3]

With continued support and updates from the developers, the game has the potential to become even better over time, perhaps even great, but as it is right now it feels rather hollow. I’m left wanting something more substantial and complete.

I have not tried any mods yet, and perhaps the modifications community will help to bring the game up closer to my standards, but the out-of-the box game needs more to its campaign mode to be recommendable from me.",1708069392,1708643300,False,1,0,0.519002377986907959,0,True,False,False

I would not recommend buying this game in its current state.  It is still riddled with bugs, some of them game breaking.  Additionally, the gameplay itself needs a lot of work.

The mid-late game campaign (not sandbox) is poorly balanced and an after thought.  For example, the never ending conspiracy quests are just aggravating and occur way too frequently.  These quests will ruin fighting wars with other kingdoms as you have to race across the map to clear a low level bandit hideout.  The repercussions for failing a conspiracy quest can completely ruin a playthrough.  It feels like they didn't play test their own game.

[b] All mechanics for the starters can be the same as in original game. [/b]

Bannerlord thoroughly follows bad example of the Warband, making everything we liked about the old game consistently worse, except the graphics. Minor new features are there, naturally, but all this work done by a huge studio feels bleak in comparison to what Rocha did long before them, with inspiration from Fawzia dokhtar-i-Sanjar.
(Oh my, I still remember her name... Imagine the immersion!)

But let's fry it proper, shall we?

***
1. First-person combat — unplayable.

Fish-eyed even on FOV 70+.
Yeah, Mr. Principal Developer, your engine renders 240 degrees, then just lazily multiplies it by x1.5, or something to that end.
That is why your realistic FOV 90 looks like alien 135 we all remember from ""Aliens vs Predator"".
Performance optimization coding master-class right here, fellas!
Learned from the best, like Bethesda.

Swinging animations are so unrefined that 3rd-person view is the only way to go. 
There was never a problem with 1st-person visibility in the original game! Not on horseback, not with any weapon or shield.

***
2. Shield on the back concept — ruined.

You could rock two shields in the original game. One one the back would greatly protect you from missiles, especially in steppe combat and arenas, or with pavise on foot during sieges, and it was a conscious choice to forego one of the 4 slots for it.

Now shield on the back does NOT block incoming missile damage, although the message is there. Idiotically, it now protects from melee strikes.
Ingenious! But not really.

***
3. Party inventory — castrated.

In the original game you could have 22 (Sic!) NPCs in your warband at the same time — each one with history, corresponding skills, progression, roles, dialogues, and FULLY manageable inventory.

Now you can have... 4 of those. I repeat:

Flower. Odyssey. Unity. Romance.

***
4. Strategical combat — degraded during development.

Was better during early access, I swear!

But you can't issue an order ten paces forward for your shield wall.
Nor you can keep proper cavalry charge formations!
Nor you can adjust the rate of fire of your ranged troops!
Nor you can cry out loud commands like ""LOOOOSE!!"" to improve the results a ranged barrage.

How come they made it worse over the years? Eludes me.

I started out choosing two handed weapon traits, because for the previous game, I went with a bow and it was OP, but terrible when the game forced me to be on foot. I figured this game would do the same... who knows, maybe it does at some point, I didn't get that far.

I know it says I have 25 hours on record, but ignore 23 of those. Because that's from the last time I played this, and most of it was being stuck on the launcher as the game failed to run. To the games credit, it does run better than it did when it first came out.

So, I selected two handed skills, and it starts me off with a one handed axe. I was a little annoyed, but thought, I'll just go to a town and buy a sword.... The town had no two handed weapons... The whole town, not one. A little unusual I thought, so I went to the next town... and the next town... and the next town.... I thought I'd fight some bandits to get some starting gear, put that axe it gave me to use, to trade it up. The looters threw rocks at my head and brought me down to 15% health... Which took waiting in a city for 6 in game days to fully heal, which was instantly brought down again next time I went into combat.

I know the game strives for realism, but this is boring. Insanely boring. It also took me a very long time to find the looters (3 in game days)

Finally, I found the smithing, I smelted down the looters weapons and made my own. I finally had a sword... that started off as rusty? That's not right... Apparently my low smithing skill meant I got a bad sword. Whatever, it was the right type of weapon, all I cared about. 
I tested it out... instantly defeated and sword taken from me... My rusty crappy sword taken away.
Enemies can also block you very easily, even if you're running at them on a horse, with a two handed sword ready to swing at them, they just have to raise their rake or whatever they're fighting with, and dink, instantly blocked. 

This game is boring. Insanely boring.
It could be argued that I'm not very good at it, and that would be a fair argument to make... But I shouldn't have to be good at a game for it to be at least a little fun. This is insanely boring.
The combat is slow, you do not gain health after a battle ends, so even if it's just looters throwing rocks at your head while you run around on a horse, somehow they have head seeking rocks. You're going to lose health very fast. Then you have to wait after the battle for multiple in game days as your health regenerates.

Do not buy this game. Save your money, buy literally anything else and it will be a better use of your money.

Now for the realism bit. These games strive for it, what is my opinion on realism?
Well, fair enough, rocks to the head do hurt, I unfortunately do have experience with this. (I predict nasty comments saying that this is why I suck at the game, fair enough, you get a freebie here) 

I used to do Buhurt and IMCF, and I can tell you fine well, that you don't have to look side to side to swing in that direction. In fact, it's better that you do not telegraph your attacks like that. I know it's probably difficult to simulate in a game, but other games have done a great job at this over many years. This direction swinging thing is dreadfully clunky.
After receiving the slice of a sharp sword across the arm and chest, it should be fairly hard to pick up a rock and throw it at someone. But not for these bandits, in this game that strives for realism. No, they can easily throw another head seeking rock, no problem! Wounded units should receive debuffs to reflect those wounds.

Now, I know how steam reviews work, I'll get one of two things, comments telling me that just because I'm bad at the game, I shouldn't give it a negative review. I'm just going to place down this rake, it will deflect all of your comments. Rakes are amazing at that, according to this game. Steam reviews are supposed to be opinionated, hell, all reviews are opinionated. A review is literally my opinion on the game. I am bad at the game? My opinion is typically going to be a negative one. (Not always, see some of my other reviews) 
I didn't have fun, I found it boring. I found it tedious to have to wait for ages to restore health. 

Or my review will get ignored, which is fine by me, I'm mostly ranting.

Ultimately, I don't care if you buy the game or not. I hope you enjoy yourself, whichever you choose to do.
But the question here is, would I personally recommend it?
No, no I would not. I hated this game.

Don't waste your time with diplomacy, or building up relations; there is absolutely no point in doing so. There is no diplomacy in the game, you're simply at the whim of the AI deciding whether or not you can have a favorable deal or not, regardless of how wars are actually going. There's a lot more depth to the game now than there was at the start, but once you get involved in being a part of the kingdom, you'll mostly just be fighting wars, so there's not a lot of time for anything else if you want to protect your lands, and whether or not you're the king there rarely seems to be any lengthy period of peace. If you aren't stacking your army with cavalry the game has decided you are wrong; I have yet to run into an instance where the larger cavalry force didn't win, regardless of what the infantry formation is made up of. The AI is just too dumb for the infantry to handle the cavalry, so the infantry gets scattered as the cavalry glide through the formation of pikes and spears without losing a man or a horse in the initial charge. 
 The enemy AI seems to have become more intelligent over time, actually executing strategy; however, your friendly AI is as insurmountably stupid as ever, meaning your cavalry formations scatter when you order a charge whereas the AI will maintain a tight formation, your infantry will stand there and get hacked to death by enemy AI if you don't order them to charge, meaning you can't keep them in formation and they get massacred by cavalry and enemy infantry, regardless of the quality of your troops. Though equally I have never had an instance where if I had an equal number of infantry to the enemy I would win. My infantry, regardless of how trained they were, seemingly always did worse than the AI, regardless of where I put them on the battlefield, what formation they're in, etc. The flip side of that coin is I've never lost as a cavalry formation against the AI cavalry; your force always seems to win, regardless of size. Which only furthers the point of why even bother with infantry? You move slower on the campaign map, your cavalry can dismount for sieges and again, fight better than most infantry, and the wages aren't THAT drastically increased over infantry.Once you start to get a decent sized retinue you are going to spend your entire time trying to have the money to pay them until you get fiefs, but dealing with the AI in kingdoms is incredibly frustrating. Either they always declare wars, or they never do, and then you're left with very little to do, since you don't have a fief to supplement your income, the workshops don't make a whole lot of sense as to what the villages nearby the workshop produce and the income from the workshop so they're not a good money maker, and if you're in a kingdom, it will be at war, and your caravan will get taken out, so what exactly are you supposed to do for money other than raiding villages and selling loot? And you'd think that wouldn't get tedious, but then you go to peace, and all you get to do is wander around hoping one of the cities or villages will have one of the quests which is actually worth your time, as most of the quests they offer aren't worth the time it would take to complete them. The developers also release patches which occasionally screw up your game, so you can never get very far into the game. Considering how awful the slog of the beginning is, how completely uninteresting and unimportant the main storyline is, and the fact you can't get very far makes this one of the more disappointing games out there. I put so many hours in because I wanted to really get into this game and really enjoy it, but the devs don't seem interested in their players getting to that point. I found myself simulating battles because I'd already just fought 3 and if I don't use the same tactics every single time I will lose, so somehow these grand battles lose all their impact.",1592673660,1708277702,False,0,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord - A Hilariously Chaotic Medieval Romp (With Occasional Crashes)
I've spent more time launch enemies with my crossbow than finishing quests, but let me tell you, this game is a hoot.

Battles are glorious, messy ballets of flailing limbs (with mods) and flying arrows. Charge into a group of enemies, screaming like a drunken Viking, and watch your ragtag army turn the tide with surprising effectiveness (or, more likely, hilarious incompetence). Just be prepared to spend half the time watching your troops do nothing lol.

Want to be a noble? Charging into tournaments and wooing fair maidens? Go for it, though be warned, their taste in men seems... questionable lol. Prefer to become a criminal, pillaging villages and hoarding loot like a squirrel on caffeine? Nobody judges (except the villagers, probably).

Now, the bad news. Bugs occasionally decide to join your party, crashing your game like a catapult to the face. The AI can be as sharp as a butter knife, and some features feel like they're still in the oven. But hey, embrace the jankiness, laugh at the glitches, and you'll have a blast.

Overall, Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is a hilarious, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately unforgettable medieval sandbox. If you're looking for a polished, perfect experience, go buy an actual loaf of bread. If you want butter fuelled mayhem and enough stories to choke a bard, this is your game. Just remember, a spoon is only as good as the wielder, so get out there and butter some lords!

There are about four very basic missions you'll do plenty of times, the early game is a horrendous grind just chasing bandits and doing the awful quest requiring you to find and talk to ten nobles, and then the process of forming your own kingdom is bizarrely linear and arduous.

--- Old Review ---
Honestly, I don't see any reason to play this game over Warband. There were several design decisions that make this game worse than warband -- Further restriction of aiming while on horseback, shield blocking changes, and a harshening of stagger mechanics. The early game is empty, lacking clear direction, and very difficult to play without going for the merchant playstyle.

I have 64gb of RAM now and a beefy rig and I STILL run into performance issues as the game progresses. It's incredibly unbalanced, repetitive, and very buggy.

I did revert back the version but it's still a problem as mods are untested and frankly the game itself seems untested. Sad because I keep falling for the illusion that I'm building something and when it starts to get good, it gets bad. Pfft. Moving on.

It's really fun and good for an open beta. Definitely missing some features and balancing is a bit wonky. I'll probably amend my review once the game gets closer to a full release.
***Early Access***

Summary: Bannerlord is a great game. I would recommend it to anyone.
 
Upon full release it's still a great game but there are smallish issues, but most can be summarized with it feels unfinished a lot of stuff is there but the moment you try to look for depth it's lost.

Diplomacy honestly is a let down. Mods fix this

Missions get boring and scale to the point of making them not worth doing for some. At a certain point I just do them to make notables like me more.

Faction balance and troop trees aren't done well and really need more work. ie Vlandia is OP, Battania is a joke. There are a couple mods for this it's up to taste I use De Re Militari

The promise of creating a criminal empire only exists in taking alleys and honestly it's a good base but mechanically it falls absolutely flat. (Taleworld's said they are working on this so wait and see I guess) There's a mod for this I don't use it

The combat system is great this is definitely an upgrade from warband (wouldn't say better), but I wished they did something to it to make it fresher. I use CBM, but vanilla is good enough, as long as you don't care that spears/pikes suck.

Fief management is boring

The economy system isn't great, if you want to be a trader and have fun with it play warband.

Clan management is great I want more but there is nothing for me to outright complain about.",1598222879,1707890771,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Edit : 
On windows 11, 32go of RAM ... the multiplayer crashes because it overloads memory ... even steam crashes. 
No support on this point ...don't buy on windows 11. 

TL;DR :
- Solo is fun if you like the game but unbalanced and slow by the middle/end game. 
- Multiplayer NOT recommended : server issues (crashes), time based combat with register issues, cheat/macro very common, map design with many exploits and bypass. 

[Edit after review and 120h more, only Multiplayer update]

TL;DR : apart of cheaters being removed, nothing changed from a player MP experience since the last review. 

- Still a lot of cheaters and macro users that will ruin your game. 
- There is a lot of crashes a little less but it's still very rare to be able to finish 2 games in a row,
- There are the same even few maps than in Beta (exactly the same, no correction or balance in Siege mode)
- There are a lot (same as beta) of collision bugs that will leave you stuck and force to change team (and lose all your points)
- The population in MP went up for the release but after 2 weeks is down significantly. Almost all servers are empty. 
- MP faction are quite unbalanced and vlandia is clearly selected most of the time because of their strength and free points (you gain point when you die).





Details :
Solo player (200+hours) : I recommend, the dev pace is very slow, as of now the game can be buggy but is fun some hours (forget the main quest is very badly written). The kingdom management part of the game is very unbalanced and slow (and uncompleted)

Multiplayer (150+ hours) : A very big NO in the current state. I've been playing for about 1,5 years with some friends ... and it's getting worse and worse. We are multiple players with the same issues, nothing seems to change, it's even getting worse.  

Stutters and getting slow : There are random stutter and slowing that change the speed of you character. Everyone in the chat keep reporting them at the same times, it varies depending on the map and number of players. This is a big issue, because it makes animation unreadable and sometimes even rollbacks, your swings will go though enemies without damage and the opposite also exists. So it makes the game very random on the hit register compared to what you see. The problem is even worse when the servers have more than 30 players. 

Anticheat and macros : Many players use macros and cheats, it will result in perfect attacks that will be registered even with stutters. Battleye is a very bad anticheat, we all know that and it consumes resources for almost nothing. You will often see players surrounded by a swarm of enemies parrying at almost 360° almost every time. Now it's even up to a state where people will brag of using macros or cheats and that there is nothing done against them. You will also find the classical auto aim with ballista/range weapons that will follow you behind a wall or shoot players all the time.

Less and less players : there are fewer and fewer players mostly due to the above that makes the game feeling unbalanced and sometimes frustrating. The community is growing thin by the day. 

Map design / game design issues : In siege mode (where one team takes and the other defends), the maps have a very ""in test"" feel to them. There are collision bugs in the stairs, the ladders, etc. The maps are so open that you can bypass every defender and go to the last flags. Most of the maps cannot be defended. The dev should have made some stages in the progression with objectives, even implicit ones. They did very well in m&b:napoleonic wars (which, at the time, runs better with 120 players and has no issue in siege). In other modes, you will find very big map with many interesting features, but the objectives are cramped and don't use them. It results in only death match, there is few to no strategy involved. Most of the map design would have to be reworked at this state.",1658512811,1707861680,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's also the first M&B where i feel like i have to cheat or cheese in order to play normal. the AI can get total war crazy, especially if you're an independent ruler.

Factions on the other side of the map wanting 10,000 per turn for peace or will randomly send massive armies. Its too much and if its meant to imply real life difficulty, it does not.

- Encourages creativity and replayability

- Too little dialogues

- Sometimes troop tactics do not work (at all or as intended)
- No definite ending

The game is a good sequel of the first Mount & Blade: Warband. It improved almost everything and keeps improving. It features a unique gameplay which is really a must to experience if you are into RPGs and real time combat. Multiplayer is a bit tough, but the single player part of the game can be enough to occupy yourself for hundreds of hours. Of course, as it is a strategic battle sandbox, it lacks some other possibilities, that are not crucial, but it would be nice if they were present.

In the heart of battle, where shadows loom,
I wield the Black Blade, casting out the gloom.
Forged in the fires of ancient Sparta's might,
It cleaves through darkness, bringing forth the light.
With each swing of the blade, I vanquish the foe,
Through the ranks of shadow heathens, I boldly go.
For I am the warrior, sworn to defend,
With the Black Blade of Carpathia, my battles I'll rend.
In the heat of combat, my sword sings true,
As I forge my own path, in the chaos I ensue.
With every strike, I carve my fate,
Defying the darkness, I stand as a gate.
With each swing of the blade, I vanquish the foe,
Through the ranks of shadow heathens, I boldly go.
For I am the warrior, sworn to defend,
With the Black Blade of Ravenholm, my battles I'll rend.
Through fields of sorrow, and valleys of despair,
I march with conviction, my purpose laid bare.
For the Black Blade guides me, with its ancient call,
To fight for justice, and stand proud and tall.
With each swing of the blade, I vanquish the foe,
Through the ranks of shadow heathens, I boldly go.
For I am the warrior, sworn to defend,
With the Black Blade of Hellfire, my battles I'll rend.
So let the darkness tremble, and the shadows flee,
For with the Black Blade of Jupiter, I am truly free.
In the crucible of battle, my destiny's unfurled,
As I wield my sword of courage, and conquer the world.
From a dim-lit tavern, a revolution begins,
As voices rise in anger, and hope kindles within.
For the forest we cherished, now but a memory past,
Lost to our longing, and our dreams that didn't last.
With each swing of the blade, we challenge the night,
Rising up as warriors, to reclaim our right.
For we are the rebels, against fate's cruel hand,
With our swords forged in fire, we'll make our stand.
Through the ashes of despair, we'll rise once more,
To rebuild the world, from the depths we'll soar.
With courage as our compass, and unity our guide,
We'll carve a new path, with our dreams untied.
With each swing of the blade, we challenge the night,
Rising up as warriors, to reclaim our right.
For we are the rebels, against fate's cruel hand,
With our swords forged in fire, we'll make our stand.
So let the flames of revolution, light up the sky,
As we march into battle, with fire in our eye.
For though the forest may be lost, our spirit will withstand,
With the Black Blade of Witches, we'll reclaim our land,
The kingdom of another land, the world of kingdoms yet to come and a language fore none,

There was a moment in the beginning of its early access where battles looked just awesome - made me feel like i was right there, in some epic movie with horses falling, people screaming, swords and shields slamming.

Now - just look at the videos. Horses and people running around in tight blobs. Dear devs, look at some classic movies with many people/horses on the battlefield (not computer graphics; real people and horses). It would be suicide to have cavalry charges so ridiculously tightly packed.

I have played this game since it first released in early access however many years ago. My review has always been ""No"" until now, but it still is a really rough recommendation.

This game is a huge sink of wasted potential. It's a giant sandbox with a bunch of jank and half finished ideas. The ""story"" is ridiculous and everyone avoids it; the only reliable way to have decent wealth is by crafting weapons for unreal amounts of money; the AI even on the highest difficulty is stupid in all decision making; combat is block and hit until someone forgets to block, etc.

Aside from the million half baked ideas, there's a million glitches and bugs that influence how you play the game. Attacking units during sieges frequently get stuck on nothing and stand around until they get shot and die. Defending units will send archers straight into enemy infantry to presumably reach an impossible designated ""archer spot"". You can recruit mercenary clans into your own kingdom as if they were regular nobles, giving them extra utility and making your kingdom the strongest in the game with no consequences.

The game is shallow, disappointing, and broken. Yet, it's still fun. This game is similar to how I feel about Escape From Tarkov; the game is terribly made and the developers don't care now that they have buckets of money, but the concept and mechanics are so unique that you won't find another game like it. 

The combat is stupid simple, but still slashy and fun. The bugs break certain features, but allow for cheesy strategies. The AI is braindead, but you can ignore them altogether and force everyone to do whatever you want to do. It's terrible and yet still manages to give you a medieval kingdom experience that you won't be able to find anywhere else.

It feels morally wrong to buy this game. Maybe buy it on discount, or from a key reseller, or from very legitimate 3rd party sites that offer games for free. If it seems interesting, you'll probably like it. I think the predecessor to this game, Warband, is the better purchase with more fleshed out features, but you'll likely still have fun with Bannerlord.",1586214768,1707627039,True,0,0,0.562900304794311523,0,True,False,True

2022 EDIT:
This game is in an atrocious state, absolutely not ready for full release. Crashes continuously, it's still almost as empty of things to do as it was 2 years ago, and the multiplayer is very bad.


I'm pretty disappointed. I really love Mount&Blade and I've waited so long for this game, the developers promised a lot of things that maybe I had too many expectations. The game is very addictive, the battles gameplay is very good and I like the graphics, but there are too many things that are wrong.
SINGLE PLAYER:
The game is missing too many features! Early access means that the game should be almost ready and only needs refinish/minor additions, but here they even haven't finished the main quest. I'm at my second run in the main campaign, and I am currently forced to stop playing because there's a crash that happens when as soon as you complete the ""weaken empire"" quest, so I'm waiting for a fix. The other quests are few, maybe 5 in total, that repeats over and over. As soon as you progress in the game there are less and less things to do, you don't know what to do with all the money you're making. The management part of the game is lacking features, since the settlement upgrades are bad implemented and poor. 
MULTIPLAYER:
This entire section has nothing that can be saved at the moment. It's like this is a different game from the single mode. If they'd be selling single and multi separately, I'd have asked a refund for the multiplayer part of the game. There are 0 (ZERO) siege servers in Europe, and to find a match I've probably waited 25 minutes last time. The gameplay is completely different from the single player, and from the previous Mount&Blade games: the block system has a delay, you can't pick the equipment you want anymore but you have to choose loadouts with pre-assigned weapons and armors, you can only pick 2 ""perks"". There are 3 game modes, that are pretty boring after a few matches. 

I really hope that the game will improve, and I will of course change my review if there will be some major changes, but at the moment at with this price, I don't recommend this game.",1587294765,1707587836,False,1,1,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,False

I've started up several campaigns now and I get very far into the game every time when something inevitably causes the save to fatally crash. This last play-through was the first time I had tried Ironman mode. It made for an interesting and challenging campaign. Then, inexplicably after hundreds of hours playing, the save file became corrupted when the diplomacy mod did something and was unrecoverable. NOT EVEN A PREVIOUS SAVE POINT WAS AVAILABLE TO LOAD FROM! WTF, TALEWORLDS?!

I love this game! It's such an absolute blast that I hate to give it a bad review but I can't forgive the lack of stability after years of development.  I had started my ironman save as a black where I learned how to make every piece of every weapon. I then joined Valandia, helped it conquer 60% of the map. I eventually got tired of the Kingdom's ineptitude and seceded, forming my own civil war against King Derthert. I won the war turning the civil war into a revolution where I was finally able to form my own kingdom and enact my own policies/give titles and lands to my companions. I had just got myself to peaceful point and was gathering support from other Lords through the diplomacy mod's messenger system when the save file became corrupted. My God! It was an epic play-through and I am so upset that it ended the way it did, not of my choice, but because of some buggy Bullshit!

Now, I had started the play-through  on vanilla but later added mods as I began to realize how broken the kingdom diplomacy systems were against you, the player. I added the diplomacy mod, improved garrisons, dismemberment, realistic combat, and the advance time mod. These were it. Nothing game shattering except for the diplomacy and garrisons mods. But that's beside the point. Why in the hell, TaleWorlds, is there no backup (fail-safe) save when playing the ironman mode for situations such as these when the whole save file corrupts? I want my save back, but I know I can't have that, and that sucks. That sucks big time, because it was just getting really good. Oh well, but I can't recommends this. I can't bring myself to play this game again. Not after so many play-throughs that broke for one reason of another/became unplayable. Every time I get invested. I play the vanilla, realize the vanilla is shit, then install mods which inevitably destroy my saves causing me to have to step away for a while before I can bring myself to start up another character again. In the end, it just becomes a whole big waste of my time. I'd love to finish this game, but that's never gonna happen because the game's mechanics suck and the mods make it buggy as hell. So I gotta uninstall it and try not to look back. Maybe someday, when the it's all possibly stable, I'll reinstall the game where it will have worked out all its kinks and be able to enjoy it on vanilla, no mods required, because everything will make sense. I doubt that day will come since it's been years since I first picked this game up and not much has changed. But, maybe Taleworlds, we'll see. Fix your shit. Make this game enjoyable. YOU HAVE A WHOLE MODDING COMMUNITY SHOWING YOU HOW IT""S DONE. Ask those developers how they're doing it and implement their mechanics. Go deeper, expand your world like they're done for you. And for God's sake! Just get the authors of the realistic combat and dismemberment mods to rework your battles.I saw a marked improvement in my fun and immersion once I installed those mods. Just ask them how they did it. Also, look a Bannerkings and Calradia Expanded. Please. We want more and official so that it's stable and we don't have to risk losing our save files downloading something that will inevitably corrupt them after every new patch.

02/08/2024 And 50 hours later in yet another playthrough...

I'm fucking done! It happened again and not on Ironman this time! This time I tried the Bannerkings mod! Nothing I do can stop the game from ending at some predetermined date! I LOVE this game! I want it to be successful, but I also want it to be stable enough to WORK! If it were a perfect game it wouldn't need mods. Alas, it NEEDS mods to be a good game! I am so sick of LAZY developers not implementing better mechanics into their games, therefore necessitating MODDERS to do it for them! Fuck you TaleWorlds! And fuck your modders! Both of you know how to make ANYTHING stable! I will never get to finish this game because of it's poor, unfinished, and buggy state! I get SO FAR! I get to the very TOP of my playthough and then BOOM! My game's broken beyond compare either to some unending update of the game (Seriously developers! You fall into the same trap as Creative Assembly where, because of eternal updates, we can never have a definitive, stable version of the game where all the mods aren't egregiously broken with each update/patch, therefore breaking my game and saves, thus destroying my deeply invested playthough!) or due to some facet of a mod not working! I just want a game that doesn't need mods, because it was made perfect. Sounds like that's Baldur's Gate 3, I guess. So fuck it! Might as well play that rather than continuously waste my time on this piece of shit game.

Dear TaleWorlds:  I use diplomacy and A.I. improving mods because your A.I. SUCKS! I use mods like improved Garrisons and Realistic Battle Mod because your mechanics SUCK! I'd play this game on vanilla if it was actually good/fun! The fact that you continuously have to roll out updates and patches, even now a full year after your supposed ""full release"" date, is a testament to how shitty your game is! Go back to the drawing board! Fix it, or don't ! I no longer care! I can't anymore! The grind, the beginning struggle, the rise to power and conquest, only to then lose it all because the game/mods bug out is just too much. I couldn't play vanilla because I constantly found myself at WAR with EVERYONE and was the only lord in my Kingdom doing anything whilst staving off attacks from EVERYONE that the game no longer became fun or realistic for me! That's why I turned to mods in my last playthrough that eventually broke it! You want me to be at war with everyone, then that's okay, but goddamn! Don't make me the only Lord forming an army and fighting the war! How stupid and unrealistic! Make a functional diplomacy aspect of your game! Copy and paste the Realistic Battle Mod instead of trying to make your own thing. And make you bandits a bigger threat! I really liked that from the Bannerkings mod. I also played the dynamic armory mod in conjunction with Xorberax's Legacy Mod. All of that was fantastic! All of it made great changes/additions to the base game! Please take a page from these mods as it all raised the stakes/made the world so much more believable! Until then, I just can't! It breaks my heart every time when my game breaks beyond all repair! I can't do this again, Man. I just can't!",1644384048,1707449984,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

No matter how much money, soldiers, lords you have on your kingdom : the others kingdom will, just like that, take more settlement than you can, and here's why :

1) I've wipped out Sturgia, and yet those guys are STIL ROAMING ON THE MAP, then they came back with like an army of almost a 1000 mens, because some clans just appeared out of nowhere and joined Sturgia (for whatever reasons : they are f*cking HOMELESS for christ sake), to besiege a castle while i was far away. In the previous Mount and Blade : Warband, when a kingdom doesnt have any settlements : they just f*ck off, but here ? Unless you behead all of them (wich will f*ck up big time your reputation) they will still find a way to mess with you.
[EDIT : Apparently this is no longer the case anymore : they do f*ck off when they dont have any settlement left. This alone doesnt change my take on this game but this is a reaaaally good start. I'm honestly just waiting for a diplomacy update to have a second take on the game]


2) So while i was at war with the Aserai a the very south of this big world map : THREE OTHER KINGDOM decided it was the right time to declare war. So they start to siege everything, and then 3 per 3 and even 6 per 6 : all those kingdoms with a total of half of my mens just f*ck up hours and hours of never ending siege.

3) Yeah because you are constantly at war. I f*cking swear, the longest time of peace i've ever had was like a week. If you rule a kingdom, this is the only thing you will ever do : siege, protect your settlements from being sieged, take prisonners and SOMETIME bribe ennemy lords to join you.

So yeah, after the ""every remaining kingdom decided to go to war against you"", i just lost severals hours of siege that i have done by myself because the lords in my kingdoms just can't do sh*t. When they do take a castle, they just get destroyed by some fresh army that appeared with a thousand mens out of nowhere.

So what now ? Well there is no alternative. There is no real diplomacy that can avoid the constant endless sieges and wars, you cannot give armies specific orders (like asking an army to just go somewhere for exemple) or anything like that. Constent. Endless. Battle.

And here they are, proudly annoucning that this game is out of early acess : yeah sure mate.

However, it also suffers from some issues, such as bugs, performance problems, repetitive gameplay and shallow mechanics. Here is my review of the game based on my experience playing it on PC.

[h2] Graphics: [/h2]
The game looks much better than its predecessor, with more detailed models, textures and animations. The environments are varied and realistic, and the weather and lighting effects are impressive. The battles are especially spectacular, with hundreds of soldiers clashing on the screen. However, the game also has some graphical glitches, such as clipping, pop-in and low-quality shadows. The game also requires a powerful PC to run smoothly, especially in large battles and sieges.

[h2] Combat: [/h2]
The combat system is one of the best features of the game. It is based on directional attacks and blocks, which makes it challenging and satisfying. You can use different weapons, such as swords, axes, spears, bows and crossbows, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. You can also ride horses and use them to charge or maneuver around the battlefield. The combat is realistic and brutal, with blood, gore and dismemberment. However, the combat can also be frustrating at times, due to the unresponsive controls, the inconsistent hitboxes and the unfair difficulty.

[h2] Quests: [/h2]
The game offers a variety of quests that you can complete for different factions, lords and towns. Some of them are simple tasks, such as delivering messages, escorting caravans or hunting bandits. Others are more complex and involve intrigue, diplomacy or war. The quests are a good way to earn money, reputation and influence in the game world. However, the quests are also repetitive and boring after a while, as they lack variety, depth and creativity.

[h2] Diplomacy: [/h2]
The game features a complex diplomacy system that allows you to interact with different factions and lords. You can form alliances, declare war, negotiate peace or trade agreements. You can also influence the politics of your faction by supporting or opposing certain policies or candidates. The diplomacy system adds a lot of strategy and role-playing to the game. However, the diplomacy system is also flawed and confusing at times, as it lacks transparency, feedback and consistency.

[h1][b] Conclusion: [/b][/h1]
Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord is a game that has a lot of potential but also a lot of problems. It is a game that can be very fun and immersive but also very frustrating and boring. It is a game that can be enjoyed by fans of the genre but also disappoint them with its shortcomings. It is a game that needs more polish, optimization and content to reach its full potential.",1707325076,1707325076,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

You will need some MODS to just make this game a better experience, it has been about 4 years or so since release and they still haven't finished the Main story quest which will basically break your game and have all factions declare war on you and you cannot stop it unless you outright ignore it. Mind you they do have a sandbox mode but the fact they have a story more implemented but not finished is sad. 
Pros: Fun combat
         Huge battles if your PC is good
         A massive world to let your imagination run world to an extent
         Numerous different factions with dress styles and armor types
          A revamped RPG system but is still kind of bad
Cons: Diplomacy system is a literal joke mod it or you wont have fun
           You have no dictate over fiefs and if you wanna choose a better person itll cost you all your influnce points depending on how many ppl vote against it.
          The lady models are just absolutely terrible looking making finding a wife difficult
           Combat is repetitive and not in depth at all mostly hack and slash stupid AI.
            Sieges are generic and easily cheese-able.
            Overall DO NOT buy this full price but just know when you get into this it is soulless and lifeless compared to Warband and they put major updates out at a snail passe.

I buy the game 2 years ago. I played for 20 hours and decided to leave it until the developers finish it completely.After 2 years i play again. And what i See?

1) My Vlandish crossbowmen cannot shoot from the mountain and hit enemy. The enemy 150-100 meters away and is much lower than my crossbowmen and they cannot hit enemys. All arrows fall 10-15 falling short of the enemy. On the plain they shoot at about 150 meters or more.
What kind of stupidity is this? The developers still haven't been able to teach shooters to use height?

2) Sometimes the size of the map is disproportionate to the battle.
For example, a 900 vs 700 battle near a village.
Yes, there is a village in the center of the map. I agree. But why is the map so small that you can’t get around the village? The battle was between three houses where I could not carry out any tactical maneuvers.The hills on the plains are sometimes also very surprising. They are almost mountains.

3)There is no normal training in the game.
a) What does the aggressive type of companion (when I create a squad for him)?
b) Types of damage: blunt, piercing, cutting. How do I understand which enemies need blunt damage or others? The armor has no resistance to blunt or others,only one, defence.
c) If you lvling your character and companions incorrectly, you can't reset skills. Even by the end of the first playthrough, you won’t understand what skills are needed in combination. It makes everything worse.
d) You can purchase businesses in the game. Leather workshop, forge, winery and others. But the game does not explain the mechanics of their work. How to make it bring more profit? 
e) How to manage a city or castle?Nothing is explained anywhere.U must rebooting and replaying fot understan mechanics. This greatly spoils the gameplay.


4)The game idea is cool. But the implementation is bad. This is not the first project ""Mount & blade"". Was it really difficult to create a knowledge base for the game? Moreover, it was released two years ago. And he looks like he was just released.

5)Sieges just look cool. In fact, it's just a stupid thing to do. Everything was done through the ass.
How to shoot from a catapult? No idea. Think for yourself. How to place 100 archers on the walls? No way! They have no place on the walls. This isn't Total War. Your archers will be waiting below when it's their turn to get punched in the face. Sieges no improvement after release, they are just as stupid as been.

6) It's good that there are a lot of mods for the game. But you need to spend time finding and installing them. So that they fit together. This is a lot of work.
The game certainly gets better with mod improvements. But this is not the merit of the developers.

7)Very poor army management. Yes, I understand that in ancient times this is how the army was controlled by generals. But I'm playing with an AI aand he doesn't care. I can't see anything within 30 meters if the fight is in the forest.AI dont care. 
If the battle is in the mountains, then you may not see half the army. It is clear that you cannot properly control the army if you do not see the battlefield.
It would be cool to make a strategic vision.Two years have passed and this problem still here.

This is just the first thing that came to mind. I can write a lot of examples. The game is closed for knowledge.Everything has to be learned in practice (save and reload) which greatly spoils the gameplay.

And last star of this game!
I say again. I play vanilla version. Latest. Without mods and cheats.Hard
Found a funny moment. I can sell captured lords in my city in a tavern, then go to the dungeon, take the same prisoners and sell them again in the tavern.Repeat until you get bored. Is the game really out of beta?
two years have passed. Has no one found this bug yet?",1587758777,1707285804,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I'll be honest.  Mount & Blade, M & B - Warband and M & B With fire and Sword are among my top 5 games ever.  They are simplistic, simple looking, easy to learn games with such an immersive environment.  Sure some of the quests are repatative but it is completely worth the grind.  

TW has had what? 6? 8? years to come up with, develop and release Bannerlord?  And what is the final product?  Barely playable.  

The graphics are improved for sure, if playing on the higher settings.  On the lower settings it's comparable to the previous titles, and it still lags like molasses in January. Barely playable.  Currently my game crashes whenever I go from a siege to assaulting the castle/town.  Any Castle, any town.  75% of the time the game crashes whenever I enter an tournament.  Barely playable.  The few times the tournament doesn't crash, all the participants can use are bows (not sure about crossbows) and fists.  FISTS?!?  It takes half an hour for mounted teams in tournaments to grind and punch and lag around the arena before the game crashes yet again moving on to the next tier of the tournament.  Barely playable.

It is my understanding these are the same guys from TW who made some of the best titles I've ever played, and I've played PC games since Sid Meyer's first Civilization.  If they had been bought out by EA or SEGA I could have understood the burning bag of dogs**t I paid good money for and see before me today but I just can't endorse this right now.  Not for a game that for all intents and purposes is broken.  I want my favourite games back, and I know TW has the potential to make Calradia Great Again!

I'm not telling anyone to not buy and play the game.  The game is broken but I still play it, with a severe taste of hot garbage in July in my mouth at the end of the day.  I'm just saying it could be the most perfect game out there and it's far from it.

***February 2024 update**
So this game is still not worth buying. Every single tactical battle crashes, so if you decide to play this burning bag of dogs**it, save often, especially before a tactical battle.  If any developer reads this, which I doubt, fix this shit!  I'd be embarrassed to put my name behind this.",1608352724,1707265763,False,5,3,0.404667019844055176,0,True,False,True

update : the game is now out of beta and has gotten steam workshop support. the workshop fixes most of the money problems the devs have been too lazy to fix. speaking about being lazy, turns out a story in a singleplayer RPG isn't something the devs think we need. i shall now summarize for it you, spoilers ahead ; you need to talk to ten lord all over the map (the lords are faster than you, so have fun running after them for days at a time) after talking to all ten, you need to talk to two other people (also miles a part of each other) one wants you to bring the empire back and the other wants you to not do that. is the 10/10 story telling showing yet? you pick what ever you want, your backstory, region you picked as your birthplace does not matter at all. (side note, the first game from 2010 made you spawn at the region you picked as your birthplace. i guess this was too hard to code for bannerlord) 

let's say that you want to make your own kingdom, how does one do that? simple, go take a castle from someone else, this will put you at war with said kingdom, the AI will then drop anything else they have going on and come steam roll you. your other choice is join a kingdom who is not part of the imperium, that's easy enough, do some quest for some lords, get's taken on as a sellsword and help them out. you can then get an upgrade as a Vassel for this kingdom, this allows you to maybe get a castle of your own after the kingdoms army takes out. here is the problem with that, chance are that if you by yourself take a castle, the king will just go ""nope, you can't have that"" but, if someone else takes a castle or town for that matter on the other side of the map, the king will just give it to you. you will then most likely lose it, since you don't have the money to have 400+ dudes to defend it and your own army. okay, so keeping all of this in mind, the MAIN QUEST then tells you to knock out the imperium people, there is three of them. and they need to have less than four castles in total. meaning that you will need to knock out 1/3 of the whole map to win. every single battle will play out the same, lords never die in battle and everyone hates you if you chop of their heads (does not matter how good of a reason you have for doing so) if you are able to only focus on the imperium people, i'm guessing this will take 100+ hours. the same battles, the same sieges over and over again. 

i have never seen the end of this game, and i most likely never will. since the only bloody fun i can find there is to mod the game until it cries for mercy and then i will stll drop it after 20 hours because i know what the next 200 hours will look like. there is nothing here that is worth your money. unless you want to grab mods and switch on cheats. i have waited 7 years for this game to come out, another 3 years for the devs to get their shit together. and it's still not worth the insane time and repeat of combat and sieges.

Problems
- Almost no tutorial on anything other than basic combat (swing sword, shoot bow). This is much worse because a lot of things are not intuitive.  
- Creating your own kingdom is basically impossible unless you are very good. To make your own kingdom, you have to go to war with at least 1 faction. They will outnumber you 10 to 1 easily. -
- War / peace is poorly implemented. As a vassal, your faction will continuously declare war then peace out so you just have a constant cycle of doing a few battles, peacing with them, warring on the other side of the map. repeat. Its so hard to win the map when you are mostly running back and forth. 
- Certain skills level up in the dumbest manners... and as I said above, no tutorial regarding how it works. 
- AI is so dumb. We will be at war on the east and they will create an army standing around in the west. 
- Since AI is dumb, you do most of the conquest / main battles. That sounds kind of good but the influence system severely hampers your ability to do a long campaign. 
- My faction kept declaring war while already in 1 or 2 wars.. this made it nearly impossible to own more of the map after a certain point. There is no reason to keep declaring wars... 
- AI armies regenerate too fast. You losing a battle is a big loss.. you winning a battle? They will just respawn that army / heroes / units in a few minutes.
- Factions need some balancing. I find the Vandals and the kuzuits? (east people) much stronger enemies. South faction is ok. Fighting any empire / northern faction is sort of a joke. Their units are so bad. 

EDIT:

The combat is atrocious and amongst the worst I've ever played. 
None of the rules that apply to you, apply to the AI - none of the physics either.
Swings go THROUGH shields for the AI while your swings go THROUGH them; the only difference is they damage and you don't. Directional blocking is so inaccurate, it's not even funny. I literally cleared my keyboard out of the way and had my whole desk to use. No matter how far left I moved my mouse, the blocking went where IT wanted to, not where I wanted it to go. How you manage to make something SO SIMPLE so incredible shit is beyond me. I hope this is fixed, but I highly doubt it.

In summation: Rules for thee, but not for me, says the game. Fuck off with this rigged nonsense.
And yes, the rest of the campaign is an exploitable cakewalk, but a good chunk is of it is combat - and combat is downright atrocious.

Update: After the new update the following happens
The AI cheats even more blatently now
Apparently hemp fibres are very resilient to blades, significantly more so than chain mail
Realistic damage only means to you, not the AI
The AI can hide behind its shield without ANY penalty or consequence, their shields NEVER break
When I say cheating, I mean go through shields and not around your shield; An NPC that was just staggered and hit by a cavalry charge doesn't flinch and can continue their swing unabated; reloading the crossbow doesn't mean the AI can't shoot while reloading out of their head somehow; you could be wearing the exact same armour as another NPC you're fighting, be a higher level than them and still get damaged significantly more by THEIR swing as opposed to doing the same thing yourself and only tickling them.",1592710400,1707169781,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

Long story short this is a full priced game for something that isn't even early access, more like pre-alpha. I might change my review once (IF) this game actually ends up finishing but as of right now huge waste of money, just go buy Warband, a significantly better game (that they didn't finish either but the modders did a great job). Full review below, it's not meant to be so negative but people who are spending triple A prices on a early access deserve the truth instead of only reading reviews of fan boys fawning over it because they finally got a new Mount and Blade game, if you are one of those people you will probably like it just because it has the Mount and Blade title, this review isn't for them as they won't care how bad it is hoping the modding community will fix it like Warband.

Will update review whenever this game is finally done or half complete but as of right now a giant waste of money. If you still feel like you have to buy this game (sandbox is fun but this game is seriously lacking compared to the first of it's name) buy it on sale, they want you to spend triple A prices on a game that is nowhere near finished. Bugs ... more bugs in this game than in a swamp in the summer. A huge chunk of the playerbase hasn't been able to play this game for a few patches now due to crash issues and that's not even considering the amount of crashes that occur from other bugs in the game. The main fear I have is this will follow suit to Warband where the same problem existed and they never fixed it leaving the burden of making a complete game to modders. Don't waste your money as I have, just wait and play something else in the mean time because this could be one of the greatest games ever, or it will completely flop and the devs will give up again. 

""The early access version of the game contains a wealth of content that will keep players engaged for many hours. While the early access version is very much stable and playable, players can expect to run into some obscure bugs and other issues while playing that we intend to locate and fix before the full release.""
This is also nonsense since no bugs are obscure, they are everywhere and in greater numbers than your army is ... many of them being Warband bugs lol. Also there is no wealth of content, as of the last time I played the game (due to the crashing of the game on load after a patch) the main story line wasn't even complete. It's basically run around and attack the same fortresses/castles over and over again with most looking the exact same depending on region. It's the same with the gear, sure there seems like a lot but there really isn't, per faction there is very minimal amount of gear and it all looks the same (including the units themselves). The actual live siege battles and the AI are trash, boring and low iq, everyone just funnels into the openings and it's a single target 20 minute cluster f, half the time the units being too close to attack each other and glitching out, at least if a shield wall worked than that kind of fighting makes sense but it's more like zombie hordes mindlessly running to a point. I really want them to fix/finish this game as I don't want to leave a bad review but as of right now that isn't possible and we are talking about a game that will probably be in early access for the next 5 years to full complete it properly. It's just so disappointing. This is not to say I've had some semblance of fun playing it but the majority of the fun has only been while playing with mods to compensate for missing features/bugs.

i love the game myself HATE the game for what they do (more like dont do)

this idea for the game is god like 
you and your big army smash into other big armies

what i dont like is a LOTTT
not going to list them all just whats off the top of my head

1 cant pick witch unit i want in witch group 
like you can do small things like 2 handed bow cav bow cav
but i want my crossbows in one unit my fian bows in another and all other types in one more
fian are snipers 
crossbows clean up armor

2 i wish you could pick what your cav fight better or what your ranged units attack or even if i can make a firing line
and all my range fire right into my spot

3 multi player would have been the coolest game on earth for my friends and i if they did better for cap fighting 

like 6v6 with like MAP 150 units fighting is lame to me

i would like 2v2  with close to100 units each player 
400 all in 
each side of 2 gets XXX points and they pick units each tema can set up a range play and one melee 
one cav and the other ranged or melee or all cav or anything

would better super cool how the fights turnout 

4 like every update all the mods dont work
you can lose save

5 making this you can make weapons why not cloths? and why  do you make the weapons cost so much i dont want to be a a salesmen going around town to town selling one thing cus thats all they have 

6 anything passed like owning more then 7town the game is just a slog of doing the same thing so much

7 i can become a king but i want a cool crowning thingy like i really walk in the city with my army about 50 come in with me all walk to the city square then the game takes over for a small cut that i get crowned then i stand up and boom back to me and the crowds are hype

8 the lore puts me to sleep 
more voice lines and better bandits more of them more type and better things for them to say 
    if i am not under a lord and have less then 5-10 troops i should can a chance to become a bandit if they catch  me
or in im not under a lord and i have like 30-60 troops the badits will try to pay me to leave

9 the little town things have nothing to them too 
i found some mods witch add to them but i think bace
game should have that 

10 plays should die more like 
i have 460 hours and i NEVER DIED
i have died of old age but never in battle 


ONE thing i LOVE 
the mods fix so many of the things
i hate this game for mods fix
just dont think thats how it should be

The downsides? Awful AI, woefully obvious rubber band mechanics, blocking is not pixel based, but creates a magic force field around shield. Features from Warband have been stripped, and the payoff from suffering through the back-and-forth ping ponging of flipping settlements in the campaign is wildly underwhelming. The vanilla game is shockingly bare, even down to things such as ""Variant string missing"" in the text boxes for bandit AI during encounters. 

As for story, this game has no idea what it wants to be. Factions are inspired by real world cultures, but none bears similarities strong enough to make you feel that you're playing as a version of that culture. There are fantasy elements, but the fantasy elements are weighed down by the similarities to real world cultures. It tries to be both, but falls flat since the story would be at best a 3-5 page short story, and can't seem to balance the fantasy setting with real world cultures. If you're looking for a rich story, look elsewhere, the entire story is told in ~5 minutes of cutscenes, and is 100% tell, don't show.

One of the most common forms of critical feedback is how the game is lacking features and end-game presence which were in Warband, and after grinding several saves out to the 'end-game', I feel that those criticisms are 100% justified. 

Diplomacy isn't even worth discussing as a feature, because it isn't one. It's a binary state of 'we murder each other now' or 'we murder each other later'. Relations do very little and make very little sense - I can execute someone's entire family, and as long as my relation is above a certain value with them, they still love me. 

The end-game encourages save-scumming to ether override / evade war declarations and related proposals from major factions and your own clan members. But this isn't a be-all-end-all solution, as the same declarations will still occur, albeit 30 seconds later, lending to a gameplay loop of besiege -> quicksave -> do meaningful action -> quicksave -> wait to start siege battle -> have war declared on you by three major factions at the same time -> quickload -> repeat until the next instance of everyone declaring war on you simultaneously. This is present in conjunction to the AI having ZERO preservation awareness. If they have a military strength of 1.5k, they will happily declare war on you even if you have 25-30k strength. Their armies will chase small stacks that they will never hope to catch or attack a settlement across the continent, leaving their own territory defenseless. 

Whilst those are just a couple of the pressing issues that mar the game past a certain stage of a save, the early-game is still enjoyable. It's a crying shame that once that point has been reached, it is likely that you will have a better time starting a new character than dealing with the unoptimised grind-fest that Bannerlord offers as a late-game.

Meanwhile, the developers release micropatches filled with 95% crash fixes, and when meaningful content does get released, it's a poorly-implemented feature such as the coordinated attack order or aesthetic additions such as 'more armour skins' or battle maps with no campaign-map sense / heads up as to what kind of scenery you'll be getting if you take a pitched battle, outside of save-scumming to enter the fight, scout the terrain and either commit or nope out; I'm on a bridge? cool! I'll get a bridge map.. except there won't be a bridge in sight. Whilst the battle maps are a cool addition, and I hope they continue to polish it, it feels like is taking far too much of their time that they should be investing on building the base game out and adding MUCH NEEDED FLESH to the bare bone that the current state of their product offers. 

Right now, I can't recommend this game as anything other than a basis for modders, as they continue to add / fix features that should have been in the game a long time ago, and that the developers have had four years to implement yet seemingly refuse to do so. 

To summarise: please add flesh to your skeleton of a game before trying to dress it in fancy clothes.",1706879806,1706879806,False,23,0,0.668524801731109619,0,True,False,False

Bannerlord Online
BO is a mod that essentially turns bannerlord into a MMO. You play the game mostly as you would in singleplayer. You're can play as a neutral and make money, or join a clan and fight wars. There are also bosses and various kinds of missions for players to do. It also features a fully player-based economy with markets at every city where players list items for sale and buy them. I highly recommend this mod to anyone who loves bannerlord and wishes it was multiplayer. Also, this is the easiest mod to download ever, all you need to do is download the launcher and make a profile.
https://bannerlord-online.com/

Persistent Empires
I didn't play very much of PE, but it is definitely worth mentioning, and a great mod. In PE, you play on one large map with several cities and castles that are owned by player clans. Clans can siege each other's castles and capture them. Being a part of hundreds of players sieging castles and controlling territory is a really cool experience and makes the mod worth giving a try.

Realm of Thrones
This mod is a single-player mod, and in my opinion, the best bannerlord mod. RoT is a complete overhaul that transforms bannerlord into the world of game of thrones. Of all the mods I played, this one was the most detailed, and comprehensive overhaul, and if you're a game of thrones fan this mod is exactly what you need.

It has a lot of ""just let me win one more battle and I'll go to bed"" in it. Highly recommend.",1706841334,1706841334,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has been out for awhile now, and they still make improvements to the game. Every time I come back after a few months something has been done which is honestly not bad because it doesn't have a game shop, and pushing new DLC while the game still has issues like Bethesda, etc.. I have 1600 hours in it mostly in early access. It's been much improved and continues to be. It's cool to see they added achievements, fixed some bugs, new bandit camps, etc. They do still have the meme male lords spawning with female specific clothing.. that is strange to see still lord dude wearing dress with a beard but, if that is your thing go for it. 

It just continues the story of Caldaria, same cultures as the first game. The main campaign is kind of generic, I believe the first had the same plot with the banner. It's updated graphics, unfortunately no shield maidens only sword sisters. I would have like to see a more unique clan specific units, that give options if your clan uses two handed swords, etc.. to equip the units with.. could be a cool DLC for later. You play the clan, so when your character dies your heir becomes your main character. Not too fond of the time limits on the main quest. It's been in 1.0 for awhile but, still is being updated I am not sure if they have plans for DLC, the first game had one DLC that added firearms. and a few other things but, I feel it has room for expansion threw DLC, if it added more map/ cultures, ships, content. It doesn't feel like there are many devs working on it from update to update. It does have a rich mod community, that seems interesting but I've only done no mods up to now. 

 It does still have lingering bugs, like enemies getting into places that are inacessable in sieges causing can't win because 2 dudes are stuck behind a door and the door is unable to be broken down. Other issues is The main quest in the campaign.. it's more like a tutorial, which is fine but they add random missions at a point that are just annoying, and timed.. go ambush this caravan, go beat this bandit camp, always on the other side of the map too...  that when the player is fighting wars, managing a kingdom etc.. it's just too much to do time. So for the most part at a point in the game I can only ignore the main quests that are really random missions.. I guess if you use console commands it's not a problem if you play normally it is a problem. I don't get why game testers don't play the game as intended to test it.. they would see these issues if they did. Console commands and is not a good game test, because they would see 3 dudes are stuck behind a door if they didn't auto kill everyone to win the battle. It seems a small team but, testers should have to play the game without console commands to test properly. I hate the main quest because it's annoying, not hard.. just annoying the sting of random crap it asks every 5 min.. that is drop everything and do this.. that is just only really viable if you cheat. The main quest becomes ""another settlement needs your help"" level annoying in this game. I find the sandbox mode the better game play mode, because the main campaign quest is just annoying after you've made a kingdom. The conspiracy quests are just the worst part of this game, as the miniutemen quests were in fallout 4, were they hard? no.. they just very very annoying and I can't get past it before it makes me want to quit.

------------------------------------------------

While I was looking forward to the shiny improved graphics and announced features such as siege weapons, expanded diplomacy, fathering a dynasty, and so on, the current solo campaign in it's current state is more a tech demo than an actual game. 

Attempting to play past the early stage is a frustrating unbalanced buggy mess not worth the time or effort (and this is coming from a veteran 1000+ hours Warband player and modder).
None of the announced features are fully fleshed, the AI scripting is terrible, companion/clan system is broken and that's just the tip of the iceberg. 

One would have thought that they would have expanded upon what was already working well in Warband before attempting to implement new game mechanics but instead prepare yourself for weekly hotfixes that do little to address the overall game balance for years to come.

You can siege enemy cities and conquer them, then you have to manage those cities its pretty complicated but not to much.

After 100 more hours of game play I have decided to add to this review. WOW THIS GAME IS TRULY AMAZING. Like all games they have faults. But this game I tell you is absolutely  beautiful with the map and the armor shining. But the combat is very balanced in some instances. This game is as much potential as you in life. All you gotta do is work for it, like in game you gotta steal or trade to get what you want. Get this game now while its on sale and for this price. I don't think it will be less and i don't believe it will go on sale for awhile after this one.

It's still a work in progress but there are frequent updates. Unfortunately, some updates can introduce issues like crashing when you enter a battle or a settlement.

At the time of writing, there are a couple of game play issues that need fixing imo. When you are a clan, it should be easier to declare war. You should also be able to get people in your clan to follow you once they have given them troops. Story mode has these annoying repeating quest - you'll know the ones. They are probably not as annoying if you bend the knee and are not trying to start a kingdom.

The in game diplomacy can be generously described as bare bones and interpersonal interactions are more or less not present.  Companions gain exp at a near glacial rate for most skills excluding the slots reserved for specific party role (Scout, Quartermaster, Medic, and Engineer).  While I like the weapon forging system and it can be fun to make weapons you like, it is rather hilariously broken as once you figure it out you can regularly make weapons that sell for upwards of 40k or more  destroying the economy.  The AI during war times can be rather frustrating having large armies of 600-900 men chasing around a 30 man group they have no chance of ever catching while the enemy could be sieging one of their cities not but a half days march away.

None are perfect simulations of medieval warfare or dynastic warlords. The Rags-to-Riches story we can tell with this portfolio of tools is unrealistic.

And yet, all the same, it's an appealing one. Between combat mechanics that are now quite frequently imitated, micro- and macro-management of armies and kingdoms, and a very dynamic set of maps and conditions upon which to battle, it's fun.

So, here's my dilemma: This game does all of the above with more of everything, and in a prettier package, too. The graphics exceed my expectations, sound and music keep me immersed in the world, and I even have an expanded means of creating a family, dynasty, and queendom of my very own.  Heck, there's even a crafting system where none existed before.  On top of that, there's a story you can follow (or completely ignore).

So, why can't I recommend this to anyone reading this review?  The friction.  In some ways, the limitations of the previous games, why restricting options, didn't constantly remind the player that there could have been a better way to do something.

You want to make a huge family of noble lords and patrol your territory (even on your own dime)?  Nope, you're limited to three parties.  

You want to take advantage of the new loyalty system that causes mismanaged cities conquered by foreign nations rise up and rebel?  Sorry, even if you buy up all the food in town and make the populace starve for months (which is tedious micromanagement), you may not see a rebellion.

Extravagant combat options for your various formations suddenly lose utility during a defensive siege and you're left hoping your ballistas aim at the correct patch of ground to take our the approaching battering ram. No new options specific to sieges exist.

There's a trading mini-tool that lets you offer X of something you have for Y of something another lord has, but I've not seen a single option of ""let's trade fiefdom for peace"" or ""here's something to establish an alliance against an enemy who's whipping your cool hwhip off the map"".

Running your own kingdom is friction in most ways.  Adding a new clan to your kingdom from one of your loyal companions mandates that you give them a fief, even when other kings are under no such limitation when it comes to you. Other kingdoms love dog-piling on you; if one has declared war, you can bet that at least two others will do so shortly.

Money is practically impossible to balance. Either your treasury is in the millions because you can smith weapons, or you're constantly on the verge of losing your whole army because keeping a full garrison in a city is impossibly expensive, even with a governor and empire tailored to keep those wages low. 

Speaking of which, you're hilariously limited in what your money can buy once you have more than enough. Upgrading mounted troops requires not just money, but also specific horses, which are rarely available in more than a dozen at a time from wealthy cities or specialized villages meant to produce them as a trade good.  If a city is running out of prosperity (and abstracted measure of wealth), there's no direct way to stabilize the situation from your own pocket.

Enough complaining. The overall impression I get is one of a game that is an excellent, involved time sink, but not a fun one. Crafting your own story with this game comes with the cost of forcing certain mechanics toward optimized, exploitative ends. Little wonder, then, that I have 300 hours and have learned how to min-max smithing, but not how to min-max my fun.",1706340497,1706340497,False,1,0,0.486049920320510864,0,True,False,False

I've Been playing the same campaign since i got this game on and off very casually, Mostly just grinding out cash by fighting in wars and trying to get as many cities as i could while being with the lame southern empire after they wiped out the based western empire early game, Eventually the northern empire wipes out half of Sturgia and takes the best city for defense Tyal (Imho, It's the side of a mountain and elevated enough where catapults/archers don't really have ""deadzones"" unless they get directly to your gate, Basically makes it so you have to have 3x the numbers to siege it high end troops and the inner layout is very easily defending even if the walls do get breached once you upgrade the city enough it's basically impossible to take as long as you have a good army on it) So i waited and built up close to 300k gold with the plan to take Tyal with the southern empire and then use it to eventually make my own kingdom using renown to make a army to take the nother nearby cities afterwards and rebel (Tyal makes for a really good chokepoint city to defend from the rest of the map/factions if you can take the other ones Sturgia owns) 

-We go to the city with about a 1500 stack, Most of the other hero NPC's bring recruits or other basic cannon fodder units whereas i bring 75 imperial legionaries and a bunch of archers, We lost about 1200 men including most of my high end units because the computer is braindead when leading a siege and thought taking on four catapults and close to 500 actually decent units was a bright idea because ""MoRe NuMbErs"" 

- The computer gives the city to some random NPC NAMED ORIGAND THAT WASN'T EVEN WITH THE SEIGE AND WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DAMN MAP not even giving the option for me to vote for myself, Frankly it pissed me off but i was like ""Eh whatever i can just trade for it, 50-100k and i'll get the city no problem.."" So i spent the next two hours trying to track this guy down, Every time i would go to where he was ""last seen"" he would magically be ""last seen"" on the otherside of the damn map, When i finally do find him he was in a one sided battle against a army and got captured and dragged off to a different city as a POW before i could save his dumb ass, So i was like ""I'll use some of my renown to see if i can convince the others of peace"" It didn't work of course because we were winning ....Annnd then the city rebels because he didn't put any troops or effort into the city >:(

So i go over to outside the city with my own army with the hopes of getting it for the ""iron price"" instead of gold, Use 400 renown to build a doomstack myself, Waited for the NPCS to come over and siege Tyal again, Lost a good chunk of guys but it was worth it. I spent the night in the city and waited for the vote for ownership notification to pop up, Again i wasn't even considered a option despite having a good reputation with most of the faction members and they gave the city to him AGAIN, So i hurried over to where he was ""Last seen"" to buy it off him and he was still there luckily, I selected to chat with him and go to the trading menu and of course it was bugged out, It didn't display any of his ""fiefs"" or anything at all in any of the categories, Luckily when i found him i saved so i thought ""Oh okay maybe it's just a loading error or something"" and i rebooted the game, Didn't fix it. So i thought maybe it was a file issue so i closed the game and verified integrity of game files and rebooted, I went to play and the game said basically said there was a ""module mismatch"" and asked if i wanted to continue, I figured it was just the old game file being updated and clicked yes, Immediately the game CTD, I reboot the launcher and clicked ""continue"" to just hop directly into the game, It didn't even launch it just immediately closed down. Basically my OG game file is now corrupted because i wanted to buy a city to get to end game M&B and i can't play that campaign at all now.

TL:DR; Save files corrupt very easily, NPC's leading armies/voting for cities are braindead, The ""last seen"" system for finding NPC's and the barter system is buggy as hell. Other than that this game is a great timesink to just relax when taking a break from toxic multiplayer games. I still highly recommend playing it, Everything else about this game is amazing. I just hope these small bugs can be hammered out so that i don't waste another 100 hours on a campaign only to lose it over something so simple",1706254423,1706254423,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The most optimal way to play the melee game in Bannerlord's multiplayer mode is to play it like a crappier version of the cover shooters that took up the better portion of the mid-to-late 2000s.

bugs, lacking of contents, crash,
but the developer is working hard, and i salute for that.

CONCLUSION/TLDR aka [Ain't Got no Time fo' Dat]...details below though
================
Bannerlord - Good potential. Better Battles than the other two. Still only 50% of what the others offer.
Warband - Great title. One of the few in its particular niche.
Prophesy of Pendor - A good example of a great game.

Graphics:

Bannerlord (8/10)
Characters look and animate a bit cartoony, but otherwise the large scale battles make you forget about it
Warband (6/10)
Good for its time, but a bit dated for modern expectations
Prophesy of Pendor (6/10)
Same as Warband, but offers more variety

Music:

Bannerlord (6/10)
Don't let the main music set too much of an expectation. Overland music is great...but repetitive. Battle music is great...but repetitive. Scenes have little to no music, and by far the best ambient music you'll get is from the tavern bards.
Warband (7/10)
Bit more variety, but similarly repetitive.
Prophesy of Pendor (8/10)
Scores highly due to the fact that they have different music for different areas and different encounters, which add rather than subtract to the immersion

Gameplay:

Bannerlord (5/10)
Half the gameplay that made the Mount and Blade title great is there - specifically the combat part. It was far FAR worse during the betas, and it's improved since, but it still lacks life. Apart from the battles, nothing else will grab your interest. Politics are nonexistent, Lords have little to no personality and will hardly react to your actions apart from 'acknowledging' the last settlement you took. ""Traits"" (Devious, Generous, Cruel, etc.) are near inconsequential to gameplay (unlike its predecessor). There's very little internal political machinations within kingdoms (seditious lords, rebellious clans etc.). Marriage is implemented strictly as a political tool, and your partner's traits are just as inconsequential as the Lords' (apart from their battle stats). There are many more flaws, let's just say that apart from battle, Bannerlord is lacking in every other part of gameplay.
Warband (7/10)
With the time it's been live, it's relatively polished. Most systems are balanced (Economy, Politicking), and battles are engaging. It offers a good baseline to a genre that only its title fills well.
Prophesy of Pendor (9/10)
It took the Warband formula and took it to a higher bar. Better Tournament mechanics and rewards, more diverse troops trees, and by far some of most lore rich game-worlds among games of its time. Whether you chose to roleplay to the hilt, or simply go for brute forcing battles until the whole map was monochrome, there was something for your specific playstyle. A good example of a great game.

Replayability:

Bannerlord (3/10)
While there's limitless ways to conquer the map, each and every one will feel the exact same once you've plowed through it more than once. The lack of relevant politics and with wars being started for the most obtuse reasons means apart from the color of the map at end-game, nothing will have really changed from minute 1 to hour 50 to hour 500. Lastly, volatile game updates mean that mods have a hard time keeping up, which also discourages large scale mod overhauls, which severely limits the longevity and variability of any given playthrough.
Warband (7/10)
Due to Lords playing a more active part in Kingdom decisions (sabotage, sedition, rebellion), most playthroughs will be starkly different from the next, and with the input of the player, it can be actively steered...something which its successor sadly lacks just yet. Also...massive (and stable) mod community.
Prophesy of Pendor (8/10)
Similarly to Warband, but with an advantage in additional ENGAGING systems for its end-game (Noldor, Hordes, Knighthood Chapters). It shores up the weak late-game grinding gameplay that Warband has...which is worth a point extra.

Price:

Bannerlord (Worth less than it's priced)
Don't get me wrong, it's a GREAT battle commander simulator, but I'd have paid around 150% of its price for Warband's systems with Bannerlord's graphics, and 200% if it had Pendor's systems. I'd be happy to do that, but at the moment, it's not worth it unless you overwhelmingly prefer very little apart from the battles (and they are GREAT, especially siege battles.) I played this game exhaustively once it became available for less than ideal means, and later on legitimately as a show of support for the developers, but it NEVER took hold for more than a week (around 10 hours gametime). Great for scratching the itch though.
Warband (Bargain)
Once you look past the dated graphics, the gameplay is extremely engaging in nearly every way.
Prophesy of Pendor (Absolute Gem)

Its an enormously fun journey on your way to forming a kingdom but when you get there you discover, like the Wizard, that the engine behind the game is just a facade. Its childlike in its design with huge missed opportunities and what would have been relatively easy wins. Prepare to be disappointed.

The other huge glaring issue is pole arms. Medieval combat is almost completely dominated by pole arms for a very good reason. However the combat engine completely fails to model any of the basics of hand to hand / formation combat and as such you not only dont see pole arms in action but you fail to get realistic fights. 

Finally, morale... Nearly all battles last till about the last 2 to 3 people decide to run away. Its just not plausible and it ruins the impressiveness of all the other beautifully implemented features.

You actual get much more out of the game if with mount blade and then the mods ! 

The multiplayer is still limited to castle siege only ! 

I would wish that this game became a mmorpg in a huge game world, where you can be elected to protect a keep or town for your realm and here you can make soldiers, build up the city, make sure your citizens are safe behind a huge wall, take your NPC army out and hunt down thief´s and robbers or join forces with other players into a HUGE army able to siege the other factions castle´s .. 

The game got potentials, but the game is still build in the old kind of way and just polished alittle bit !

Combat is to dull, the hit registrations is bleeh, the way of blocking is Bleeh !

I would wish that we could get a better way of fighting e.g. the same way you fight in games like Elder scrolls V Skyrim ! 
Just the way the characters run and or how you ride a horse is to dull .. 

and you cannot even use a spear on the horse to lanch with, you need to attack with it ! 

To lanch on a horse you just point and hold that spear tight while hitting the target, the damage impact and the force from it, comes from the heavy horse and heavy armor the rider is wearing, you dont fight with a lance, you lance with it, its not a spear, its a LANCE ! 

Game mechanic´s still to clumsy and dull 

Game engine -> The game should get a new one that is up to date, that can give the players alot better graphic´s and visuals and still performe outstanding with over 100+ fps, game engines like Remnant 2, For Honor, Hunt showdown ? thous games got alot better graphics and runs alot smoother at the same time ! 

So game developer, come with an update of the game where you convert the game client into using Unreal 5.3 or Cryengine´s latest versions or similar, because as i see it, then this game and the way it plays is outdated and boring because it is basicly just the same game as mount blade with nothing new under the hood, after so many years i had expected alot more from this game studio !",1705812003,1705812003,False,3,0,0.432553678750991821,0,True,False,False

After N years of dev they actually got the video aspect of the game right. Battles are more epic then ever. Alas - that's it, somewhat disappointing as for ""full release"".

Pros
- Decent companion system
- Larger battles with better command mechanics
- Involving economics
- Decently thought through skill trees with meaningful variety of ways of progressing
- Battle map and starting positions on those based on grid placed on world map - fairly unique approach that gives vibe of things really happening at some particular spot.

Cons:
- AI is dumb and as time progresses it only gets dumber
- Kingdom policy votes are fiction because decision making of certain lords always leans towards the same solutions
- Overall interactions with other clans are preposterously limited to the point of not providing even some of the things that Warband delivered on.
- Very limited control over various activities of your Clan",1705784222,1705784222,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Historically in the medieval era sieges where costly, being almost impossible to assault a fortification of any kind, only done as a last resort as even an inexperienced defender out numbered five to one could win in a castle. In here its just a glorified battleground. 

Honestly this just makes the game too easy and boring as i am able to win wars in a matter of weeks or maybe even days by just chain sieging places like its nothing. 
And i wish the battles where longer because walking around in the settlements is just so fucking cool.

A way to fix this could be multiple sieges within a settlement, like for a fort it would be two, consisting of breaching the walls and then clearing out the keep as a last stand. 
For settlements it could be three stages, the first stage is the same but clearing the village, the second would be clearing the inner wall, and a last stand in the keep. 

Would be a cool way to make wars more costly and harder, along with giving time for a relief force to arrive. Would also incentivise starving out the garrison. (and make ladders a siege deployable, that your soldiers carry in after the camp would be built, would make more sense)






Also unrelated but if you play this with the RTS camera and the RBM (realistic battle mod) mod it turns this game into an actual good total war competitor as rbm places more focus on positioning like medival 2 and rts camera just makes controling 100X easier so you dont just F1 + F3 every battle.

Like, I had high hopes, you know, because it's all medieval and stuff, and I thought it would be like, totally cool and everything. But nope, it's a complete and utter mess, and I'm, like, so over it.

First of all, can we talk about how this game just, like, crashes every time you try to do a siege? I mean, come on, I'm not here to deal with technical glitches. I'm a busy person with a busy life, and I don't have time for my gaming experience to be interrupted by constant crashes. It's, like, totally ruining my vibe, you know?

And don't even get me started on the forums. Like, seriously, they're, like, the least helpful thing ever. I go there hoping to find some solutions to my crashing problems, and all I get is a bunch of nerds arguing about mods and stuff. I don't care about your mods, okay? I just want to play the game without it exploding on me every five minutes.

Oh, and speaking of explosions, let's talk about how unhelpful the community is. I posted about my issues, and instead of getting, like, sympathy or solutions, I just got a bunch of people telling me to, like, ""git gud"" or whatever. Excuse me? I shouldn't have to ""git gud"" just to play a game without it turning into a dumpster fire.

Now, let's address the fact that this game is, like, so not user-friendly. I mean, seriously, who thought it was a good idea to make everything so complicated? It's like they want us to spend hours figuring out how to recruit soldiers or manage our fiefs. I have better things to do, you know, like, sipping my pumpkin spice latte and practicing yoga in my dad's perfectly manicured backyard.

And don't even get me started on the graphics. Like, hello? It's 2024, and I'm expected to play a game that looks like it's straight out of the Dark Ages? I deserve better, okay? I deserve stunning visuals that match the fabulousness of my Instagram feed.

In conclusion, Mount and Blade: Bannerlord is, like, a total disaster. The constant crashes during sieges are a mood-killer, and the forums are basically a black hole of unhelpfulness. I wouldn't wish this gaming experience on my worst enemy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go complain about it on social media and then, like, find a game that doesn't make me want to pull my hair out.

This review is of my viewpoint since Early access to now as of January 19th, 2024. I have to point out that I don’t really touch multiplayer side of the game all that often but from what I have gathered it is a fun experience on its own right.
[HR][/HR]
[H1] THE GAME [/H1]
Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord follows the trend of the other Mount & Blade games which each Viserion has built upon what has come before. Keeping with that tradition, this game revitalizes the older game mechanics with more RPG mechanics whilst giving the game a newer coat of paint. If you have played any of the other Mount & Blade games, then you would understand that each one excluding Fire & Sword basically replaces the previous game. This game follows that to the T. this has been going on since 2008.

For those who are new to this series of games, Mount & Blade, in a basic sense is an opened ended sandbox yet player character is not the center of attention. You are just a single actor on a stage with hundreds. Each one shifting the world ever so tiny bit. It is up to you the player to influence the world through actions. You can shift the balance of power. Aid characters to claim a throne or seize it for yourself. Plunge your nation into a forever war. If fighting is not your thing you can play as merchant, vagabond, or a noble. Whatever catches your fancy. The choice is yours on how you want to interact with the world.

The game still features the standard affair of combat systems that has been present ever since the original Mount & Blade in 2008. It has not really evolved since then but everything else around those systems has. Granted those systems work as it and been fun to play with since their inception, you shouldn’t fix what isn’t broke. In the most practical sense Bannerlord is just Warband with a new coat of paint so that it doesn’t look like it was the spawn of a late PS2 era.

The other improvements besides the graphical was semi upgraded skill system, where working similar to games like Skyrim where when you do a task you get experience in that task, you will often be present to choose between two-character perks in a skill set. Some perks or skills are rather powerful in Gameworld sense such as having a larger party, however there is no real way to respect a character as if you play enough, you could max out a character’s stat in every category but it will be both tough and time consuming.

You are able to create a dynasty, a family if you have the option enable on game creation where you can actually die of old age and the next heir to the clan becomes the new player character. This itself is quite interesting and feels very nice to the game, however because of it does drive home the idea the player character isn’t the ‘main character’ sort of thing, just another actor in the world. I do know that there are some people out there who could take over the entire map in a single character life but doing it over generations feels like something else. Just depends on how you want to take it.

[H1] CLOSING THOUGHTS [/H1]
Bannerlord is a wonderful game, but it is ultimately just the same game that had released almost 20 years ago but with a new coat of paint. I wish roleplay systems and other mechanics such as town management was overhauled, would be nice to have the ability to create your own towns/villages. For 50$ I would expect a lot more for my money, so I can only really recommend t his game when its at 50% off.",1705679950,1705680076,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Combat is what requires the least to say about, it's better animated, more satisfying and overall an upgrade from Warband. This represents the core of the game, hence the positive recommendation.

Graphics are likewise simply an overall upgrade, especially to the world map.

New features that Bannerlord introduced are very cool (such as smithing) but smithing in particular feels over (and poorly) designed, there's too many types of steel, requires too many button presses for all the various actions (smelting, refining, smithing). For instance you cannot refine multiple hardwood with one button press, so if you need 300 coal, without a perk you'll literally have to press the refine button 300 times, with a perk 150 times, that is just for creating coal. There's no way to save combinations of parts when smithing. All in all smithing is designed like the game's an MMO, including the random chance for getting better versions of the weapon being created. Smithing stamina moreover also presents more tedium by forcing the player to constantly leave the smithy and wait (you can also not see your stamina outside the smith either).

Mechanics such as army management have improved much from Warband. An army is clearly defined in this game, in contrast to Warband where an army was simply several lord parties following a leading party (technically there were no 'armies' just several lords following another lord).

The game user interface has seriously improved in terms of quality, going from looking like cheap JPG's to what looks like it's been designed by an actual UI designer.

It is possible for the player to actually die in this game if an official sub-mod is enabled. Both from combat reasons and old age. It is therefore possible to actually face a game over screen if the player doesn't have a partner and an adult heir.

Mechanics such as workshops rely on a very advanced trade simulation running in the background where villagers and caravans constantly trade (sell and buy). While this is for sure an interesting system, it is so advanced and dynamic that most players end up simply having to guess which workshop will be profitable and raise revenue. Towns that should and do receive the necessary raw goods to operate a specific workshop may in fact not be profitable regardless because of the aforementioned trade simulation. For instance there may not be high enough demand for the good your workshop produces, but there's no tangible way to gauge that demand beyond simply spending weeks (months?) in-game looking at the trade activity.",1705579745,1705579745,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've played several campaigns now but I've just reached the end game again in my most recent playthrough. I am amazed at how bad the end game story quest is. SPOILER ALERT: A coalition of enemy factions all jointly declare war on you, they're overall power is artificially boosted by about 2000 to make it more of a challenge, pretty lame but I get why they do it, but the trouble is it doesn't matter how much you batter them their power doesn't go down, so the end game is virtually impossible. WORST OF ALL, the game developers for some reason thought it would be clever to block the peace option, even if you are destroying the enemy on every measure and they are desperate to pay you thousands per day for peace; the game just says nope.
They also still haven't fixed the ridiculous amounts demanded by lords to join your kingdom, I mean they sometimes ask for a million or more. Even if you are at 100 relation with them.

Cons:
- For a game that's so much about running a kingdom/clan, it sure is a nightmare to try to get by with the tools in vanilla. Mod: improved garrison makes it better, but still it's hell when your fiefs starts piling up. I can't understand why something as easy a clicking a castle/town to enter city/castle management is not implemented. If the argument is ""it's not realistic"", then what is in this game? You could have a time delay on your orders being active, if you want to pretend that a messenger carries it, but only being able to run a city or castle by being there in person!?! WTF.
- AI in battles and making troops actually listen/respond to certains orders is awful. Sometimes, they just don't work. Cavalry is a joke. Try to make them charge archer-line? Could not make it work with either charge, engage, movement first and then charge or engage. Just ran up and stopped and started melee without any charge. 
- Mods are compulsory to the degree that you should only lose achievements if you don't mod the game
- Riddled with bugs and problems. Some of these are due to mods, but when mods are essential, that is a problem. Even without mods there are stupid things happening. E.g. last solider of enemy is stuck inside a wall and can't be killed. Have to retreat and attack again. Dying sometimes ends up in the same solution due to the AI just running around in circles with each of the battle-forces without engaging each other. Super annoying if you've set the stage for en epic battle with decent tactics just to see it wasted as soon as you go down. 
- The ""side-quests"" are super boring and repetitive. The hideouts are also a joke. 
- NPCs have no personality whatsoever. 
- Graphics is a sore topic for discussion. When it comes to battles, I'd say its what to expect from pure volume of things going on. I'd say I find the performance pretty good for that. 
When it comes to graphics of heroes, cities, hideouts and everything where you don't have the excuse of 1000 combatants hammering it out, it is a joke. All look like it's been made in the early 2000s. 

Pros:
- The idea of starting a clan/kingdom and being able to participate in battles as general and warrior is really cool. Just wish it cut down on several other elements of the game to increase the quality of essential functions. 
- Arena and first battles were fun. Siege is also mostly fun
- A lot of different troops and always fun to upgrade.
- For people that get by with the micromanagement and other cons listed, the game has endless potential. As seen by multiple 2000 hours+ game reviews. 

Conclusion
For me it was hard to put down in certain phases of the campaign build up, but still didn't really felt like I was having fun. Mostly I just felt caught in a hamster wheel of micromanagement hell. Still don't regret buying it, cause it's nice supporting such an ambitious idea. Quadruple the budget, use modern game development tools and perhaps bannerlord 3 will be playable for me.

But i have three big issues with the game, and i loved ""mount and blade warband"", that game was so good. But my isses are this, first the enemies unlike warband zerg you. Where in warband they would attack individually which makes sense, but in bannerlord they zerg. Almost morphing into each other, which makes it impossible to fight more than 2 people at a time. Makes zero sense and really ruins the game play. My second issue is the factions that use a lot of cav. Its very stupid, and again ruins the game. One faction uses nothing but horse archers, which probably the dumbest unit in both bannerlord and warband. The other faction uses both horse archers and lancers. Over 70% of all of there armies on the map are made of horses. My third issues is the game has incomplete story line, which granted it is a ""early release"" game. But still, if your gonna charge over 40 bucks for a game then have it at least have a completed story line. Aside from those 3 issues the game is amazing. However i don't think the devs will change the horses or the zerging enemies, which will most likely kill the game very quickly. Thankfully some people have already noticed these issues and have made mods to work around the stupid dev designs in place. There is one that gives the units proper spacing to get ride of the annoying ""zerging"" that the enemies do. There is another mod that reduces the amount of cav an enemy can have in one army, the same mod has an option to remove horses from the game completely ""this is my favorite option"". If it was not for modders, this game would be a lost cause. If you are new i highly recommend looking up some mods before you quit playing or get a refund, the game does have huge potential once these things are fixed. Its shame tho the devs thought it was a good idea to add so many horses into the game, why in the world would they think it would be ""fun"" to fight over 100 horsemen with arrows? Or implement the zerging into the game? The warband game previous was so freaking good, and yet they didn't copy it over to the new game....WHY??? It would have been such a good game if they would have. Imagine it with no horse archers, and limited cav plus the warband attack anamations from warband.

This game is worth it for $20 WITH MODS maybe.

The AI fails to make proper use of siege engines, and combat feels dated and stiff. 

You can still have a good time because of the nature of the game but I genuinely don't understand where development time and money went. It didn't go to multiplayer because battles are half-baked maps and combat feels a tenth as good as any of the chivalry or mordhau games, and it didn't go to singleplayer because all they added was an end to the boring story and fixed siege ladder AI sort of.

On foot combat is awful, by far the worst on foot combat I have ever seen, tries to be complex with the multiple attack directions but none of that matters when the enemy has a shield. Opponents are just up in your grill with absolutely no way to out manoeuvre them. 

Most fights in arena result in me strafing around my opponent and just spamming the attack button with the occasional block. Fights in huge armies are just straight up rng as to wether you die or not either to a few stray arrows or being impaled in the back. There is zero skill involved in this game, Skyrim had better combat and that's donkeys year old. Only saving grace is the mounted combat which is actually quite satisfying until you get peppered by arrows and die.

We eventually raised an army and tracked them through the Western empire, captured the bandit leader, and saved my siblings. Eventually, I had enough finances to move back home with them, so we returned to the Celtic nations.

Then I got a name for myself killing bandits and eventually fell in with the High King Caladog, who liked my work of keeping his lands bandit-free, so he made me his vassal.

Right after this, my brother married a Rus viking babe. Then i found this ancient dragon banner and after asking around with the nobility in the area found out it was an ancient symbol of the right to rule for all kingdoms around, so I gave it to High King and he lauded me with praise and position and asked what I would have in return. I asked to marry his daughter.

This would be important since Caladog was taken in as a small child by the old High king, who mysteriously died a few years later. It would be wisest to leverage his daughter against a possible betrayal in the future. However, he wanted 60k denars to wed her, so I went and talked to her personally and we hit it off. She eventually started to really like me because I saved her ass once, and then she wanted to marry me. Her father then reduced the wedding dowry to 10k, and I married her. She hates the Rus though so holidays are gonna be hell. I went on a raid to celebrate.

So the High king Caladog decided it was a good idea to declare war on the entire Middle East and I had to show my support. They were paying us tribute and have just about as many men as us, and there's a good chance this could end us all, but if I didn't, I risked my position in the kingdom. Being married to his daughter and all, if he dies, she becomes Queen and I become King. But right after the declaration of war, my wife is all ""I'm with child"". Fuck.

Anyway we captured our first settlement, now we just have to hold our own against....well, the entire Muslim empire.",1705421379,1705421379,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,False

I myself was an absolute fan of the Mount and Blade series, it was unique, interesting, and had so much replayability, especially if you took mods into account. I started playing warband, and have many hours in that game, and I was on the hype train for many many years for Bannerlord since it was announced, I will say that I was sadly disappointed in what Bannerlord became compared to what I had hoped it would be from all the devblogs and everything I was reading. I do understand a lot changed from the original goal, and the team being restructured, and a lot of problems that came up, though im honest, and I was disappointed, I expected a lot more from it. 

Now is the game good? Yes, I think so, its Warband, but better overall I would say, if you enjoyed Warband, you will enjoy Bannerlord. They absolutely nailed the combat, its incredible, where I feel the game fell short was the Campaign map, a lot of people dont care about this, but for me the singleplayer was what I loved, and I had hoped it would be much more intricate compared to Warband, and sadly its not that different, just a few new interesting mechanics that I do enjoy.

- NO AI : NPCs run straight to nearest enemy and randomly attack or defend, literally. You can kite an entire army alone with your horse while your archers destroy them.
- NO Economy : Sources of income are broken. For example, a mercenary contract do not cover the cost of maintaining your army, for a group of 90 mans i got like 300 gold (while group maintenance cost 500 gold)... On the other hand, a lord will ask you to bring him 3 horses and give you 5000 gold... Nothing makes sense, and it's hard to makes profit if you're not constantly fighting and raiding.
- NO lore : They try to had lore, but it's so ridiculously made that i hardly remember any of it. I can't name kings after 500+ hours xD.
- NO fun : do not expect to be surprised or challenged. Every single game is identical and will inevitably ends in boredom.

This game clearly lacked the love and ambition it needed to become a good game. It's an engineer game, the devs were happy to develop their engine but are unable to design an effective game with it.

To give you a short summary of this game:
You start out as a warrior / noble. You go from village to village, town to town completing quests, fighting in arenas, recruiting Mercenaries into your army, joining a faction, and then joining a larger army and going to war with other factions. 

The combat system is highly addictive as the battlefields and sieges tend to have hundreds of units on the screen at once. You are in full control over your character and try to kill as many units as you can to avoid casualties to your own troops that you are also able to command and change formations. 

I think what really draws me in here is that you are raising your own group of mercenaries, and watching as they grow and level up. You also get to recruit commanders/heroes that you can fully equip with gear and so fourth. This makes every battle engaging because you truly don't want anyone on your side to die and heaven forbid your entire army is wiped out meaning you would have to start over.


Downsides: 
- The intro to the game is rather slow as you go around fighting small groups of looters and raiders.
- The quest systems is incredibly repetitive. I feel like you get the same handful of quests over which breaks the immersion.

I've been a long-time player of both Warband and Bannerlord, starting from the days of modest PCs to now owning a high-end gaming rig. My journey with these games has been a rollercoaster of emotions, primarily driven by the expansive modding community.

Gameplay Experience: The core concept of these games is brilliant, offering a unique experience unmatched in the gaming world. However, the vanilla versions, especially Bannerlord, have left me wanting more. Mods have been essential in enhancing my gameplay, suggesting a gap in the base game's content and features.

Development Concerns: Despite the game's critical acclaim, I've noticed a worrying trend in the developers' commitment. The slow pace of significant updates and the lack of engaging new content raise questions about the long-term vision for these games. Community interactions, especially in the hub, often leave much to be desired. Critical questions about content updates and roadmap plans are frequently overlooked, with a preference for addressing less impactful issues.

Regarding Bannerlord: If you're considering Bannerlord, I'd advise first looking at Warband. With its rich array of mods, Warband feels like a more complete package. Bannerlord, while promising, still seems like a work in progress.

A Cautionary Note: I urge potential buyers to do their due diligence. Examine the community hub, understand the current state of the game, and consider if it meets your expectations for value and content.

Final Thoughts: The gaming industry has evolved dramatically, and not always for the better. Games like Warband and Bannerlord remind us of the potential in video games, but also of the pitfalls of unfulfilled promises and inconsistent development. Here's hoping for a brighter future in gaming.",1705158018,1705158018,False,7,0,0.523506224155426025,0,True,False,False

I have 420 hours in M&B Warband (probably hundreds of hours more from ~2010), and ~270h in Bannerlord at the time of writing.
MERITS
1. Really fun combat, picking troops off with ranged feels amazing, horse mounted overall is fun, but, on-foot melee combat feels clunky with directional combat (just a preference). 
2. Smithing skill is a good skill addition, though, it would be cool to have more options to include bows and armors.
3. Execution of lords was an interesting addition to the game from Warband. Suggestion to make execution a toggle button, with multi-select of lords wishing to be executed, have a confirmation box and allow for mass executions rather than clicking each one individually and waiting ~15 seconds for the same animation to be played.
4. Creation of armies with multiple lords as a single entity is a great addition and helps manage lord AI during war.
DEMERITS 
1. Commanding battles in Bannerlord is inferior to Warband (much older game), there should be the ability to create named control groups in the base game.
2. In campaign I completed conquest of the whole map, and, my character only achieved 250 siege level with nothing else to siege. Suggestion to buff the base amount of experience gained to cap out after ~50-75 sieges (if game map 120), also to make siege skill more meaningful in the early game (e.g., have wall damage and equipment reload speed earlier) and suggestion to have alternative perks (e.g., inflict moral damage daily when sieged, or, starvation to also effect militia [new 250 perk?, would be broken but if you played this long heck, the skill is not that useful at high levels])
3. Clear bandit hideout quests are slow and repetitive. Suggestion to add alternative quest archetypes that take base in hideouts, for instance, allow for negotiation with hideout (e.g., 1) they become mercenaries or recruited to a garrison, 2) allow for a all-or-nothing duel with the leader immediately, 3) allow for the option to pay-off the bandits to disband). 
4. Walking around in-towns is generally optional as most actions can be completed through world-map menus. In-town NPCs are generally static and not doing or adding much in terms of the world building/ immersion.
SUGGESTIONS
1. Include game speed as an in-menu/ in-game option, as combat can feel ++slow with repeated battles.
2. Include RTS options as part of the base game, perhaps this is how tactics could be changed to interactive game play rather than just auto resolve. 
3. Region specific quests, or, mini-quest lines that could impact game play in a meaningful way (e.g., sabotage a specific families' enterprise, murder a noble without witnesses, have a lord defect to a faction at war with as a vassal, incite a rebellion with purpose [e.g., complete a town project before conquered for +50 relation or a free enterprise]).

?Bug Report re: Regicide type Conquest - Huge time waste and massively inconvenient, would NOT recommend in current state.
I played as a solo clan Kingdom and was mass executing lords. I owned probably ~40 fiefs, and was using the Leadership perk +5 troops per fief. I was systematically clearing kingdoms by killing lords, and, during this process when an entire faction is executed for whatever reason that factions buildings are instantly donated to a random enemy faction. 
I killed all of the lords in the game, taking about ~40 hours over several days (did not siege 80 settlements as this is brutally slow as a single clan). 
And, I assumed that once I killed all of the lords I would receive ownership of the settlements with no one else (still a remaining 80 to conquer). But what happened was, after all the factions were killed the remaining settlements became owner-less to random ?rebel factions that generated after every other named faction died. 
So, I was back to square-one basically with the only option to siege every single remaining settlement (taking ~5-10 minutes of siege to breakdown the walls, auto-resolving, and recruiting to replace casualties). This made conquest a non-optional grind with siege. 
I am unsure if it was an intentional mechanic to make a murdered faction owned by your enemies, but it felt really bad and I quit that campaign and reset to a fresh start not wanting to siege 80+ settlements with no other meaningful or challenging combat once all the lords died.

IN LONG : Those who think that this game is a great sequel to the series are gravely mistaken. It is nothing more than a re-skin with updated graphics and fewer mechanics. While it does have a few more towns and villages, it lacks several of the more immersive mechanics, such as dueling for your love interest, getting jumped by bandits, and drunk tavern fights. The civil war climates for every faction are also missing. The mechanics that are present are nothing to praise or celebrate. The fact that we can now battle with 500 or 1000 people is to be expected with the technology we have now compared to 13 years ago. It is the bare minimum they had to improve, besides graphics and all the other new mechanics. The mechanics for controlling your companions are just less professional versions of mods made by committed fans over 13 years ago. They have not even finished the voice acting, yet they have the audacity to stick a bow on it and call it done, leaving it to the real hardcore fans to mod it up. This is a massive blunder for hardcore fans. It feels like a triple-A game with all these false promises, such as building a castle or any diplomacy besides declaring war. While you can still enjoy the game and play it because it is a better-looking version of Warband, do not deceive yourself or others that this game is finished or that they tried as hard as they could. It is not entirely their fault, but the people at the top who run the company who made the decisions. 13 years for a mere re-skin with fewer mechanics is a spit in the face. Despite this, I still bought it, and I will still have fun. I will support the people who made the game and continue to support the people who will finish the game, i.e., the people who mod. The world is amazing, and my love for the potential this game has, especially with mods, is unwavering. Lastly, while I acknowledge that combat is the biggest part of the game, diplomacy is a crucial aspect when you become a noble, lord, or king, and they have severely lacked in that department so much so that there is no such thing in the game. they should be ashamed.",1599307475,1705047902,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The combat gets rather boring after a while, the smithing is repetitive. You have to constantly rest to get the smithy skill up. It ends up wasting so much time. The enemies also magically counter your armies so rebuilding is a constant. It feels like doing the same thing over and over which people may like but not me. 
The game feels like a repetitive circle that will never end and for that I cant recommend it.

The development cycle for this game is nonsense. It's been 4 years since the game came out in early access and the foundation of the game roughly in a playable state. That's not mentioning the years before it was EA. Why is this game going to take as long to grow up as an actual child?

The fundamentals of the game are good. They continue to add great stuff. The pace is just bad. They are still using the Warband engine so why do we not have the mechanics from Warband? Why was Warband not our starting point with that logic? Why are the modders able to work circles around the devs?

Modding is a whole other thing. I'm no coder but here is the issue. Nobody can make any VAST overhauls or anything because if they do, the fact the game is still being slowly given patches is preventing anything truly massive from being made.

There are still some dedicated mods that bring things closer to Warband. BannerKings, Warlord Pack, etc. But again, why is Warband still a FUTURE goal to aspire to after almost a decade of development?

Overall, game is okay. Mods make it fun and good and put it up to where it should be, but I can't suggest paying for something that isn't enjoyable without mods. The base game has the attention retention of a cheap arcade game. There is no depth.

Look for a heavy sale. Then I can recommend it.",1586830371,1704903143,False,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,True

Fixed after months. Still negative, because I had to wait dozens of weeks to play a game I paid for. Nonetheless it's not half bad and I can recommend it.

Update.. After playing for a few dozen hours here is my conclusion. The launch was pathetic to say the least and they're lucky I didn't take my money back. In spite of this I found the final product to be very enjoyable, so much that I'm reverting my review. I find the mechanics are quite similar to warband with a few quirks.

As a long-time fan of the series, Bannerlord not only met but surpassed my lofty expectations.

The game excels in its open-ended gameplay, offering players the freedom to carve their path in the fictional continent of Calradia. Whether you aspire to become a noble lord, a mercenary for hire, a prosperous trader, or an infamous bandit king, the possibilities are boundless. The depth of choice in character creation and progression allows for diverse playstyles, ensuring each playthrough feels unique.

One of the game's highlights is its vast, dynamic world, teeming with life and activity. The attention to detail in cities, villages, and castles is remarkable, making exploration a rewarding endeavor. From participating in large-scale battles on sprawling landscapes to engaging in smaller skirmishes or diplomatic negotiations, the variety of activities keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Combat in Bannerlord remains a standout feature, offering a satisfying blend of skill-based mechanics and tactical depth. Whether leading troops in the chaos of battle or engaging in one-on-one duels, the combat feels weighty and realistic. The addition of new formations and tactics adds depth to the strategic aspect of warfare, providing a thrilling challenge for armchair generals.

While Bannerlord shines brightly, it's not without its minor flaws. Some aspects, such as occasional AI quirks and quest-related bugs, could use refinement. However, the developers have consistently shown dedication to improving the game through updates and patches, addressing community feedback and enhancing the overall experience.

Moreover, the modding community has flourished, introducing a plethora of user-created content that further enriches the game, extending its replayability and offering unique experiences tailored to individual preferences.

In conclusion, Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord stands as a testament to the dedication and ambition of its developers. Its captivating world, engaging gameplay, and the freedom it offers to players make it a must-play for fans of medieval strategy and action RPGs. Despite a few rough edges, the sheer scope and potential for emergent storytelling make Bannerlord an unforgettable and unparalleled experience in the gaming landscape.

    The weapon smithing is the most varied and interesting I've ever encountered in a game. The depth and customization options here are top-notch.
    The family dynamics are another highlight. The ability to have spouses, raise children, and then involve them in your journey - either leading armies or managing your towns and castles - adds a unique and personal touch to the strategy.
    The combat system is brilliantly innovative. It reminds me of the precursors to kingdoms in ""Kingdom Come: Deliverance,"" but with its own unique flair.

Mismanaged my construction projects in my new fiefs and went into debt for 3 million coins.

Completely broke, but still fighting in a massive war with the western kingdom.

Realized it was unwinnable and started executing every western leader after each battle, hoping that would make a difference.

Lost my “Generous” and “Merciful” traits, gained the ""Deceitful"" trait, now every kingdom and clan despises me for being a heartless, murderous monster.

Left my king knowing his kingdom was doomed, tried joining another kingdom, but everyone hates me for being a war criminal.

Only option now is to retire to a cave in the mountains and live the rest of my life as an honorless hermit while my governor brother and his children try to salvage our clan’s name in a dying kingdom.

Battle Reinforcements magically appearing in the center of the battle map 

your nobles will decide to declare war on the entire world, at the same time 

my current game the AI has given 12 consecutive fiefs to the same low tier clan 

low tier nobody clans stealing your siege, then deciding they dont want that town and  leaving,  only to travel across the map to steal the town the player is now besieging

the economy is horrible, they attempted to implement a semi-realistic economy. There is nothing fun about the economy changes, it is just annoying and frustrating. Workshops are mostly useless now.

AI cheats, a defeated enemy will be back in a matter of minutes with another giant army.

Prisoners escape rate from dungeons is so  high there is almost no point in even taking prisoners, or even having dungeons.

The formation system is broken and mixes troop types. Its not possible to sort crossbows from archers.  The sorting for formations is awful even when it works! You can not say I want this troop type in this formation anymore, everything is slider with some variables that sometimes work. Ive spent more time fiddling with the stupid formations sliders and variables then fighting the actual battles.

Once you join a kingdom the game is nothing but a battle sim. For every 4 hours of game play you might get 10 minutes where the players kingdom is NOT at war. It would be nice to have some time in between wars to check on player owned workshops, towns, get new gear, do some missions to fix town security. Only way to do anything but WAR is to repeatedly save scum.....to the point where its just stupid! 

The alley/crime system is pointless and annoying. You assign one of your ultra valuable companions with several soldiers to protect your ally. Then it gets attacked and they dont protect it, the player has a set amount of time to get there and defend it or else its lost. While your in the middle of non stop wars.....

The latest changes to AI blocking is just dumb, a naked looter with hammer blocks a lance from a knight charging at full speed. The naked looters without shield block everything, they are like Jedi's now. While the high tier troops with shields are easier to kill then the low level nobodies.

There is no diplomacy in the game, other then war or peace.

The game is fully released, yet still plagued with crashes. I have 15 13600k, 4080, 32 gb ddr5, ssd and still get random crashes. The support page is full of hundreds of crash reports.

As of writing this I have 598 hours into this game. About 1/2 of my playthrus I quit because of crashing or bugs. The other 1/2 because it becomes so tedious and boring being engaged in non stop battles that I find it completely impossible to continue playing. Ive spent 60 hours over the holidays playing Bannerlord and have hit that point of janky never ending wars.....Id rather get a root canal without anesthesia then continue to fight the jank. The ai that declares war on the whole world, the ai that gives every single fief to the same tier 3 clan, the ai that steals your siege then leaves 30 seconds after the player does, the never ending enemy armies that are instantly replenished, magically appearing enemy reinforcements behind the players army.

And that, my friends, is its god-awful shader implementations. The sieges are hands-down my favorite part of this game, which is truly a travesty because, half the time, the game crashes with the dreaded d3d error. 

Sure, I can get around it by ENTIRELY SKIPPING the siege and just using ""send troops"". But, where the heck is the fun in that?!? You think I want to skip scaling walls, busting  down gates, and launching clusters of stone to splatter large chunks of enemy armies? You think I want to skip leading a defense against enemies 3x my number, or zerg rushing with 3x their numbers? Not to mention, I can mitigate and minimize losses SO MUCH BETTER when I am in the field. AI alone cannot fend off a 3 to 1 matchup. 

This isn't just a one-off either. Its affecting nearly half the sieges I do. I followed all the forum posts, guides, and suggestions online. Nothing works, nothing fixes it.

I played a new campaign the first time with the official release and went through all the boring stuff of starting with nothing and joining sturgians, do that once and if you start again with a new campaign you want to skip that boring early shit. So I started using the console cheats like give player  money, but not with 1.2.0  and upwards that shit doesnt work proper anymore and it only adds like a tiny shit amount not worth even opening the console for. Then there is the give certain troops to your party so you dont have to find and train them console command which works decent enough unless you want some troops they changed names off most noteably in sturgian faction.... Its annoying as fuck and as far as I  can find nothing of that was ever mentioned or to wat the names has bin changed to. Then there is the console command to give you xp for a certain skill for example, ""campaign.add_skill_xp_to_hero bow 999999"" that would increase your skill with the bow but now that doesnt work either no matter which variant of the command I use ( seen people in the discussion of the game stating its now done as ""campaign.add_skill_xp_to_hero <name of hero> bow | 999999 or other varaints of that. But that shit dont work either). And I cant get most of the console command to work. Then theres the crap about crafting, How do you know if you crafted a good weapon? God knows if your lucky enough to speak to that GOD guy because theres no indication wat-so-ever wheter wat you crafted is good, decent, or bad.... The game is slowly going down hill and the mods that make the game actualy fun get ruinend by EVERY FUCKING TINY LITTLE SHITTY WORTHLESS PATCH. Not even mentioning they indroduced battle terrain where if you encounter enemys on lets say grass plain with a bridge, the actualy fight where you command your troops takes place in that spot on a ""Mostly"" open grass field with a bridge. Now that isnt the case anymore since update 1.2.0 and the recent other one 1.2.8. Example, ""I encounterd a Vlandia army of 50 troops on a forest cliff, but when I actualy got into the fight where I command my troops I somehow find myself fighting them in a snowy grass plain....?""  They made such a huge big deal out of that stuff not happening anymore in patch notes and they even went as far as stating it would improve (yea right). Now I admit I was sceptical of the game when they first announct it because I was so used to warband, but I got into Bannerlord and it kinda grew on me bit by bit time by time. So for now I unistall the game cause people will say ""simpley revert to a older version where everything does work!!"" And yea... NO I did that and it only broke my game even more to a point it wouldnt even launch anymore (got that fixed though by extreem luck) So for now I uninstall the game and hope they do eventualy fix this shit and make the console work proper and somewhere in patch notes put the actualy BLOODY PROPER TROOP ID NAMES!! In it, because all those little things annoy me to this point of uninstalling the game and most likely forget about it ever existing and thats not a good thing.

So DONT BUY THIS GAME YET!! But buy it in a like 2077 where it all gets cyberpunked...

Still quite buggy but mostly visual glitches, only encountered 2 quests that caused crash, it was fixed on the same day with a patch.
Loading screens are very long even with SSD.


Update after full release:

I see this game getting exposure and a lot of people seem to enjoy it and recommend it and that is awesome, but also I see a lot of talking up the diplomacy and kingdom management aspect of the game.

Let's get one thing straight, this is one of my favourite games of all time, I play MB since the pre-alpha when I was just a little kid and never stopped playing because of the amazing core gameplay: combat and leading your soldiers in battle.

The diplomacy is not in depth at all, relations with vassals serve little purpose than to make it easier for them to defect to your kingdom (if they have bad relations with their current liege).

Marriage helps improve relations beetween families, but many times they are/eventually will be enemies and marriage will change nothing other than you gaining or losing a family member.

Managing your fiefs is not balanced or fun or easy, many times fiefs will stay undeveloped and actually cost a lot of denars to maintain a garrison instead of making any profit from taxes pretty much the entire game, because you need to have a passive loyalty modifier instead of developing your settlement or else the fief will rebel against you or their lord. It's good for free a city though, you can start a war against any rebels and take a settlement with no immediate repercussions.

In late game when you have plenty lords from all different cultures you can better split your fiefs among adequate lords to not be hindered by loyalty (heavily influenced by the culture modifier)

That said with mods these things are easily balanced, there are tons of fun mods for whatever you can think of and that adds a huge value to this game.

Me personally I am very happy with vanilla right now, I do play around with some mods every now and again but the challenge of starting a new game with a weak character and ending the game by conquering the entire continent paired with extremely fun and fluent combat keeps me coming back to this and just repeating a campaign with a different approach over and over.",1585945832,1704250876,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Medieval combat sim mixed with medieval campaign sim mixed with medieval diplomacy mixed with tactics I enjoy more than the Total War games. There is a skill to it all.

The multiplayer in M&B games made me quit shooters for good, & Bannerlord is no different. The mod community is also thriving.

I'll admit there's a corniness to the faces and how some mechanics work, but let's be real, Warband had plenty of those, and this plays it off well enough like those did. Taleworlds brought a lot of modders from that game onto this one, and so the passion & ideas truly feels like they earned the ""2"" in M&B ""2"".   

If you're on the fence, or have a mediocre system, I would recommend trying Warband out first, pop in the Diplomacy or Floris conversion mod, and go to town.

I bought Bannerlord in late 2021 and initially had a negative review as there were several underlying issues, however after revisiting for approximately the same amount of time I can recommend it, however there are still several issues that I must outline. For people unwilling to read a longer review, do remember this, [b] Bannerlord is a game for the long haul, you will suck initially and not know what to do as the tutorial is lacklustre and so your first run through will almost certainly be a dud after about 40-50 hours.You should consider not doing the story to begin with and let the quest fail (there is a lot of time) and then start a new one after having a feel for the game [/b].

Now for a far more detailed overview:
Bannerlord has A LOT of potential to be one of the greatest games in recent time as it brings something unique in a very unexplored genre, however, there are still flaws hence my somewhat mixed attitude. I want to make it clear that Bannerlord is a game that I immensely enjoy, so don't take me talking about negatives extensively as heavy criticism, rather as things that need improving to make the game (in my eyes) perfect.

Starting with the most basic of problems is the incredibly flawed system of the economy and money. The economy works like it does in most other games in that as the player increases in level, so too do enemies, hence providing better equipment, and subsequently more money upon their inevitable defeat. Usually, this is an alright system that works for the scope of most games, however does absolutely not work in Bannerlord. Being rich is nice and all, but you can amass seriously stupid amounts of wealth after initial struggle in the early game. This means the player can purchase anything without an issue as selling equipment after a battle against maybe 100-150 fields around 60,000 Denars (the currency) and this can be done frequently. Consequently, most income a player receives is through selling equipment as opposed to owning fiefdoms which is not how the system should work, I don’t exactly think the troops were grabbing everything off a fallen soldier (clothes and the like) after a battle, hence it shouldn’t work like this. Instead, a portion of the wealth of lords you capture and the ransoms offered should be the main source of income, along with the pillaging of settlements and income from fiefs as opposed to selling copious amounts of weapons and armour. 

More of an extension to the last point, but when you find yourself in a situation you can’t win, you can weasel out by offering certain things (usually money), there was a nice implementation that some lords would refuse to accept any amount as they could simply take it off you. This is a good system that I like, however there are notable flaws in that your wealth doesn’t get taken, and the amount you must pay is scaled to your character's wealth rather than the opposing parties. I once paid around 400,000 to get out of something, quadrupling the enemies wealth whilst not making a dent in mine. The player should not be able to do this, as 400,000 is a lot of money and the enemy would be able to take it with relative ease, leading on to the second point where you don’t actually lose wealth when captured which means the only consequence is losing your entire army, which definitely sucks, but losing maybe half or a quarter of your wealth would make the player more attentive and less reckless. That being said, this does raise another issue in that players could lose millions of Denars in one foul swoop, which is fixed rather simply by having a safe place to store your money (in a fief or something) and a smaller portion of your wealth on your person. Hence, the economy in Bannerlord is bankrupt and is in need of a rework at some point to make it more enjoyable. 

It is an amazing feeling to finally receive your first fief, but, once again, the system stinks! Garrison wages expand quickly, loyalty works (but should work differently) and the distribution is in dire need of a rework. Garrisons work fairly simply, the more men in militia and in the garrison, the higher security and subsequently greater increase in things like loyalty and prosperity. However, from what I have found, there is no way to limit the garrison size and hence expenses get really high, especially if your governor isn’t particularly good. Like I so eloquently explained earlier, money isn’t a real problem, and so it doesn't actually matter, however turning a profit is fun and so I constantly find myself reducing the garrison in castles. This isn’t a major issue and is fixed very easily (a way to limit max garrison).

Moving on, loyalty works far better than it does in Warband with the inclusion of loyalty drift which is a loyalty increase prior to 50, decreasing the amount it increases by as you get closer, and then flipping to a decrease, increasing in decrease as it approaches to 100, hopefully that wasn’t confusing. In layman's terms, a settlement's loyalty won’t just get to 100 and stay, rather constantly fluctuating which I think is a fine addition. However, loyalty is affected by a heavy decrease when the culture of the fief is different to the culture of the owner (a -3 penalty) and the culture of the governor (-1 penalty). Now, this isn’t a problem (or at least not as big a one) when playing the empire culture as the entire centre of the map, split between the northern empire, the southern empire, and the western empire, is empire culture meaning expansion is more sustainable as loyalty will probably never be a problem until expanding into others, so there is a strong reason to start with empire culture, however I will expand on the benefits of others later.

My last problem with fiefs is the really poor system of distribution. Essentially, if you have fiefs close to newly captured ones, you are more likely to get them. Now I can’t speak for other factions, but Vlandia (and probably the Khuzaits, Aserians, and Sturgians) have a problem with this as they are at the edges of the map, having one route of expansion as opposed to the empires who can from all sides. Now for the serious flaw, in certain situations, an AI clan will get [b] every single one without fail, [/b] and it’s to the point that I am starting a new run because of it.
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198311401258/screenshot/2116185209392121092/
Now, this only happens in specific situations but it gets seriously irritating to the point that I’m starting a new run through earlier than I had hoped as it is officially impossible for me to obtain a new fief. The only way that I have found to fix this, is to buy fiefs off of vassals in order to expand, however a trade skill of I believe 300 is required for this which is just plain stupid. This is because the trade skill isn’t levelled up by selling, rather, by buying goods and then selling them to another settlement, so you can’t passively level it up like most of the other skills. Even still, this isn’t how fiefs should work, they are rewards for dedication and so vassals trading them wouldn’t be taken too kindly by the King, but that is very minor at this point.
I like fiefs, but literally any other system is better than this, not enough factors are taken in like participation in the siege, amount of fiefs, or reputation (this is taken into consideration but not for the shortlist), making the entire system very frustrating. [b] This really only happens in specific circumstances, however these circumstances highlight the flaws in the system.[/b]",1643841542,1704186432,True,0,0,0,1,True,False,False

The towns are dead and non-immersive. There are probably 2/3 different voices in the entire game, everyone sounds the same. Not all the lines are voice acted. Dialogue is the same with all NPCs.

Eg. you want to go to the smithy? people are used to walking there, but in bannerlord since the town is so dead they have an option to 'visit smithy' and you just appear in front of him. 

You will need to play with mods, however be warned, these will crash your game on each update. You will need to review your mod list each time the game is patched,

Normally you would back up or create space, but you can't now b/c they ai seemingly will match your speed regardless of what they are doing (blocking/swinging/up/downhill).  This ""rules for thee, but not for me"" is lazy ai balancing, and it just gives the ai an unfair advantage over the player. vs making it function better in general.  Even with maxed speed stats it is impossible to simply run away from an overly defensive ai.  One on one the combat is laughably easy, you can literally spam 1 attack and you will win every 1on1 fight.

Campaign changes: good (even though mods already do what they added better, but now those mods are broken)
combat changes: horrible, combat is super boring now without an ai overhall mod.

Game is un playable for me without mods that significantly change combat (which is arguably true for all players of this game regardless of patch :) )

Recommend this game in general, but current state, avoid unless you want to mod right away.",1704121473,1704121907,False,1,0,0.50265955924987793,0,True,False,False

But some of the recent updates have made the game not enjoyable anymore, For instance the new combat AI has broken the Arena Tournaments system as they want the combat to last longer which granted it does but for how long is long enough? I let the AI fight and they fought for 20mins before beginning to fight me plus you can no longer shield bash enemies to stagger them so thats useless now also they now can block with weapons and shields quicker than any human could. Anyway off topic what I'm trying to say is to Devs that may read this is ""If it aint broke then don't try fix it"" In my opinion the Battles are no longer fun, they changed some of the font for some reason and also changed some of the sounds OK but If it is a full release game which it is now why change game features and dynamics this late into it?

You cannot cancel a swing every you have released and begun swinging the the cheats you can causing the twirl effect every time increasing your swing speed by about 25% making your swing speed always faster than everyone else you will never win a 1v1 fight with a hacker. Aimlock for automatic headshots with bows and crossbows if your helmet is even peaking out from your shield you die if you protect your head they can shoot you accurately from across the map in the foot instead.

Like any Mount and Blade, you can customize your settings to fit on your PC specs and desired graphics.

I can't recommend this game due to the amount of stupid contained within it.  

It's little quality of life things that come along the way like a lack of integrated save features.  Auto-save can be controlled in the settings and I recommend you do that or a crash can lose you 30 min of gameplay, but I just recently discovered, after literal hours of play, that auto-saves on different characters can overwrite slots, so something simple like wanting to play a different character for a bit can cost you all of your progress if you rely on the auto-save feature.  

So I just lost a Tier 4 clan playthrough because I wanted to be Afro Samurai for a bit.  That's a lot of needless grinding thrown away for a trivial oversight.  I would equate that to Baldur's Gate 3 deleting your entire Act 3 character because you wanted to roll a new one.

There's also no guarantee with what your units will do after you order them around.  Micromanagement isn't difficult, its just frustrating.  Why can I not target units?   Why do my units have an unchangeable set of unit priorities?  Why is my small stack of cavalry just standing there waiting to be charged by a spear line instead of moving like they've been told?  Why are they charging the same fucking spear line instead of the exposed archers in the back after I've moved them into a perfect position to attack said archers?

All this and more in a cool game with a duct-taped package where sometimes taking the duct-tape off breaks the entire package and the present inside explodes.

I've given this game almost a year after release, 3.5 years of EA and whole 8 years after official start of development. And what do I see? Yeah, game looks much better than title from 15 years ago, has bigger battles and somewhat more interactive world.

Bannerlord tries to follow formula of ""everything than you've liked, but more"". Only problem - original M&B wasn't full and enjoyable game without mods. Mods added all depth original lacked - proper diplomacy, settlement management, proper npc interaction and many-many more features which looked like obious inspiration source for the sequel.

But, unfortunately, diplomacy system evolved only to scale of ""I'am support I'am"" getting separate window. You could ony do 3 things:
1. Elect owner of the settlement
2. Propose start/end of the war
3. Propose policies with miniscule influence

Settlement management couldn't be even called a management - you could only upgrade 12 sources of digits, without any option to actually manage, specialize, choose which buildings to make or do something to your settlement

It seem like most of the work have been put into battle impovements and it's nice to see proper formations, which have been brought only by mods in original. But what is the point, when your abilities to manage all of this is so limited? This is not a Total War, were you could pull off a really beatiful tactics and beat much stronger enemies, using landscape, positioning and precise movement. No, when your units event slightly touch the enemy things turn into typical M&B bloodbath without units even trying to hold their formations or listen to commands.

Now you could actually damage enemy's economy with raids, attacking caravans and stuff, but that's the only noticebale impovement compared to original. And guess what, mods did this too in original, whithout asking you to buy a separate game.

Workshops are still bad and boring, smithing minigame is kinda good, but absolutely ignorable, hideouts are much better in giving you a headache than fun (where the hell is option to autoresolve them?), characters still look as ugly as my life and overall game leaves you with a question ""If this is your product of 8 years of development, then what the hell you've been doing all this time?""",1703815324,1703815365,False,1,1,0,0,True,False,False

Okay, so base game bannerlord is amazing. Its a fantastic successor to Warband, itself still a solid game today, though its a struggle to get working on modern hardware. Although it lacks certain features i'd love to see in it from Warband, Bannerlord does a LOT, and continues to improve as the years go on.

First of all, I appreciate the effort of putting in voice-over in certain small places, though honestly the game could easily do without it. Secondly, the main story of the game sure is there. It exists. That's all I have to say about it, as its really just a way to give the player an idea of where to start and what to do. If you understand how the game works, you can just play Sandbox and get the same, if even better, experience.

The game is great, genuinely. I wouldn't say it captivates me at all times, and its the only game i'd ever want to play, but... it got close, seeing from my several hundred hours in it. Combat is pretty fun, though it can be very frustrating at difficult odds. But succeeding is that much more gratifying when you can manage to pull it off. Though it is easily cheesed, with proper skills, both for your character and your own personal. My only real gripe is that equipment makes too -much- of a difference of who wins and who loses any given battle. I recognize that with armor comes an advantage, but I'd like to see tactical gameplay having a bit more of a bite than just running head on toward a band of Looters and slaughtering them all easily with a band of four or five knightly fellows.

I'd like to see more building on what this most recent patch offers, being able to command your troops to attack specific formations, expansion specifically in the form of flanking and the like. I think nerfing equipment just a smidge would be very good, if tactics were also brought into a more make-or-break role. If you have ten horsemen and ride into a crowd of twenty five bandits, well... That's kind of stupid. To be clear, there are elements of this idea already present in the game. You CAN already do things like this, its just a bit janky to pull it off.

I'd like to also have stealth being an aspect of the gameplay in more ways than a simply percent chance to enter a settlement. For one, the enemy AI in battles always knows the location of you and your troops, and vice versa. I could definitely see it being frustrating if the enemy could hide from you, but in the case of you getting accosted by a massive band of looters whilst you are on your own, it would be nice to be able to avoid them and slink away from battle, as they find an empty battlefield and they have to spread out to try and find you. You can sacrifice men to do this in a text prompt, but when youre just by yourself, say on your way from being a prisoner to gain some troops, and you accidentally run smack into a gang of forest bandits, well... I'm on a horse... I could outrun them if I flee. But once I exit that battle's boundary, the options are to fight, or surrender. There's no possibility of fleeing once you are caught. This is a bit of a disappointment to me. But that's also not the point of the game, I suppose. The point is to have grand battles and work your way up to being emperor of a vast state, or to destroy the current empire. The point IS battle, so offering ways to circumvent battle altogether, without paying substantial sums of denars or goods, while it would be neat for me, that would be antithetical to the game's goal. Then again, you can also be a trader, caring little for the politics of any particular state, just running a trading caravan across Calradia, so... Why not a swashbuckling rogue or brigand? Aspects of this are included, but not so much in the slinkink and sleuthing, just... medieval-style thuggery.

All of this being said, Bannerlord is fantastic. Its given me hundreds of hours of entertainment. But more recently, I've discovered the true Holy Grail (trust me, using that analogy is very funny) of video games. For this game, there is a mod called The Old Realms, a total conversion mod that transforms the Calradic imperial era into the Age of Sigmar of Warhammer. There's many features still on the way, but what they have already is genuinely amazing. Its still a heavy work in progress, but trust me, if they presented the mod as finished, it would take some digging to be able to tell.

The Old Realms takes Bannerlord and expands it to truly epic, fantastical proportions, with sorcery in addition to swords, and fantasy, and not just fiction. Ever want to be a necromancer, with a thousand undead lackies at your command? You can do that. Ever want to be a holy Knight Errant, on a quest to recieve the favor of The Lady of the Lake by slaying thousands and thousands of Chaos warriors? You can do that, too. How about a vampire lord, seeking to dominate the rest of the Empire and overthrow the Von Carsteins? Yep, that too. You can also still just be a trader.  There are random encounters, not included in Bannerlord, its own soundtrack, towns, cities, models, systems of magic- Name a fantasy thing. It probably has it either included or on the horizon.

The Old Realms makes Bannerlord worth at least double the asking price, alone. Now THAT'S a game.",1659490151,1703754526,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The pros:
- Combat feels good and responsive, it is not easy to win a fight and yet it isn't overly convoluted like some games. You can very easily be one-shot and yet at the same time you can fight and win against 10 NPCs with good movement and timing.
- NPC army controls are pretty in-depth yet also not overwhelming, makes battles feel at least partially based on your ability to position and lead
- Love the variety of lands, cultural portrayals and equipment that gives you a lot to work with
- REALLY nice to have these sorts of ""first person strategy"" games where you both manage whole countries, individual town and cities, and also get to fight on the ground with large armies. Possibly my favourite genre, sadly under-served and this game gives good precedent for why there should be more of them.
- The political system is not too detailed but what is there and the level of discussion that can be done is quite nice and being updated all the time.

The cons:
- NPCs aren't bad but also aren't good, the ""swarm"" mentality still rules here and you can lose a lot of men to silly path-finding or poor enemy targetting.
- City and country management systems are still rather crude, would ideally become far more in-depth.
- Economies can be janky, working to balance things in a city or town can ultimately never work out unless you abandon them without a garrison to not overeat the food, or risk rebellions and discontent.
- Many NPC bosses have the clear advantage of resource pool baselines, beating one can see them come back way too quickly with large forces.
- The more ""RPG"" elements of detailed plots, interact-able first person world outside of combat, and all related is quite weak, you are still quite a bit more ""overview strategy"" despite being on the ground a lot. If Taleworlds can include this sort of ""passive interesting first person action"" in the game, they'd have one of the best games I think I'd ever played.

Overall, great fun and quite nice for those who like RTS, strategy and first-person melee combat in a package, yet sadly lacking the more involved elements of story and RPG that holds it back, plus little bits of bugs and AI issues.",1586103720,1703694969,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Can it become the best game i have played - yes, if some issues are resolved.

Which issues?
...
Mount&Blade II: Bannerlord is still being made. And it feels that they are patching it strategically, from the base. That said, I can assert that they have pretty much built everything nicely to the level of party. Where it starts to feel odd, is above this level - army and kingdom management.
Armies are very difficult to manage, first and foremost because in large scale battles you don't know when your reinforcements will arrive, and more importantly - where from. You can't influence the order in which those arrive and it both, makes it difficult to win battles and breaks the realism and immersion. If the engine can't support 1000vs1000 battle on screen, they could have broken it into 10 times 100vs100. That way you would at least be able to implement some tactics.
Another big issue are messed up troup transfers. The battle starts sorted out (infantry, archers, cavalry...) but the moment you mix them on field the AI becomes confused and they are all treated as infantry even if they have only 1 footman within.
I really enjoyed majority of my Vlandian hero 70h campaign, but i felt too many bugs made it unfair and unrealistically difficult when i came to the point where i needed to constantly manage armies in order to defend the lands. 
Can't wait for this game to find solutions for the issues I mentioned. With that done I would probably never uninstall it again.

14 month old major bug that only got fixed in patch 1.2.7

I used to have a long list of bugs here, but I think these two bugs are enough to illustrate my point.

This game is riddled with bugs. Some of them are minor and extremely easy to fix, some of them are game-breaking. These bugs will stay unfixed for months and years, because the team at Taleworlds is poorly organized, and working with a code base so messy that they're afraid of changing a 0.5 to a 1 for two years.






Other complaints:
- There is nothing interesting to do after ""beating the game"" (being the biggest kingdom and having enough money to perpetually pay for strategic peace). World conquest is a boring slog.
- You can easily beat the game before any of your children can come close to being of age.
- Cheesing skill gain XP is required if you want to max them out before the game ends. Skills are way too grindy in general. (e.g. you don't even come close to maxing out Engineering by personally sieging every fortification in the map)
- In general, the endgame is poorly designed.

- Armies are too fragile, and raised too quickly. Defeating a kingdom's entire standing army should be a difficult and momentous event, not a temporary setback. It should either lead to tribute extortion or loss of lots of land.

Thank you to the developers and folks who worked hard on this game release, I for one applaud you.

I am leaving my original review below so we can look back on all the things fixed since my initial review!

::Original Review Posted during the first year of the games release::
What should be a solid game is marred by some truly abysmal AI.

I can't speak on the multiplayer as servers are not set up well for playing at the current time of posting. No north american siege servers have been made available and current game modes don't include a battle or duel mode. 

The single player however is full of promise but wasted by some awful AI decisions made on the campaign map. Watching kingdoms try and pass completely positive policies that are supported by literally every lord in the kingdom get denied by the king with no hit to his relationship stings.

But the absolute sticking point for me is whatever the AI is thinking when it decides with 45 allied men, over half literal recruits, decide to chase a 300 man army holding outside my 500 man siege. Does the AI think i'm going to abandon my siege to save their 45 recruits? Why did he engage? There are other massive problems like an enemy army is sitting spotted outside an allied capitol city and allied armies won't move on the defence or even decide to hold in the capitol city for some time as a defence. 

Battle AI is also atrocious sending 4-6 mounted horse archers on a charge to their death at the start of every combat. It makes sense for the aseri and khanate to be sending these units on a charge, but the Battle AI doesn't seem to consider tactics, unit composition or even enemy composition and can be run over very much like this games predecessor, warband. In siege the attacking AI will get stuck all over the place, miss killing archers in towers its already cleared, use a single entry point when multiple are available(to the detriment of the attackers units) and generally run around uselessly right at the base of the walls getting shot and pummeled by defenders. I wish I could speak on defending a siege but the AI on the campaign map rarely commits to any battle, and siege's that are defended even less so, and that is if they even brought enough food in the first place.

I am concerned that some things cannot be fixed like the small momentary hitch that occurs in the music as it decides what loop of music to play next. There are some issues with the UI that have presented from the start, dialog with NPC's that I ""wasn't supposed to see"" and TODO labels on the siege markers for morale and food that still are not fixed. There is an attempt to force a main storyline on the sandbox that really needs to be toggle-able because it colors your characters background and affects the playthrough. This whole game lacks in some ways that I am concerned even an early access cannot fix even with their productive patch cycle having almost a new patch every day.",1587054755,1703641570,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'm excited to see if i can get good enough to win 4/1 battles like i could on war-band.
 
I haven't accomplished much of anything in this game so far, so i can't talk about many of the features, but there is a lot more to do than in war-band, and war-band was my life for a few years, but the thing about this kind of game is making your own story, so if you like that kind of thing just buy it.

An RPG that really lends itself to writing my own story. Though still in early access, patches come regularly and the devs seem to prioritize fixing what needs fixing the right way. Gameplay is varied, good medieval meleecombat and command system for any scale battle, be it duels or massive army fights. Then there's politics, romance, economy, crafting, all working as they should. The gameworld feels alive. 
The games' economy is especially impressive, it works as you'd expect. Has a region been at war for a prolonged period? well after years of raiding and sieges food becomes scarce and recruits become harder to find. Has it been a peaceful year? The finest craftsmanship flourishes and a plentiful bounty floods the market. 
Prefer shooting a bow and managing your kingdom? Sure, you can do that. 
Prefer swinging a massive axe and wading through piles of corpses? Go for it. 
Prefer a single sword and a sneaky dungeon breakout? Yep, also an option. 
Quests are fun and keep getting added to the game, there's a massive modding community already going absolutely nuts on overhaul mods and steam workshop support has been announced. 
As of the time of writing I've played a little over 500 hours and I'm only on my 4th campaign. It definitely won't be the last playthrough. Can recommend.

Very very basic features arent in yet, every patch has changes major enough to completely break every mod in the game and thereby actively driving modders away from it. Frequently you run into things were you arent sure if its bugged, supposed to be that way or unfinished, and that really says everything about the game.

Is it fun? Sure. Is it the worst game every? Nope. However i just cant recommend it in good conscience, neither from a players enjoyment perspective nor a overal consumer perspective.

Firstly, everything that happens feels extraordinarily important. Those few cavalrymen you lost feel like you lost a thousand and that castle you just took will go miles in winning you that war. Everything has significant weight to it and could lead to anything, more so once you get into a kingdom.
Secondly, every aspect of the game is done incredibly well. The combat is epic, the mechanics of the game are easy to pick up and put together well and all parts work well together.
Finally, the modability of the game adds so much to it. I installed a few and it added so much to an already outstanding game. Their effect cannot be overstated if the right mods are added. My only problem is that mods may sometimes break from updates but definitely worthwhile despite this.

There are many more things I could talk about, but I'll stop now. I got the game for the appeal of leading an army from the battlefield, but I often end up getting my generals to do it so I can join in the fighting but I would still recommend the game to someone for that reason.

pros/improvements over WB:
-graphics. while still not looking near up to snuff with modern AA or AAA development, environments look much nicer, and towns and cities received a major boost to size and believably.
-sounds. combat sounds brutal and splashy, towns and cities have an appropriate din, the menus have neat sound effects to add immersion. quest givers have some solid voice acting now as well.
-quest structure and character RP. the character creator is slightly better than in Warband and its backstory generator is more involved. characters can age and have kids. quests are more involved.

mids:
-can't select weapons for arena practice combat. while this may help you get used to more of the weapons, it prevents you from choosing what you're best at to make a profit fighting.
-good graphics made loading much longer and more frequent. Warband gets away with looking poor and mixing in a lot of menus because its practically instant; with only a single load screen and few hitches, you'll never have to wait for a town to load, a battle to load, the world map to load, etc. in BL, at least 5 minutes of my first hour of gameplay was looking at art while the game loaded.

cons:
-inconsistent performance. despite looking a decade old, it struggles to run at 60 on my mid-tier machine.
-combat just doesn't feel nearly as good in general.
-devs kinda left it to modders to add in missing warband features and keep multiplayer active. It was kinda fair enough back when Warband released as mostly the work of two people, but when its a company of over 100 people, it feels like more should've been done",1703449399,1703449399,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

For comparison mount and blade 1 already had Warband out for about 2 years at this point with Fire and Sword already hitting it's first anniversary. 

UPDATE: Two years later and nothing. The game still doesn't have half the features of the first. Maybe all their talent left for better things? I'm not sure. Whoever remains just sucks at their job. In any case, the updates have slowed considerably with no news on a release date. 

[strike]Wish steam would allow a neutral response for reviews.[/strike] With so much time in development, and now completely missing their own 1 year early access deadline I would recommend for people to just wait for the full release at this point. [strike]The development  of the game hasn't stopped and new updates are still released regularly, but it[/strike] looks like the promised features are far from being finished.

The first being that the A.I. lords are outright incapable of surrender. They will face your army of three hundred with a band of forty and decide to fight to the death. Their kingdom can lose the past five wars against yours, and they still be the ones to start the sixth. At some point they really should admit the cause is lost and request to join the stronger side, be that the player's kingdom or one of the others.

The second being that if you want to negotiate a clan to join your kingdom you have to speak with the clan's head, reasonable enough on it's own, except to do that you have to chase them down all across the continent. It would be greatly convenient if you could send them a message, either by your own messenger of asking a member of their clan you do manage to run down to talk to, saying you want to meet under a truce banner.



Addendum, I own up that the first of my complaints has been dealt with in the intervening months, but I have discovered another one.

Anytime one of the lords of the kingdom I'm part of shows up to 'help' with a siege, every SINGLE time they wrest control of the siege away from me, proceed to ignore anything in the way of preparations even if I'd already set them up to be built, and will just march their troops into a blood bath, with my only options being going with them or abandoning the siege I'D set up.",1677912829,1703379885,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Bannerlord was a cash grab made by TaleWorlds where they make a bare bones remaster of their amazing game Mount & Blade Warband.

Bannerlord is a game you can waste time on, but it's not that fun of a gameplay loop as Warband was.

And the worst part about Bannerlord is that it feels like the devs hamfisted factions into the game. Like ooooh there's going to be three of the same exact faction instead of making any sort of unique changes to each individual empire faction.

There's different settings for each empire faction, so why doesn't each have Units that resemble their setting? For example, Southern Empire fights in the desert vs desert themed factions, so why aren't they desert oriented? Why don't they have some units specifically made to fight vs the desert faction? They don't even have a different uniform for god's sakes

Now, the most egregious thing is that Bannerlord releases bare minimum patches that change just enough of their code that makes Bannerlord practically not worth modding.

There are no good overhauls when Warband had a crazy amount.

Hell, Bannerlord has released so many of those bare minimum patches that Diplomacy, a staple of a ""Native focused Modded"" playthrough of Warband, doesn;t even work anymore for Bannerlord.

Oh and one last thing, the release date is a lie. Bannerlord released Early Access in 2020, and the game has only gotten better through optimization, the gameplay itself is weak. 

From a gameplay perspective,  the lack of content from Bannerlord feels like an Alpha game.",1589694606,1703332603,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've been playing the game since it went live in beta. I've played Warband extensively as well. Bannerlord is a prettier game. Warband is a deeper game.

If you want a good medieval battle sim with fun battles, this is your game. If you want tactical battles with formidable AI, this is not your game. Battle AI, Campaign Map AI, and siege AI are all completely broken in this game.

I can win just about every evenly matched battle in the game with 50/50 infantry/ranged in every battle by spreading and charging at the beginning of every battle. The AI doesn't know how to handle it. It's pathetic. The only real time tactics comes into play is when you're way outmatched, but even then the AI advances in a very predictable manner.

On the campaign map, the AI will send caravans right into heavy enemy presences. Even with high scouting, the AI will still approach enemies close enough to aggro them. Friendly AI isn't logical in where it decides to go in the world. The NPC's are just dead AI wandering around. Big numbers chasing little numbers. 

On the campaign map, the player can only control what to build when on offense during a siege but not while defending. It makes no sense. The battle AI during a siege is horrible. It's literally despicable. The enemy has four ballistas on the wall, I have four trebuchets in the field. I cannot direct the fire of my trebuchets, instead the AI is in control. My AI chooses to shoot at individual infantry units behind cover instead of shooting at either the defending siege engines or the city gate. So dumb. On the flip side, if I'm defending my catapults will more often than not shoot at individuals instead of the oncoming ram/towers or attacking engines.

That's just siege AI. Let's talk about infantry AI. It's incredibly basic and it's bad at even that. The pathing of the AI is some of the worst I've seen in a game. I used to play a lot of Unreal Tournament and the AI in that has about the same as this, seems to be little nodes where the AI can set up instead of ""thinking"" about where it should go. Charging during a defensive siege is hilarious because if the AI has a tower or a ram, they prioritize those things instead of trying to pour through the open gate. Don't expect real tactical battles in this game. Expect battles to be ruined because enemies spawn inside of building or walls sometimes, totally ruining a battle making it unfinishable unless you use console commands.

The game has some very half assed voice dialogue that's pointless and ads nothing to the game. If something isn't going to be done all the way, it might as well not be added. Much like so many other things in the game. The game world feels dead and pointless. The interactions with npc's feel pointless though when they smile it can feel like a reward in itself. There's always a place for comedic relief. 

Two years of open beta and this is all still the same as it was in the first few weeks. Sure there is more to it since the beginning but I've seen smaller studios do a lot more in a lot less time. Taleworlds is entering EA territory for me. Seems they don't care about what they've created and instead pushed it out in the hopes that the mod community will do what they're too uninterested to do. I love Warband, it's one of my favorite games of all time. Bannerlord is the itch I scratch every few weeks.

I'll keep playing the game because the mods are starting to churn out but the vanilla game is a shiny piece of garbage with some cool huge battles. It's a battle sim and that's how I play it. It lacks true depth in my opinion.

I only play on the hardest difficulty.


EDIT

UNINSTALLED. THE AI IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN. I'M DONE.


EDIT 4-29-23

Game still sucks. Still crashes. Still can't control who gets what in my kingdom. Still can't control MY OWN EFFING KINGDOM! The developers of this game are morons. They've claimed countless times to have fixed siege AI. Nope. Sorry, you haven't. I always get an itch to play this game, and I always come away completely disappointed.


Edit: AI still sucks after all the updates. Units still won't utilize all ladders during a siege. AI has a hard time even going up ladders. The campaign is boring and hollow. This game is a beta game packaged as a finished game. It isn't. Just read their patch notes, this game was released way too early.",1585772961,1703278806,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Do not buy untill  TW finally stops breaking the game with crappy patches than you can play  with mods which make this game better and more fun than TW ever can.

Oh and you want a perfect example of how much TW spits in our faces? they spend 6 months on ""beta"" patch than less than 1 week later when modders are updating all their mods (which add more features than TW has in last 10 yrs) they release another shitty patch that breaks all mods, and is full of only bug fixes that are 8 gb in size.",1586116687,1703217443,False,0,0,0.446186304092407227,0,True,False,True

1) map and bands - there is very little to do things on large medieval map and very questionable mapping in some places, like impassable north fjords. there is no ruins or something to explore like in Viking Conquest. there is no neutral big or strong bands, like deserters, adventurers or robber knights, to fight them in midgame between new game and lording in own castle (homeless clans do not count, one way or another they often belong to factions) 
2) boats - none
3) very weak balance of damage and armor makes leveling of soldiers pointless and unrewarding - 5 peasants can trample one elite warrior and in tournaments everyone kills each other in 2-3 hits.
4) tournaments - i dont know how, but often your teammates are weaker than opponents, with same random loadouts it feels more uncontrollable than MnB1, and much unrewarding with bets scaling on your rating
5) the poor economy makes trading, headhunting, managing settlements or everything you can do for make money into an unrewarded routine. (maybe I don’t know something, maybe caravans are very profitable, I haven’t tried them yet, but so far it looks like this) 
6) you might not know, but the game has a very complex economy system that takes into account every item produced, every purchase, etc. and noticing the impossibility of managing villages and their production, I was upset
7) workshops in towns that cost much as f*ck give little profit and simply disappear in the event of a war with the faction of the city, not arrested, just disappear - unrewarding
8) sim life and many ideas from mods before are ignored. just imagine - you are a soldier in the service of the lord as part of his army, but without mods this is not available, like many other features and ideas that were implemented and worked out in MnB1 (with Warband) and that was most upset and questionable, i know that game still early access, but it released 2 years ago and i haven't seen anything new since that moment, nor since warband. maybe developers are just making a big bet on modders, but there is still no devkit for them
9) leveling - it seems to me that the developers of many sandboxes (PZomboid, 7daystodie, etc) rely on the fact that you will play their game for 20 hours a day for many years, otherwise I cannot explain such a long progression of your character, bannerlord is no exception. a very slow leveling turns into a dreary skill building of each character in your squad / clan / kingdom with a calculation for the maximum benefit at the current moment or someday after - routine 

I understand that on the one hand it will seem challenging, but on the other hand it is mostly a non-rewarding routine. Better call it Warband HD Remaster, add flail and sell for 20 dollars, but bought for 50 it makes me dissapointed, it makes me upset, it makes me feel like fooled by Taleworlds on Turkish bazaar. 
Well, I'll wait for the transfer of some good mods like Prophesy of Pendor to bannerlord, but now not recommend to buy

This game is only good and accepted because it is the only game that offers this kind of experience, no matter how broken, poorly designed and generally frustrating that experience may be. 

The vast majority of the playtime in this game is spent trying to exploit or circumvent poorly implemented and poorly designed mechanics. The game actively tries to stop you from having any fun. 

Battles: The battle AI is just sad... it will either run to the edge of the map if you overpower it or it will just rush you in an uncoordinated manner when it thinks it has an advantage. No tactics, no skill, no challenge. 

Overworld: Despite being told from day one that kingdoms are completely unbalanced, nothing meaningful has ever been done to address that. The Khuzaits and Aserai will just roll across the map if left unattended. Map AI is better than battle AI at least but there is some anti-player bias. 

Clan: This is one aspect I do enjoy. It's decently enjoyable to grow your clan, have members be born, companions lost in battle, assemble caravans, assign governors and other parties. 

Economy: Probably the most poorly designed aspect of the game. The devs actively want to prevent you from having any passive income. As of the last patch they completely destroyed Workshops. Cities, towns, castles and workshops provide no money, while garrisons cost huge amounts. You are actively punished for having many cities and high quality troops. You're left with roaming the land selling blacksmith weapons and other loot for your warchest. 

Overall: At the end of the day, this game is just unfun. Game mechanics actively work against you and despite thousand of comments and years of feedback, devs are refusing to implement common sense changes to make the game the fun sandbox we've always wanted. Mod scene is basically dead as the game is unstable and any small update breaks all mods.

original review:

can't play a normal full campaign against a friend. the current multiplayer options are extremely depressing compared to what the single player game has. 

single player lets you play a full campaign while multiplayer does not let you play a full campaign at all and only lets you play short battle instances.

and even the existing multiplayer options do not work. I bought a friend this game as a gift just to not even be able to play multiplayer because it says i have to ""select my region from the matchmaking settings"" when there literally is no option to change my region anywhere?

A lot of improvements from Warband. This feels a lot closer to what Taleworlds wanted out of a M&B singleplayer experience.

The clan system is a welcomed addition, the replacement of marshals for armies was a great choice and far more enjoyable for the player, the inventory system is more modern with nice QoL features.
The battles are just fantastic. Having the campaign difficulty on 1:1 (highest) with unlimited persistent bodies, going into battle with thousands of units each side, and watching the sheer gruelling warfare unfold in front of you -- the feeling is something else. Warband's battles and sieges never felt so dire or desperate. The stakes didn't feel as high. Not once in Warband did I think ""wow so many (npc) lives were lost today"", after seeing a couple hundred corpses max lie on the ground. In Bannerlord, however, when the battle is over and you ride around the field seeing piles upon piles of bodies, numbering in the thousands, litter the ground, it really feels like you've just survived medieval hell.
The visuals and graphics are a massive step-up too. The snowy maps are beautiful, especially at night during a snowstorm. The castle and town designs are diverse enough across the different regions of Calradia, but you will start to see repetition within the same region especially within the central region (empire).

Here are the negatives:
I played through the campaign on 1:1 difficulty and the game really drew me in. The only part I didn't enjoy, I almost hated, and that when you reach the part of the main quest when you assemble [spoiler]the dragon banner[/spoiler] and declare yourself [spoiler]as the rightful ruler of Calradia[/spoiler]. I wish I knew that when you do that you are bombarded with a bunch of repetitive radiant quests that only prevent the inevitable - that is the [spoiler]empire factions all declaring war on you and you cannot get out of it until all 3 are defeated[/spoiler]. As an example, the radiant quests would either be [raid a bandit hideout], [kill 3-4 roaming bandit parties], or [attack this specific marked caravan]. The radiant quests sucked and didn't fit the current gameplay at that point. How were you supposed to deal with a caravan roaming on the other side of the continent when you've got fiefs to defend on the other? It honestly felt like an afterthought. It would have fit better during much earlier gameplay before you got your first fief. What followed was even more of a chore. If I were to play the campaign again (not sandbox) then [spoiler]after assembling the dragon banner[/spoiler] I would intentionally not continue the main quest (you continue it through a series of dialogue options once the aforementioned conditions are met). I wish during said dialogue there was more warning before you proceed, or better yet, tune those boring-ass radiant quests to fit in with the current state of the game. Once that uphill grind was finally over, you can return to the great free-flowing gameplay that Bannerlord has to offer.

Family System, while very cool, has not much use. Cannot give land to family members and watch them expand their own family, build their renown or do anything useful themselves (like hunting bandits, making trade caravans, hiring their own companions to do that type of stuff, etc).

Raiding villages and sacking towns is great fun... but what else is there to do? not much. There are bandit camps and ""hide outs"" but not much else.

Still don't have multiple NPCs to do the things I could do in Mount & Blade 1 - Sword of Damocles mod  - Recruit patrol groups to hunt bandits, recruiter to hire and train troops, Gift npc to impress members of my faction.

Still no diplomacy system. You are a king. There are no non aggression pacts, no trade agreements, no alliances. I cannot ask another king for his assistance militarily, financially or politically. I cannot become a bandit king or a nomadic war host and offer my warriors for money/loot/slaves.

No Armor Crafting system, so I must rely on RNG to spawn what I want for my companions (who also don't have an Auto Loot if I ever wanted them to upgrade themselves.

Original post - 2020

Alright so first 20 hours so far and it's pretty fun, a more fleshed out and in depth version of the previous M&B (without mods) though it definitely has some game breaking bugs but due to it's early access that's all chill.  I'll label some of them I've encountered which have caused some issues.

-Firstly, I was in a siege defending with around 800 men in general, but the AI were not functioning correctly, such as when the attackers pushed up ladders on the walls they got stuck and jumbled up into areas like they were not finding their way around.  This felt like XP farms in minecraft as taking out 100 enemies were easy as they just wouldn't function.  Cavalry would block the gates when I tried to unblock them to get the defender and attackers to both find their paths leading to a long siege which ended in me having to retreat due to the endless battle.

-Secondly this also is with sieges, in general seems like those are the most bugged of the bunch, but I was defending and wasn't allowed to pick any of the options in the tab with the title ""The enemy has begun their assault"".  The two possible choices to pick from were to fight or to leave it to the others, in which I could do neither of those as I had sworn not to fight the enemy.  This lead to me having to restart my entire campaign as I could not continue with unpausing or fastforwarding nor any of the options.

Overall it's pretty fun but any longer campaigns seem to get halted with incidents like these.  As it's early access likely most of the stuff I'm encountering will be fixed.",1585757500,1703093410,False,0,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,True

While it's ""EA,"" I've mostly lost trust in Taleworlds' intention to deliver a fleshed-out product comparing to even the functionality of modded Warband. They seem more interested in tweaking numbers in partially-implemented subsystems of the game to make it more ""grindy"" than working on additional features.

Hope time proves me wrong, but don't exactly hold my breath for it.

(Edit: By the by, before somebody jumps on it - I play all the games I can offline, which is why my recorded ""play time"" is what it is).

End of 2023 edit: The game is still as devoid of gameplay features as it was. Taleworlds wasted years of potential development on tweaking variables, and without mods not even battles are all that engaging.

They just suddenly released it out of early access but it still feels like it needs more. The modding scene is basically dead. They release small patches every other month and call it a major update but all it does is make the small amount of good mods unplayable. 

I could be totally wrong and they might be just being quiet for a major dlc and i hope so but based on how this game is right now i can't recommend it as much as i would like to.

I think it's a great game and i don't regret my decision to have played (almost) 500 hours and if you think you will like it you should try it, but don't expect anything more than what there already is.

I will probably come back to it now and again and maybe play when the lotr mod comes out but all we can do is hope that the developers haven't given up on the game.",1597763656,1703013678,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

AI in games is lacking, so cheating resources or men or power to help the AI remain competitive helps keep the game engaging and challenging. Games cheat by letting the player sneak past enemies, even though they should by all rights be able to see a full-grown person crouching only 20 feet away. Games cheat, but the balance of cheating is what makes a game fun or frustrating.

In this game players complain that the game cheats by spawning lords with 20 men in their party. Players do not complain about cheating when the game deletes entire clans from the game, but not the player clan. Because it benefits them. Which I understand. If a restaurant accidentally gives you an extra serving of fries, who would speak up and offer to return said fries?

I feel the balance of this game has changed towards making it easier to snowball. You know, that thing people hate in strategy games. The devs have pushed an update that allows kingdoms to be destroyed, making world conquest easier, but in doing so have revoked the right to exist from some kingdoms and entire cultures in this game. The Battanian's always lose without the players help, and now they and many of their clans will be destroyed unless the player makes it their goal to preserve the Battanian Kingdom.

This most recent update has hurt the way I preferred to play the game. I have conquered the map once, a feat I never bothered to accomplish in Warband, and in doing so have lost all ambition to do so again.

""And Alexander wept, seeing as he had no more worlds to conquer.""

This quote perfectly describes my problem with ""painting the map"". So I don't. I play to enjoy everything the game has to offer besides world conquest. And I LIKE it. After this recent update, every game I play will inevitably be reduced to 3 or 4 kingdoms becoming world powers and controlling the entire map. The AI has no mercy for weak kingdoms, and with no civil wars or kingdom creation, the world map will become small in a sense, as the diversity and uniqueness of other factions will fade. Although I will add that the player can create kingdoms, but the game is buggy as the devs clearly never intended for the player to create a kingdom, then leave it. The kingdoms colors will change to match the players, even if the player joins a completely different kingdoms.

I am glad that players who want landless kingdoms to be destroyed can enjoy their game, but I cannot enjoy such a feature.

I will remove this negative review when the devs make kingdom destruction optional.",1702777113,1702777113,False,11,2,0.561739921569824219,0,True,False,False

First of all, I am a diehard fan of the M&B franchise. Warband was the pre-Skyrim Skyrim of modding, and Napoleonic Wars doubled the amount of gameplay. I love the games, but I don't love Bannerlord. 

I am a modding kind of guy. Most M&B players are. 
Mods are essential to the success of the M&B franchise. Mods make the hitboxes in combat much more tolerable, they make combat rewarding, there was even a mod that let you stealth through the bandit hideouts (or even allow the player to attack them during the day, what a stupid limitation). The mod I miss most allowed you to forge multiple weapons at once, and now the mod crashes the main menu. You can literally spend IRL days forging individual weapons to level smithing, and you won't use a single one.

Trade and combat continue to get nerfed and now all the mods that made trade and combat profitable are abandoned and the community has forgotten Bannerlord to go back to making Warband content. 
I am so sick of dredging through a modlist for 5-10 hours every patch push to find all the broken mods that the community creators have abandoned because Taleworlds has decided to be creator hostile. These patches are only minor hotfixes. I actually noticed one, they pushed a fix to keep one floating cow on the ground, and it broke MOST of the mods I was using. The game crashed every few minutes, if it got past loading the main menu. 

I, like most of the M&B community, have done their best to make Bannerlord fun, but the patches (which are now almost exclusively multiplayer) have pushed away all of the mod creators who used to make Warband mods such as A World of Ice and Fire, Perisno and Gekokoju on ModDB. 

It pains me to admit this, but the choices of Taleworlds have pushed me away from the game and it's highly unlikely that I'll ever reinstall Bannerlord.

EDIT: It's 2023 and the modding community have almost completely abandoned the game. This review aged like a fine whiskey.",1638667111,1702743659,False,20,0,0.638054490089416504,0,True,False,True

More interactive combat, lots of quality of life improvements, and a more structured Calradia. Do you like being the leader of armies? Now you can do that without grinding relations and hoping for the chance to become the marshal of the realm. 

Some of the great things of Bannerlord include the combat improvements, the AI improvements, the ability to use true strategy to win battles like a medieval genius, and the ability to have clan that can raise children, have direct relations with other clans and can own fiefs.

For the Warband players: Here are some of the negative changes from warband that I'd personally like to see fixed...
1) feasts no longer exist, while not an important mechanic, it still helped make the world feel more alive and immersive.
2) clans are strict, if their leader says no, that's that. I think this is a big problem, as you can make the son of a lord your best friend, when you make a kingdom, that man will never join until their father agrees. It very much feels like a ""Can't man, my dad said no"" type situation. They also don't have the relations based orders you can give to parties such as ""go attack this village"" or ""target this castle, it's weak"" that could be helpful to strategize enemy movements.
3) You need to have a clan rank to start a faction, and you cannot be a mercenary while you have land. While I don't think that being a king should be as simple as the owning land, it shouldn't need to take hours and hours of grinding renown being stuck in a limbo.
4) Only castles and Towns are obtainable fiefs, no longer can you donate worthless villages to people to please them, as all bound villages to a castle or town belong to the owner of the town or castle. Don't expect to be given land when you join a kingdom, first the land must be taken and the lords must be willing to put you into a vote, and then you still need to have enough influence to successfully surpass the others to get the fief. There is no monetary compensation or ability to rebel if a fief you take over is taken by someone else in a vote, it's more of a tough luck maybe you can get the next one.
5) Claimants are no longer a thing anymore, still wish they were, at least for the non empire factions.

Finally, if there's anything I want more in this game, it's kingdom diplomacy, it doesn't need to be crusader kings or anything like that, but literally anything that could be like factions that want peace in times of war, or the ability to sway opinions of your enemies to try to get peace, or the opposite and try to declare war. Delegation gifts to improve kingdom relations would be great, and maybe even that if two kings are friends, they won't just go to war randomly.",1702740854,1702740854,True,1,0,0.514705896377563477,0,True,False,False

It can be a very big timesink and investment to build your character and army up. It isn't like Total War where once you're hitting the end game the game is basically over and it's just a matter of going through the motions, it's a constant back and forth of war, which keeps it fun and interesting even at the end.

It's a fantastic game that starts off very frustrating. For those of you who enjoy going into games blind (like me) I honestly recommend not following that train of thought for this game. The barrier to understanding is huge and the information isn't quickly there. Take your time and realise it's gonna take a while for things to click, and keep on with one character through failures and successes while you learn.

This game sucked me in for a whole month and it was an amazing experience. Now I'm tinkering with mods to make the experience better (on a micro management perspective / gameplay fun perspective) and happy with the results.

I won't play the game as much as it's scratched the itch I'm looking for and it requires a bit of time to feel some sense of success, but it's a great kingdom management / battle fighting game that does something incredibly unique I haven't found elsewhere.

This game shouldn't have entered [i] or left [/i] Early access. It is a game that would have been A-tier in 2014-2016, but is very dated and buggy for a [i]""newly released""[/i] title that has had a solid decade of development time. 


The world map is still clunky and full of ""odd"" things, such as settlements starving themselves back to poverty because they won't stop growing (wiping out your garrison), settlements having nothing but problems if you don't spend your every second completing missions for the notables, being unable to launch sieges because a single AI army rocks up to ""reinforce"", instantly taking over the siege and never launching an assault (Even if you're the king of that armies kingdom). The list is long and at this point old.

As for the combat/fighting? yeah it's pretty much the same as warband. The AI is slightly less dumb, but it's somehow buggier. Basically no different from the gameplay trailer in 2016.

The full list of stuff that they've added that I've found?
[list]
    [*][i] Limited [/i] voice lines. They appear AI generated and it's awful.
    [*] Banners! They're buggy and don't always work.
    [*] Warehouses! yeah, the thing warband. They were hyping it up for some reason, no excuse for this thing taking 2 years to cook up.
    [*] Piles of new armor. Sadly you'll probably never use any of it because you're looting the very stupid AI lords A-tier armor
    [*] Sieges are no longer bug filled nightmares. They're now just let down by how dumb the AI is during them.
    [*] alleys, they're not really worth it.
[/list]


As for what hasn't improved?
[list]
    [*] heros/notables are still a pain in the ass. The interactions are shallow and the grind is long.
    [*]Campaign map AI (actions, armies, trading... just... everything)
    [*]Smithing, still a big hype feature that is shallow and unrewarding (it no longer replaces every weapon in the market pool though so that's a win)
    [*]Skills and the levelling system (a large number of them are ""implemented"" but useless or so minor that even if you can stack them, the improvement is just not worth it)
    [*] Troop tier performance/balance (Tier 4 is your friend)
    [*] Troop trees are basically all unchanged and poorly balanced (Spam cav archers or Fians + knights and you'll trade 4:1 with pretty much everything in the game)
    [*] Graphics are unchanged. They were good in 2016 but it hasn't improved much since that trailer. This applies more to armor and weapons than the environment which is currently still holding strong.

I love M&B. I have spent more hours in Warband than in any game whatsoever, so i can't forgive TW for their laziness over the past TEN YEARS OF DEVELOPMENT.
TEN. FUGGING. YEARS.

From the announcement of the game 'till its release,
* Ubisoft has released 8 Assassin's Creed games
* Skyrim has been released 6 times
* 5 Battlefield games have been released
* 7 COD games have been released
* Paradox Development Studio has released 6 games (7 with Vic3 releasing on the same day as Bannerlord) and 61 major DLC
* Isis rose and fell
* 24 Marvel movies have been released and they're now sheet
* Weed has been legalized in many places
* We saw the beginning and the end of Game of Thrones. That was like what ? 7 seasons ?
* GTA V was published and rereleased on 5 different supports
* Queen Elizabeth died
* Epstein didn't kill himself
* We got a new pope
* Americans elected a bag of cheetos as president
* We survived a major pandemic
* Wokeness rose and ruined everything for everyone
* Star Citizen is still in early access
* Valve released a game

It's an awful, unfinished mess. And i'm really sad because i love this series, and i expected something better than what we got.
I really hope we'll get some more content coming these next months/years, but i'm not counting on TW much...
Modders, it's up to you, again :(

Edit 12/12/23 : As i thought, TW doesn't do jackshit. The 1.2.0 update still hasn't been released despite promises and claims, and modders did have to fix and develop content in their stead.

I don't think so.

Lets start with the Good.

I really like the combat. Directional blocking and attacks are nothing new, but the way weapons feel to use in this game, combined with the system, work really well together. The hit markers for ranged weapons sound very satisfying (so do a lot of confirmation noises!), and learning how to aim feels rewarding as well. Different weapons and weapon stats can feel meaningful and change the way you approach fights. 
Commanding troops also feels very rewarding, especially when using better strategy than your opponent gives you so much of an edge that a fairly lopsided battle is still won. The fact that the game slows down when giving commands is a very nice quality of life addition and helps making strategic choices.
Experience gain and progress feels nice, as most actions in game either reward experience, money, or renown, and there are perks to pick from at regular intervals. The breadth of perks allows for several playthroughs with different setups, and helps when playing toward a particular goal.
The world in game is fairly pretty, and the geography of the overworld, as well as the distribution of factions interesting enough. The troop variation is nice, and i recon most people will find at least one faction they really like. The different battle environments make a strategic difference, and also look fairly realistic. Being able to create your own Kingdom and managing it, for example, passing policies to shape the Kingdom the way you want, is great, and the clan management is nice as well. I like the option to have several of your clan members running around the map compared to just having your own troop.

Ok great, so why isn't this a glowing recommendation?
This game just doesn't feel finished - in some places, almost, in other places, not at all.
Take Smithing for example. Great addition to the game, and the ability to create your own weapons to fit your playstyle is fun, but, why are there hundreds of thousands of possible smithing combinations? Why are all of them swords and maybe 10 of them axes? Why do i need all of those sword combinations if there's no difference (apart from aesthetics) between them, and if there is a difference, why do i actually care about 1 more point in 'handling'. A stat that, by the way, is not explained, and as with many things in game, doesn't have a tooltip.
Experience, Perks, and Kingdom management policies? Some of them are completely overpowered, at least, compared to others (or, for Perks specifically, compared to the alternative Perk). A lot of them straight up don't work, or don't work as intended (or advertised), and an even larger amount technically work, but in practise, are irrelevant.
A lot of things seem weirdly unbalanced. Place first in a tournament? On average across a playthrough, 200-ish Denars. However, you might also be awarded a sword! Another 1k Denars. Or a Horse, 20k Denars. Smith a high tier two handed sword, 40k Denars. Smith a sword with even better stats than that, but use a different component, suddenly worth only 5k.
 
Then there's a bunch of things that seem like the remnants of content that was cut. Lets take NPC interactions. When an NPC has a quest, you can ask them about that. If the NPC has Money, or something to sell, you can talk to them about that. And that's kind of it. Sometimes, there's options to 'Talk about something else', which leads to a Menu where you can only select 'Nevermind...'.
What about the 'Story'. You save your Brother from a Bandit lair, and have the opportunity to behead the bandit, or let him go. If you let him go, he says you'll meet again.... and then you just don't. If you kill him, nobody cares. 
Pretty much all the Village/City/Castle settings, outside of battle. They look nice, don't get me wrong, but (almost) everything can be done from a menu, and you never actually need to walk around these places. Why not? And why is it that there's 2 quests where suddenly you do have to walk around for 10 minutes? Was this planned for all quests, or is that only here to make sure you see the environments eventually?


I avoided making the comparison to Mount and Blade: Warband until now, but in many ways this feels like Taleworlds wanted to make Warband better, added a bunch of new systems and ideas, worked on the Ideas that they really liked, and left everything else in an unfinished state. 
If the game still speaks to you after reading this, go ahead! Ive definitely had my fair share of fun playing this game. If you're looking for a fully fleshed out experience, this is probably not it.",1702397530,1702397655,False,8,0,0.563460230827331543,0,True,False,False

Early game is fun and the grind is addictive but as you rule your own kingdom the diplomacy and everything else is just really shallow and needs to be brought up to par with mods but the mods don’t even work now since tw keep releasing mini patches that break mod compatibility.

Battles are also shallow and boring because of the new pre battle formation system which means you can’t create certain army groups like skirmishers and spearmen, they are all grouped into one now which was a terrible decision.

Battles are excellent. Best mounted combat of any game I've played. Pressing F6 (assigning your sergeants to take command) is easy and lets you fight without thinking about your army and strategy, but it's more fun to command the battle yourself.

Simulated economy is enjoyable with tangential educational benefits. Learn war profiteering with Bannerlord!

Chance-based persuasion and dialogue system encourages save-scumming. Playing without save-scumming is frustrating and time-consuming, especially when finding a wife. I would recommend removing the system altogether and replacing it with dialogue choices with occasional binary checks based on player traits, which are already tracked (honor, mercy, etc.), clan tier, wealth, or other skill levels. No more failing a 90% chance to convince your potential wife that you, who are famous for being honorable, are in fact honorable.

Dialogue acknowledging the player's sex was cut prior to release, reducing an interesting gameplay choice in Warband to a boring cosmetic choice in Bannerlord. I didn't expect Taleworlds to touch this given modern cultural pressure. While not a deal-breaker, I preferred Warband's system and wished it could have been expanded upon rather than neutered.

The crafting system went through several iterations in early access, but still feels incomplete. I'm not a fan of crafting stamina; making each crafting action instead cost time would be much more enjoyable. Melee and thrown weapons are all you can craft. It would feel better to be able to craft ranged equipment, armor, clothes, horse equipment, and trade goods.

Campaigning feels good when you're at war with a worthy adversary, but there comes a point (just like in Warband) where world conquest is a foregone conclusion, and rather than put the effort into conquering the rest of the map, it's more fun to just start a new game. I suppose this reflects real-life empire cycles in a way, but for the sake of fun, Bannerlord would have benefited from a powerful late-game threat that would, hypothetically, come from outside of the playable map and demand all the resources of your massive late-game empire and a unified Calradia to drive them back.

This game is still good despite nitpicks that become grating after hundreds of hours. If you're anything like me, you'll see negative reviews with hundreds or thousands of hours as a roundabout positive review (so long as they don't mention a recent update ruining everything). So I'll just save you some mental processing and recommend it.",1702237122,1702237122,True,1,0,0.502089142799377441,0,True,False,False

Combat is clunky. Like its smooth compared to similar games of its release date, but still clunky.

No multiplayer campgine map mode. It had been rumored and discussed at the early stages from what I remember but it would have been a whole different game had that been done.

Warband was a great game, and Bannerlord by comparison feels like the start of something that could have been great. Right now, its a boring bare-bones never ending combat simulator. The combat itself is fun, but it gets old and stale really fast once you realize that none of the fights matter. There is no interaction with the game outside pointless conversations and simple directions, and even those can be lacking. There is no diplomacy, alliances, or elements of a larger strategy. AI makes insane decisions regarding war and diplomacy constantly. Many of the systems that looked like they existed in the trailers were scrapped or gutted beyond recognition.

After waiting for so long for this game, I am beyond disappointed with the state of it. Mods can make the game enjoyable by adding in features that should have been in the base game, but as others have said, most of the modders gave up because taleworlds doesn't care about them, and they don't care about the rest of the players either. They made their money, now everyone can get fucked. Theres still no custom multiplayer games either. Modders have shown that multiplayer or co-op style campaign systems are technically feasible, but taleworlds refuses to budge on the issue.

Maybe one day the game will be worth it, but honestly, your money is better spent on warband so that you can play some of the excellent mods for it that have more content than this overpriced ""complete"" game.",1702072250,1702072250,False,5,0,0.531268656253814697,0,True,False,False

diplomacy doesnt exist its a thing you see but have no effect over you can ""vote"" but it for some reason decides this based on a new rating system not your clan rank you worked on no no its a new system in the bottom right when you become a lord despite you slaying every bandit in the land winning 100 tournaments its at 0 dont want a castle cause it will bankrupt you too bad get it anyway dont want a city cause you have no governor of the same faction to run it too bad.

 what..
 their both imperial EWHY SHOULD IT MAKE ANY FUCKING DIFFERENCE WHY EVEN ADD THIS TO THE GAME.
 can it go down no as long as youre governor "" doesnt share a culture""
 with the town it will perpetually refuse to build and so be poor starving and unhappy and you can barely control if you get towns or not...

it is basically the first M&B with graphical overhaul and new UI and some new features but nothing to say the long developmet is put into evolving the original game

You won't know what that is until you're dozens of hours into a save file and realize that a choice you made in character creation made the game incredibly difficult.

Skills the player can select in the skill tree have no effect due to the player not being allowed to govern their own settlements.  I put a good amount of effort into making all my fiefs constantly stocked with prisoners for the 'Forced Labor' perk, only to much later realize it was all wasted because my perks don't apply to my cities.

Settlements revolt constantly because they are a different culture than the leader. This is the strongest penalty to their happiness and can only be mitigated by constantly running the 'Increase happiness' project, making actually building the settlements up impossible. 

The diplomacy system barely works. Trading prisoners only works for ones in your party, prisoners in your dungeons might as well not exist. Trading fiefs, which should be a base feature, is instead the capstone of the ""Trading"" tree. If you have hundreds of thousands of denars, good luck trying to move a tiny slider to match the amount whatever you're trading is worth. 

The NPC responses are bordering on nonsensical. You catch a lord who was burning one of your villages to the ground and tell him ""Surrender or Die!"" and the usual response is ""Hmm, I was hoping we wouldn't fight today"" like you're inconveniencing them. 

The lords consistently vote against any policy or proposal that would make their lives better, and declare war for nonsensical reasons.

As a fan of its predecessor, Warband, I had high expectations for Bannerlord, and it certainly delivered with its extensive features and satisfying gameplay.

One of the game's most captivating aspects is the progression from a humble soldier or even a peasant to eventually leading substantial armies. The journey from a captain with a handful of followers to commanding massive forces in epic skirmishes is both rewarding and immersive. The option to align with a king, pledging loyalty for castles and settlements, or striking out to establish your own kingdom adds layers of complexity and strategy to the game.

The medieval combat in Bannerlord is nothing short of exceptional. Whether engaging in battles on horseback, leading infantry on foot, or coordinating archers, the game offers a rich and diverse combat experience. The innovative features, such as blacksmithing, owning businesses, and the intricate dialogue system, contribute to the overall depth of gameplay.

One of Bannerlord's strengths is its groundbreaking approach to medieval combat, making it a must-play for anyone with a love for the genre. The game's expansive world and the freedom it provides, whether through tournaments, factional wars, or the pursuit of personal wealth, make it a standout title in its category.

The potential for Bannerlord's future is exciting, and I eagerly anticipate how the game will expand in subsequent releases. The experience is reminiscent of what players may have wished for in games like Skyrim, especially in the context of large-scale battles. I wholeheartedly recommend Bannerlord to anyone considering it; the enjoyment and depth it offers make it a worthwhile investment.

Additionally, the inclusion of mods further enhances the game's longevity and enjoyment. Exploring the Nexus mods or trying out options from the Steam Workshop adds another layer to an already exceptional gaming experience. Don't hesitate to dive into the world of Bannerlord, as it is bound to be a memorable journey that echoes in your gaming memories for a long time.",1701921394,1701921394,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the game is so terribly balanced on the Sandbox / Campaign modes that it's nearly garbage to play.  The AI cheats.  Not only does the AI cheat but you're limited in  the number of troops you can bring to a battlefield and reserve units.   The game forces you to use only mounted units for large battles as you never get the right troops and reserves come in piece mail.  The game feels unfinished and despite being FUN I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Multiplayer is trash ,  the only people doing large scale organised battles are multiplayer mod users for that PE thing but it's run by your usual control freaks and set up as a grind fest so you won't be doing many battles anyways just running around mining crap until your slaughtered and naked again as the faction use you as a resource and little else. . ""Join our guild rife with nepotism and collectivist rhetoric "" Imagine volunteering your time, only to be kicked around without a say and used as a pawn.  Might as well be working a regular 9 to 5 as a job.  Anyways the game is borked and without mods and cheats (the ai cheats) the game is just crap.   Like an army of 300 elite units vs mediocre enemy units yet somehow they kill you despite you killing half of them solo.   Kicks the fun right out of it.  Even when you're 100% positive you should win with superior units and tactics the game will handicap you to lose by stashing your units in reserve.  Without mods this game is trash.  With mods the game is still trash and still unbalanced and still a slog but only marginally better.   AI will spawn units out of nowhere , Ai will force you to bring your units in reserve in the worst possible order.   Factions are heavily unbalanced, unit types are heavily unbalanced.

Update 12/2024

Awsome singleplayer champaign, horrible multiplayer.
While the champaign stays enjoyable even after 100h of playing, the MP remains to be an utter mess. Respawn-mechanics in tdm turn every battle experience into a messy, futile onslaught where individual skill might makes a difference of only 3-4 seconds more to live. Surviving direct encounters is a matter of coincidence since people spawn right beside or behind you. From one second to another you are surrounded by 4 enemies and while you might still stand your ground for 3-4 seconds its the cavalry that interrupts every moment of skill-based pvp. Cavalry is a cancer here.

Not only the Warband tdm felt much better, also the sieges in Warband are much more enjoyable.

[h2] Conquer, Command, and Consequence: Bannerlord 2 Review [/h2]

Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord stands tall as a wonderful medieval sandbox masterpiece, immersing players in a world brimming with strategic depth and consequence-laden choices. From managing your wealth to delicately balancing morale and food for your army, every decision echoes throughout the vast landscape.

The game’s allure lies in its attention to detail, allowing players the freedom to carve their path in a huge medieval realm. Whether you're forging alliances, leading armies into epic battles, or partaking in the intricacies of diplomacy, every action you make carries weight, influencing the narrative trajectory you will take.

One of Bannerlord 2's notable strengths is its unforgiving yet rewarding gameplay. The balance between managing resources, maintaining troop morale, and navigating the intricacies of power dynamics keeps players constantly engaged. Each decision, be it political alliances or battlefield tactics, ripples through the game, ensuring an ever-evolving experience.

[b] TIP For New Players [/b]
For those venturing into this vast world for the first time, I'd consider disabling character death initially. This grants you the freedom to experiment without fear of losing progress, allowing you to adapt smoother to the game's mechanics. You can learn without the stress of a permanent setback; it's a great way to get comfortable with the game's controls and dynamics.

In conclusion, Bannerlord 2 is a huge canvas for strategic minds and medieval enthusiasts alike. Its depth, immersive gameplay, and the weight of consequence ensure an experience that is both challenging and  satisfying. Embark on your journey, make alliances, lead armies, and revel in the art of consequence-driven decision-making in this awesome sandbox adventure!",1701613050,1701613050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The ""diplomacy"" ""mechanics"" are even more shallow then the 13 year old predecessor Warband, there is no real living world only, no memorable encounters or things like that. There are only battles, more battles and finally a battle.

Bannerlord could have been one of the best games period. Instead it's a cool battle ""simulator"" in an empty shell of a world.

Compared to Warband, the campaign is bland and shallow. Companions have no depth as anything other than soldiers and stat cows, recruiting soldiers and training them from rank 1 is tedious and annoying, dialogue and diplomacy with other lords is almost non-existent, many perks are broken and just not implemented, and once you get to a certain point, there's nothing to do in the campaign. Mechanics like camping, books, usurpers, duels, insults, and other stuff that was in Warband just are not present in this current build. There seems to be the start of a story-line, like what they did in Viking Conquest, but it might as well not exist at this build. I assume they're gonna add more to it so I'll give them that, and if its anywhere near as good as Viking Conquest then I'm pretty excited for it.
That being said, I've had a lot of fun inside the battles themselves. The command system is pretty neat and fun to mess around with. Multiplayer has been loads of fun with friends but it gets pretty repetitive.
What I would say is wait until they release and see the state of the game there. Its a mistake to release a single-player-driven game in early access. You either have an unfinished story that makes it pointless, or you have a finished story alongside an unfinished game empty of content. The latter just makes it bland and you'll get bored of the story by the time the full game comes out. Since Warband had the mechanics, I assume this game will add them but I haven't seen a roadmap or clear list of what content they want to release and all they have updated is bug fixes so be wary if you're thinking of getting this down the line.

Especially with the saved games and graphics there are just too many bugs. I lost count on how many times i've had to start a new game because my save file was corrupted. NPC's gear is bugged, your opponents are switching in and out of armor mid-fight. ALL THE TOWNS ARE COMPLETELY BROKEN, missing assets, missing ground textures, bugged textures that look like a blobby glitchy mess. The optimization is non existent, don't try to play on anything below medium settings or the game will crash, break, freeze constantly no matter how powerful your machine is. Only the higher settings were given any attention at all.

Not even starting on immersion, from clothes and gear glitching through chairs when you sit on them to clothes and gear seemingly ""hovering"" over your body when you wear them. It's like atmospherics, immersion and detail were given NO attention at all.

Next to all that there's the BROKEN PROMISES of the devs. They promised a much bigger map than there is right now, they promised aquatic gameplay, ships, sea combat, piracy, viking raids none of which were added. There were early devblogs mentioning city-founding, the building of forts, walls and monuments, being able to completely raze villages and cities to the ground and many many more promises made and none fulfilled. They can't even get their base game to properly function and all they really added from the early acces until now is a superlame broken ""alley gang"" system no-one asked for.

And now the cherry on the pie...
Most of the features and mechanics that actually work well and are fun/enjoyable ALREADY EXISTED in their previous game: ""mount and blade warband"" of which bannerlord is just a cheap, lazy remake.  

If this isn't a literal SCAM then the game was ABANDONED by the devs during the beta, it doesn't look like they're going to fix it at any point and god forbid they add anything new... 

And last but not least: If you ask Taleworlds for help to make the product you paid for actually function the way it's supposed to you'll be referred to sketchy public forums. And when you complain about them not taking responsibility they'll rudely tell you off, i've literally met drug dealers with better customer support.

Coming back into it im trying the multiplayer mods this time. Persistent Empires, Bannerlord Online, cRPG.

You want persistent wars where theres constant PVP, being in a faction, mining resources and crafting gear for the poeple going into battle? Play Persistent Empires.

I'm disappointed.  8 years of waiting and the game is surprisingly far from being finished.
Constant crashes, linear dialogue that breaks more often than it should, broken quests you can't complete that I can live with but when my save file gets deleted and I'm told that this will happen ""sometimes"" it's the cherry on top.

The game look great but only feels slightly improved from warband. (visually)

On the one hand Bannerlord is extremely addictive. Building from the ground up a strong army, fully kitted out, 500 men strong, sieging castles and burning towns is amazing. Nothing makes you feel more human than having a huge stack of troops only to take a loss and another one and be back to ground zero. The atmospheres are amazing, the music is solid.

Problem being... that could have just as easily been describing the much cheaper Warband. Bannerlord's only advantage over Warband is the graphics. I think the game looks really good, specifically in the HUGE battles the game allows (over Warband) Seeing the Calvary charge at you while on foot you feel scared. seeing the catapults firing overhead as your push a battering ram through a wall of arrows is nerve wracking but again... the graphics aren't good enough to justify the cost of entry.

The gameplay in general while addicting can feel shallow after a season or two. At the end of the day you're going around hiring troops and finding looters or other armies. Maybe as a side biz you've got a passive shop or caravan but it's no where near enough gameplay to distract you. That's more an issue with Mount & Blade in general than Bannerlord specifically.

So at the end of the day if you want Warband but pretty and are willing to pay the price increase, do it, it's a phenomenal game. If you're fine with Warband being smaller in many many ways but saving a ton of money, then don't buy Bannerlord.

I hope the developers make some big changes that really change things up, but right now it's really just Mount & Blade: Warband+",1604878350,1701184797,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With that, I'm going to change my review to positive as, now that the MP and SP are both working well, it deserves a positive rating.

Single player in this game is, just like the original, quite unique. There are few games like it and Bannerlord does what it does very well. If you want to be a medieval lord in a video game, well, this is your game.

Combat is done well and controlling your army is fairly straightforward. It's not too complicated to be confusing but has enough detail to allow you to have reasonable control over your army.

Multiplayer has been improving now that it's been fixed. Although the population is still not large, there are hundreds of players playing at a time, not including the Bannerlord Online mod which, I am sure, has a large following. Although some players say that games like Chivalry 2 and Mordhau are better for multiplayer, I prefer the combat style of Bannerlord. I also am a big fan of the Captain mode in Bannerlord, which is unique to Bannerlord.

M&B Warbands had a huge mod community and Bannerlord is, slowly but surely, following suit.

Basically, if this is your style of game, you won't be disappointed. It still needs some improvements but the devs update it fairly regularly.

Original Post: Two of my friends bought Bannerlord so what we can all play MP.

Neither of them can even log in, much less play, MP.

That's not even getting into all of the server issues due to the bad coding. Servers lag out and drop all the time. I tried hosting my own and can't get it to be even remotely stable.

The single player seems to be working well and in good order. However, multiplayer is a mess right now and needs to be fixed.

what are you guys smoking? the game is now officially released, no new multiplayer content, 2 years later and its the same game with bug patches. so much potential on a game that's fun for no longer than a week.

[h1]Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord Review[/h1]
“Explore, raid and conquer your way across the vast continent of Calradia, making friends and enemies along the way. Raise your own army and lead it into battle, commanding and fighting alongside your troops in the thick of the action.” 

Basically it’s a game that lets you be whoever you want and do whatever you want within reason of course. Fair warning, Bannerlord is really light on story, this is the type of games where you make your own stories about the adventures and challenges that you face.


[h1] Questions you might have if you're interested in playing it[/h1]

[list]
[*][b]What is it exactly that you do in the game?[/b]
Like I mentioned before, Bannerlord is the type of game that is more focused on the sandbox and simulation side of their gameplay rather than in the RPG. Sure this game offers you a deep character customization with dozens of background stories and classes, each one with a play style associated with them. Along with this there is the classic stats, gear and crafting system expected in modern RPGs. But the whole point of the game is for you to look for your own fun looking for adventures and sometimes misadventures in the huge open world map that it has. 

I personally played as an archer, the charming son of a merchant, and I spent most of my time with the game going around raiding towns and castles in order to get more resources to raid bigger towns and castles. But I had seen people doing pacifist runs of this game or joining factions and climbing their ranks to become the emperor of the whole world. My point stands, this is the type of game where you make your own fun and the sky's the limit on what you can do with the mechanics that the game offers you.

[*][b] Will it make my eyes bleed?[/b]
It looks a bit dated in some places and decent in others. For example, the top down view of the open-world map looks incredibly bland and simple. Maybe it’s just me who compares it to the Total War games, but the terrain textures and the map density feel like something from the early 2010’s. The game starts looking decent when you engage in 3rd person gameplay. The armors, NPCs and buildings don’t look so bad, a bit dated for modern standards but since this is an AA size game I will give it a pass.

Something that I love from this game are the animations that the characters do during combat. You can feel the weight and impact behind all the attacks. It’s something hard to describe with just words but it helps the combat feel great and like I said before, it’s my favorite part of this game.

Historically Mount & Blade games never were “good lookers” and this game is a huge improvement over the previous installment. But I honestly believe that for the $50 that this game asks for, it should have looked way better.

[*][b]Does it have a good story?[/b]
Doesn’t apply. This game virtually has no story.

[*][b]Does it have a good soundtrack?[/b]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_ksqhX_Rdc

It’s all orchestral songs that aren’t that catchy or memorable. The OST is not particularly good or bad, but it gets the job done. 

[*][b]Does it have replay value?[/b]
Tons of it. From the multiple combinations of back stories and stats that you can get, to the random encounters that you can find in the open-world and the multiple weird and niche play styles and builds that this game supports. You easily can get dozens maybe hundreds of hours out of this game.

[*][b]Does it run well?[/b]
No complains on this from me on this front. I maxed out all settings at 1080p and got a smooth 60 FPS all the time. I didn’t find any major bugs or glitches in my 30 hours play through of this game.

[*][b]Is it fun?[/b]
Yes, but only if you are willing to tank through the inherent jankiness that his game has.
[/list]


[h1] So what is Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord?[/h1]
It’s probably the best medieval life simulation that lets you siege castles that exists on steam to date. But it is also a game that looks somewhat dated and has a huge learning curve. The amount of amazing and deep mechanics that Bannerlord offers you is sometimes overwhelming. From the whole banner system that gives buffs to you and your army, to how complex the diplomacy and trading systems are and how it lets you do all kinds of crazy and fun stuff… this game sometimes amazes me. There is simply too much to learn and do. This is a good problem to have in your game, Bannerlord luckily has a tutorial that explains the base mechanics of the game, but it is lacking in some aspects. I had to look for guides to understand enough of some mechanics to not get myself humiliated on starting areas.

Something that I hear a lot when someone mentions the Mount & Blade games is how “fantastic” the combat system is and well… it’s going to depend on what you expect of a modern RPG combat system. I can admit that (like most of the mechanics of this game) it has a somewhat stiff learning curve and it has a lot of complexities that makes it deep and strangely addictive. I also mentioned before how the animations give it an extra feeling of “weight” and “impact”, but I can’t ever shake up the feeling that it never really clicked with me. I think it’s because it’s slower than most modern action RPGs out there but I’m not quite sure.

For me, the moment that I understood why this game is so widely praised despite its shortcomings was when I was besieging a huge castle and I found myself in the middle of my army giving them orders and trying not to die. This is not the type of game where you can fight 5 to 10 enemies at once, in Bannerlord you have to be tactical and smart in order to beat just one enemy and watching the whole carnage around me… it felt real… it felt like I really was there. Bannerlord is probably the most immersive game that I have ever played. It encapsulated perfectly what it is to live in the middle ages with all their ups and downs and never forces you to do anything. This is a niche experience that you can’t find anywhere else.


[h1] Things that I like about this game[/h1]

[list]
[*]Deep combat system.

[*]Fun and complex sandbox mechanics

[*]It’s the best sieging simulator out there.

[*]Great RPG mechanics.

[*]Amazing mod support. Everything on my dislike list can be fixed with mods.
[/list]

[h1] Things that I dislike about this game[/h1]

[list]
[*]It’s janky.

[*]No story at all.

[*]The graphics are a bit outdated.
[/list]


[h1] Is this game worth my hard earned money?[/h1]
Chances are that if you like the Mount & Blade series you already own this game and you have several hundreds of hours of play time in Bannerlord. So… If you like games like the Total War series and you don’t mind janky games that look like the early 2010’s… Buy Bannerlord on sale… It’s a game that offers you an experience like no other game on steam has but… $50 is a hard sale for me. At the time of writing this review, Bannerlord gets regularly updated and the devs constantly add more content.

I wonder, is it a skeleton dev team working on this now or what's going on? Do the devs ever plan on getting this game to where it should have been?

The positive again is the creativity of the community itself. The modders are the back bone of the game now.

I played my hours in Vanilla I will add. Since I've left, the modding community has stepped up to the mark where the devs fell flat it would seem to an outsider anyhow.

So my first impressions of the long long looooong awaited Bannerlord, the sequel too M&B Warband. 

5 hours in now. It's pretty much Warband on steroids. Prettier, more refined but still a lot of whacking of looters from atop a horse.

In 5 hours I had one crash and my pc is blowing pretty hard but to be fair it's more stable than I thought. Definately recommended!


I'm 45 minutes in and still in the tutorial, so these are just my first thoughts. That's mostly because I also practiced with all the weapons and started reading all the possible skills. 

The skilltree is a big step up from Warband. I love that the game is very recogniseable if you're a Mount and Blade player. There is still a picking off your background in character creation, but there are more skills now. Within the skills there are perks you can pick. This can make for very different playstyles. For example I just picked my first perk at level 2 where I could choose between a small xp boost every day for my whole party or a medium xp boost for the tier 1,2,3 troops of my party. Depending on your preferred playstyle, you can pick one. 
If you like to run around with a small elite army who loose little men you pick the first one. If your style is to throw lots of low to mid level men into the meatgrinder and quickly training up the next batch, you pick the second one. 

The UI is also better in my opinion, the inventoryscreen is much better than Warbands and in villages you can directly talk too the villagechief without having to ride around a village to find him. This was a very necessary mod in Warband, so I'm happy to see the devs picked up these sort of things. This is a hopefull sign for the rest of the game.

I haven't seen any of the tactics or the RPG elements of the game yet, nor any of the bugs that are probably still there, thanks to early access, but my first impression is very good.

I have played the Mount and Blade series in the past and I believe this game proves that
the team behind those games are worth all the credit from our gaming community.
The game is a better version of the old Mount and Blade Warband with many new features ( I adore that I can smith my own weapons for personalisation and ingame profit)
The tactical aspect is much improved inside the battles, the new sieges and its mechanics are truly magnificent. We feel some nostalgia though that some mechanics from the previous games aren't included ( we hope that they will do something in the future) like the feasts and the courting system. still it is a great game and the team is worth all praises because they constantly make it better and more realistic. 9/10 from me and I really wait to see what we will get in the future!",1700917090,1700917090,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unlike Warband, the predecessor to Bannerlord, the progress feels linked to a continuous narrative for your clan, with marriages, children and deaths having an effect over the in-game years.
You will be fighting a lot of battles and will gradually risk higher stakes as your fortune, land and influence grows. By the end of my character I had gone from a lone bandit hunter to the lord of about 8 castles throughout Calradia, and was throwing my weight around with a moderate sized army. This means you will go from brawls with looters to skirmishes with lesser lords and eventually to conducting real-time strategy level battles of 1000's of combatants.
Bannerlord is quite good and an improvement on Warband in some key areas, the modding support is there but I hear it is in the early stages as the game is still being patched (making some mods malfunction).
I would recommend Bannerlord to people who enjoy sandbox adventures where you make up the story, to people who enjoy basic economy and management and those who think chain mail armor and horses are neat.

First of all, don't be fooled (you should never be in any game) by the super quality images in the store, except if you have a top computer. The game design is nice, but not worth the price TaleWorld ask. The gameplay is nice but not worth the price either. 

Wait for a good sale. And try it yourself. I'll give a thumbs up, but at same time I'm asking for a refund. It is simply not my game despite my love for medieval-themed games. 

Bannerlord lack better UI and more intuitive mechanics. Total War, for instance, give you better control to armies and battle strategy. The tutorial lacks better explanations and options of weapon's control. And I got a taste of disappointment in the character editor. The design seems rough, not smooth enough in battle movements and character positioning. 

It's not my game, but maybe it is yours. Try it and judge by yourself.

I'm told that in Turkish, ""Kısmetse Olur"" (which means 'God willing it will be') is frequently used the same way as the Hispanic ""mañana;"" but without the sense of urgency. That describes this game. 

I see they have changed their release date yet again, to.... after this review was posted. 
Oct 25, 2022? Was that it? That's a very funny date from people who have been changing their dates and history since their company was founded. The Reality? Announced officially more than 10 years ago now, and teased in the Taleworlds forums with some questionable imagery even before that, Bannerlord had been long awaited. After ""narrowly missing"" several ""windows of opportunity,"" It was awaited even longer. Then it was let out of the box as an EA title with a full ""finished"" price-tag. It was not. Two years of EA later, followed by the ""Full Release"" version, it is still not a complete game. As a whole, the release was average, with numerous parts being horribly broken. What followed was years of hasty patches followed by a slower-paced release of fixes.  In the meanwhile, players noted that the map had almost nothing in relation to the chosen setting, the quests were just as tediously repetitious as its previous incarnations, and major game mechanics were either poorly realized, horribly buggy, or else missing. Nonetheless, they remained hopeful; many are still hopeful, but others are now playing other games.

This may lead you to believe that I don't like the game; but that simply isn't true. The map is NOT Calradia, but it IS attractive. The scenes are detailed and engaging. The depth of potential character growth is breath-taking, and what Warband did so well continues to be done well. 

Unfortunately, those issues which were never resolved in Warband are also unlikely to ever be resolved in Bannerlord. Some of those have already been mentioned, others include misconceptions about the subject matter, or simply lack of education regarding physics or historical realities. New issues have been introduced, notably the shallowness of the marriage mechanic, the ability to buy your wife even from a hostile faction, and the utter lack of the basics for a dynastic simulation even though that is a major aspect of the game. Character appearance selection is also like visiting a wax museum of horrors. True, once you put on a helm, no one really should care, but you'll know. You'll sit there on your horse, staring at the Battanians you are about to slaughter, and thinking about just how unbelievably ugly your character is. Why should it be so? Lack of Turkish reference material, I suppose. Additionally, balance regarding costs, income, trade, smithing, etc., have also never been resolved, and will likely remain that way indefinitely. Mechanics regarding the perpetual conflict of cavalry -vs- spears, 300 meter archery sniping, have never really made anyone happy. The game continues to be plagued by bugs, and by the tiny little updates that either address bugs introduced by earlier updates, or add new bugs of their own. The patching behavior invariably breaks saves, making it a hard game to complete. 

Steam has no ""meh"" button. For Steam, like ants, everything is either ""done,"" or ""not done."" In response, since no is shorter than yes, I choose not to recommend it. Not because the game is bad, mind you, but because it remains unfinished while charging a finished price. That is yet another thing that is unlikely to ever change.",1656948687,1700843799,False,3,0,0.5354880690574646,0,True,False,True

The game doesn't make it difficult to play different roles since they all have the same basic leveling system and if you level up the blacksmith skill you gain access to super op weapons with the exception of bows that you have to find. After putting 600+ hours into this game i'm still learning new ways to command my troops in battle and earn money to keep my clan and kingdom going. 

I only played the multi player section of the game for about 10 hours but it just wasn't my cup of tea. The multi player section seems to be only pvp siege battles which some people enjoy. In my opinion id like to see a secondary game mode in multi like the main game but with most of the AI kingdom leaders replaced with players.

That being said there are some areas of the game that i think could use some work. The AI kingdoms are in a constant state of war 70% of the time and it makes establishing any kind of kingdom difficult at times. I also think that the cap on influence you can spend on kingdom decisions should be removed or that the players influence should hold much more weight based their clan level and relations to other members of the same kingdom. Id also like to see more ways to level up some skills like the trade skill, i dislike that i don't get exp from selling metals and wood that i get from smelting gear just because i didn't buy it from another city or craven.

- There is an incredible group of modders that help make the game varied, replayable and fun or more realistic
- TaleWorlds blatantly ignores  the modders and players and publishes minor irrelevant updates which basically disable most popular mods. WHY ?

After sinking in nearly 75 hours I've ran into a bug over and over and over that can just destroy your kingdoms ability to conduct war, and of course that would be sieges.

Once you (your player character) starts a siege there is a chance another allied lord will join your siege and lend their strength to you. When they do this there is a chance that you will lose control of the ability to launch the attack once their defenses have been worn down. The other lord is recognized as the siege leader now but the game still thinks you're the leader so that AI lord won't launch the attack. Your only option is to leave the siege camp and hope that RNGesus blesses you and that lord actually launches the attack instead of just standing there doing nothing tying up anywhere  from 500 to over 1,000 troops just looking at a castles broken walls.

Additionally, you had the freedom to assemble a powerful guard unit composed of elite troops to accompany you in combat.

However, as time went on and updates rolled in, the game took a disappointing turn. Instead of enhancing the experience with valuable features, the updates seemed to focus on removing them. With each successive update, it felt like the game was being stripped of its core elements.

I started playing Bannerlord in 2023 and my experience has been frustrating. 

The game in it of itself is fine. I really like the improvements in animations and graphics and everything that includes the overall look of the game. I usually skip the single player part of the game. Since Warband I had only been active on the multiplayer side. Usually playing every night during my college years and some after. Good times. Due to my location I used to play on NA servers. Though not as big as european ones, it was decently big enough to enjoy a good siege game. My ping would not go above 100 but not below 50. It was fine. It worked well. 

As I mentioned before I bought Bannerlord in 2023. Years later after the initial release expecting the game to be full of players and servers about to burst. To my surprise I rarely see any server above medium capacity. Only on certain dates or occasions. Usually needing a password to access. Playing siege has always been my preferred option and I quickly found a server to play.

Unfortunately, for me, the ONLY siege servers are european and let me tell you that playing this game in multiplayer with a ping of 165-180 has made me want to tear every single strand of hair from my head. I find myself in a constant state of frustration and anger every time I play this game. I feel my character moving in slow motion. I swing my sword back and before the character swings forward I can see the enemy player do that same motion, with a huge double handed sword or axe and kill me. Everyone but me seems to move faster. I cant attack. I cant defend myself. I cant enjoy the game. 

I know. I play on european servers while living in the only third world country in North America. Thats why I used to play on NA servers back in the day but in Bannerlord there are no decent NA servers. I am amazed by the lack of interest in this game considering how long warband lasted. 

There is a lack of maps. 5 or 6 if I recall correctly and every single dammed game people always choosing Vlandia to play. EVERY SINGLE GAME. 
I find myself amazed how an archer runs slower than a fully armored Vlandian sargeant. Amazing. 
I dislike the fact that we have predesposed classes. No longer we can choose what weapon or armor to pick and have lots of combinations. We have classes now that have to be unlocked as a whole by killing and earning coin. 

Ill stop now. I cant recommend the game to anyone that is not in Europe and wants to play multiplayer. I just cant. 
The game if fine. Sure. Why not. 
Not for me I guess.

What do you think is NOT possible to do in Mount and Blade 2 Bannerlord?

Option A

 Become a wealthy man by selling slaves. Afterward, marry the daughter of the most powerful ruler in Calradia. Strip her down to her underwear, impregnate her, mount her on a donkey, give her a stick as a weapon, and command her to lead an army into the battle against her father.

Divorce your partner.

Taleworlds are the biggest cowards in game development they wont allow you to execute lords with animations even showing and if you do this everyone in the game hates you even your own fiefs which wont allow you inside, and to top it all off entire factions cant be eliminated without doing this, kinda ridulous game design if you ask me.

I still think taleworld should concentrate on the end game as its a sandbox game, AI and diplomacy are lacking so are the perks, i think alot of stuff should be tone down as once the character is max out with perks and weapons/equipment the game spiral into boring game as the player can pick and choose battles as the pathetic AI does its dumb stuff....

this is a niche game as there isnt any like this so I am changing to a recommendation due to taleworld's continual effort to make this a better game esp beta 1.2xxx which changes alot of stuff which can only better the player's gaming experiences...

It's an engaging scenario for its variety of combatants, mercenary bands, and warring societies, each with a unique historically-based way of fighting. In contrast, Bannerlord's main story is very thin, but revolves around finding the remnants of an ancient and symbolic banner – then deciding whether to use it to finish off the empire or take the banner to reunite its fragmented territories.

It qualifies as a sandbox because how you rise to power is largely up to you, whether on a trade fortune, becoming a famous mercenary, or working from inside one of the eight kingdoms. From there it's all about conquest in the name of your chosen nation – or throw that out the window and start a faction of your own. That said, the actual kingdom-management strategy is weak due to shallow mechanics and lackluster AI – it's really just an excuse to raise big armies and smash them together. You do that via maneuvering in an overworld strategic layer before dropping into hybrid action real-time strategy battles where you directly control only yourself, but can issue commands to your AI-driven troops.

It’s a shame that the game lets you auto-resolve its glorious action/real-time strategy combat but forces you to endure dozens of hours of laborious and repetitive activities on its dry, flavorless overworld map. If I could skip over the bugs, shallow grinds, and frustrating non-combat activities around building up your faction and quickly return to battle it'd be easier to recommend. But, when it comes to simulating a medieval warfare at the ground level between hundreds of soldiers down to every swing of a sword and clash of shields, this is the only game in town.",1700592006,1700592006,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Unfinished and unpolished. They seem to be waiting for mods to fix many things. It lacks a lot of expected depth and feels extremely repetitive.

The updates in terms of developing the game have really slowed down. Banners were a cool addition though.

Siege AI is awful. Your troops wont even shoot from firing positions, will double up, will teamkill clumps of defending infantry/friendly walls, miss stone throws at siege equipment/enemy troop clusters, and get stuck.

Army behavior is awful, bailing on a front to drag 2k troops to the other side of the map. They can hardly defend newly taken lands in many areas of the map.

The questlines are unfinished/nonexistent. The conspiracy quests feel more like a chore to avoid the scripted dogpile war ai kingdoms are unequipped to handle.

There is a clear meta in terms of army comp and what skills to specialize in. Your character choice and skill points too. A lot of promised features are still lacking like banditry. Certain kingdoms tend to steamroll every game.

The game hits a ceiling way too early at clan tier 6. Policies and kingdom decisions are wack. Peace deals for a minor faction you crush when 3 people declare war on your kingdom constantly starting at 5k paid to them when you are winning just makes no sense.

I don't like how the UI relies on you clicking a ton of stuff en masse for Blacksmith content.
I don't care for the clan system. I don't like how Renown was changed to be an XP bar to accommodate for that.
How perks changed from allocating numbers on level up to a perk tree is disappointing. Minuscule percentages? Disgusting, get that out of my sight.

Trading not being based on how you barter with your loot is also dumb as hell. Rogue or whatever is pointless outside of roleplaying. 
The party cap skill being Quartermaster instead of tactics or leadership is also awful. Leadership basically being the auto-resolve perk tree is misleading. Call that Strategist instead, it's much more accurate and less confusing to anyone who played the older games in the series.

(THREE YEARS LATER)
When this first released i thought it was nt half bad, but this was during early access. I thought they'd add more to help make this feel Fleshed out, and maybe nostalgias hitting me hard or maybe i was pampered by warbands mod availibility. But as of Three years later i cant say i'd recomend this game. For as long as we waited the game feels like every other. Its Emptier, things are simpler and duller. For the higher graphics Calradia feels Emptier. Sargoth is still in the wrong place three years later, The communication with NPC's is really basic now as theres less dialogue with the NPCS. There is no sailing which we got with Viking Conquest, there is no creating your own Refuge like Viking Conquest.  The original DnD style charm the character sheet had was tossed out.  Im aware unique companions are impossible due to the nature of ageing and the like but it does genuinelly feel like that took away from Calradia; for as annoying as it was to have your companions interupt you going near Veluca it had its charm. The game was Rushed and it shows, Calradia feels emptier despite having a bigger map with more details. Ultimately this game feels like a water downed warband. They had many years to learn and test out designs, and feels like they took very little. Fire and sword included guns and pikes; whilst they added pike wall i so rarely see them used by the AI even in my own forces its barely worth a mention. Viking Conquest added Ships and interesting event placed to explore and feel like your wandering old Roman Forts; none of those are in the game.

-edit
The new update is great. Trading at the start is pretty impossible unless you get lucky. Everything will be expensive and over time the prices will drop so don't buy things early on. Otherwise, trading is very easy. The reinforcements aren't perfect in battles. Sometimes the spawn is still right where the enemy puts their units which is fine since it is new. Otherwise, the reinforcements are great. Siege battles you can still camp the spawn. The cut scenes are great for marriage and all that. I like that other nobles from destroyed factions will join new factions.

Sadly, I will have to downvote the game until it works again. I do not know the issue. I can launch the launcher but then nothing happens when I try doing single player or multiplayer. Also, I cannot stop the launcher through task manager, steam, logging out of steam. I have to restart my computer to stop the launcher.

-The game had the RPG/diplomacy system gutted shortly after early access started by making all character relations clan-based. So all of the 'actors' they are proud of are hollow beyond what Warband had. Even clan relations barely matter unless you are making your own kingdom or trying to marry someone within them. Forget making individual friends who would join you for battles or vote your way on councils. Its all empty.

-Their basic answer to the snowballing problem of previous games was to simply make war on the player's kingdom constantly and do away with peacetime activities, rather than expand them to make a good ebb and flow to the game. You will simply get bored with the constant fighting long before you ever see your kids come of age.

-Controlling your troops is akin to a babysitter simulator, unless you use 'meta' setups that exploit the AI aggression versus certain formations. The addition of 'elite troops' is poorly implemented and should have had real limitations put on it, both for player and AI.

-On-map sieges make no sense with the way siege engines work, so there is no point to waiting to build trebuchets and catapults. The castle assaults are just two armies going at it, but one has a wall to stand on. It still doesn't play well.

-The influence system doesn't give @*$& for influence within kingdom politics regardless of how big/strong your clan gets and there are low, hard limits on how much influence you can spend in decisions. You also have no real ability to sway other clans to vote your way, so kingdom decisions are trivial. You can keep your army going almost indefinitely later in the game with decent influence generation, and you'll need to since the fighting is non-stop.

-They pissed off their modding community so the game won't get half the love the previous game did.

-I can't speak for the pvp of the game. Its maybe worth getting on sale if its below $15 if you want to swing at AI for a bit rather than real people, so long as you don't have better games on your list to buy.",1700324272,1700324272,False,32,0,0.635799527168273926,4,True,False,False

this playthrough i started out as a mercenary and graduated to a vassal, and at no point really felt lulls or boredom pursuing various objectives. if i had to gripe about anything right now it would be [spoiler] the conspiracy questline after assembling the dragon banner [/spoiler] because of how short notice + time you get (20 days from what i can tell for each of the various quest types), and how far apart the locations are it sends you to (vladian vassal being sent to the OPPOSITE side of the empire quite often). impossible to fight a war and manage the conspiracy at the same time when its sending you across the empire you're at war with as you march around with 500+ troops. just something to keep in mind if you're usurping the empire. i'm going to start a new game today and try the empire route this time because legionaries are cool

as is, this game is top tier now. at first, wasn't perfect, but scratched the mount and blade itch with a nice facelift. now it does that in addition to providing a stellar medieval warfare experience, both from tactical and third person/first person combat perspectives. and, if you're hell bent on leveling every skill, there's a mod for that. mods allow you to optimize pretty much every aspect of the game. for a super fun experience try dismemberment and cut through everyone mods, but they may be outdated and require a rollback from the current version of the game

here are some tips if anyone needs them:
blacksmithing is a crazy good moneymaker at higher levels
companions are the easiest way to optimize party roles (assigned in the clan menu) - find one for every role and your party will become a force to be reckoned with
parties from your own clan cost 0 influence to bring into an army, and cost 0 influence to increase cohesion - easiest way to get big armies early on
joining kingdoms and earning influence is the easiest way to get fiefs (castles and towns), but when obtained this way tend to lack loyalty due to being taken from opposing cultures - slightly mitigated by a governor of the same culture
it's pretty much impossible to be a one man army without cheats or mods, but a decent tactician can easily win outnumbered fights and earn consistent and substantial renown and influence
try not to focus on more than two attributes per character

It is hard to define what genre(s) Bannerlord falls into, being part RPG, part grand strategy, part 3rd person action adventure. I would call it 'simulator' in the sense that it's a true sandbox, set up with systems designed to allow you to lean into pretty much whatever your imagination can conjure for role-playing in a medieval world.

You could form an army and beseige castles with battering rams and cavalry and archers. You could join and then double-cross a powerful lord to usurp their throne. You could establish trade caravans, dividing your army into warbands who escort camel trains across the world to make big money. You could ride from city to city, entering the gladiatorial arena tournaments and betting high on your own successes. Or you could just chill on the cobbled alleyways of a beautiful fortified city as the sun sets.

Bannerlord's take on melee combat is really well designed, easy to learn and master but super satisfying, with four directions from which to attack and block. It has a really nice 'rock, paper, scissors' type of gamefeel and feedback from the weapons is solid.

The problems begin to appear when you reach the ceiling of each type of gameplay style, where you realise relatively quickly that you can do everything in the world and then have nothing left. I think the devs should think about expanding and deepening the late-game options, and making things like dialogue trees and consequences go a bit further. 

Overall this is a middle ages sandbox which is simultaneously deep and casual to play, with the accessibility and draw of Pirates! but with super fun combat and an amazing atmosphere and soundtrack.

In my opinion this is probably the best 'double-A' game in years and certainly the only game series that really satisfies the itch for that kind of fast, smooth world simulation of games like SMP.",1700223325,1700223325,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Companions have 3 text boxes and a line of voiced dialogue each, at least you can smack them around in the arena though.

Extremely bare bones feeling in all aspects, combat is stiff and basic. The RTS elements are very limited due to your boots on the ground POV. Trading and caravanning might be more interesting but I don't play a game called ""Bannerlord"" to make a caravan lol 

Also the RTS AI is worse than Total War. Units just clump up into disorganised mobs and swing mindlessly at each other. Spear men get right into the press along side axes and swords so it just turns into a huge mess. No attempt to hold a line or formation, you can't even make formations anyway besides shield walls. 
Even though the intro shows you guys making a phalanx you can't do that at all.

But it's the only game in town.

This alone shows that theres something that makes the game worth playing.

It's got an amazing idea to build your clan and conquer the world. Start a family that will help you throughout your time. Absolutely love the first 10 hours of any playthrough (ive played the game probably about 10 times through to kingdom stage). 

There are obviously some problems, some can be fixed by mods though like Better Time (makes time go faster meaning you'll be more likely to see your children grow and become useful) The problem is theres such an amazing feature to the game which is your family and what happens after your main character dies, but its hidden because the time is so slow and you need to sink about 40 hours into a playthrough before any of that starts.

There are other problems like the gameplay loops overtime get boring like hideouts and permawar. But you can always fix them with mods. 

Overall, the game is amazing and fighting different kingdoms is like playing against a different stratergy, and your own stratergy can vary somewhat with different playthroughs, my last playthrough was with an Aserai Horseman attack, but you can also play the khuzaits like the mongolians or battanians which use bows and longswords.

I wanted it to be good but in the 10 hours that i played, most of it was spent either grinding renown in tournaments or being captured.
Whenever I try to do quests, I just get captured by much larger armies that hold me for days and when I finally escape; Oh Yeah, I am in the middle of enemy territory so i can't fucking leave without getting captured again and the process repeats

(New Positive review)
88 hours later: I have changed my opinion, the game is very fun.

The short version is this is a hard yes if you really enjoyed the first game/still enjoy the first game, a hard maybe for anyone else

Its mount and blade but newer and with more quality of life features and more depth over all, If you like the first games and know they were imperfect experiences with alot of problems on release (and even years after) then this will feel like a good and fun version of that with the hope it will get less buggy and more complete as time goes on (and it does seem like the devs are working hard and listening to players in terms of feedback).

I was able to make a new version of my first mount and blade character, Bruce Hamfist, a man who just stomps around the battlefield with nothing but a big axe and some sturdy armor... but he feels better now, the playstyle of being the big stompy man is actually supported by the game, and so are a number of silly fun builds that were very hard to do in the older games.

Its not perfect and its far from finished but I am currently holding faith that the game will be worked on and finished and it seems like that gamble is paying off. Overall it feels like a better version of the original mount and blade in its current form and it seem to only look like it will get better and better

Edit some time later into the full release: Honestly this game met my expectations and even exceeded them in a few ways, i went in fully understanding the type of game i was getting and from which dev I was getting it from and honestly I'm very happy with the current product. Compared to non-modded mount and blade its only improvements, they did a really good job and i'm glad they made this game as there is nothing else like it.",1625505603,1699818312,True,2,0,0.524525284767150879,0,True,False,True

Multiplayer (official) servers are mostly dead. Development is almost exclusively changes to multiplayer features for the 15 people still playing it. Lovely little insignificant changes to single player that break most mods on a consistent enough basis to make modding it as miserable as possible. I mean, why develop your own game when you can pass it off to the community to deal with? 

With all that said, the game is really good... for the first 15 or so hours. After that, you'll begin to see all the shallow game play elements that were half baked and left for the community to finish. Depending on how generous you want to be, it's a 6 or 5/10. Painfully average. A glorified battle simulator with lackluster RPG mechanics that you will ignore. However, with mods, you can tailor it into one of the best games around... until the next minor patch. I'd recommend turning off auto-updates to save yourself a headache.

Who will you work for as a mercenary? Will you choose an expanding kingdom like Vlandia and trample your enemies down under the hooves of your mighty cavalry? Maybe you will pick Battania and lead your elite archers into the woods and shoot clouds of arrows onto that silly Vlandian cavalry? 
To whom will you pledge loyalty? Will you spend your time fighting a three front war with Rhaegea of the Southern Empire or will you build your tradeskill by joining the Aserai in the southern part of the map and focus on caravans and workshops.

Relationships and chances to succeed in war never stop enemy faction of declaring one more war on another front... Logic of kingdoms is broken without any chances to be rapaired (it's been few years devs just keep adding useless small features without making changes to core mechanics that are broken). Main quest is nothing but a scum, because it causes instant all-in war or instant queue of hostile quests of 3 types you have to repeat over and over to keep doom timer down for a bit.

They said you'd be able to make your villages into castles, they said the terrain on the map would make a difference.

Battle AI consists of running around in circles, which forces me to ""Send Troops"" for every single battle, so as to avoid waiting 10 minutes for the AI to fix itself and charge.Warband may not have had the most advanced AI, but at least it worked.

Well  Here we are 7 monthes later, and those turkish baboons still can't get soldiers to climb ladders or use siege towers. The siege AI sucks, the there are army wiping siege bugs still present in the game, but its ""done"" guys dont worry.",1585643353,1699216541,False,2,0,0.498706281185150146,0,True,False,True

They don't even have one person developing multiplayer. So much wasted potential locked behind us 50ish active sweaty players that still play multiplayer on the SINGLE server that is up for your region depending on time of day. 

Out of region server optimisation is so poor playing on a East Coast server is unplayable from West Coast. Anything over 100 Ping is unplayable

No spoilers, but some QOL improvements I've really enjoyed - Ransoming prisoners from the town menu, without entering the tavern.

It's a good game and a good sequel to the previous Mount & Blade games.

Some things have improved but not a lot that is particularly revolutionary. It's just a sequel with better graphics, some improved systems and some minor quality of life things.

It does annoy me that they don't have co-op, certainly due to their reasons for not having it. First it was that they ""didn't know"" people wanted it, then it was engine limitations, then it was that co-op would ruin what the game was meant to be... it's a huge missed opportunity for something that the whole community wants to see.

Review Update 22/7/21: They still have not patched the problems causing the game to Crash. At this point i wish i could get a refund because the game is literally UNPLAYABLE now. The Series used to be so amazing it is a total shame to see it go so far down hill since the last game

The only moments when realistic mode is hard is in the very first hours when you have 0 armor and any random arrow to the neck drops you, after that its fine.
After getting to know the mechanics, lay of the land and unit types i restarted the game, realistic setting again but now on ironman to prevent myself from savescumming.
After the first handfull of looters and village quests i became a mercenary stacked up cash to about a million denars, levelled to around 20. After that joined several factions as a vassal just to screw around, make people mad etc. Eventually joined battannia, captured two castles of my culture, received then as fiefs, raided settlements from all neighboring kingdoms so Battania has 4 concurrent wars, left kingdom, smacked 4 lords, peaced out easily because they had 4 wars already. By that time I devised a superior tactic to consistently lose 0-2 units in any engagement, i.e. my 400 troops vs their 700 troops. no losses,
At the point of writing after paying for ~55 hours I had a kingdom with 2 towns and 5 castles. Due to the fact that AI is dumb I knew that from then on I pretty much won the game and did not feel to actually go through the effort of sieging settlements. Especially did not look forward to war with khuzait and the sand people.

In summary
- AI is dumb
- after the power trip tediousness sets in.

Pros:
- Game looks amazing in terms of visuals
- Can get married like before, but this time can raise your own children
- Cities & Castles have more of a impact to strategic value (building sim)
- Quests are generally diverse and you can opt out of the ones you don't want to do, or can send your companions instead.

Cons:
- Diplomacy is bland in terms of conducting trade, alliances, and war (let me expand on this). Once you become ""king"" of either your own or a previous kingdom, you are able to make decisions. The issue resides on the options given. For example, when taking a fief you are presented with 3 random options where you must choose one of those three people. You can't just give it to whoever you want. Also in the case of war, you can't just make peace with the other rulers and are instead greeted with ""you must talk to the council"" which you can't so you have to beat them up.
- If you defeat an enemy army, within a couple days they will reform their entire force and attack you again while you are weak
- Killing enemy lords is allowed at the cost of everyone, including your faction, hating you
- Making money in the early game is a bit rough and the game doesn't really explain how

All ladders are still hit and miss.... and I just found out if they destroy your siege towers there's no backup ladders? Wth is up with that? Plus the AI still being stupid to the point of destroying immersion. AI should not be sacrificing their archers to enemy infantry SO OFTEN. Occasionally, with like low stats, low level leaders, sure. But Dhertert's army should more or less take reasonable actions. But they really don't.

And there's still so many BIG issues that seem like they shouldn't be that hard to fix. Soldiers getting stuck on the battering ram when trying to enter an enemy keep.... and on some maps that just lets archers on either side destroy them unopposed. Like all they have to do is make the damn ram permeable after the gate is down (which I think it actually does sometimes?).... stuff like that really makes it hard to believe they're doing even the minimal necessary to give us the game we paid for.

- Massive battles
- Plenty of different maps to battle in as well as castles to siege
- Combat required some skill 
- Really makes you FEEL like Alexander the Great

Cons:
- NPCs are retarded; you will do a billion favors for a certain faction and for no reason they will declare war on you.
- GRIND; you will be required to go back and forth selling shit to even come close to getting enough money to raise a legit army. Idk about you but I don't want to spend hours selling shit, I just want to fight. Of course you can do sandbox battles but I like the campaign cause there is actual weight to your fights.
- Diplomacy needs to be a bigger part of the experience. NPCs feel all the same and you really never get many favors from allies.

TL;DR 
Battles are awesome but all other aspects of the game feel unfinished. Npcs don't feel like they have any agency at all.

(As of 2023)  I can't recommend this anymore.  Yeah, at its core its still a GREAT game and the combat mechanics are a blast to play with.  But this last time I played I tried my best to go all in and push one of the factions to supremacy and ""Rebuild the Empire"".  This process is nothing but unsatisfying headaches.  Once you reach a certain size, either every other faction piles on to you, or your own faction sabotages you in declaring random wars when we are DEEP in fighting two to three others.  I managed to capture the last towns and castles of a faction, expecting that war to at least be done and taken care of.  Nope.  Never ending raiding and terror of trying to chase down every single little warband and party trying to end the pain.

Besides the base games which are bad ass all by themselves, you always have all the mods also which can add even more and also turn the game into your favorite book/TV series/movies. Plus it still gets regular updates that aren't all that large usually. Another great game just like Mount & Blade and Warband before it.

I had to edit this to add about how the devs are listening, and have already been pushing updates to better the gameplay.


1.0 Update

Great game, late game is liek everyone says but still worth. Everyone asking for coop in a game where pausing and passing time is an important mechanic is a bunch of sillyheads.",1585858644,1698091912,True,3,0,0.560439586639404297,0,True,False,True

Mount and Blade II Bannerlord is a good example of a game developed by an indie developer living in the past, on the shoulder of the dead. Mount and Blade and the expansions were revolutionary concepts 10 years ago, introducing a new fight dynamic (you hit according to the mouse movements) and the ability to ride horses. But that was more than 10 years ago and Bannerlord didn’t move with the times. Unfortunately, what was acceptable back than in the name of a new fighting system is not acceptable in 2022.

Single player experience is acceptable but still far away from the hype the game generates. You got a Warband with much better graphics but to a certain extent less or worse futures. The fighting scenes look good, but this is because the computer is programmed to fight realistic. Unfortunately, it is very easy to abuse the bad designed mechanics and to cheese the AI fights (by constantly moving left or right and spanning attacks, for example). The 2.000 units battles are interesting (after all, more is better) until one realises that after destroying the first wave of enemies the rest spam out of nowhere, on top of your troops trying to mop the enemy archers. I am usually losing more troops in the final stages of the battles than at the begging, when the armies are at equal size. The diplomacy system is simple but strange as many times the AI manifests suicidal tendencies and declares war to a two times larger kingdom. And the war is constant because, despite the interesting economy, it is much easier to make money during war then during peace. You have the possibility to have children which in theory will inherit you after you die (nevertheless it lasts an eternity until they became adults). Yet you need to visit your wife or husband in order to make them and, if you are a part of a kingdom, this is impossible due to the constant wars. The same goes for managing your estates. And it gets more and more grindy as your kingdom grows, because everybody attacks you and the AI forms an army far away from the conflict zone, travels there for 10 days, reconquers one of the two or three lost towns and castles and disbands because it doesn’t have enough influence to maintain the army. 

If single player experience is acceptable, multiplayer is horrible. I played team death match and sieges and there the name of the game changes from Bannerlord to Abuselord because in order to be a good player one must abuse questionable game mechanics. Spinning around constantly with a weapon in hand – checked. Turning and running away as the enemy tries to hit you and then running back and hitting him – checked. Fighting better without a shield (even with a one-handed weapons) because one gets a substantial speed bonus – checked. Being a peasant with low armour and a gardening tool and hitting and moving faster than a trained knight in armour (because, of course, the average medieval peasant didn’t need any sleep and trained a lot after he/she worked the land) – checked. An overpowered faction that dominates all the other (Vlandia is chosen during 80% of the games and wins 80% of them) – checked. To this one may add a questionable spawning system – in death match in the middle of the enemy team, in sieges somewhere around, sometimes inside of buildings having no idea how to get out reach the fighting area and the constant crashes and lag. It is therefore no wonder that on the European server there are at most 250 players playing the game and I started to know some of them by name because I see them so often.

I know that the game is still in early access, but I doubt that after eight years of development and two years of early access the game will be in an acceptable form in the near future. I hope that I am wrong because the game seems to me a sound concept, although very poorly implemented, and I really liked Warband. Nevertheless, at this stage I advise you to wait and buy the game at sale, with at least 50% off. 

Several months later. This game is a scam. Steam should have a refund policy when it comes to early access games.

Updated after launch:

Single player is better, but still shallow as hell. Multiplayer doesn't work, even after the official release. It keeps crushing. Dont't buy.

Update one year after launch:

The game is a total failure. Single player is buggy and shallow like hell. Multiplayer it's full of bugs, laggy at beast an dead. Once in two weeks there are stealth updates that make the game even worse. Avoid it despite the good reviews. It might be a good modding platform, but modding is a mixed bag at best.",1645307145,1698087852,False,2,1,0.491540282964706421,1,True,False,False

Absolutely amazing, being thrown into a huge world, loads of different options to get into. You don't need to go near the story or start making a kingdom. I spent so many early hours in towns doing tournaments, earning money through that or mercenary work, selling stuff from raiders, blacksmiths or making a trade empire through making caravans and buying workshops. 
All in all, early game allows you to easily get lost in the vast world that they created.

Mid Game:
This is where the game peaks for me. Mid game for me was the height of the wars between the different factions in the game. The sieges in the game are phenomenal. That's all there is to it. I've not seen any siege/defence like this game. Peak gaming

Late Game:
This to be honest is where it slowed down for me. Ive waged war long enough to where all the other factions are broken messes, no foothold on the map, just the different clans running around being terrors. You have to lower your party size to where you're quick enough to run them down (because god knows they can run) and yet powerful enough to take them. It turns into hours of finding where they are (which doesn't always work) to catch them, or finding out who's already caught them to buy them off of them to be able to execute them. This is all because the only way to get rid of a faction is to completely kill everyone from it off.

Bad Stuff:
- Late game is so long and mind numbing it nearly killed the game off for me 
- AI is dumb asf. I would have multiple armies out, when one would be attacking a castle, every other army would cross the map to join in, no matter how far away they are or how close they are to an enemy castle they could easily take anyway (it meant that i had to be the one to lead the attack where i wanted it to be, i couldnt leave my vassals to take over by themselves.) 
- As the king, in some cases, i felt as though i had less power over my kingdom than when i was just a vassal to it. If my vassals wanted something, most of the time i had no way to over turn it or stop it (like when they wanted to declare war or even accept a treaty form a faction even though they were nearly all gone)

The game concept is similar to its predecessors in the series, but it comes with improved graphics, which means it demands more powerful hardware. If you're using a less powerful device, I recommend sticking with the previous version or playing it on super low settings.

It seems that the major difference is in the graphics, while the rest of the game, including the marriage system, combat system, map system, recruiting, soldier management, character leveling system, and all those Mount & Blade elements, remains largely the same but with improvements.

No enemy AI tactics, no diplomacy, nonsense cultural and kingdom management systems, goofy as hell approval system, etc. etc. the list goes on. 

So with all these problems of course the modding community steps in and makes a ton of improvements. The mods are great but again, every few months the devs release a new version that breaks every mod, so at this point many modders have just stopped updating their mods. 

TL;DR Taleworlds has aggressively shit the bed with this game and its patch release schedule. Stop breaking the game every few months with your patches that add nothing to the game.

This game is not what I would call an introduction into Mount & Blade. This game is not Warband.

All that being said, all the criticism on this game is really bleak for what you get. Insane single player hour potential; I must have thousands of hours in this game despite my playtime. This game will challenge you and your creativity. This is not a game you need a guide for aside from some pesky bugs. You just experiment and find out and have fun. What kind of army would you build to conquer the ages of antiquity? This game will give that to you and allow you to do so in an engaging, relaxing, intense, teeth gritting game play scenario. Some situations are resolved in minutes by calm, stable planning. Sometimes, you think you're getting into the same situation again and then get humbled. This is not Warband. You will be assaulted by Lords you have never heard of 100 hours into the campaign and get destroyed. It happens.

All that being said, this is an excellent successor to Warband.

First and the LARGEST of my issues is trying to get the game to launch for me is an absolute NIGHTMARE! you would think clicking on play would make a game run....nope not for me with bannerlord. i have no issues whatsoever with any other games except this one. click play, and the game says playing, 2 seconds later it just turns off... i had it work once after a complete reinstall of windows.but now its just not working once more... i just want to play the game.... i dont want to go througth 24 hours of troubleshooting im done with that, ive had enough! if you cant make a game playable in the simplest aspects on a clean install then i will play something else for the next few years....

the other thing that drove me bonkers were the mods availablility, the mods i wanted to play were both on nexus and steam, trying to figure out how that all worked together in what order was a nuissance nevermind the 10000 milllion updates they put out for bannerlord, none of which fixed the actual playing issue.

the third was diplomacy in the game, everything else was cool, great graphics, options, free to do whatever you want. but when you get involved in a kingdom or your own kingdom it was nonstop wars from various people and it became so tiresome i had to find a mod to make ceasefires so i could actually do other stuff in the game.

i would give the game a 10/10 but i just cant leave the huge frustrations this game is putting me through to get it to play.... ive been gaming for decades, done my fare share of troubleshooting, pc reinstalls, file rearranging and changes. im somewhat familiar with figuring out problems but this game just takes it out of me. ive tried everything so be warned that while the game itself if fantastic you need to be aware things can go wrong in this game for no reason whatsoever, random crashes are part of the game for now",1697300735,1697300735,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I have the red eyed npcs since beta 1.7.2 and it's still not fully fixed, the crafted weapons sizing part system is not functional (blade gets separated visually from the pommel if you lengthen it, a bug that appeared around 1.8, still not fixed but hey ! lets go full release ! ); There is no diplomacy or I should say the little there is is meaningless, doesn't have any real impact on your playthrough. Bridles will sometimes bug out of the player hands. Banners and Flags frozen in place. 

And the AI is worst than ever in sieges, it had me stop my new game on this 1.0, attacking a castle all my men decided to just stand in front of the castle, not moving, receiving arrows for 10 minutes before deciding they should leave... I had an army of 1650+ men and the castle had a garrison of 300, guess what ? I lost. Endgame for now and a bad review, sorry TaleWorlds but this is bad. 

One year later update : Same thing, red eyes, bugged bridle etc... still not patched, AI is ok, core game is great but it's still broken, even worse now the economy is broken also, workshop don't work and prices make no sense, it's been months and still nothing done about it.

This game is like dating a redhead. Yeah its a freak in the sheets, its a lot of fun at first, until it ruins your life.
 They constantly ""patch"" the game, it doesn't add anything to the game except maybe some UI changes from time to time, or optimization, but then every update breaks something else about the game, and makes every single mod useless. YOU NEED MODS to make this game playable, you need mods that boost EXP, you need mods that boost arena, you need mods that change damage numbers etc. For crying out loud they don't even have a FACTION DESTRUCTION SYSTEM IN A GAME ABOUT CONQUERING A LANDMASS. You can execute every lord you defeat and they spawn some non affiliated npc to take their place, there is NO END to enemy lords, there is NO END to factions, there is NO END to THE GAME!! Unless you get specific mods! That Break every time they update the game!! THEY CONSTANTLY RELEASE PATCHES THAT DO NOTHING BUT MAKE ALL THE CURRENT MODS USELESS. Not to mention this modding community is THE MOST TOXIC OVERALL. Numerous times modders are stealing eachothers code, bickering, dont try to make them compatable with other, not putting download directions or INCORRECT DOWNLOAD DIRECTIONS. My personal favorite was the dude that makes one of the more popular overhauls for the longest time it was incompatible WITH THE MOST NECESSARY AND POPULAR SCRIPT MOD. He's since changed his tune but GOOD LUCK finding any other mod that is compatible. There are a few good modders that really make great mods, with great directions, and communication, and EVEN THEY CANT KEEP UP WITH THIS MORONIC DEVELOPER HALF THE TIME!!
This Game is AN INSULT!!

Is it fun to battle? Yes Its' everything I've ever wanted! Is any other aspect fun about it? NO!! Managing towns and castles, makes ZERO sense, you might as well just let a governor automate it, oh WAIT THEY REMOVED THAT. Okay can you do any of the cool gatherings that warband had? NO!! There is nothing unique about the factions except armor appearance and troop choices!! The laws and things mean nothing. Factions ARE SOOOOOO STUPID. They will declare war on you with 1000 power and one castle when youve conguered half the map just a week ago in game. Lately YOU WILL NOT GET FIEFS. I have no idea when this became an issue it just happened in my last playthrough, I CONGUERED LIKE 20+ FIEFS AND I WASNT EVEN ON THE VOTE LIST HAVING THE MOST INFLUENCE AND NOTORIETY. IT USED TO BE IT WAS ANNOYING HOW MANY FIEFS I WAS GIVEN NOW ITS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE! And god forbid youre actually trying to complete the game! AT SOME POINT MULTIPLE NATIONS WILL DECLARE WAR ON YOU AND CRASH YOUR GAME WHETHER YOU GOT MODS LOADED OR NOT!!

You can't assign specific types of troops to a formation, rather, you have to put a very weak filter, and then divide them between formations using a ratio slider (hope you remember exactly what number of troops ya had), and hope that the troops you wanted in your shield-wall actually all have shields, and didn't instead get swapped out for a unit that doesn't even have a shield. You can't even separate crossbow men from regular archers, with this system. I keep losing troops, and sometimes battles, because the game has lost features that were critical to the gameplay of previous titles.

It gets worse in sieges, where, regardless of what you selected at the start of battle, the game will create new formations, and mush together your other ones. Took my formation of archers, split it into 4, and threw some of them into a group of melee units. That's just when I'm the only party on my side, during a siege. When you have friends, joining you, or are aiding another party, the units they bring just get melded in, even worse. If you happen to be working with an army, and you're not commanding it, I hope you didn't have any expensive units with you, because you probably just lost control of them, for that battle.

Mid battle formation position control is also finicky. Gone is the ability to tell your units to just advance a few paces, you have to manually tell them where to go, or just send them to advance towards, ""the enemy"". Great if the enemy doesn't have cavalry, an eminent disaster if they do, because your two formations making up a wide shield wall are now melded together and facing the wrong way because a lone dude on a horse got behind them. There is a mod that allows you to activate a free camera, that makes life a lot easier. No idea why this isn't included in the base game.

I really, REALLY wanted to love this game, but the way they destroyed a system that worked in the previous games, that now causes just frustration in what should be the most enjoyable part of the game, just saps the fun out of it. I just wanted to be able to have my units, who don't have shields, be able to go around the back of the enemy when my shield units engage, or have my more survivable crossbow units infront or on the flanks of my regular archers, stuff you were able to do in the previous games.

Enjoying various of unit types, different army compositions, using different weapon loadouts, trying out different strategies. 

However, the problem lies with when there is no war going on, the game is stale, boring and soulless. No choice you make seems to matter to other Lords/NPCs. No dialogues that are really relevant to anything. You speak to somebody, they either have a quest for you or they don't, and thats all there is. The roleplaying element is completely missing. There needs to be a bit more activities to do outside of combat.

All in all, I would recommend this game but it is still incomplete.

I will say the game is still excellent after changes and has definitely improved in many areas. Will say one thing that's a little misunderstood in games that...hasn't happened in this game too much, but i've wondered at times with the glitches, is making a game difficult for difficult sake. No, never think making an enemy hard makes the enemy better. Make them more realistic, more skilled realistically, not meaninglessly hard. Give a valid reason for it

This is why Bannerlord often succeeds in the drive to play it, because you feel that realistic battle feeling and that you truly are succeeding or failing. The glitch which occasionally makes you wonder if the game makers are messing with you is:

Your troops not loading the way they should as well as the enemy spawning teleport. These are glitches I really hope Taleworlds fixes as they do hurt gameplay considerably.

So, to give you an example on your troops not loading in. Playing a siege last night and my men would not man the walls or catapaults, as well as when they died I didn't get any new units spawning in until most were dead, and i mean less than 30 units alive out of 80 to start with, and me fighting off the entire enemy army by myself, which went on for several minutes, just to give you an idea of how long my troops didn't load. This has also happened in open field battles where I'll have my archers down to the last arrow and allies still haven't shown back up. This being after my army parties infantry or other units have long since died and here I am firing away with my party for a long time waiting for allies.

This is also where the other glitch comes in. So I'll be killing off a ton of enemy troops, they should spawn from behind them right. Nope! They spawn right...behind...YOU! Or on top of you, whatever the game picks. So here you are realistically winning despite the game doing everything to glitch and make you lose and the game adds one more programmed issue into the game, spawning enemy troops on top of you

And what's better the enemy teleporting on top of your troops happens all the time. So it really is programmed in by Taleworlds. Stooopid.

I mean for realism sake if we want to be fair and make it like, you can have your military leaders choose where to spawn in to take your enemy by surprise, ok, that could work. Granted I feel like some conditions would have to be met battlefield wise to balance that, as just because your losing doesn't mean you can spawn troops right on the enemy. NO, realistically theyd have to be at least a couple hundred meters off. Otherwise were trying for some stealth force game, and come on...a couple hundred troops aren't all being that stealthy. Especially when theyre completely visible on the map and there literally is no stealth in Bannerlord, except for hideout missions which is its own category

Point being there are some glaring issues.

Now props: the game is probably among the top games, and I mean top of the list top, and one of the last games youll ever need

For those who like Blacksmith, as one who also liked it I can say this latest version, playing in the beta 2.0, is actually not bad. You can be a blacksmith, still make the best weapons, and also make good money. I'm at attribute 9 for endurance, thanks to other skills props, and 8 and 8 I think for Control and Vigor. Blacksmith demon at that point.

Things have really been stepped up, and the fixes do make the game better than where it was with its issues just months ago. So I really do thank you Tale worlds. Please fix the troop loading and teleporting issues and I think well be fine",1631219469,1696986130,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It seems that the devs are gearing up for a quick console release and cash grab instead of creating a game that lives up to their own promises and legacy. I have been through so much shit with this game and will continue to because I have hope in what it could be but I feel that the devs are not listening to the community on what the real issues with the game are so I have to leave a poor review. If you're asking if this is still relevant going into 2024, it is. Not much has been fixed at all.

If you want a meat grinder simulator this is the game for you, you'll slay tens of thousands of enemies within the first year of the game. If you want something deep past that then you should go play warband with mods.

Major issues (Not even missing promised content): 
(fixed) Kingdom snowballing issues, stupid campaign AI, poor control of armies/parties, Movement/formation command does not allow for you to spread/tighten formations, relationships with lords not personally mattering much, lack of mission diversity, (fixed) broken sieges where no attackers can scale the walls, armor that doesn't really do much, (fixed, smithing is now useless and bad but doesn't break the economy as much) broken smithing which destroys the economy, boring random companions and lords who have little to no personality, lack of consequences for AI coupled with laughable player income from sources like caravans and businesses, terrible cavalry AI, and to top it all off you can make a more interesting and diverse flag in Animal Crossing: The game is called Bannerlord.

I'll update that as I see fit with new issues I have yet to encounter or consider or if issues get fixed. I also have words about the MP but I'll skip those because I don't play it as much as SP. I will leave a better review if the devs begin to address all these issues specifically, but they continue to ignore the dedicated players who largely agree on glaring issues with the game.",1585617661,1696940815,False,0,0,0.523052453994750977,0,True,False,True

Came back to the game to see  what's happened and it's quite refined now, no obvious technical issues and much more depth added to the gameplay. The new beta adds a lot of variety and expands the immersion. 

Nov 2021 Update: 
Much improved over the last year. Few crashes and recent versions have added and refined content. The sieges have improved immensely as has performance. 

Nov 2020 Update: 
Playing through it again and definitely improved. Very slow development pace though. Enough for me to change it to a thumps up. 

Update: I really hoped they would improve BannerLord but really the updates are incredibly minor (they have focused on crash related bugs and some on optimization but nothing that really improves the game itself or the content. You can do a lot with mods with this game as well and that improves it a lot. But the microscopic changes they are making are incredibly disappointing - enough so for me to change my recommendation from YES to a NO until they really begin adding some content to this. 

Bannerlord is everything I hoped for in a sequel to Warband and more. Love the direction they took with it, the features and implementation are superb. Looks like there are lots of bugs to squash. 

A few notes on what sort of improvements are here: 1) The interface is 1000x better and more intuative. Things that were a giant time sink now can be accomplished rapidly. 2) Graphics are immensely better. 3) Fights with enemies are much more difficult as the ai is greatly improved. 4) Scope of the game much greater.  5) lots of new elements like crafting etc. 6) In warband often you would not know fundamental information like if you could persuade or not but in Bannerlord the cue's are far more useful. 

Warning though - game is quite buggy, crashing quite often at the moment. These are crash to desktop type deals. Still the positives vastly outweigh the negatives.",1585576961,1696837631,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

As a huge Mount and Blade fan....  

It hurts my soul to down vote this.  

Plain and simple, I expected it to be better then Warband and it's not.  It's 99% the same game, but worse in every way so far.  

IF this was a completely new game, not a sequel?  I'd be okay with it.  But it's not.  It's literally the same game 10 years in development and nowhere near where it should be or where you would even think this game would be.

- Most skills take an absurdly long time to level up. Like smithing seems like it would need 2000 hours of play time to finish.
- AI Diplomacy. The friendly clans will declare war for no reason. factions will declare war even though they stand 0 chance, or have easier clans to fight with.
- AI Clan. Your own clan could be engaged in a 5 way war, barely surviving, and they will nag about starting a war with yet another clan. Non-compliance will lower their rep with you.
-AI reputation system.  Investing in your nobles takes a lot of time and resources. yet at max rep, they will still randomly leave your clan.
- Inconsistent recruitment methods with NPCs. Some prisoners in your party can be talked to and recruited. many others, need to be placed in a castle prison, then you walk in there (first person), and try to talk to them in their cell.  you cant open the door so if some NPCs are at the back, you lose.
- AI retreating. Sometimes your retreating units ignore the map border next to them, and instead 'retreat' across the map, and through the enemy line. (getting slaughtered)
- Ending Wars does not show its terms. The screen will lock you in, and cant see if you are agreeing to pay a tribute or have any control over that.  you just click yes/no and live with the pain.
- As king, assigning your castles to nobles is highly restrictive. When you capture a castle, you are forced to give it to one of 3 random clans. Some clan names never come up and cant grow.
- First person combat is poor, but looks cool. Getting hit cancels your attack swing, making many weapons near useless.  a dagger can stun lock an NPC with its speed.
- Siege warfare doesnt allow you to build siege engines at start of war. While you are forced to build tents and camp, even the weakest enemy will have ample time to fully deck out their walls with the finest weapons. THEN you can start building your first weapon.

Fun and great to experience such a unique game and vivid world. Nothing quite like this and will definitely make an impression on you if this is your first time playing.


If you're a fan of the series though, there's a laundry list of problems that TaleWorlds has truly fucked up on.
- Day 1 bugs (looking at you, siege)
- AI cannot disband armies by themselves
- Devs removed the only way you can sort units into categories in favour of a dumbed-down ""optimised"" version
Now your wildlings will stand in the same group as legionaries, with no player agency in our own party organisation.
- Warband had a system where you could order lords to patrol an area, you can't here so have fun with AI lords doing jack all to help you defend from the 20 something raids
- Devs made a crossbow unit with a pavise! Quite early on too! The AI still can't use the pavise 2 years in though, so what's the bloody point? A mod from Warband well over 10 years ago solved this with an extremely simple solution, yet devs cannot do this?

And more...

For a game that is well over 2 years since release, yet still a bug ridden experience, feels like an unpolished product, with AAA price tags, and regressing in some features. I cannot recommend this to you in good faith if you are a warband enjoyer.

If this is your first Mount and Blade game, by all means, try it. If it isn't then perhaps wait until TaleWorld gets off their butts and wake up, before considering investing your cash.",1696505209,1696505209,False,12,0,0.557418107986450195,0,True,False,False

After 9 years of development, I expect a working main menu. I don't mind the crashes, the buggy state of the game, problems that are hard to detect, I get it, it's early access. But these 'staring you in the face' kind of obvious bugs and problems, should not have gone unnoticed and unsolved this long. I don't see how you can justify that after so many years of development.

The game-breaking main menu problem has persisted throughout the Beta, but they have never made official comments, or provided fixes. Most of the tickets revolving around this topic are either removed or just ignored by moderators although they have thousands of views. 

( Community members have found a temporary fix for the menu bug. The solution can be found here: https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/early-access-graphics-font-issues.396712/page-3#post-9266945 )

Again,I understand this is early access, but a game that has been in development for this long, and has gone through an extensive beta test should NOT have this many absurd problems go unnoticed. We're not talking about little under-the-radar issues.

It's just not worth the price tag at the moment. Although the combat is significantly better than the previous installment, there is hardly any real content to be found.  If you're a die hard M&B fan and you wish to support the development, go for it. If you're hoping for a smooth experience however, or hours and hours worth of content, give it some more time. 

I am a M&B lover myself, and have looked forward to this title along with you, for many years. I want nothing more than to give it a positive review. But in it's current state, even with a 20% discount it's not worth the investment. I played it in the first week after release, and have had no reason or inclination to play it again, ever since.

It is an improvement on Warband and an excellent game.

The mount combat is terrible compared to warband. In bannerlord you can never hit any infantry from a comfortable camera view. You have to tilt a lot (and constantly) and pray the swing could land on enemy's head.
In warband you can tweak the weapon trail freely so you always hit precisely (if you practice enough). In bannerlord, it's impossible, it's even worst than Skyrim's mount combat. 

The graphics is better than warband, but... why do you make characters so UGLY INTENTIONALLY? 
It's even worse than the low poly warband version. Is it because you must satisfy the wokes who never play the game?

And now a price increase? It's already too high by its quality.

I'll go back to warband. At least the battle is much better than this.

Now that they are getting Greedy in other places of the world.
This game is not worth what they UPPdd the price to.

Still a lot of bugs, and its not a aka Finished Game. The modding community is what finishes this game.
That being said its a good game but i don't like how, OUTTA the blue they just up the prices.
Now the price update don't effect me ( US ) but i do not Support the decision for them to up the price in other country's. 

Bad Move by TaleWorlds, Greed is Griping all these companies . AVOID --> Pick up on CDkeys DON'T pay full price on steam.
They deserve Lower sales in country's they Jacked the prices.

when there is war lords have no ai if there is a big army coming they wont try to group up to face them they just ignore and try to raid or siege and if they take a castle or something they just abondon it and go away they only focus on the player if a kingdom is at war with you and several other kingdoms you guessed it they will just ignore other kingdoms and focus on you they dont know how to govern they dont know how to rule you will almost always see rebellion somewere sometimes they last for years and they attack randomly it doesnt matter what state they are in lets say they are dying when they make peace they just attack at random I have seen countless times the weakest kingdom randomly attacks a random other kingdom even tho there is no chance they would win and then they get obliterated.And you are not safe either your lords will try to do samething over and over again until either you are no longer able to stop them or you get attacked.

It sort of feels like the Viking DLC for warband got meshed into warband but with less glaring faults and some nice general ease of life improvements.

Faults-
1) The most notable is that the bartering system is broken. If you hit cancel in the trade screen you get ""Your barter has been rejected."" It feels broken. 
2) If you are a newcomer this is important. Unlimited Wage is default on for parties and garrisons. Nothing ruins a game like going bankrupt and having a snowballing cost from parties and fiefs spread out across the map can ruin you.
3) This is a minor complaint. So far the main quest becomes difficult if you play like Warband and try to establish a clan and kingdom first. Being able to leave your fiefs and castles and towns to go track down some nobles becomes difficult with constant wars. If one wasn't part of a clan then one could just wander around. 
4) There's no explanation of what defensive, neutral and offensive settings mean for parties. An explanation would be nice. 
5) There's some cumbersomeness with the workshops. Which fiefs are parts of the towns? Do I have to be in the town to change a workshop? Why can't I go collect raw materials for the workshop and give the workshop those? Kinda clunky and not very evident in my opinion.
6) Sometimes siege towers don't work. I forget which castle (one of the northern empire ones on the coast) but I managed to get one to the walls without it being destroyed and the top never came down. 30 of the troops just sat there behind it. 
7) Upgrading Imperial Equites is very expensive. The average war mount runs about 1000 gold. I like the new horse upgrading mechanic but war mount upgrading is very expensive. You get deals in horse fiefs and pick them up from battles and quests to be cost effective. I've been able to get some heavy horsemen from having +20 relation with local fief leaders.
8) I've had difficulty upgrading trading. 
9) A bunch of items turn purple when I switch to civilian loadouts and I don't know what it means. All I know is it won't let me drag and drop.

Pros
1) There's parties, governors, armies, more engaging tournaments (Brackets), a large map, more kingdoms, more troop types, managing of towns and castles, a family, a main quest line with a reasonable time frame, more side quests, a huge skill tree, more items, and in general everything that was great about warband and more. Simply put if you liked Warband then Bannerlord is worth getting. If you've never played either then there's a learning curve I'm used to from Warband but Bannerlord has more to it. I'm on warrior difficulty and I wouldn't recommend going higher if you're a beginner. 
2) The right click encyclopedia feature is nice. The tip to hold control to stack sell was helpful. Some of the skills have quality of life improvements leveling perks like increasing simulation chances. Charm goes up more than any stat I've noticed.
3) Armies yield some epic battles. They go back and forth on the map sometimes. Things can get hectic with multiple wars going on as far as AI decision making. 
4) Companions feel more important and flesh out a more full story in this game.

To be fair, it is a great action game but who expects this game will include deep strategy and tactics will be very disapointed. I played hundreds of hours exploring the game mechanics and it is a lot. Technically, the game provides all the fundamental gameplay promissing exiting battles with tactical depth. But there is no depth. Neither on strategic nor on tactical level. Even on hardest difficulty it is very easy to get rich AF. Simply buy the most expenive units or outnumber your enemy - select all - attack - loot - sell loot. That's it. Instead of paper scissor rock design it is ""expensive"" beats ""cheap"" and ""quantity"" beats ""combined arms"". Combined arms is not necessary since many units are anyways copy-paste universal purpose allrounder. Expensive archers slaughter lower rank swordmen or even cavalry in close combat. You think you can demoralize the enemy infantry by crushing into their lines from behind using cavalry? You think you can play hammer and anvil tactics with breaching spearman and deadly shock troups? Well, you can do that but don't expect to have an advantage.

Wait before you buy this.

Yes it's a early access game, still you are going to lose so much time dealing with crashes and bugs with this in it's current state.
As of now I've put over 20 hours into the game for nothing. My current playthrough is completely corrupt. I have 5, yes, 5 backup/extra/whatever saves that I made to be extra careful not wanting to lose progress with them getting corrupted. Unfortunately, all 5 will no longer load. The game just crashes when I try to load any save after doing a quest that I didn't pay attention too.

Also quests in this game should be avoided at all costs. They will corrupt your save and, if not that, they will constantly cause crashes.

Definitely more challenging than previous Mount & Blade games, and that's a good thing.

The decision to force players to rest in a city to regen stamina for smithing is a terrible one.
You can't go and do something else in the game, you literally have to select 'rest for a while' in a city, and then just wait..... That isn't fun. That isn't even gameplay. There is a mod that fixes it, but it shouldn't even be there in the first place.

Don't get me wrong, there are some epic moments where you are charging into battle with your troops and watching the arrows fly, there are some basic tactics, positioning, and it's nice that you can be a mortal combat participant in the fray.  

However, outside of battle the world feels--half baked.  You can level your character in a decent skill tree, trade goods for profit, loot or smith new gear, visit castles, recruit party members, manage your party, fight in tournaments, complete missions and quests, and move your troops around a larger world map where broader dynamic factions are at war or peace.  But none of these activities is exceptionally deep or meaningful.  There's something that feels lacking in the degree of immersiveness or the impact of your actions

It's a strategy-game, but without much in-depth strategy mechanics. It's a war-game, but only very basic political, economical and social mechanics. It's a roleplaying-game, but without in-depth roleplaying mechanics. Fair to say though, this is a unique game. You will not have played any other games like this, unless you've played prior M&B titles and you will very likely not play any other games like this ever. There's a tl;dr below if u don't have time to read. 

Things the game does right:
- The music. Maybe not a popular topic to start with, but it has to be said; the game-music of Bannerlord is top-notch. Every soundtrack feels unique and at the same time blends very well with what's happening in-game. After 500+ hours I still do not get tired of the music when walking into a town or fighting out on the plains. That's great design. 
- The battles. Imagine if you'd mash up the hack-and-slash vibe of For Honor, and combine it with military strategy from games like Total War. The most unique thing about this game is the fact that you can control an entire army on a battlefield, while also controlling your own character. The fighting-mechanics aren't that deep, but are polished well-enough to be able to generate a tough but fair hack-and-slash vibe.
- The mods and community. From a player standpoint, it is nice to see Taleworlds has finally made the step to use the Steam Workshop. Not great news for modders, but they've adapted and as a player, I'm glad for it. For every little thing the base game doesn't offer (and that's a long list), there's a mod out there that will allow you to tweak these things to your own desire. Of my gametime, I've spent about a 100 without mods, and over 400 with mods installed. They truly bring this game to another level of experience, and the community is to thank for it. 

Things the game doesn't do right:
- Too much with too little depth. I could create a very long list of all the mechanics the base game is lacking, but here's the gist; Early-game the mechanics are too overwhelming for new players, and mid- and end-game the mechanics are not deep enough to have a truly immersive experience. It's trying to be too many things at the same time and therefore lacks focus on the unique aspect of this game and what makes this game truly fun. 
- The grind. I like grindy games, especially if it adds to the roleplay component, but the game kind of misses the mark on both ends. It's the type of 'here's a nice quest, now go and do it 300 more times'. Over the years they've added plenty of sidequests and side activities to do, but I personally still feel there's really only 6 actual sidequests and you just need to repeat them many, many, many times. I would be ok with this, IF the sidequests were actually adding value to roleplay, but every npc has the same type of dialogue. At least if you're making us do stuff on repeat, make the dialogue interesting so we can follow along a story or at least give us more variety of rewards. 
- The Multiplayer. It's a missed opportunity this game does not have co-op mode or an online version. The game does have multiplayer, but I've personally never really enjoyed it. Although the community is actually quite nice, the game's mechanics are too quirky for multiplayer to be fair. There's no p2w systems or any of that nonsense, just jump in a game and play (which is great), but servers lag terribly and there's a lowkey gitgud-approach, which I think is unacceptable for a game with quirky combat mechanics. 

tl;dr: Do I recommend this game? After 500+ hours of game time I'd be an idiot not to. In the end, I've had fun with this game, but not because of what this game is. But because of what the modding community has made it to be. Bannerlord has the potential to be the best war-rpg ever created, but with the base game falls short on the best aspects of that genre. Total War is a better war-strategy game, For Honor has better combat mechanics, Crusader Kings has better diplomacy and levels of intrigue, and Dragon Age Origins has better roleplay elements, yet Bannerlord has adapted a shade of every game mentioned above and put everything into one, tried to do its own thing and then didn't take into account what makes the games mentioned above actually fun. But then you discover the magical world of the Steam Workshop and the community that seem to understand why this game has such great potential, and you can strap yourself for many hours of more fun and you staring at menus while tweaking the game to your own liking.

My mighty army sweeps like an icy wind through the ranks of the enemy force cleaving them mercilessly. No enemy is left standing - all receiving deadly blows. But, hey, hang on a minute. The enemy lord who I just impaled with my eighteen foot lance at 50 km hour apparently wasn't killed after being thrown off his horse and landing on his head. Apparently because he is just another lord that has the 'get out of death free' card in his back pocket. Every lord/lady is issued one before the game begins or so it definitely seems.

This then raises the game question of how can I actually kill him, because if I simply now capture him he will escape easily. The game allows that every lord automatically escapes captivity after lunch/dinner or the next 20 kilometres, whichever comes first. It appears lords also have the 'get out of captivity free' card in their back pocket. They will even escape your heavily guarded prison automatically should you actually successfully return them to your stronghold. 

The problem here is that escaped lords will raise another army of hundreds of men at the blink of an eye and return speedily to fight the bannerlord again, rinse and repeat style.

Okay so how about executing this already-dead lord who refuses to acknowledge their fatal wounds? Ah, no sorry, then every lord in the game will slightly or significantly hate me forever, according to game logic. Even my friends who also hated this now dead lord will instantly hate me. Even on the other side of the world they will hear about this. Even if they are deaf. 

However, if the lance wound had indeed been fatal then nobody would hate me at all even though in both cases I am still savagely murdering him. 

So there are two possible scenarios, both merciless and intent on killing the enemy lord, but one brutally penalising the player in terms of global public relations:

(A) The battle is still raging and I tear the heart out of my enemy and stomp on it twenty times in a fit or rage. Penalty: 0.

(B) The battle is still raging and I tear the heart out of my enemy and stomp on it twenty times in a fit or rage. But the lord miraculously survives and then I hit him with an axe after the battle because I don't really like zombies. Penalty: life long hatred from the entire world. Because apparently their is CCTV in all battles and this is relayed back to Calradia 6 O'Clock news in all provinces. So every lord in the world instantly knows what I've been up to...

And it is this part of the game that will create the most frustrating grind of what is otherwise a complete masterpiece.

It ran horribly on my old computer, but decently on a newer one. I didn't play much back then. Came back a year later, now it runs smooth on the old computer. I appreciate this.

Now, for the game itself, if you've played the previous one, it's that, just upgraded: more complex, more features, more of anything, some voice acting, which is good, but inconsistent and rare. The voice acting is nice, I would LOVE for it to be present throughout the game.

If you don't learn how to play the game, it's can get very difficult. And I don't mean strapping on some armor and fighting whatever comes your way. I mean learning how to make money, troops, politics, etc. There are tutorials now, but not for everything, and sometimes they're a bit hard to follow. However, it doesn't matter that much because there are guides available and a nice community. But even so, going into battle with various troops / armies is still an amazingly satisfying experience. Especially if you have mounted troops, and you're with a couch lance / spear or a big axe. You can also play it as a strategy game and skip all that fighting stuff, although I think the combat is one of the best parts.

Graphics are... weird. It's an optimized game, and being in the middle of a battle with hundreds of troops is an amazing and unique experience, but oh boy the faces of the NPCs can give you nightmares. The smile at the end when you decide to spare an enemy leader is funny though. This gameplay, with good graphics, would be amazing, but would also probably require a top-end computer to run. Right now, it runs very well on a 10-year old computer, and I think that is something that should be appreciated. But yeah, a little more cloth physics and better graphics (especially FACES) would make a great addition to this game. Environment looks nice, and night time fighting is really night time, it's dark out there, not just a shade darker.

Story is basic, but game mechanics can make it good, as in: you can make whatever you want out of it, be a mercenary, be a merchant, a lord, whatever, it works. It's a true sandbox game. There is a main story you can follow, that can branch off into a couple of routes, but you can also just ignore all of that and just do whatever. It still works.

I'm just starting, learning how to play but doing pretty well; got contracted as a mercenary for the Northern Empire and making a name for myself. Figure the time had come to settle down and have children with a respectable lady to carry the clan name forward after I perish, so I start visiting different castles to see the ladies at court.

They all snub me. ""You simply aren't of sufficient means blah blah blah you must rise much higher at court before I'd consider you for marriage blah blah.""

Okay, forget these picadilly snoots then.

I devote myself entirely to winning tournaments, honing my fighting skills, training my troops. I end up roaming out towards the fringes of the Empire chasing mercenary work and meet the Khuzait (mongolian-themed) clans. Intervene in a few battles, earn their Khan's favor. Get a dialogue option to propose marriage between our clans, and it SUCCEEDS. The Khan offers me his daughter's hand in marriage.

LOLWUT there ain't no way, this must be a joke, bet she's one of those f'd up looking NPC's with garbage stats anyways right?

Nope.

She is a BABE warlord princess with amazing stats and traits to potentially pass on to our children. My hands are shaking as I crit-succeed the dialogue persuasion checks. We marry, and shortly after I am offered a fief and lordship by my liege in the Northern Empire.  Everything is too good to be true.

My rags-to-riches story took me from a nobody mercenary with nothing but a horse and a sword... now I have my own castle, 120 men-at-arms, married a Khuzait warrior princess who is now carrying our first unborn child, and I have a warlord father-in-law who will literally send forth his hordes to demolish anybody who messes with me.

Now, for a more detailed review of the game... 

Bannerlord is essentially a map for the most part, so that's the only downside to me. I prefer a more open world based experience. However, one of the most impressive parts about the game, is its attention to detail. 

The strategy you learn from this game is brilliant. I started off with just charging at the enemy, but it resulted in massive casualties. Two months of playing later, I discovered the ability to upgrade troops and to set them in different locations--now I have little to no casualties! (Quick tip: Always go for archers and horsemen. They overwhelm the enemy!) 

The story mode is alright in my opinion, but it really doesn't do much for me. I prefer the sandbox mode, which is where I will be talking the most. 
So, this game was definitely meant to be a sandbox game right from the start! When you begin, it is a little difficult, almost overwhelming at times because you don't know where to start. Well I began by fighting in some tournaments, building up my inventory, then doing some odd quests here and there. Then I became a mercenary, then a vassal. Honestly, that's a basic run through of the sandbox mode... but I am not basic. >:)
In my main play through, I decided being a vassal wasn't enough. My character was at 79 years of age, lost two wives, has three heirs, and seven grandchildren. I had a dynasty in the making. So on the map in my game, the Western Empire is just dominating Calraida. I used to serve Sturgia (which fell), and the Asari (Which is waging too much war), and Battania, and the Northern and Southern Empires are gone. Three kingdoms remain and a new power needs to rise, and that was my Que. 
I decided I would go straight for the Western Empire and capture one of their castles (Note I am at max level at this point, so I had a pretty fair sized army). Now I have a kingdom that is about to grow into a new empire! 

The RPG elements are supreme! From the courting process, relations, and quests, you never run out of things to do in Bannerlord! The character customization is honestly beyond fun! From creating the eye color, hairstyle, weight, and clothing, it gives you so much to work with! I have also started smithing, and it is a blast! Creating my dream weapon is such a joy in this game! Again, there are so many RPG options in this game, its hard to keep track! The companions are also a plus--I just use them for Caravans. 

As far as online mode is concerned, I have not yet played it. However, I have heard a lot about the Persistent Empires mod, so that may be something I might try.  

The bugs are prominent at the beginning, but after a while, they just stop. So don't be afraid if the game stops every once and a while! :)

In conclusion, Mount and Blade 2: Bannerlord, is one of the best video games I have ever played! If you like riding horses, swinging a sword, and living your dream of being a medieval knight or something, PLAY THIS GAME! 10/10!",1695490399,1695490399,True,3,0,0.519040167331695557,0,True,False,False

UPDATED 6/26/2022: It's been over a year since I've bought Bannerlord and not a single thing has improved, and in fact have actively gotten worst. There are so many bugs and devs are just adding more and more of them with every meager update we've gotten while there are bugs over 2 years old that are still present, it's absurd to even call this a early access product because at least early access games tend to update their games and add content. The only major content update we've gotten in over a year is for multiplayer that no one cares about. The main game is so far from finished and so many bugs exist that you can't even play the game without debug mode on to fix things and get yourself unstuck , and even then there are so many game breaking bugs that can't be fixed with debug mode (like your wife and companions just ceasing to exist on the map anywhere). I was cautious going in and knew I was buying an incomplete game when I bought Bannerlord, I didn't expect the devs to just take the money and run though, never improving anything of substance and outright refusing to finish their own game. Just play the old M&B, and don't encourage this shit company to continue their awful practices. At this point I wouldn't even play a complete version of the game because it's left such a bad taste in my mouth. STAY FAR AWAY FROM BANNERLORD!






OLD REVIEW: Mount and Blade Bannerlord is a pretty unique title at the moment due to it being early access (and for quite some time now) in that it's the price range of a normal fully developed game. One should keep this in mind before purchasing M&B II as, unless you're willing to accept that your game WILL crash and that some things ARE missing. That said, I think development in the time I've personally owned the game is going fairly smooth. I've personally seen bugs I've found myself while playing get fixed in recent patches, so I can't really say I'm upset at the pace the devs are going.

If you've played the older 2 M&B titles and enjoyed it, you'll enjoy this one too. It's more or less the same game with some much needed upgrades, both visually and quality of life wise. Despite being early access it runs very smooth with almost zero instances of slowdown or frame drops using a RTX 3060 and Ryzen 5 3600x. I did notice that the game does A LOT of disk reads when looking through things like inventory or troops menus however, and this made the game very slow on my 7200RPM HDD, while moving it over to my SSD corrected that issue, I think this is a poor design as a game really shouldn't be doing disk reads for something you access as often as these menus. This is something the devs should really consider fixing/optimizing.

All that said, I do think it's a little brash to pay full price for the game at the moment. Sure the devs seem to be working hard to fix the issues and what have you, but they're also using the fans who purchased the game as free testers which is a practice I'd really rather not encourage from any company no matter how fond of them I am.

Level scaling is very poor (easy to level some like combat, grindy to level others like engineering).

To make matters worse, running castles, cities and kingdoms are more chores than they are fun. Even these are unbalanced and some cases where you cannot progress in them at all without micro-management. 
The best thing I can say is wait for a heavy sale. When you get bored with it, try a new bulid. If you hate yourself, try role playing as a foot soldier (this eventually will feel good, especially in siege battles but it's very very slow and risky). When you have had your fill, look to mods.

The game really feels unfinished and should not be presented as retail version.

Seriously, after nearly a decade of waiting, Bannerlord is a worthy sequel. Battles/sieges are more realistic. Quests are more diverse and finally fun. I like that instead of having to roam a town to find a certain NPC, there's a menu that will allow you to speak directly to them once you enter a town. 

My only real complaint so far is the lack of criminal activites I can do right now, in comparison to what the devs were planning. But, given that this is in EA, it's understandable that there are going to be features missing for now.

Great job, TaleWorlds. I'm loving it.

Edit: 38 hours in and I'm still enjoying this game. Yes, alot of things such as kingdom management haven't been implemented but TW already said that they won't implement it until BL is out of EA so I guess I'll wait (not that I have a choice).

I still recommend this to everyone, especially those like me who put in serious hours with WB. Even with the bug and imbalances, this game is still fun to play for the price tag and get involved with the forums. The devs actually read them and lots of their hotfixes have been implemented to take care of the bugs that have been going on.

Edit 2: 3 years and 783 hours later and honestly, I might change my recommendation. The mod community has been incredible at adding content and quality to this game, but TW practically breaks all the necessary mods with each new hotfix. It would be appreciated if TW worked closer with the modders and incorporated these mods into the game core.

Edit 3: I'll be honest with everyone, TW is doing a horrible job with updates. It's not that they don't update this game, it's that the updates are usually very minor but they brick mods like crazy. With the lack of real content, mods are quite literally required to play this game. Until TW starts actually incorporating some mods into the core game, or at lease stops bricking mods every couople months, I'd say hold off on buying.",1585613011,1695162957,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First of all I didn't play 5 hours in this game. The game was collapsed a few times, one time was definitely more than an hour. Why steam counts that time?

I was searching good battle multiplayer which I can play, I can't play and enjoy this game because:
- You need to wait a match more than 10 minute
- The battle is very slow, before fighting starts you will wait for opponent like 2 minutes

- You can't quickly finish a battle because of (don't know why it was introduced) my troops  cheasing retreating troops, what? Why? just to make a boring game even more boring?

Taleworlds has decided to increase regional pricing, which is already above US regional pricing in places they plan - as is. Yet US pricing is not increasing.... 
This seems heavily like a scummy marketing ploy to get more sales and a portion of the community have repeated this idea. The game has been slumping but instead of deciding to do content updates, they chose the cheap scumbag route of luring people in to panic buy. 
They haven't had a substantial update in ages and have displayed 0 motivation to even bother making DLC or even flushing out features, modders are doing this work for them. They delayed mod support, which made modders literally quit this game when it was modding that made warband as great as it was. It is still modding that makes bannerlord great not the developers. If anything, the developers hindered their own game by stumping mod support. This is literally why you see these huge projects people were working on vanish - they fucking gave up carrying this game.

This game has been thrown to the curb and they are asking people to pay more.... its disgusting. This is some EA shit and they should be ashamed.

What is Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord? Well, that’s a complex question to answer. Asking that is almost like asking what kind of game Dwarf Fortress or Starfield is. Bannerlord is, in my opinion, a story-telling engine. It gives you a world to play in, the tools and means to affect it to your will, and sets you free. It is a quality that very few games can achieve, though many have tried, most fail. M&B Warband and Bannerlord are the standards that all others ascribe to imitate. This game allows you to witness the beautiful and profound impact of your actions and the actions of others upon the world.

On the surface however, it is a mix between an action RPG and a 4X Strategy game. The setting is Calradia, and it all takes place prior to the events of Warband, the first game. You are given Warband’s beloved world in it’s inception, made to discover and, in a way, create the history of the overall Mount and Blade world. Your character can be, literally, whatever you want. You choose one of the cultures to spawn into, craft a background for yourself and choose what specialties to take. Then, you spawn in a city from your chosen culture, and from there - the world is yours. Talk to nobles. Gather troops and supplies. Do tasks for the locals to earn their trust and their favor. Gather influence, money, and men.

Level up your smithing between breaks fighting bandits. Create your very own personalized war gear. Are you a medieval weapons nerd? Your mouth will water at the customization options in Bannerlord’s smithing system. In any other RPG, half of the parts would be DLC, and the other half pre-order bonuses. In Bannerlord, you unlock them by leveling up. Hell, if you don’t like the systems Taleworlds has, just mod them out, because the game is 100% modular as well.

Then there's the combat - the best part. Command your army with the same level of tactical, battlefield control that you get in something like a Total War game. Deploy your archers in the back-line in a scattered formation while your infantry forms a shield wall at the frontal assault. Run your cavs around the flanks, and become the x-factor in battle yourself. Storm the battlefield in the middle of a bloody massacre, two-handed sword in hand. Your strikes are raw, blood spurts and the victims of your burning hatred scream with believable terror. Your loyal troops that you spent hours grinding and customizing roar with heroism and faith behind you.

Dueling down opponents never felt so sexy. Metal clanks and scrapes are believable. To hit your enemies, you have to directionally attack using the mouse. Every area that you can attack can also be blocked, and fighting one-on-one becomes this deadly dance where you have to watch your enemy’s every step. Or, against an unworthy foe, simply watch them crumble at a wild swing they have no hope of defending.

Characters you encounter on the battlefield will remember and judge you by your every action. They’ll remark to you about past battles, or complement heroic deeds that they witnessed from you. Every character and location you have seen will be accessible at any time in the game’s encyclopedia - and honestly, it deserves to be called one. The amount of information cataloged about the world around you is immense. If you thought Skyrim was a sandbox RPG, this game will make you reconsider, as it did to me.

Speaking of the world, it is immersive to every sense. The music is unforgettable. Battle tracks make your heart jump with passion. The world map music makes you feel at home in your chosen culture, borrowing elements from real world influences such as the Roman Empire, Mongol Empire, Celts, Nords, Mesopotamians and more. Every single city and town in the game can be entered at any time, each with its won unique structure and layout. Naturally, if a fight breaks out, it will be on that very same map that you could travel peacefully through. The towns feel alive and lived in. Castles feel like true fortresses, and consequently, the assaults feel epic every single time. It’s like your very own Helms Deep siege, again and again.

And that’s exactly what Mount & Blade is - a storyteller. So, to conclude, I will give you a bit of my own story:

Valishin of Maregoving set out from his home amongst the Sturgians when his parents were killed in their tavern. He was a strong, fighting man. Valishin was a big guy, and as such he made quite a bit of money fighting in the local arena matches. When his parents were killed, Valishin knew he had to leave and set out to the world, using his fighting skills form the arena to slay the bandits responsible. He singlehandedly took out an encampment of the local bandits, an act which impressed upon the nobility in Valishin’s vicinity. His strength and capability as a military leader was clear to them. They knew they could use him and his clan as a weapon against the encroaching Empires around their ancestral homeland. And so, after garnering enough support from the locals, Valishin was welcomed amongst the Sturgians as an official mercenary. The clan was named after Valishin’s family, and so, the Maregoving clan set out like a whirlwind against the Empire.

Their assaults were fast, clearly like nothing their western neighbors were prepared for. Instead of engaging their cavalry in the open field, Valishin decided it best to instead strike their ill-defended fortresses. He set out for their castles, though to call them such would be a discredit to the world. The Imperial, paper fortresses buckled under the assault of Valishin’s highly trained infantry. Casualties on the attacking side were always kept to an absolute minimum thanks to their commander’s unceasing, eagle-eyesight. This made their attack against the frontier difficult to stem - an accomplishment which only brought more favor to this once small mercenary band. Afterwards, they were welcomed into the Sturgians as an official vassal.

Your capabilities to affect the world of Bannerlord are more generous than anything I’ve experienced in a modern RPG. Having said that, I believe that this game demands the attention of any gamer who enjoys RPGs.",1681132916,1694980611,False,1,3,0.5,0,True,False,False

That's probably Bannerlord. There are great things about this game, and it has large improvements over M&B 1, but it never feels like a finished game, and that's not only about feeling, but, it actually just isn't finished. It's possible to get over clunky animations and weird npc behavior, and its worth mentioning many things M&B does well, but polishing their games is not it. Early Access since 2020 and more than 3 years later most of it's updates are occasional bug fixes. Last time I played, I was trying to find out how to upgrade income sources using properties you can buy within cities, as it seems there is a ui dedicated to leveling up economy/income etc. I figured out through comments that this feature wasn't implemented yet. I get that its hard to make tons of AI do sensible things in large scale combat and also run well, but why neglect missing content and other important elements of the game?
And then to raise the prices for many regions? The game honestly wasn't worth full price as it was, and how can raising the price be justified if the game isn't even finished?

It largely falls into the same pitfalls as the first game with a tiny bit more interactivity, but with the addition smithing system making the game genuinely easier. Hell, returning unit lines from warband often repeat crippling weaknesses they had back then, like some top tier units refusing to wear helmets.

Distributing weapons which have a stabbing function to AI troops genuinely makes the AI perform massive leagues worse, as lightweight and fast weapons are handled like a slow and heavy lances.

Its still the vaguely robotic two button combat we had before.

But its still a 70% complete war-peace sandbox simulation game to teeth ourselves on until starsector is done.

Since release the game as a whole did not change that much, if u hop into singleplayer its still empty, the diplomacy is as bad as in the total war series, so ""peace"" and ""die"". But people will say that Bannerlord was mainly done for the battles, well, there are no sea battles (which isnt bad but does give some negative points) and the land battles are just f1 f3, the strategy of the ai is bad, the melee combat of the ai is bad, as a player u literally need a MOD to make battles somewhat good.

The weekly updates that Taleworlds has done also periodically breaks mods and these arent big updates that actually change stuff, no its just a tiny balance here and there, smth that could have waited. The actual big updates also are just lacking, many bugs are still present and they have been here since day 1.

For the multiplayer, well that is mostly dead. Maps are bugged, hitboxes are bugged, u cant hide inside of hay stacks (smth u could do in warband), the Taleworld servers for skirmish and captain dont exist, u will only find private servers. The only servers working are siege and team deathmatch and they also like to crash and the private servers are simply better.

Furthermore, they have also added perks for your unit type, which i dont understand why they ever did it, literally nobody asked and it looks more like the devs played some bad shooter were perks are everywhere. The only thing that should contribute in a fight should be your own skill, your weapon and your armour. The perks are unneeded.

Its even worse, bc the devs already have problems with balancing units, armour, weapons, they simply lack the manpower to also balance the perks.",1592133686,1694889314,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Starting from very little, your first couple hours in the game will come to learning the basic mechanics, bumbling through combat, and graduating from lordly infancy by saying ""Wait, I can recruit people??""
I have enjoyed my time with Bannerlord despite being terrible at it but, as I finally decided to serve a larger clan as a vassal and start laying siege to castles and cities, I discovered a game-breaking issue which invalidates all of your work to that stage of the game.
As a vassal of Battania, I gathered together an army, laid siege to a castle with a garrison of ~50, and was certain to succeed. When the walls were nearly torn down, an allied army came by and joined the siege. At first I was happy about this, but then I realized that I could no longer begin the attack. I discovered that when an allied army aids you in sieges, they wrench control of the siege from you and get to choose when to attack.
This would have been alright and something I could deal with, but then we'd torn down every wall of the enemy castle, destroyed all their reinforcements, and assembled a full suite of our own war machines. And... nothing. I sat there for three full in-game days, and the in-control lords refused to ever begin the attack.
I did manage to leave the battle and rejoin, thus causing the attack to initiate, but I was refused entry to the final assault and was not recognized for being the one to lay siege.
I see forum posts about this issue going all the way back to January, and even a moderator promising way back then to pass it on to the team. And still now, eight months later, I still cannot siege a city.
Wonderful game, but an issue preventing players from interfacing with one of its greatest mechanics has remained for over half a year.",1694885753,1694885753,False,11,0,0.61055457592010498,0,True,False,False

Warband - but with added visuals of bandits drinking from skulls,

In all honesty, probably one of the best releases of an early access game thus far in 2020.

The graphics are much better, many more items, they improved all the parts of the game that caused friction, for example when they attacked your castle in mount and blade, your arrows ran out and you had to wait for an archer to die, but now there are reloading stations, battering rams, catapults, and so on.

in short, this game exceeded my expectations. but there is still more to come. the best thing about the previous game was the mods, i played almost all the mods over the years. and now i can't wait to see what the wonderful community of mount and blade can do with this engine, mods from the lord of the Ring, game of thrones, Neapolitan wars, crusades, gekokujo.

What is Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord? Well, that’s a complex question to answer. Asking that is almost like asking what kind of game Dwarf Fortress or Starfield is. Bannerlord is, in my opinion, a story-telling engine. It gives you a world to play in, the tools and means to affect it to your will, and sets you free. It is a quality that very few games can achieve, though many have tried, most fail. M&B Warband and Bannerlord are the standards that all others ascribe to imitate. This game allows you to witness the beautiful and profound impact of your actions and the actions of others upon the world.

On the surface however, it is a mix between an action RPG and a 4X Strategy game. The setting is Calradia, and it all takes place prior to the events of Warband, the first game. You are given Warband’s beloved world in it’s inception, made to discover and, in a way, create the history of the overall Mount and Blade world. Your character can be, literally, whatever you want. You choose one of the cultures to spawn into, craft a background for yourself and choose what specialties to take. Then, you spawn in a city from your chosen culture, and from there - the world is yours. Talk to nobles. Gather troops and supplies. Do tasks for the locals to earn their trust and their favor. Gather influence, money, and men. 

Level up your smithing between breaks fighting bandits. Create your very own personalized war gear. Are you a medieval weapons nerd? Your mouth will water at the customization options in Bannerlord’s smithing system. In any other RPG, half of the parts would be DLC, and the other half pre-order bonuses. In Bannerlord, you unlock them by leveling up. Hell, if you don’t like the systems Taleworlds has, just mod them out, because the game is 100% modular as well.

Then there's the combat - the best part. Command your army with the same level of tactical, battlefield control that you get in something like a Total War game. Deploy your archers in the back-line in a scattered formation while your infantry forms a shield wall at the frontal assault. Run your cavs around the flanks, and become the x-factor in battle yourself. Storm the battlefield in the middle of a bloody massacre, two-handed sword in hand. Your strikes are raw, blood spurts and the victims of your burning hatred scream with believable terror. Your loyal troops that you spent hours grinding and customizing roar with heroism and faith behind you. 

Dueling down opponents never felt so sexy. Metal clanks and scrapes are believable. To hit your enemies, you have to directionally attack using the mouse. Every area that you can attack can also be blocked, and fighting one-on-one becomes this deadly dance where you have to watch your enemy’s every step. Or, against an unworthy foe, simply watch them crumble at a wild swing they have no hope of defending.

Characters you encounter on the battlefield will remember and judge you by your every action. They’ll remark to you about past battles, or complement heroic deeds that they witnessed from you. Every character and location you have seen will be accessible at any time in the game’s encyclopedia - and honestly, it deserves to be called one. The amount of information cataloged about the world around you is immense. If you thought Skyrim was a sandbox RPG, this game will make you reconsider, as it did to me. 

Speaking of the world, it is immersive to every sense. The music is unforgettable. Battle tracks make your heart jump with passion. The world map music makes you feel at home in your chosen culture, borrowing elements from real world influences such as the Roman Empire, Mongol Empire, Celts, Nords, Mesopotamians and more. Every single city and town in the game can be entered at any time, each with its won unique structure and layout. Naturally, if a fight breaks out, it will be on that very same map that you could travel peacefully through. The towns feel alive and lived in. Castles feel like true fortresses, and consequently, the assaults feel epic every single time. It’s like your very own Helms Deep siege, again and again.

And that’s exactly what Mount & Blade is - a storyteller. So, to conclude, I will give you a bit of my own story:

Valishin of Maregoving set out from his home amongst the Sturgians when his parents were killed in their tavern. He was a strong, fighting man. Valishin was a big guy, and as such he made quite a bit of money fighting in the local arena matches. When his parents were killed, Valishin knew he had to leave and set out to the world, using his fighting skills form the arena to slay the bandits responsible. He singlehandedly took out an encampment of the local bandits, an act which impressed upon the nobility in Valishin’s vicinity. His strength and capability as a military leader was clear to them. They knew they could use him and his clan as a weapon against the encroaching Empires around their ancestral homeland. And so, after garnering enough support from the locals, Valishin was welcomed amongst the Sturgians as an official mercenary. The clan was named after Valishin’s family, and so, the Maregoving clan set out like a whirlwind against the Empire.

Their assaults were fast, clearly like nothing their western neighbors were prepared for. Instead of engaging their cavalry in the open field, Valishin decided it best to instead strike their ill-defended fortresses. He set out for their castles, though to call them such would be a discredit to the world. The Imperial, paper fortresses buckled under the assault of Valishin’s highly trained infantry. Casualties on the attacking side were always kept to an absolute minimum thanks to their commander’s unceasing, eagle-eyesight. This made their attack against the frontier difficult to stem - an accomplishment which only brought more favor to this once small mercenary band. Afterwards, they were welcomed into the Sturgians as an official vassal.

""I don't have much playtime on this game, and to be honest I keep returning to modded Warband instead... but mark my words. This is a good game, and some day it will become a great one.""

I must say, that hasn't aged well. I admit, this game still has potential, but to this day, you're still better off just playing Warband mods. Bannerlord doesn't have many interesting mods, the game is missing a lot of content even now, and there's many bloated mechanics that don't add much to the game, but result in either immersion-breaking experiences or unbalanced ones. The biggest offender in that regard is death and children.

This game isn't worth your money, and I hate to say but Taleworlds has not done a good job at making this game feel like a worthwhile investment. Buying it in Early Access felt like a sort of... crowdfunding. Like I was paying to make it possible for them to make the game the best it can be. It was a big red flag when they cut major promised content from the roadmap just so they can release version 1.0 sooner, and now with them raising prices in some regions is another red flag. This game is not much different from how it was at the time of my review last year. Development is slow, and they clearly have not made the most of the money we invested into this.

Warband is, to this day, a fantastic and very fun game, if you can look past the graphics. It has a number of really entertaining mods, almost all of which are overhauls (by virtue of that game only permitting one mod at a time) that take the game into other settings. From Game of Thrones, to Starwars, to Warhammer Fantasy, to Lord of the Rings, and even some original settings like Perisno and Prophesy of Pendor. The last one there, Pendor, is my personal recommendation. If you are interested in this game and have not experienced Warband mods, just go do that instead. It'll be more fun, and it'll be cheaper.",1648398340,1694591651,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

In my humble opinion, most of those negative reviews are not warranted, and are probably from people who would still rather review bomb and play Warband than ever admit that this game is an upgrade.

There's only about 2 or 3 things that are missing/different from Warband at it's core, but there's MANY more things to enjoy in comparison - more culture-based armors than the few Warband had (same with town maps), more cities and map scenarios in general, more skill-tree depth and traits to focus on for a more defined RPG experience, the entire family/clan addition, the newly updated criminal/backalley gang gameplay for income, better trading and caravans, actual armies, in addition to a much higher increase in individual party numbers, more unique quests in addition to some similar ones, more kingdom management and diplomacy, more town and castle management, and probably more worth noting that I didn't think of.

The only major thing I have found in about 800 hrs that it doesn't do better is the marriage courtship. The entire NPC lord relations and dialogue options are, well about the same as warband's. There's options that often don't do much but exist, and then there's bartering which is newer but only worth when you're rich and paying people off. The system is a bit more dynamic than Warband's, by a hair if anything, but then you have the courtship which is non-existent here, and instead you either just pay for an arranged marriage if the father approves, or elope if you talk to the potential match long enough with good RNG.

I could go on and on with positives, and yes the game will still have it's bugs and possible issues...I mean, like most games of that era, Warband is a much simpler and smaller game. It won't crash as much but that doesn't mean it didn't. If you played that and you like it, or you just want a different medieval feudal RPG where you can play as an OP character running down dozens of enemies while a hundred more scream and yell around you, then get this game.

The battles, the whole fighting, it's unparalleled. No better game around. But it's not a medieval fighter, it's an empire builder and in that aspect the game seriously lacks.

Long term relationships with other kingdoms is impossible. If you're small they attack because they can take you. If you become big they attack you to prevent you dominating the map. The past your kingdoms have, the relationship between your leaders, none of this matters. Intrigue between nobles? Nope. Becoming a bandit ruler? Nope. Decent financial insight? WHY? You don't need that to fight, right? Lively cities? Nope, purely empty background.

I know a whole bunch of games who did way better, and that's only taking the 80's in account, games of less then 2 megabyte. It gets worse if you look at modern days.

However, nothing quite prepares you for your first big battle and the re-orienting that you have to do over a campaign from front line warrior to tactician and leader of an army.

I absolutely hated fighting Vlandia's sharpshooters and cavalry before I figured out how to counter.

Positives for Bannerlord:
-Still great combat with weight behind horses and weapons, but with better graphics. Greater scale battles, captain squads, relative easy to use tactical hotkeys, and siege weapons are all very nice additions to the game.
-Cities and towns got lots of love with maps, units, reputation, etc
-Some of the Warband jank is cleaned up (ie animals go to inventory/no more herding cattle)
-New systems like smithing, skill perks, reputation and realm laws are in the game
-New factions that still feel different

Negatives for Bannerlord:
-Taleworlds don't know what game they're making. They built a cool combat system and sell it as a single player sandbox RPG, but put sooo much development into multiplayer that was essentially dead after 3 months because its up against Chivalry 2, Mordhau, For Honour. 
-Allied AI commanded battles can become a frustrating slaughterhouse if you join as a captain. I've seen too many battles where my allies single file plug walk into a wall of enemies.
-Companions and settlements feel less special. I like Bunduk, Ymira, Borcha, and the rest of the crew from Warband. I remember the epic three way battles over Dhirim that disrupted trade for an eternity. I can't remember the name of any companions or settlement sieges in Bannerlord.
-Realms seem to death war to a stalemate most of the time. In Warband, realms didn't always form one huge army to hit one target. There would be multiple skirmishes and smaller sieges. Feel like this might be an AI problem on the overworld, but it does lead to the next problem.
-Grindy. Its very difficult to try and do anything in Bannerlord because the AI seems to want to preserve the status quo. This leads to every gain you take being immediately the target of a unified enemy, while your own realm will not lift a finger. While not impossible to do, it slows the game down and made it not fun for me. May as well have put in Preston Garvey.
-Late game is pretty much broken or non-existent. Standard play is to make money, get some guys together, pledge fealty or create a realm, get some land, expand the realm. Diplomacy, political intrigue and economics all feel non-existent, which really defeats the RPG element. The way people treat you as a random mercenary verse a king is pretty much the same despite the reputation system.

Conclusion: Everything feels rehashed, shallow or soulless except for the combat. There are some good new ideas and frameworks like reputation, dynasties, different types of local leaders, skill feats, realm laws, but they are feel like placeholder systems. I think most of my frustration comes from what it could have been. If you don't mind the graphics, Warband and With Fire&Sword are the better value games.",1694480314,1694486858,False,16,0,0.600738584995269775,0,True,False,False

Yes, I have fun playing the game at times...but not really. I'm an avid lover of sandbox games and like many others I couldn't wait for Bannerlord to come out. When it originally released in EA and the honeymoon phase ended, I realized there wasn't really anything to do other than fight and run around the map. It wasn't anything like what was promised, but hey it was early access.
So I waited in hopes 1.0 would bring it all together: it didn't. It is a husk of what Warband/Viking Conquest has to offer.

- No depth in diplomacy
- Shallow characters with even shallower interactions
- No path to play (Bandit for example) other than nobody -> merc -> vassal -> king/queen/whatever (Which feels no different than being a vassal)
- No outpost/camps to make like in Warband

As of this review, I'm on the 1.2 beta because I had hoped it would show some promise and while they did expand on the bandit aspect, it's just as shallow as everything else. Also this is just a side note, but does everyone really have to have the same basic greeting when they meet you for the first time? It really reinforces that Twilight Zone feeling which sucks because it's a sandbox and I want to be absorbed and feel like I'm in a living breathing world.

Regardless of the negatives the sieges are great, graphics amazing, skill tree is solid, and combat is good...but I don't think this should have taken 10 years.

I'll still play the game, but I don't think this will see it's full potential until future expansions or extensive overhaul mods come out. Hopefully I can update my review at that point, but for now this is a $30 game at most imo.",1694464534,1694464534,False,1,0,0.506172835826873779,0,True,False,False

This game is somewhat a medieval RPG/Combat Simulator
But it fails miserably in every aspect of it.
Combat is more like a massive Zerg, the AI is non existent beside: There is enemy, use weapon and hit them.
There is no real strategic fight or tactics behind it. If you start a siege the AI will send immediately one or two huge Armies to stop you as player and ignore the ""main war target"". Your Allies aren't helpful at all. They sit there and do... nothing.

Hit system is more rng then anything else. If you hit or miss is absoluetly random at some distance.
Quests are obnoxious and repetitive.
Graphics are mediocre and that's a nice description.
Mechanics are well hidden or not explained at all.
Game crashes sometimes.

There's nothing to do outside of these quests.

It uses the same exact items if not more. I would suggest to have the developers add that feature to game since you already have add the feature that lets us player craft our own weapon. I would really love if you can add that to the game. 

Crafting an armor makes your character a unique one, it separates your character to your army. Also why not add also another feature that let us craft our own shield.

Finished the game to the point of having my own empire, reaching the ability to fight multiple wars with over 380 troops in my personal army. Ambushed by groups of 800-1000 and held small passages with 150 fian champions, a shield wall and just enough cavalry to route the enemy. 

Had every companion in my personal bodyguard unit and was run down by a flanking cavalry charge, most of my unit was dismounted, we had to fight our way back to our line. Ordered our shield-wall to take tremendous losses to get us back into the fighting. Creating a tusudo (square formation) around the companions and bodyguard unit while we fought against the 2 v 1 odds (realistic difficulty). 

Lost 90% of my army, most of my companions but we won that battle. 

When we get out, we siege the enemy castle with just enough soldiers to push the ram. We knock down the reinforced doors and engage in a skirmish. The companions start to fall, members who were with me from the beginning. My troops are outnumbered, holding a small room near the gate. The balance of power is slowly creeping in the right direction. We are down to the last 20 enemies. We have 9 of us left, holding the doorway the best that we can. 

I take a javelin to the head, instant K.O. My units keep fighting, my bodyguard with insane leadership and tactics, reforms the wall and finds 30 or so troops that I mismanaged to come around and flank. 

I watch the battle incapacitated, the units left on our side is under 10. The units left on there side is under 10. We get to 3 each, companions vs. enemy leaders. My wife is one of the companions, my brother Nogrand is the other. The last companion is a surgeon who somehow made it this far. He dies but not before he throws a perfect javelin and takes one of the enemy commanders. Nogrand and my wife are melee specialists, almost maxed fighting stats with pillaged level 6 weapons. They hold, they wound both the last commanders. 

We take the castle, executing the commanders. But this isn't over. We, 265 wounded, an effective fighting force of 2 with my character health at 1% are about to come under siege from a nearby army. 

The nearby army sets the castle under siege. Hours turn to days, the army of 600 is ready to fight and in the distance I see our last hope. I see the first lord I recruited in my battle against the empire. The lord I spent years chasing as a mercenary, relentlessly beating in battle to gain charm points... he with an army of 400 is charging this way in what looks like a rally to protect his king, his commander, his lord! 

He stops and watches my no save, death on, realistic campaign's final moments. He sits there, watching this enemy army take down our walls with trebs and in the last second... just as they start to storm the gates, my number 2, my favourite lord... just sits there. 

We lose the campaign, we fight to the end and with a valiant last stand my party is killed in battle. It is over, my sons killed, my wife murdered and staring at my 300 hours campaign, satisfied that the next time; i'm going to behead that lord and his entire family the first time we meet. Until next time...

Pros:
1. It has great gameplay, the physics are just right
2. You can conquer all cities through 2 main methods; war and trade (both have their difficulties)
3. They managed to include a variety of troops with their respective upgrades and a significant level of equipment available for the player.
4. There is blacksmithing! You can actually deliver on client orders!

Cons (all communicated to the devs but have not been fixed till today):
1. AI can be really really stupid at times, During sieges of settlement, they just run for ladders instead of using the hard-built siege engines...
2. If you beat a lord in battle and let them go, a day later they come back with a 300+ army to fight again (good luck recruiting good units within a day)
3. For blacksmithing
  3a. You have stamina that only replenishes while you are resting at a town or village - It takes a minimum full day to recover your whole stamina and then you use it very very fast between smelting and crafting.
  3b. You can only craft weapons (excluding bows). So you are unable to craft armor for yourself nor for horses.
4. Workshops - yes you can own several workshops but... they are all Level 1 and you have absolutely no way of increasing or investing into them. This has been the same since the beginning of EA - the only improvements that have been implemented were related to profits, production etc. Be aware that the ""profits/losses"" are haphazard - will change on every play-through.
5. Peace negotiations - Imagine an instance where you have completely decimated an enemy, taken all their land etc. Now your fellow lords argue for peace and lookie here... you are due to pay the enemy tribute for peace...
6. AI warmongering - Seldom the AI loves to just go to war with at least 3 different enemies.  So you will have to face 3 wars from 3 different fronts (Ended up creating own kingdom with as little lords as possible due to this).
7. Multiplayer - For many many months, the multiplayer was subject to constant crashes. Luckily it looks like it was fixed but still 3 out of 10 games tend to crash.

Please note that if you still wish to play this game, you can actually use mods to fix most of the issues (not all) - I myself have used mods to fix the Workshops and Blacksmithing.

When the devs had decided to ""release"" the game officially and take it our of EA, most of us players were trying to understand why... the game was not finished or stable.

Therefore, based on all of this - the game itself is not finished and hence no way recommended at full price.
If you get it at a solid 60-70% discount, then yea - go for it.

IF the devs decide to actually fix all the issues and not rely on modders to do the work for them (and apparently breaking the mods with minor patches), then I will actually revisit the review.",1693988402,1693988402,False,1,0,0.517241418361663818,0,True,False,False

Progress and Setbacks:
Bannerlord makes commendable strides in its mechanics and gameplay. Unfortunately, it's marred by subpar optimization, a flaw that hinders the overall experience.

Less Freedom, More Action:
One of the glaring differences between Warband and Bannerlord is the decrease in player freedom. Bannerlord leans more towards the action side, sacrificing the role-playing elements that made Warband shine. This shift in focus might not resonate with fans of the original.

Missed Opportunities:
While Bannerlord introduces several new features, it could have been a more substantial leap forward. TaleWorlds had the opportunity to blend Warband's mechanics with modern graphics, but instead, they opted for a different approach, one that may disappoint long-time fans.

In conclusion, despite its progress, Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord doesn't quite live up to the legacy of its predecessor, Warband. The game's focus on action over role-playing, combined with performance issues, may deter some players. If you're a die-hard Warband fan, you might find Bannerlord lacking. I would have preferred to see the beloved Warband enriched with Bannerlord's mechanics and graphics. Overall, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, especially if you're looking for a worthy successor to the original.

Devs should just start hiring more modders.

Late 2022. This game already has some great mods out for it; however no matter how you mod it you still can't  correct the absolutely dumb AI, the battles AI is really bad, the main game AI is worse. 

The things that piss me off  are:
The AI going to war when it already is involved in two wars.
Not defending the territory it already has 
An army ignoring an enemy army besieging a town or castle to go take a castle.
No armies spawned even though at war or spawning an army and not using it.

This game could have been so great. Maybe in a couple of years when modders have figured out how to fix the AI  behavior. 

Late 2023 I'm done, this game has had minor tweaks but so what, it's boring and will never be fixed because the AI was broken from the outset. Lack of content too. Just boring

I say ""managed"", not because it wasn't enjoyable or I didn't want to put in more (I do), but because there are game-breaking bugs in MBII with no fix that date back to it's launch. Seriously. 

First 29 hours went really smooth and were a lot of fun. I started off playing on normal because this is my first time ever playing a game like this and I just wanted to enjoy the battles without having to worry too much about politics/economy. My plan was to complete a playthrough like that, and then either turn the difficulty up and run again or do the campaign while only having one life. 

But around hour 30 I got the D3D crash. I updated my graphics drivers, restarted my PC and got another couple hours out of the game until it happened again. I'm not tech savvy at all, so I searched Steam forums, the developer forums and a handful of other websites looking for a fix. All I found was hundreds of posts regarding this exact crash dating back to 2020. They have a ""workaround fix"" that involves you changing your virtual memory pagefile minimum and maximum sizes (whatever that means), but it didn't work for me. That's the only thing the developers themselves have offered anyone everywhere I have looked.

I've tried everything I can think of outside of that and have tried the hefty majority of attempted fixes other people with this problem have tried, but to no avail.

It's a shame honestly, the game is awesome and I think may have opened the door to me playing more games like this, but everywhere I look it seems there is no other game quite like this. I'd like to say I'm holding out for a fix eventually, but I just don't have a lot of hope for a bug that came out on launch 3 years ago to all of a sudden be fixed.

This game is bonkers. In a lot of ways. It will make you hurt and it will make you scream at the computer, it will make you smile and it will make you seethe. 

First thing I have to say about this is the combat. It's simple, but it really works. If I could I'd enable a friendly fire mode where half the damage is dealt in friendly fire, but that ain't important. 

Mods. All of them. Just mod the fucking shit out of this game. It's so much more than 60 dollars if you do. 

One of my problems with this game is just that it's not very deep. I wish lords would have more memorable personalities (Yes, there's some basic traits, but they aren't that deep) and maybe more immersive stuff like taverns, getting your own place to live, enjoying Calradian scenery, and other quality of life changes.

Combat is still good, you are no longer a god of death on the battlefield and rely much more on your troops who are also more fragile now. There is a heavy emphasis on keeping a balanced army, that being all troop types and also a mix of eliteness.

The other stuff though, is wide but shallow. And some mechanics are straight up worse (getting lords to join you, right to rule is gone, companions are flat, and some more).

The development progress in this game is unbelievably slow, developers even undo decent features such as the party screen formation assignment and replace it with new impractial mechanics. The game's animations are trash, and the ai is stupid.

The game is in an unenjoyable state in its current vanilla form therefore using mods is encouraged but not supported. What I mean by that is, they consistantly keep  releasing minor ""updates"" causing half to get outdated, and some to die out. Players have to spend considerable time to figure out whats crashing the game after each and every single update and these crashes aren't even always the consequenses of outdated mods or player installation, they somehow incredibly break the game with new add-ons...

Like I said the game becomes boring after a couple hours because there simply isn't anything else to do other than battles and sieges. Unlike what the game's description says, its safe to say, there are no real RPG features..

I've played for rougly 650 hours solely thanks to mods but after I've been faced with all these stressful unacceptable non-ending issues, I QUIT!

[1.8.1 Update]: THEY DID IT.
Captain matchmaking multiplayer is still broken, but the release of the dedicated server files means this is now circumvented. Alas, there are an enormous amount of unhandled crashes for the server, but ultimately, we're in a better place now than we have been since 1.7.2

[1.7.2 Hotfix and Beta Patch Update]:  Still don't bother.
Single Player is _slowly_ getting some decent content. But still no where near a decent game. It's like playing a game your mate sent you that he plans to finish _one day_...
Multiplayer:
- Captain: Find a game? 20% you'll actually play that game. Otherwise, return to lobby and wait again.
- Skirmish: Find a game? 40% you'll actually play that game. Otherwise, return to lobby and wait again.
- Team Deathmatch: About the only playable game mode. 
- Settings: Default FPS is at 700 for some weird reason. Be sure to change that else your rig is going to fly into the sun. Courtesy of TaleWorlds.

[1.7.2 Update]
Single Player is a screen tear fest
Multiplayer:
- Captain: Can't even play
- Skirmish: Can't even play
- Team Deathmatch: Unfathomable screen tear
- Battle/ Custom Game: Crashes

[Old Point]
But bloody hell the Devs are doing terribly on the early access front.
- Single player is an amalgamation of unfinished content
- Multiplayer is a travesty with crashes, lag, disconnection and horrible vote-kick systems

It's fun. Don't get me wrong. But it's going really badly.

However, I think there are a few areas where the game could be improved. First, the trading and politics systems are not as detailed or deep as they could be. Second, the side quests could be a bit more complex.

Overall, I think Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord is a great game that is sure to provide hours of entertainment. However, there are a few areas where the game could be improved to make it even better.

Here are some specific suggestions for improvement:

Improve the trading and politics systems: The trading system could be made more complex by adding more goods and trade routes. The politics system could be made more in-depth by adding more factions and political options.
Make the side quests more complex: The side quests could be made more challenging and rewarding by adding more choices and consequences.

I think these changes would make Mount & Blade 2 Bannerlord an even better game.",1693576432,1693576432,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Honestly, with mods for armor/factions/features, it's some of the most fun you can have in medieval combat. It has a slow start and combat can initially be awkward but it quickly becomes second nature and you'll go from commanding 10 soldiers to 200+. Eventually you'll be mounting cavalry charges against peasants and scaling castle walls while being pelted with arrows. After that you'll watch as your sons, daughters, and bastards grow into fine generals or lackluster governors. You'll make allies and enemies and decide between war or more war.

-Campaign AI is dysfunctional
-Economy is brainless, most items are worthless and some are still bugged with ridiculous prices
-Smithing feels unfinished (like everything else in this game)

-GUTTED mod support. Every now and then they release a worthless update that adds one helmet and some feature nobody asked for that is completely incompatible with mods. Instead of spending 1-2 years overhauling the game to fix it they decide to kick the modding community in the nuts for some reason?

I have been playing it for hundreds of hours, loved it.

It's just that you start of as a common citizen, then you make your way up in a way you want to.
You want to serve lords and make good relationships with them, you want to become rouge and steal from villages, everything is in your hands.

I don't see plenty of ""changes"" from first MnB. Diplomacy is still weak, you can only declare wars on Kingdoms.
There is no option to improve relationships or to form an alliance or something...
I would love to see more diplomacy options.
You can't order around your lords, you can appoint them to a quest, but you will have to go to that quest and then assign someone.
There isn't options like ""go patrol around castle"", and if I remember correctly that options was available in first MnB.

When you have a Kingdom, like I do (have around 80% of map under my control) it gets really hard to keep everything up.

And when you have too many lords, they are making decisions, cuz you will need infinitive amount of influence to overthought their decision.
So, there is, at least from my point of view, a lot room for improvement regarding management. Lords, kingdoms, castles, towns etc...

From battle perspective, it's the greatest.
The way you swing your sword and the way how enemies die when you strike them....uuuu, chilling.
When you have a 2000 army and you are fighting against 2000, you can feel the fight.

I recommend this game, it will give you plenty fun playing hours.
But at some point game becomes repetitive, you are doing exact same things and hoping to conquer everything.

Tip for players, when you are seaging town or castle and you win, keep all forces and prisoners (even if they go over your limit), cuz you have won the town or castle, and you can leave rest of soldiers and prisoners as soon as fight is over.

P.S. Don't you ever try to become ""scary king"" by executing every lord that you capture. Result will be: no one fears you and no one loves you. I was hoping that I could make everyone fear me, but no. There is no such options.
So I am not sure what does execution does, except that lord dies and everyone starts to hate you.

Hopefully I will succeed in conquering every town and castle there is.
For now, south, east, center is conquered. Only north and west remains.

And there is too many rebels when you have a huge kingdom. I would like to execute one rebellion leader so the rest of them will s*it their crossbows. 

Overall, you have to play this game!!!

Pros:
-World simulation, the world feels alive and functions without a player. in real time you can see battles won, sieges failed, caravans, lords and armies.
-Trade system is pretty cool, different prices and such. you can travel from the frigid cold north with 50 cheap fish and sell them in the arid hot south west for a decent profit and i find that awesome.
-craft your own story and meaning. your given a main quest but it's like skyrim, you pretty much ignore it until you actually want to start it.
-Butter lord, if ya know ya know

Neutral:
-Combat. the only reason this is here is for beginners, it wasn't hard to pick up for me but I also came from KCD (Kingdom Come Deliverance) at the time. so i'm not a great source for combat difficulty.
-Menus. menus specifically for characters are a touch difficult to find and/or world information, it's not horrible in the slightest but ease of use can be a lil difficult. 
-Battle information. I wear glasses and the font is super small, completely understandable for neatness of UI tho.

Pitfalls:
-Quite honestly can't think of any except maybe a once in awhile bug or very minor things.

overall verdict:
If you want a game to lose time in and immerse yourself in it's awesome. I especially recommend it if you want to like grand strategy games but not enough happens to have fun. you either find trouble or trouble will find you.

I love this game, I know it inside and out, played Warband a lot as well, but it just doesn't interest me for a couple basic reasons and I will tell you why;

-Personally I have no interest in Caladria, its factions or lore. Given how period accurate to the medieval era they try to keep it, I just really wished they would hire a small history team(there is tons of precedent and easily accessible resources out there already) and just try to recreate the world or even Europe to surrounding Mediterranean world as accurately as possible. Some modders are doing a decent job of this already albeit with a limited scope.

-Once the real-world map is established this game would be so immersive if there were actual fleshed out character relations/interactions/diplomacy, that of course extends to proper faction diplomacy and geo-political consideration based upon historical realities. Currently it is inexcusable that the character/political/diplomatic flavor is so lacking.

They could take this game, flesh it out a bit, make it relatable and create a series that is based upon different periods in history and it would have so much more potential than a fictional world with flat fictional characters.",1693239604,1693239604,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Perhaps new players will get turned away by Warbands admitedly very dated graphics, however mods can fix it. If you can't get over that, then ofcourse play Bannerlord.

without any objection, after a couple days I formed a rebel against Derthert and he had no money, no influence to fight me (using Diplomacy Mod), and since all faction can't have a beef with the rebel so you're safe and left Derthert to his pain and agony. Then capture his city and the kingdom is over. 

Fun fact, later on I recruited him and some of his old vassals back and they sworn to protect my kingdom against all odds. But Derthert officially is one of the greatest vassal in my Kingdom.

It can be a girl, who built her fortune in trade and now produces 70% of all ale on the continent or a tale of a brave general, who gained the trust and respect of a kingdom's royalty and nobility and leads the vast armies in the name of the king himself. It can even be a tale of a cunning usurper, who betrays his liege lord and siezes his lands and then perhaps even becomes king himself and leads the new realm to expansion and prosperity.... or plunges it into darkness.

Looks like and pretty much is a Warband refresh with a bit more content and tweaked (but not improved) engine, but still seems kinda unfinished to me right now. 
Not sure what to expect from the game in the current state.

Enemy AI still bandwagon's you and keeps chasing you and just you. Ignoring the 50 troops behind their back just to attack you.
Apart from duels you just have the same 50 vs 1 issue in fights just like most of the players hated about Warband and the previous games.


Issues from Warband/Previous Games:

- The whole dumb AI in fights, just as in all Mount & Blade Games before
- Have to chase AI across the map to fight
- Very limited options to create your own kingdom
- 10+ Mods are essential to fix/improve stuff the devs apparently can't or don't bother with
- Performance is alright yet could be a lot better because this game doesn't seem that demanding, actually rather poor for a game in development that long
- Music is mostly the same asin Warband, but mixed (worse) different.
- Just doesn't feel refreshing, feels like an actual Mount & Blade Warband mod that has been in the works for years. Definitely doesn't feel like a new (better) game


Please guys, if you enjoyed all M&B games, just wait another probably 2+ years or so until the devs really ""finished"" the game to one state you can consider it refreshing.
I wish the devs would actually make the game aside from the combat better and offer a real option to create and advance land you own.

It has the incredible potential and more or less manage to mix RPG, strategy and political warfare.

Unfortunatly nothing goes in deph, not a single feature is exploited to provide to the player the best experience.
The game does many things and you will be amased at first, it does so much than most games that it's refreshing.
But all these activities don't transform in greatness, they transform into repetitivness and shalowness.

For several reason... 
The game hasn't any proper narration, while forcing the player into several fedex quest for the majority of the early game.
The games doesn't provide personality to the different mains characters, that could build stories or goal to the player.
While the game offer background to orient your character, it doesn't offer variety of starting situation and scenario.
Despite the whole sheet and stats, skill etc, everybody will play mostly the same and finish the same.
The game has no scenario or lategame challenge, once you conquered 2-3 towns and created your kingdoms, you basically finished the content and will just repeat the same thing.

It's a RPG sandbox game that unfortunatly  lean/rely way too much and the sandbox aspect while not providing so much deph to it and also forget his whole RPG counterpart making our gaming hope falling down rather quick.
I suggest to play the game Campaign first to get used to it, but quickly go for a Sandbox playthough in Max difficulty with mods once you understood the basics.

Campaign mode is the only version of single player that you can earn achievements on, Sandbox is completely locked (for no reason) there is nothing in sandbox that gives you any advantage towards achievements than on Campaign and the only reason we don't play Campaign is because of the Conspirator Caravan crap that you refuse to take out of the game.

So then you have to turn to mods, 90% of them don't work. and because the popularity of this game has nosedived the mods that do work do not get updated, and again just with Sandbox you cant earn achievements with Mods, and the ""Mods Enabler"" mod has to be installed through a different method than all of your other mods which will basically always result in a crash or the game just not working.

How do you fix this? there are many ways.

1. Get rid of the Conspirator stuff in Campaign, just let us kill the NPC in charge of it or remove the feature as a whole
2. Enable achievements on Sandbox
3. Actually optimise your game to work with mods

Updates!...... There are none
weather updates! new scenes!... Who cares! there are literally features available in Warband (A Game made in 2010) that
Bannerlord still to this day does not posses how?? its basically a copy and paste yet you somehow have less features??

If your a fan of the previous M&B versions then you should love this one, just as much if not more ! One main difference from the others is that in the previous Titles if you got used to the game play it was possible too wipe out hundreds of enemies with just your character alone. That little perk(cheat) has pretty much been fixed, making for a more realistic outcome to battles and a better overall experience. A lot of people think M&B is just another game with out dated graphics and  slow, clunky game play but, I couldn't disagree more. The game play is unique and slower than most unrealistic action games but I think this just adds something special and more realistic to it than most similar PC games. The slower game play and nostalgic graphics just work and or flow together seamlessly to give you a uniquely personal, in the moment, experience that seems to actually put you in the action. With a good, rich story line and countless possibilities on your travels, the games replay value is endless. This just makes the all ready reasonable price tag an even better deal. Especially with all the subscription, pay to play, overpriced DLC ridden games of today. The Dev's are very active and put out a fair amount of updates frequently. As of now I give M&B Bannerlord a high 8 / 10 and they just continue to add to that score!

You can't modify your army in any effective way and even 'preferred placement' is more of a suggestion than order. examples, you can't make a unit of crossbows and another of archers, if you want throwers in one unit and fodder in another there's no way to assign them into one or the other (there used to be though but it was patched out).
Overworld army/party movement is dumb in every sense of the word. Your 10 man party operates the same as a 1000 man army; you don't interact with other groups unless physically contacting them, armies don't need time to rest and can march without end, The visual size of the armies don't make sense either.
Travel is based on shortest (not fastest) path and doesn't allow waypoints. More often than not you have to micromanage your party to avoid forest or they'll add days to the travel. For whatever reason there are also no roads made on this continent that's built dozens of castles and towns but hasn't laid out a single road for trade or travel.
The campaign implies you're the 'chosen one' to bring the nations of the continent together under your banner, but you're forced to follow another nation's customs instead of inventing your own-which is a lesser gripe but still doesn't track with the whole ""I'm doing my own thing"" option.
You can't add multiple quests of the same job from different towns, which makes zero sense. If one guy needs x number of bandits killed, another guy with the same problem can't be helped until I finish that. Same goes with clearing bandit camps; why would one of them prefer not to ask me to do something for them because I'm already doing it and how did they know what quests I have?
Some castles and towns have the same layout and surroundings. The artillery has almost no range because of how small the siege maps are made-often cant hit enemy towers if they were put on the far flanks. Siege battles seem very bland in general and offer no real customization.

tl;dr. It's just not immersive enough for an 'open world/sandbox' style game, or intuitive for an army campaign rts, or customizable for a medieval diplomatic 4X. It's essentially a template for modders.",1586706765,1692579839,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Smithing feels like a chore, Khuzaits are OP and will mongol you and your armies, fortunately they can't siege for S*** because they are horse unit favouring.

Basically, looked around on the forums, because you need to search up a lot of info because the game doesn't like to tell you if your doing something wrong, smithing is cool and fun, but it is op, you can get 85k for a sword, but your fiefdom will only generate 2k a day. Anyway besides the point, was looking around on the forums, and the development team is a toxic mess, few guys lodged a complaint who were members from 2012 with 4,800 posts so they must have been active, he posted that the modders are the one saving the game from the devs and they did not like that one bit so they banned him, development team is toxic, lazy, and could not give a s*** about the game at all.

The fact it is programmed in a lazy language such as C# which has the same syntax as C++ ( a proper language for this stuff) but more like Java, and it shows. Game stutters and creeks like a nightmare, feels like i am playing a unity game, probably is since unity accepts only C#. Besides the point, for the past year and a half the game is in the same shape as it was when i bought it, they said they introduced new stuff, but i don't see it anywhere, i see that Khuzait are op and kill everything except sieges and that ai in battles are much harder, but nothing has changed. Can't blame it on the Chinese flu since everyone works from home which was found to be more efficient.

You know when you play a game, and you make all the money you could ever want and you get bored and stop doing adventures because you don't need any money which was the ambition? I believe the same happened to the company who made this mess of a medieval fantasy simulator, they have it all, what? 5m sales X £39.99 = £200,000,000 - standard corporate tax rate of 21% = £156,000,000, yeah, when companies have what they want they can not give a crap about the product afterward, they probably update the game through a cheap indian sweathouse while they enjoy the money people paid them.

The game is fun, until you spend like 200 hours in the game and realise Jesus f***, i wasted all of that time playing a broken game that is neglected. Enough ranting, should you buy the game? Nah, you will get frustrated at the game and annoyed at how abandoned it is, the fan boys will tell you that there are regular updates, sure, regular updates of 5 minutes work a month, people are programming minecraft in a day or going really hard at it and other projects and these people roll out a few fixes a month which are nothing more than number changes or a few extra lines of code.

Don't waste your money or your time on this game, hell don't waste your time reading this review, but it is too late for that one :)

Savaş mekaniklerinin tamamına yakını tatmin edici ve eğlenceli ; lordlar, yoldaşlar ve eşraflarla etkileşimler çok sınırlı ve birçok diyalog menüsü hala boş. Oyun içerisindeki öğeler arasında etkinlik dengesizliği var (demircilik). Optimizasyon giderek iyileşse de hala eksik. Erken ve en geç aşamalarda oyunu temposu çok yavaşlıyor ve bazı durumlarda nasıl oynamaya devam etmeniz gerektiğini anlayamıyorsunuz. Yetenek ağacındaki açıklamaların bir kısmı anlaşılır değil veya eksik. Lord ikna etme ve klanları krallığınza alma sistemi bence tamamıyla rezalet. Ekonomik anlamda oyunun bazı dönemleri çok zorken harici durumlarda da paranıza bakmıyorsunuz bile. Şehirlerdeki refah güvenlik vb değerleri kontrol etmek ve nasıl değiştiğini anlayabilmek için çokça farklı kaynaklara bakmanız gerekiyor. Optimizasyondan bahsetmiş olsam da menülerdeki yavaşlıktan ayrıca bahsetmek istiyorum. Eşya veya birimlerinizin görselleri yüklenene kadar menüde hiçbir şekilde hareket edemiyorsunuz ve bu bazen can sıkıcı olabiliyor. Bununla ilgili menülerde eşya veya birimlerin görsellerini görmemek için bir ayar olsa benimki gibi oyun için orta veya belkide birazcık daha aşağı sistemler için çok iyi olurdu. Sistemi kuvvetli oyuncular için görseller ve animasyonlar çok güzel. Oyunda sıkça bulunan yükleme ekranlarındaki görseller bile gayet güzel çizilmişler ve insanın tahammül etmesini kolaylaştırıyor. Bütün olası diyaloglar sizin ilgili kişiye gitmenizle kurulabiliyor Warband'de ki gibi bazı lordların kendi istekleriyle size katılmaları, ziyafetler, konuşmaların sonunda bazen sizi tutup yoldaşlarınızdan birini rica etmeleri gibi size yöneltilen diyaloglar bu oyunda hiç yok ben artarak bulunmasını umuyordum. Servetinizi arttırdığınızda bunun oyununuza çok fazla etki ettiğini hissedemiyorsunuz ve tüccar olarak oynarken alım satım yapmak bir kademeden sonra etkili olmuyor veya yapmanıza ihtiyaç olmuyor ve oyununuzun o seviyesine geldikten sonra oyun stilinizi değiştirmeniz imkansız. Belki çok daha pahalı ve bir tık daha kaliteli paralı askerler veya daha geniş paralı asker klanları olsa paranın değeri arttırlabilirdi tabii ki dengeyi kaçırmamak kaydıyla. Yine çok yüksek fiyatlara bir tık daha kaliteli şaşalı zırhlar olmasını da isterdim. Atletizm ve biniciliğe verilen odak puanları yeterli verimi vermiyormuş gibi hissediyorum ya da bu yetenekleri arttırması biraz daha zorlu. İnfaz durumunda ilişki cezası çok çok fazla ve sadece yakın ailesiyle de değil en nihayetinde bir savaş durumu söz konusu tabii ki o dönemki savaş ahlakı tutsak alıp yeterli fidyeye serbest bırakmayı gerektirir ama infaz etmek de o kadar büyük bir mesele olmamalı. Öyleyse bile onuru azaltırken en azından nam kazandırmalı. Bu durum özellikle hükümdar infazlarında çok daha belirgin. ''Kral katili'' gibi dehşetli bir sıfatı edindiğinizde biraz nam kazanmalısınız. Yine daha önce söylediğim gibi buralarda da ilişki cezaları daha az veya sadece birinci dereceden ailesiyle olmalı. Düşman hükumdarını yakalayıp da serbest bırakmanın pek akılcı bir şey olduğunu düşünmüyorum. Politikialar ve krallık sekmesi biraz daha zenginleştirilebilir. Fakat genel olarak paranıza hayli hayli değecek ve çok keyifli bir oyun.

Yapay zekanın kesinlikle geliştirilmesi ve partilerin harita üzerindeki aksiyonlarının iyileştirilmesi gerekli. Özellikle oyunun orta-ileri aşamalarına geldiğinizde düşman krallıkların yapay zekası çok çok zayıf kalıyor ve oyun sadece angarya oradan oraya gidip kolayca kaleleri ve şehirleri ele geçirmeye dönüşüyor. Yukarıda bahsettiğim eksikliklerin giderilmesi, anlamlı olmasa da rol yapma için gerekli ve teşvik edici olan rastgele birimlerle (köylüler, şehirlerdeki muhafızlar vb) daha fazla diyalog eklenmesi, iç mekanların keşfedilmesi için teşvik edici etkileşimler eklenmesi oyunu çok güzel cilalayacaktır fakat oyunun en net erken erişiminden beridir bulunan problemi olan diplomasi sorunun kesinlikle çözülmesi lazım. Seriyi çok sevdiğim ve bu oyun tipi favorim olduğu için oyunu erken erişime açıldığı günden bugüne kesintisiz olarak oynuyorum ancak büyük bir kitlenin oyundan çok hızlıca soğuyup neden geri dönmediğindeki ana sebep bu diplomasi meselesi. Bütün diyarın açık ara en güçlü krallığı ard arda bütün düşmanlarından şehir ve kalelerini alır, köylerini yağmalar ve soylularını tutsak ederken diğer krallıkların size karşı birleşmiyor oluşu gerçekten akıl alır gibi değil. Savaş açtıklarında da çok cüzi bir nüfuz ve oyunun o aşamalarında hiçbir anlam ifade etmeyen 8000-10000 dinar arası günlük ödemeyle sizle barış yapmayı kabul etmeleri gerçekten çok saçma. Geliştiricilerin bu noktada oyuna olan tutkularını yitirdiklerini düşünüyorum açıkçası ve bu noktadan sonra bahsettiğim problemlerin düzeleceğini sanmıyorum. Oyun yine de başarılı ve oynamaya karar verirseniz en azından 60+ saat boyunca eğleneceğinizi düşünüyorum ancak devamı için geliştirici firma ne yazık ki bir şey yapmıyor. Bu eksikliklerin modculara bırakılmış olması da direkt bunları düzeltmeyeceklerini söylemelerinden bile aşağılık bence. Ben ve benim gibi birçok kişi bu tarz oyunlarda oyunun organikliğini bozan modları kullanmayı sevmiyoruz. Yine de oyun sizi mecbur bıraktığı için bazı elzem modları kullansanız da yüzlerce(?) çalışanı olan devasa bir oyun firması Taleworlds firmasının bu problemleri üç beş kişilik ekipler halinde çalışan ve bundan para kazanmayan yine kendileri de çoğu zaman sadece oyuncu olan kişilere bırakması çok üzücü.",1586245295,1692530604,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

Bug list:

Required to pay troops in Castle's that are no longer yours. (Fixed?)

Ranged Calvary only parties are overpowered and need to be nerfed.

Edit for 1.05:

Complaints:

Dragon Banner needs a buff, it is the central story line of the campaign so a buff would make sense.

Ranged Calvary only parties are still slightly overpowered but I usually just use mods like RBM to balance it out.

Game may have random crashes and freezes whenever in a troop or character screen changing values.

Sometimes in Vanilla sieges when climbing over the walls the enemy troops will all push each other to block the ladder then push you right back off, usually resulting in a quiet dissatisfying death, when this happens it almost makes it impossible to get over the wall all together.

When Delegate command is active while 2 separate parties/armies are on the field as allies, in some occasions the other party will do the complete opposite strategy as your troops (This may have to do with different strategy values on commanders) . When this happens the game forces you to micromanage your troops or face the enemy alone, this is very frustrating.

During a vanilla siege, if you order your troops that are assigned to a siege device (such as a ram) to change they're formation or if you temporarily disable delegate command for those troops, they will entirely ignore trying to enter the castle once the siege device has succeeded, instead they will stand there and do nothing until a full retreat or charge is called; and when they are ordered to charge they will ignore the said siege device and instead relocate to another opening or ladder regardless of the siege device's success.

During some sieges or complicated village settings, troop navigation will be entirely botched and require micromanagement.

Armies and Parties commonly get stuck moving back and forth to an enemy party regardless of they're advantage/disadvantage repeatedly until another event provokes said party.

In some occasions, armies will not commence a siege battle until they have starved themselves or another event provokes the army into starting one, regardless of they're advantage. Usually resulting in large armies besieging loosely defended castles/towns for ridiculous periods of time.

Not really a bug, but it would be nice if shields got some sort of realistic feel to them, instead of feeling like your hitting an invincible wall and rebounding; it would be nice if they actually acted corresponding to the material of the shield.

Between the main story mission where you retrieve phases from a bandits den and the training course mission there is a strange dead period where you are left pondering what to do and unsure if the game even works, it would be nice for your companion or some other factor inform you of the coming events or what to expect in later game play.

Visually: Bannerlord is leaps and bounds more advanced graphically compared to its predecessor. To begin with all characters have had a much needed face lift. Textures have been brought into this generation of graphics and models overall look much cleaners with less noticeable edges. Keep in mind Bannerlord and all Mount & Blade games for that matter are very  mechanically driven games and as such the graphics won't compete with the cutting edges games out there to date. 

Gameplay Mechanics: Although still in early access Bannerlord has improved on the base mechanics that players of Mount & Blade games expect. Sieges for one have been completely overhauled breathing much more life into a base level mechanic from Warband. Another mechanic that has seen a large improvement and will undoubtedly see more improvements in the future are the quests. Bannerlord has a moderate pool of quests that the player can run through to gain favor, honor and currency from a number of notable figures within the villages and cities. That brings me to my next mechanic. Recruitment has undergone a complete make over. Gone are the days of mass recruiting 10s of villagers just because you had a high CHR stat. Now a more reasonable and realistic mechanic has taken its place. In order to recruit from villages and cities and have access to their entire pool of recruits, you need to build their trust. As of now like previously mentioned this is done through completing quests for them.

Audio: The audio within Bannerlord is a noticeable improvement over Warband. The most prominent sound effects that players will most likely pick up on are the hooves of mounts. They now have weight to them on top of having a number of sounds depending on the terrain you are currently walking on. Battle audio has also had love placed into it as the shield, weapon and armor SFX also stand at higher fidelities. 

Overall: Bannerlord is a very well put together game. and with daily hot fixes TaleWorlds is ensuring that it is brought to a stable place before proceeding with the implementation of new features which I can appreciate. The only thing lacking which will be implemented in the future I can only presume is diplomacy. In its current state Bannerlord does lack the diplomacy with other factions that Warband had. Going forward however I see a more in depth system taking its place based on the other facets of the came that are currently built.

I like small changes like holding down ALT to easily view characters in settlement, that is the kind of chore reducing gameplay i was looking for. however, after about 20 hours (my brother does the rest) there is so much micromanaging, and many aspects of the game feel like a chore. In Warband, training was as simple as ranking up your training skill -  now there are different perks across different fields that give small boots to this.

Already using several Mods, and its now even better.

Seeing that there is already a Warhammer Mod incoming, a GoT Mod, Medieval Mods, etc. and many more and better Mods than there were ever in Warband, beside Full Overhauls like Perisno or PoP.

My Guess is, the most People pissed off, blindly believe in Promotion Ads and Marketing; never ever played Warband or were a Fan of it anyways.
They seem to have expected something different than Warband, although the Title of the Game alone is ""MOUNT AND BLADE 2"", giving already out what you get out of it.

The game has sat unchanged, there is no real mod support yet. The multiplayer is boring and near dead, Clan and Role play events are the only things that keep the MP going.

The campaign aka 90% of the Devs effort is a one-trick pony. Once you've played a 100-hour play though it won't ever be as interesting as it was when you first played. 

Strongly don't recommend it at this point in 2023. If you were going to buy BannerLord then you should have when it was fresh and new back in 2018 or 2019.

Then, all the lords from that kingdom that I've captured get released and the other kingdom will spend some time recovering, then declare war on us while I'm across the map trying to get rid of another enemy.

Original thoughts:
Look. I love the concept but the series has barley progressed since Warband.
The game feels extremely similar, all features in the game feel unpolished, the go from bad to passable. Democracy and Party management are unpolished, the income/expenses list will easily get bloated and the details pop up will expand to be bigger than the screen with no scroll so it's useless.

The main quest objectives are still buggy and when you get to the third step you will find some objectives don't get marked as done, so you google it and realize you can fix it by leaving and joining a new kingdom. So then you get a new quest that will just time out and there is no way to pass it as of yet...etc etc
AND THAT'S the Main quest! 

Everything else is also bad, shopping is bad, democracy and managing you kingdom barley works and the features are badly explained. Managing your own faction in the vanilla game is horrible and you can't even set up to run half as efficient as the AI. (this can be improved by some mods)

The only thing that makes this game playable are the mods, without them you would go crazy. Still, I wish the game was polished and felt modern because mods only get you so far and I can't recommend getting this unless you are a super hard core fan, and then you probably have more fun with your modded Warband.",1605770559,1692036187,False,5,0,0.519767582416534424,0,True,False,True

However, for the thought that they are patching still this game and will eventually fix it, i will not give a negative review. Firstly, I want to talk about things that bother me:


• Castles in this game literally don't do anything and are useless. They do not patrol around the villages attached to them. Whenever you're at war with faction(s), the enemy lords raid your villages attached to your castle and your castle doesn't even care about defending your villages. All they do is exist.. to do nothing. And it's really annoying, like which one I will prioritize? Saving my villages from raids of my enemies or attacking enemy factions?


• Diplomacy doesn't exist in this game at all. It doesn't depend on kingdom strength or anything, it is completely RNG. The game wants you to establish a kingdom but how can you do that when everyone randomly declares war on you? I had to play as a clan (Hopefully they don't declare war on you if you are a clan) for a very long time until I was able to withstand against them. However I failed the quest to create a kingdom due to time limit all because of this stupidity.


When you're at war with a faction, although you caused more casualties than them, captured all their fiefs, they don't give up. Always you HAVE to propose peace and if you do, you still have to pay tributes to them. 

Come on man like why.


• Although I like the battle system, it lacks features. For example, when you fight an enemy, they either create a shield wall and wait for you to attack or charge at you. You can create a lot of formations such as circle, skein, square, loose but they don't do that.


• I still don't understand why there's a Kingdom Council in this game if I am gonna eventually say the last word. Even if everyone in the kingdom is against the ""A"" decision, I can still enact it. It would be nice if there were limitations for my ability to enact or veto anything.


These are what this game lacks. However I believe they will make this game better no matter what. Now let's talk about what it is fun to do:


• Combat system is great and fun. There's decent amount of armor and weapon and they're cool. You can also download mods for more!

• There are decent amount of quests, although I wish there was more. Some of them are fun to complete. 

• Hideouts are also great and it's my fav thing to do in the game. Even if I'm in the end game section, it's still fun to do!

• Game's soundtrack is great, fits the medieval times.

• You can visit your fiefs and talk to people and clear gangs in your city or become a gangster. Also you can sit on the throne at your settlements.

• There's arena section where you get cool rewards if you win. It's super fun. Arena's very useful in the beginning of the game btw.

And more. 



To sum it up, buy it when it's on sale. Despite the important features it lacks, i believe they will be added and fixed eventually. (By the way, through mods, you can add the features I mentioned that this game lacks.) It's fun and I think you'll enjoy it.

If you're familiar at all with what this game is attempting to offer, it's a very unique blend of strategy and real-time combat. This company took an engine that they had been building for over a decade and said ""Naw this is too clunky,"" and rebuilt it from the ground up. The result is what you see before you.

Fights are more kinetic, the action is spicier, and the interactions have (relatively) more depth. The AI can think more actively but still stumbles on its face a good 40% of the time, which is a huge improvement over the 80% we got last game. There are also systems rebuilt to be fairer to the player, including a more comprehensive recruitment system and a (rudimentary) vassal voting system. So now when an enemy lord is defeated, they wont respawn with 60+ troops in one of their cities! The player can actually (vaguely) follow what's happening in the realm! (Yay!)

I'll give this game some sass, but I still think that this is leagues above the last game in terms of ambition and potential. It's no easy feat to create a game world that feels alive and breathing, and TaleWorlds is inching ever so closer with every few years of development. Maybe within another decade we'll have a game I feel compelled to complete? Nah, probably not.

I entered into this world with bright eyes, hopes and dreams, etc. I was in awe of all these new factions, mechanics, and all these new quest givers. But lying underneath this veneer of bakery freshness was my old lake monster nemesis: grinding. Everything is a number that needs to go up, which is good because it's never felt better to make the numbers go up. It's also bad because you get to the midpoint of the game and you realize the content just stops...

There are a lot more resources to get you going now. It feels like getting to the point of vassalage is a bit easier. But once you're there, it seems like things just sort of end. You run out of leavers to pull. You talk to your fellow vassals and there are only a couple options when I should have some way to influence things. I should have a reason to interact. I should have ways of subverting, obfuscating, challenging, persuading... But I don't. I have a barter menu that's new and shiny, but ultimately worthless.

And like so many before it, the moment I feel compelled to cheat is the moment the magic gets sucked out of the jar. Mount and Blade has always thrived on the creativity of modders to fill in that gap where the magic should be. Fingers crossed that this gets the same love and attention that its previous iteration did, and if that's the case then it will be a feast indeed. As for what's here now, it's good. Enough to hold my attention, to make me want to make numbers go up for a good while. But enough to make me complete this main quest? No. I got closer than ever though. This time I got a couple of cities and castle fiefs before quitting instead of just one.

I used a mix of settings between standard and realistic to up the difficulty mid way through the game, then applied a few QoL mods to improve the gameplay into late game, and tried a few item mods that were supposedly lore friendly, but didn't add much value short of a variety of looks for the player and his party that did NOT extend to the NPCs so the world was still quite repetitive by region. 

I had 4 play through's, the first 3 to learn game dynamics, what's changed from M&B 1, and how to exploit game systems to my advantage to create my own Kingdom. 

As you'll see on many other comments and reviews, After kingdom stabilization there's not a lot more game play other than color painting the map little by little as kingdom battles ebb and flow. 

The game is fun, no doubt, but if you're a completionist and going to the very bitter end is your thing without easy difficulty, you're going to get bored for the last 3/4s of the game. 

The game has a lot of dynamics that create a difficult early game, mid game and early late game crawl, however once you master those dynamics, the random event counters are EXTREMELY low, with rebellion and other factors mostly preventable, and tribute surrenders and easy system to exploit in your favor give the amount of cash you were able to amass, and how low you conquered a kingdom which was in decline. 

Mods Used:
Diplomacy - wanted to gain and maintain and ally, but got too powerful, too quickly so never got to leverage that feature.
Dismemberment mod - realism

Hours of chopping off heads and skewering enemies on a lance and I've barely scratched the surface of the SP game. 

 It's much better than Warband in many ways: 
1. Progress system is much more detailed and longer
2. Story and people are more interesting
3. Fighting is harder, persuasion is more intricate
4. Trading and exploring are actually worth it
5. Better graphics, more to do overall.


Warband is fun, and I spent countless hours on it. Bannerlord is just better at most of what Warband did. Go to a tavern and chat with the locals to find trading tips and who to trust. Do various missions: help gang leaders sell stolen goods, help villagers carry their products, assist lords to remove poachers.

However, this is not a fully fleshed out sequel to Warband; it is an unfinished, albeit fun, sandbox with quite a few missing features and poorly designed mechanics. 

This game is without proper flavor, as lords have zero personality and the dialogue ""options"" are the same for every character. This is particularly evident with your companions. In Warband, they would comment on locations, giving their thoughts and memories to the player. Companions would squabble with each other and you'd have to remedy the situation. In Bannerlord, they're just kinda... there. The lords in Warband were admittedly pretty generic, but their assigned personalities actually affected their behavior. This gave them some level of flavor, which is still far better than none. There is a reason people really like Jarl Knudarr and really hate Boyar Meriga. 

The skill system needs work. Warband had a near perfect system for its purposes. Bannerlord did not [i] have [/i] to use the exact same approach (though I wouldn't have minded if they did), but the replacement we got was disappointing. Leveling up doesn't feel exciting, and skill caps can make the player feel like they're just wasting time until they get their next attribute point. In Warband, every level up did something the moment you invested your points, which always felt great. In Bannerlord, it's highly unsatisfying to invest some focus points and not even get an attribute point unless you've gained [i] FOUR [/i] levels. Perks are pretty good, however. They are fun choices you can make in between level-ups, though they could do with some balancing since a lot of the time there is one very clearly better choice. Also, managing companions' perks is a nightmare; if you auto-assign, you'll end up with a much less effective ally, but doing each perk one-by-one is a chore.

Sieging is just a mess. If a lord joins your siege, he'll take over (for me this happened even if I had far more renown and troops), and then he'll just sit there and do nothing forever. You can ""fix"" that by abandoning the siege and rejoining, but this doesn't address the issue of you not being the commander of the siege you started AND this doesn't always work for me. Sometimes rejoining will still cause the lord to sit at the siege forever, doing nothing. In addition, building siege weapons is a cool mechanic but I wish it were affected more by the Engineering skill, and the weapons generally suck and get destroyed extremely easily by the AI. Sieges are a frustrating slog. All these issues are compounded by the fact that the late-game is [i] ALL [/i] about sieging castles and cities over and over again.

Those are the three main systems that I have problems with, but then there's the whole issue of systems and mechanics that [i] should [/i] exist but do not. Feasts, claimants, unique companions, real dialogues, diplomacy options, skill books, boats, village upgrades/buildings, marshal system, manhunters, more quest variety, challenging lords to duels, assassination attempts on your character, and more. Most of these features, but not all, were in Warband, and they were completely left out of this ""sequel"". Instead we got mechanics no one asked for, like smithing. I don't even want to think about how much time went into making the smithing system and trying to balance it with patches over the past few years.

So why am I recommending this game? Because despite all my gripes with it not being a very good sequel to Warband, I've had some fun with it as a standalone game. I [i] do not [/i] recommend it at full price. This game is not worth $50. It feels more like a $20 empty sandbox to me. If you get it for cheap and go into the game knowing these flaws, curb your expectations, and maybe throw some mods in there, you can certainly have a lot of fun. Just don't expect it to be Warband 2.0, expect it to be Generic Medieval Sandbox 0.7 Alpha.",1606514088,1691172830,True,2,0,0.540636062622070313,0,True,False,False

Perhaps when modders get access to this game they can make something out of it, but as it stands Bannerlord is simply NOT  a stand alone game. You could mod Warband to look, play and operate better than this game and it's a disgrace they're charging £33 for an unfinished project.

-Update, the devs continue to ""update"" the game adding pointless, pathetic and useless features and tiny bug fixes, which in reality take the game further away from being finished as the work they do is DOGSHIT compared to the work Modders already do, which then breaks when they decide that they desperately need to release an update to 1.90.91.91923.91 (New grain sprites are now available!

I hadn't played this game since early access v1.8 or something along those lines and coming back to bannerlord in version 1.1.5 has reminded me why I fell in love with it a while back. In early access one of my biggest problems with bannerlord was forcing me into playing a storyline to really do much but with the introduction of sandbox it lets you loose and allows you to be really anything you want and doesn't force you to be this near unstoppable warlord hell-bent on being powerful, and I love having control over my own story. While small skirmishes and tournements can be either fun or boring (tournements especially become boring over time as there are so many ways to cheese a win it once you learn how to fight well it becomes almost comedic how much of a pushover they become) the real appeal is the large scale battles, things like besieging a castle or being beseiged yourself and holding off the incoming horde of footsoldiers are the real reasons I keep coming back. The sense of progression and gaining strength over time as you slowly become more and more battlehardened alongside your troops and win more and more large conflicts is also addicting beyond belief, but the games not afriad to strip that power away from you. You can and will lose battles from time to time and along with that everything your party was holding and all your troops will be gone which gives a sense of risk when the battle isn't overly favored to one side. While you can win against an opponent through sheer numbers alone, tactics will almost always prevail in a close fight and can be the edge you need in a one sided one. While mods are an option and make certain aspects of the game more enjoyable or adds new mechanics in, they're not necessary and the depth the game brings alone is more than enough to enjoy. I will whole-heartedly recommend Bannerlord to anyone who might even be somewhat interested in the gameplay loop Bannerlord offers.

Getting 500 veteran units together takes hours. In EVERY war I've fought in, I've had to kill 3000+ men. You will be savagely outnumbered at every turn. On the easiest difficulty, I generally have to kill at least 5x the size of my army to stay even. [b]This blows.[/b] 

--Mid to late game, each enemy kingdom has 5x as many troops as yours and then multiple enemies declare war at the same time. Eventually every kingdom will declare war looking for landgrabs or unbelievably large tributes. At one point, I controlled 10% of the map and I was spending 3x my GDP on tributes because there was no other way to avoid multiple enemies with 5x my troops from ganging me. Completely savage. Sturgia, I don't know you and have never even met you and you're demanding World War 1-scale reparations for a weeklong war you started against a country 80 million miles away. Go back to your huts you ****ing psychos. The game is terrible currently, but it looks like there might actually be a playable game eventually. Maybe even a great game if modders save it. The mods are great so far. 

--The game is much better with mods to cut away the worst of the grind. The best ones I've found so far are no-fatigue smithing, increased recruiting, increased skill gain, no Folly of Nertezes quest, and maybe starting with your own kingdom. If you use the console to give yourself Medicine skills, I think the game is less tedious (increased medicine increases the chance that your guys will survive otherwise fatal wounds, cutting down significantly on the hundreds of recruitment runs you'll need to do). Unfortunately, getting Medicine without cheating is an extremely grindy process. 

--[b]Giving every enemy thousands of troops when it's so hard to scrape together 500 is savage[/b]. Making it take 20+ hours of trading for players to be able to trade settlements is fucking cruel, and charging $3+ million per settlement in a game where each city only trades $50,000 at a time means you would be spending 100+ hours just walking between cities farming money for an economic victory if you were masochistic enough to try it. Maybe most of all, the difficulty of acquiring troops and getting together armies larger than 500. Being able to send out recruiter units to collect units for you would help so much. (There's a mod for this). Or being able to recruit more units from towns (including noble units) so you're less dependent on visiting hundreds of villages. 

--Grinding up the Trade skill: some recurring trade routes that work better than most. Exporting desert horses from the Aserai (southern desert) to the cities of Vlandia (the western kingdom) is a good start. 

TAKING A SINGLE CITY: 
I spend several hours getting 500 veteran units and march on the nearest enemy city. 800-1000 enemy units intercept me. My 300 surviving units begin a siege of the city and are ambushed by ANOTHER army of 500+ enemies. My 150-200 surviving units launch a desperate attack into hundreds more garrisons. It takes me so much fucking time to assemble my ~500 men and every enemy ALWAYS has thousands of troops lying around. What the fuck.  Best case scenario, after 5 hours of troop recruiting/training and 3 hours of nonstop fighting, I have taken 1 of the game's 75 settlements. If you can put up with this crap long enough to beat the game, it gets even worse when you finally do conquer the entire map and there's no victory screen. The game just goes on infinitely.  

--Until you've gathered impressive numbers of veteran units and have a more-than-casual understanding of how your units interact together, it is stupid how much your armies will depend on the player general personally murdering 20%+ of the enemy army. 

--Strategy ideas: stage melee fighters about 30 meters in front of a huge amount of archers. I recommend a 70-20-10 distribution of archers, foot infantry, and cavalry. In a battle where you're hugely outnumbered, which will be every fucking one of them, the main value of cavalry is preventing enemy horses from messing with your archers. Only archers will produce enough value over time to grind away at the huge stacks of enemy soldiers that will come at you from all sides. 

--Buggy fighting: unless you have mods to fix this, spearmen waste most of their attacks hitting each other if they're in a tight formation. Using spearmen in a loose formation is historically very weird but it's by far the most effective approach in most engagements. Unlike most spearmen historically, yours are idiots that don't know how to use a spear. 

--The renown mechanic is awful. Unless you get up to 125 trade, the only reliable source of renown is grinding your way through hundreds of battles. Problem: getting up to 125 trade is itself very grindy, and probably less fun than hunting down 100+ bands of bandits. Both options are terrible. Maybe signing on with another kingdom and then kamikazing your armies at someone else works better.  

--The most effective method for kingdom conquest seems to be clear-and-hold. Collect 500-1000 units, grab a city, garrison it with all of your surviving units, then go back and recruit a whole other army. Do this 75 times. This is unbelievably grindy, but nothing else holds up for me against enemy raids. Militias seem very ineffective. 

--You can recruit AI lords into your faction. But they blow. They are virtually unable to successfully attack enemy cities. It doesn't seem like they're very effective at protecting your territory, either. At least it reduces the scale of the hordes against you if you steal some of the enemy lords. 

--Buggy traits: most army perks only help ""your formation"". There's a huge problem: if you're commanding your own army, you're the commander and are not considered to have a formation. [b]That's a massive ****ing oversight[/b], unless the game intended most military perks to be irrelevant for the 80% of the game you're running your own army.",1625588421,1690992903,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

This is an improvement over the original in so many ways-especially so many of the quality of life features that have been added. Tracking locations so you can find them on the map, showing how much money you have when looking to recruit a new companion, and the save/load file screen showing an image of your character and some stats like how many people, the morale and food amount in your party. There's a lot more, but those were some of the first things that jumped out at me upon coming back to check it out post launch. Another favorite thing I like is that trading is much easier. From rumors suggesting a good place to buy or sell various goods for a profit-to even showing thru the color of the numbers how profitable it would be to sell certain items at the place you're currently at. There are so many important things I didn't even know would matter so much to me. 

Then there's the Crusader Kings style side of it I never really cared about in the original. All the political intrigue and building of your clan and notable figures within it and how they interact with the game world while you're doing your thing. For example, I married one of my people to someone else, she got pregnant and had a kid, and that kid's father won a tournament somewhere and earned my/the clan 2000 monies.

The combat is still there, but even that has been improved upon from what I've seen. So many different stats to take into account for battle. How long is your weapon, how fast can it swing, how well does it handle, what tier is it, and more. It feels like there are so many more options for weapons rather than just a few different types of swords, axes, etc. For example, even within a named type of sword such as a spatha, there can be many differences in how they handle in combat.

If you're looking to play a new RPG and potentially build your own empire from scratch as a nobody and on your own, check this game out. It can take quite a long time to get to the point where you are able to start capturing towns and getting your own land, but the journey along the way will most likely be filled with a lot of fun running around wiping out bandit troops, their hideouts, doing quests for various noble/other named people, and/or ransacking villages. There are so many ways you can go about building up your warband and your reputation around the game world. You don't even have to have any aspirations of becoming a lord or the emperor. You can just spend all your time amassing money and reputation and become a merchant with a ton of businesses and caravans bringing you income as you just manage your business empire. In some ways, the game can be a medieval life simulator and I never expected to want that from these games. I was just happy to do the battles and take over castles and towns. I feel spoiled like I got so much more than I asked for.

Edit: They updated the game so that you can continue playing on as one of your heirs in your clan. In essence, you can now play kind of like Crusader Kings and build a dynasty and play on generations after your original character has grown old and died. There's an update coming in version 1.2 that improves the current fog of war mechanic that encourages you to go around and explore and talk to people because you no longer have every bit of information unlocked in the game encyclopedia. Now you learn things about people, places and so on as you explore. In that same update, they're adding even more maps to the bandit hideouts and other locations you can fight in, plus an overhaul to the crime alley mechanic and your ability to become the leader of a criminal empire-as well as the way environmental effects such as rain and snow impact cavalry in determining combat advantages. 

In short, they added a bunch of updates and content post launch and even more is on the way and might even be here already by the time you read this review. Also, the original couple that got married in my clan have 6 kids now and the dad has won 2 more tournaments and is becoming a real charmer in social circles, boosting my clan's reputation with various notable NPCs in the game on top of earning me money every so often AND expanding my clan's list of potential future playable characters (or leaders of their own parties or caravans or crime alleys).",1675424083,1690973532,True,28,5,0.724807798862457275,0,True,False,False

There is a small sliver of gameplay in which it is actually somewhat fun, but unfortunately the game mostly consists of fumbling from one underdeveloped system to the next. The absolute lack of any kind of diplomacy at all means that unless you literally only want to get into skirmishes the entirety of your playtime, you will just end up frustrated like me. You start off cripplingly weak, with the only way to improve your skills being either wasting five minutes trying to chase a group of bandits/looters that are always slightly faster than you so you can try and beat them down, or go to a nearby city and hope to god they decide to give you the weapon you want to train with for the practice fights. But why would they, when instead it could be RNG so you can get some shitty javelins instead of literally anything you want to use! Lets say you make it past that. You become a mercenary clan. This is where that sliver of fun is, when you can get a decent enough group of units that aren't too expensive to maintain as you hire yourself out to the various warring states. Just make sure you pay attention because you can very easily throw off your whole budgeting system by trying to have a few more guys. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY THIS GAME AND NOT BE FORCED INTO A WORLD CONQUEST SLOG, STAY AT THIS LEVEL. I thought it'd be fun to become a landed vassal, and boy was I f*cking mistaken. At first you think its great- a city/some villages to provide passive income! You can then focus on the villagers of your little fiefs, solving their problems, developing the infrastructure- except no actually, you can't. Because the game constantly forces you to be at war with at LEAST one other empire, if not four. There is no time to help out the local notables anymore, and in fact they become entirely irrelevant, because you need to always be chasing down the enemy armies that are relentlessly raiding your villages or trying to lay siege to your castles. And god f*cking forbid you execute one of these asswipes who have razed the same meager hamlet five times in the last in game month, if you do so FOR SOME REASON every other noble in the game gets massive relations penalties to you. Both fortunately & unfortunately, it seems like nobles opinions of you actually don't matter at all. They're all gonna go to war against you anyway, so what do you care if they hate you for executing the leader of a minor bandit faction/mercenary group/literal cult? 

This is not a complete game, far from it. It is barebones, a scant few systems just barely good enough to entice you throughout the agony of trying to do literally anything. Buy it on sale, if you have to buy it at all. But I cannot in good faith recommend anyone play this if they want ANYTHING more than to just throw themselves into random medieval battles for a few minutes at a time- and I definitely cannot recommend paying fifty full dollars for it.

Edit, after nearly doubling my playtime: My thoughts on the game as is have not changed. I started a new run where I just focused on tournaments and being a merc and there is a satisfying, if repetitive, loop there. But I've also spent some time trying out mods, both from steam & nexus, and after getting some to work (at least 10 of my new hours are just having it open in the background as i read help threads and figure out conflicts) I will say that the mods people have made to enhance combat, introduce an actual diplomacy system, & others do help the experience. Hell, I saw some that change the map to be europe and you play in historical times, which is awesome! But while they did help and I found them interesting, I don't think it should be up to the modding community to save this game and the devs, especially given how long they've had to introduce these basic concepts themselves to bannerlord. I will continue to play & keep an eye on updates, as there is a nugget of a good game here, but overall my opinion remains unchanged- I would simply be remiss if I didn't comment on what does work, and the work the modders have put into improving the experience.",1690308836,1690948291,False,29,1,0.67004704475402832,0,True,False,False

ok..tried it out again....they definitely improved on the family stuff. It seems a little better....no longer seeing empty text dialog strings.
It's ok.  Still gets drawn out after you get a fief.  warring nations seem to go nowhere and arbitrarily engage in war just because....as if the AI trigger is to sensitive without any margins ......off on off on off on.  hard to focus on your shit when your liege is always going to war for whatever fucking reason like too much creme in his latte.

Do i recommend it....i don't recommend unfinished games anymore....new policy after shit shows like kerbal2 and darktide.

but it is ok if you get it on a good sale and should entertain you for about 100 hours.

I thinkIi know why it seems dull....there does not seem to be any families, like in mount and blade.  Seems to be missing alot of lords and ladies.  Also noticing ALOT of missing text strings.  It really seems incomplete.  thus the ""early access"".  I would think that early access would be at least feature complete.  This is my guess, they outsourced this project, which delivered poor quality (thus the years of development) and milked the budget.  Now they are forced to release this early and incomplete to stay afloat in this ruined economy.  At least that is what the quality of this early ""not feature complete"" release feels like.

The multiplayer is dull.  Years to to pretty much release the same game with new graphics?  That seems very low quality to me.  I'm happy enough that I got it on discount.  I even saw a text placeholder on one of the character texts.  How many years was this in development?  There does not seem to be anything NEW in this game.  At least I don't see it.  You can pretty much save your cash and keep playing the old mount and blade (with better performance) ....sometimes people...its not about the fancy graphics like these game CEO's think.

I was burned out by all the features that could have been implemented better, the defective ones, and the amount of mods I had to install to get a FULL experience.

But after going back to Warband, I can say Bannerlord is better on almost every front, despite some poorly implemented features.
Navigating Warband's UI was a chore after my 250+ hours in Bannerlord. This is probably THE aspect of the game that has evolved the most: Bannerlord's UI is slick, intuitive, simple and displays all the information you need, when you need it.

Bannerlord doesn't feel ""final"" yet though. It lacks polish, some features should be reworked, and some implemented.
Mods do a great job at making Bannerlord feel like a complete game, but it's a chore to get all thoses mods working, and every game update will (obviously) break your mods configuration.

Hopefully, Bannerlord will get the polished it deserves, because I don't think I can go back to Warband now. Compared to Bannerlord, Warband feels clunky, dated, and its UI massive, obstructive and unintuitive. I don't care about graphics, but the aforementionned points definetly make playing Warband more unpleasant once you've experience this iteration.

I recommend the game to newcomers to the series and fans of Mount & Blade alike. Bannerlord feels like a Warband 2.0; fans of Warband will feel right at home. With better UI, presentation and tutorials, new players will get to enjoy the unique experience Mount & Blade has to offer without the clunkiness and unintuitiveness of the previous iterations.

Devs, please keep updating and polishing the game.

Encountered game breaking glitch.

Edit: Totally forgot you had to enable console to skip these issues. Thumbs down regardless, I enjoy the game, but I got an issue right at the beginning with bandits and there was a neverending issue where I couldn't execute the first bandit you fight to save your kin.

It stops you from progressing the mission. Glad they added a sandbox mode, I'll give a thumbs up for that. I really appreciate this feature. I'd suggest staying away from campaign. I'll try the campaign again, but that's a big issue not being able to progress your main story on the first try after not playing for about 6 months to a year. Not a good sign.

This release fails on so many levels. So many common sense features are completely missing, including some that were available in M&B: Warband. 

I'm horribly disappointed in this game. Two campaigns in and I am frustrated and let down.



Update after 40 additional hours: You need mods to save this game. The base game fails on so many levels, here are a few off the top of my head.

Game Difficulty: There are arguably 3 facets of this game; economy, relationships, and combat. Game difficulty only applies to combat aspects of the game, not relationships or economics, which remain incredibly difficult to manage throughout the game, especially mid to late game.

Diplomacy: The Diplomacy Mod provides some features that should have been inherent in the native game. To send messengers to heroes on your behalf. Negotiating peace, alliances, ceasefires, and more. It's all missing from the base game.

Executions: Executing enemies ONLY hurts you, there is NO balance. You would think that people who hate the person you executed would like you more for it, but no. This function is IMBALANCED. You only lose favor with allies of the person you executed.

War: War is declared on you at AMBIGUOUS times. There is no indicator that you are falling into disfavor with clans, and there is no way to improve your standing with them to avoid war. Also, the deeper you get into the game, enemy factions ignore war with one another and focus solely on you.

Alliances: Alliances through marriage does NOT actually create an alliance; the faction you married with, even though they will have 100% favor with you, will still go to war with you.

Storyline Quests: These are obnoxious. You are hit with constant quests that you cannot complete because you are too busy defending your empire from tireless onslaughts. There is no way to slow the rate of incoming quests, deny them, or send companions on your behalf to complete them.

Mercenary Clans: You do not get the full range of interaction with Merc Clan Parties in your kingdom as other parties, ergo you cannot donate troops to them.

Economy: You cannot buy or trade fiefs by default. Paying for peace is drastically weighted against you; if you find yourself on the losing side of a war, you will have to pay 4,000+ denars for peace, but if the other side suffers those same conditions, you may still have to pay, or only receive a few hundred denars after months or years of fighting.

Vassals: Vassals do not approach you asking to pledge their loyalty to you with any regularity as they used to in Warband, even with high renown (I currently have over 5000 and have not had anyone approach me)

Marriage: If you or someone in your clan marries, and their spouse dies, there can be no remarriage without installing a mod.

I've covered a lot and I know I'm leaving things out. Sorry to be a bummer but the devs screwed us on this release.",1671787445,1690702506,False,4,0,0.509002208709716797,0,True,False,False

Once you are doing well the game becomes increasingly frustrating. This is due to the way the AI can spawn metaphorically endless army after army out of its behind, the way your own faction's AI does not co-ordinate, the way that a peace treaty means absolutely nothing, winning a major battle carries small signiificance, winning a war means absolutely nothing other than you get some tribute until the AI breaks the peace; it's all pointless because even if the AI has 1/4 of your army they will declare war then spawn army after army (unless you start executing nobles which the player should not be forced to do - particularly as the game punishes you for doing so). 

You are spending your time as the only competent member of your kingdom running around all over the place fighting multiples enemies with it feeling like you are having to do it all yourself in a hugely frustrating way that stems from the developer's seeming desire to punish the player for playing. The player cannot be on all fronts at once. The developer is cheesing an answer to the player's faction snowballing in power by making it an endless whack-a-mole experience where you need to be everywhere at once.

I am sure players can still win by paying tribute to smaller powers to end wars, by executing captured nobles, by doing other tricks, but that feels like bad design to me.

Bannerlord is a great foundation for a game, and to be honest, when it's barebones it's pretty boring to play.

What makes this game great is the very active modding community that volunteers to fill the gaps in the gameplay and QoL improvements that it needs in order to reach some of it's potential.

So if there were no mods I would give this game a 6.5/10 but mods make it an 8.5. The potential that it has though is 11/10 and that would be the case if the developers would be more responsive to the community's requests. 

Also, at times the grind is real. Are you poor? Grind to get rich. Are you rich? Grind to get powerful. Are you powerful? Grind to be the world dominator. In the meanwhile, grind to be famous, grind to be the top arena scorer, grind all your skills and to get the best weapons as a smith, you guessed it, grind some more.

The battles are amazing and it is what gives this game it's uniqueness over everything else. They are the best example of army management and action gameplay mix. It's like total war but you can at any time fight along your soldiers. Every faction has different strenghts and weaknesses and also the player has the ability to mix troops from any faction they like, if they have the patience to go around the huge map in circles to pick them.",1585609230,1690561144,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Leading up to becoming a king, 10/10. Been playing since first beta version, and the game has come along light years. Just give me back the og troop organization however, the new grouping system is trash. 

things that would make this the perfect game:
being bale to send messages to lords
not having to cross the enitire continant, just to loop back around because a lord WaS lAsT sEeN nEaR PrAvEnD
be smart and intigrate mods like free camera, or realistic batle sounds etc. They shouldn't have to be mods. 

This game has a learning curve on par with HOI or really any paradox game. This isn't total war with on ground pov, this is a time machine that turns day into night outside your mom's basement window.

When Special Ed Games ""Jounalists"" call out ""Entitled Gamers"" these are the people they should be talking about.
Listen, I understand we all waited over a decade for this. I understand that it's not instantly what you wanted it to be and more. But Ya'll are pulling a damn No Man's Sky level of butt hurt for a game that isn't even fully released yet. Do we really need the Illustrious Internet Historian to do a bum bum slap on all the cry babies again? Things happen in development of a game that you simply cannot predict, much like life. These dev's for the most part have been pushing out consistent patches and fixes and are just trying to get their game completed in the way they know how.
So maybe sit back, wait for full release, or Hunt Bugs and issues to give to Taleworlds to fix instead of whining that you actually have to wait for the Pie to cook after you've picked the apples.


Edit: Post Release.
I probably should have edited this sooner but to be honest I've been kind of disappointed in Taleworlds Handling of the release and the content around it.
Some of the promises were kept, I know feature creep and realistic expectations are something to maintain, but there is no real Bandit Path.
There is no path that is just burn it all down and be a Bandit Cave Man.
The Bandit path feels unfinished and basically just feels like it would just turn into a different Kingdom, but why not do something with that? 
Maybe let us take part in sieges where we can help or Hinder the defence using our Criminal connections? 
Perhaps someone opens the gates for an attempted night raid?
Or you smuggle in a couple of assassins to kill key generals?

There's a lot I feel could have been expounded upon.

The Game also still has the occasional CTD bug. Most often around the Party and inventory Menu's.


I am going to Compare Taleworlds to Bethesda for a moment.
Bethesda makes Games that Require Mods to be good.
Taleworlds make games that Mods Make better.

While I would prefer Taleworlds option, Bannerlord I feel is going to be a game where Mods are more important. where the game is basically just a Blank Slate for Modders to tell their own story. Maybe that's the point? The Game is fine on its own without Mods, unlike Fallout 4,3, Skyrim, and basically anything produced by Bethesda instead of just  published by.",1593686494,1690308496,True,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

3. Become a mercenary for the Battanian king, Caladog, and try to complete the Dragon Banner missions at this stage.
4. Attack a bunch of armies only using the Battanian Hero archers, and collect all their juicy loot. 
5. Seek out dirt-cheap hardwood (I usually see this sell for like 8-10 gold at the cheapest), now just buy all of it. 
6. Go to Marunath and start working on your Smithing-skill, and just create a bunch of Two-Handed Swords, where you max everything on the sword out. Remember to collect a bunch of swords from step 4. Smelt these down into metal for your swords.
7. Rinse and repeat until you have about a million, where you swear alliegance to Caladog, and start buying a bunch of workshops (the workshop system is so RNG based, that it's hard to explain which ones to buy in this tutorial).

Brothers this land burns with the self righteous hatred of the men who seek to rule her. No longer can we stand idly as our kin are sent to die in frivolous wars. We must band together in defiance of the very men who would see us spill our blood, on distant forsaken soil, in a far off forgotten land, all so they can grow fat on the fruits of our peoples labor. 

Today we gather, many different people of many different walks of life united under a common banner, brought by a common goal. We shall see this land liberated from those who seek to oppress us. We shall march forth not as an army driven by vengeance. But as a people driven by a righteous  desire to live freely from the bonds of oppression.

Together brothers, we will form a legacy that our kin will look to for generations to come as a beacon of guiding hope in these darkest of times. And should we not see the sun rise next, let it be known to all the lands, that we gave our all, that we stood shield to shield, shoulder to shoulder, unwavering. Let our battle cry be heard all throughout the realm, igniting the spirits of those who would carry on our legacy should here today we fail.we fall here today.

In the face of darkness, we remain resolute, for our fight is not in vain. Our legacy will endure, a beacon of hope that shines brightest in the darkest of times. For it is through our unity and unwavering spirit that we declare, today and forevermore, that no shackles of oppression shall bind us. Onward, brothers, onward to a future defined by our courage, our unity, and the indomitable spirit that resides within us all.

Stupid: everything about the economy, smith like 3 two handed swords and you can sell them for enough money to bankrupt an entire kingdom, meanwhile workshops moving thousands of pounds of raw materials return a pittance. On a side note Bannerlord has the worst smithing system of any game in history for more reasons than I will write out here, but one example is that you cant buy smithing materials, you have to refine thousands of pounds of iron to get enough for one high level sword or smelt like 3 throwing knives its really stupid.

One of the most 'pick your playstyle' games I've seen, even if you'll likely be pressed into touching all of the systems at least a little bit. It's all wrapped in a barely-fantasy world which fits analogously with the fall of the Roman Empire in our own history, and which features in-game cultures that will look pretty familiar.

Bannerlord can have the addictive quality often hailed in turn-based strategy games. Similarly to the 'just one more turn' phenomenon, it feels like there's always one more thing to do before you try and pry yourself away from the screen. The game awards both quick thinking in the moment and careful planning for the future, and it can be unforgiving if you choose poorly.

There is so much things still wrong I do not know where to start. Maybe the first thing to tell you is that the game is frequently crashing. If you look at the last updates they added no content but where only fixing reasons for crashing. Supposedly the game crashes more the longer you play which is a bad sign. And did you ever look at the loading screens? In this pictures every person has the same face copy pasted lol. 

But that's not all. There is also tons of content and featues missing from the game. The campaign doesn't deserve this title. It's just 4 missions or something and they are not helpful in learning the game as they don't give you any idea how to achieve the goals. And without spoilering too much one of them is just to talk to 10 NPCs which randomly move over the map. Wow. Such brilliance. 

There are also so many things missing that I cannot comprehend why they are not in game. Talking about caravans. If you want to accompany a caravan with your soldiers you cannot do that because there is no way of matching the caravans speed. So you are either going to slow or too fast and have to constantly click next to it as it moves ahead. You also cannot tell the caravan which trade routes to go or which goods to trade. They just do whatever they like. And the same goes for creating a second party. After having a second party for quite a while I do not know what they actually do. They can recruit soldiers and run around the map while you have to pay for them. But what is the purpose? Some internet commenters supposed the second party would do side quests and increase your clans rank faster while also trying to earn some money but this couldn't be confirmed. 

If you set a up a workshop in a city it should show you the expected profits. Currently it's just trial and error. You buy an existing workshop like a brewerey and then you notice it is not making any money. So you check the prices of resources and goods and decide to transform it into a blacksmith. But it still not working so you make it winery. And repeat until it actually is profitable. 

Don't get me wrong. The concept and idea of the game is amazing. But this product is just unfinished and the fact they removed it from Early Access sounds like they have no intention of making this game complete. Which is a sad thought. This game had the potential to be my favorite game of all time but at the current state I am not a happy customer. 

It might sound like only the campaign, tading and the overall economy is my problem here but there is really something in every mechanic in the game that is not finished yet.

Furthermore mercenaries will not seek you out as a king, lords of weak factions who are on death's edge won't try to join you for protection, and there is the matter of the fact that mercenaries can only be contracted by talking to their leader personality, in the middle of a war i can't stop everything to track down the leader of the mercenary company, to be frank, as a king i should not have to, at least i should be able to have one of my companions so seek them out, furthermore the ai will never come to you for anything, they are all passive and the world revolves around you, none of theses ""characters"" have wants or desires, there is no agency, simply hey lats attack that empire because they are currently weak after losing one battle, and then lets make peace because we are winning. the game is still bad, but no longer is it simply because it is early access, it is now a matter of simple bad design, it is fun for the first half of any campaign, well you attempt to get a fief of your own and found your own realm, but the second you become a king, no one treats you like one, you can grant a fief to your companions, but no one will go do menial tasks for you, no one landless clans will offer to pledge themselves to you early on in exchange for land they would otherwise have no chance at, you are the female dog who must beg and bow for even a landless clan to join you, no one is ever at your call.",1591947338,1689837942,False,0,1,0,0,True,False,True

After playing a significant amount of Warband, I was super excited to hear about the sequel and ready to return to my favorite 9-5 as of yet- the Warlord destroying Armies three times our size while desperately attempting to conquer the world (Anyone who disagrees with the concept of genocide has yet to lose the same castle in Rhodoks for the eighth goddamn time after ""liberating"" it only minutes ago). 

Unfortunately, Bannerlord is functionally flawed, and the game turns into a unfun slog not too far in.  The AI is big dumb in this game, which leads to ridiculous situations regarding declarations of war. There are STILL errors in weird places. Marriage mechanics and the courting ""minigame"" are watered down and practically useless. The graphics are no treat either; some of the main NPCs are actually painful to look at. 

Overall, part of me still hopes that soon a major patch will be released, and all of Bannerlord's problems will fade away, but I'm not holding my breath. If you have never played Mount and Blade, I'd still recommend Warband over Bannerlord- the dated graphics suck but the game is nearly flawless otherwise.

Auto-battles are broken as fuck, any siege battle is an automatic loss with 90% chance no matter if you two or three times more people. Siege equipment is so fucking weak you'll probably never see a siege tower not being destroyed in first two minutes not even close to walls. Tactics were made by an imbecile who either couldn't make them work or couldn't explain how they work. You can't give orders to your troops to use a catapult, or a siege tower. You just can't, I literally Google'd it and the only answer I've found was press F6, but that only helps in some rare cases. During battle enemies randomly spawn out of nowhere even if you're standing right next to spawn point and when they begin retreating you HAVE to either finish them off (which is almost impossible because they always run away from you faster then you run) or wait for them to run away from battle. Hidden encampments battles are horribly boring - you just run from A to B while killing enemies 2-3 people per encounter. When you capture every castle and every city of any faction they do not lose, they keep spamming armies out of nowhere and keep raiding your villages again and again and every successful raid increases amount of money YOU have to pay to THEM for peace (THEY HAVE 0 FUCKING SETTLEMENTS). Character interactions are non-existant, yes you can have a wife, but this is just another companion that will be travelling with you and spawning children from time to time. If you think that this game has ANYTHING in common with Crusader Kings 3 - forget it, not even close. Replenishing army sucks - after every battle you have to run around villages recruting 5-10 people per vllage (of lowest quality of course) which, considering that you basically have to conquer the world, means potential hundreds of hours of ""fun"" gameplay loop.

The game is fun for first 5-10 hours, when you do arenas, fight with bandits, acquire new loot and quickly level up skills, then you get into kingdom warfare, get your pro-empire or anti-empire big quest and game quickly goes to shit from here.

P.S. Oh yes, and developers also decided to block your achievements if you're using ANY mods.

Grind, grind and more grind. I have never played a game with more grind - and I played World of Warcraft for several years!

There are fun aspects to this game, but for every good feature, the developers nobble it somehow:
- hard limits to character development (you won't believe the grind at later levels)
- caravans and shops to make money - that don't make money or get lost in wars
- hidden and incomprehensible game mechanics - you will spend a lot of time googling and still be baffled
- great battles, and smaller missions - but limited maps that quickly get repetitive
- great overall tactics - but weird politics and members of your own faction march away from hard won territory giving it  back to the enemy

I was thinking of playing through again - but I can't face the GRIND!



[b]Original Beta Review Below[/b]

Not really what I was expecting.

I thought it would be a first/third person perspective RPG where you get to control your own armies. 

It's more of a micro-management, overhead map exploration - with the occasional 3rd person battle. These are fun, but the maps are repetitive. There seem to be only a handful of bandit camps that you will replay ad nauseam. Even the fighting is a bit limited - no counters for perfect timing/blocks (perhaps these come later?), strike/defend from only 4 directions - could have included upper-left, lower-right etc.?

It has huge potential still, but after 30 hours of play, it feels very frustrating. In order to make progress as a new player you have to do a lot of Googling, and most of the information out there is out of date about a version of the game from one or two years ago.

A lot of the interface is NOT intuitive. There are a lot of 'hidden' game mechanics going on in the background - just try to google how to how to get a profitable workshop. No one seems to understand what the rules are! The first one I bought, I thought would be a sure fire winner - a brewery with 2 farms connected to the city and over a 1000 grain in the market - it made 7g a day instead of the 200+ I was hoping for, then ran dry !?!

The caravans seem to be equally un-profitable especially early on, and after you go to war later in the game.

For every interesting aspect of the game - there seems to have been a wilful effort to nobble it and ruin the experience, or make it so hard that the game really starts to grind.

It leads you in gently in some ways but then nerfs your gameplay e.g. you can hire recruits to fight for you from the prisoners you take - up until the point you can't and some strange 'conformity' statistic governs the ones you can hire and the ones you can't - except I could never find any I could hire! And it is never explained - or even mentioned in the in-game encyclopedia. Conformity to what exactly? Other recruits in your army? The faction you fight for?

I can see so much potential here - but it has been a very frustrating effort to get as far as I have - and it only seems to get harder - struggling to constantly quest to get money to fund your soldiers while the developers have nerfed the workshop and caravan money earning options behind some truly obscure game rules.

And half the quests you are offered are not worth the time it takes to complete them - you lose more money funding your troops than you get back from the quest.

Other games have a more story centric set of quests that teach you how to play and reward you with money, xp, etc. But this game drops you in the grind of low reward, and repetitive quests on repetitive maps.

They should hand the franchise to a developer that could really make this fun.

No wonder everyone bangs on about mods making Mount & Blade games playable ;)

The game is pretty fun early on, but has a serious balance issue fairly quickly. I played M&B: Warlord a very long time so I do understand the concept. However when I tried to play on mostly 'realistic' settings, We got attacked by a Computer army that was inconceivably more powerful and wiped us out. Yes you can start over and rebuild, but basically about 10 hours was annihilated with what felt very much like a cheat by the AI.

This makes it very hard to be motivated to keep playing. All in all, Warlords is a superior game.

Is it worth buying though? I think so, it gave me 28 hours of fun, which is pretty cheap compared to other recreational things you can do that cost money.

This is an incredibly ambitious game, basically attempting to recreate thinly-fictionalized versions of the factions that inhabited Europe and North Africa during the Medieval Era. Celts, Western Rome, Eastern Rome, Mamlukes, Vikings, and Mongolian forces all clash in frequent wars over towns and castles.

And the battles are big... something like 200 concurrent NPCs on the field of battle at once, with more reinforcing each side  as the battle goes on (it's never more than maybe 200 fighters on the field though... the rest spawn in as casualties occur). And the battles take place on snow, on grass, on sand, at daybreak, at dusk, at night. 

And a variety of weapons are in play. Bows, javelins, swords, spears, pikes, shields, different types of horse armor.

Beyond all of this, basic diplomacy, town management, and even crafting (blacksmithing) are present, with tournaments and arena fighting and various bandit lairs to clear out when the major factions aren't at war.

--------

Where the game goes off the rails a bit is in some of the basic execution of the above elements. 

Big battles are wonky... they function well technically, look amazing, and are a ton of fun, but the reinforcing is just, well, chaotic beyond anything I've ever seen. Blocks of men reinforce all at once, to places on the map that have no warning indication that they are an enemy spawn point. I'll be flanking an enemy force at their far edge, then suddenly I'm surrounded by enemies who spawned from a bizarre angle. 

Strategic AI is also wonky. My faction's biggest army that I joined sometimes will deviate from helping a major siege because 50 enemies in a small party went by. Then we all ping-pong between the siege, chasing the army, and back to walking to the siege, then back to chasing the small party. Sometimes things are fine, but sometimes the CPU-controlled armies have no idea that it's way more important to rush to relieve a siege than bounce between chasing little platoons of enemies wandering about.

There's also not a ton to do aside from fight. During big wars, obviously there's big battles. But even in peace-time between the major factions, it's mostly free-for-all fights in arenas, team fights in tournaments, and killing bandits and bandit lairs in those radial quests. The main quest line of the campaign is laughably unfun and threadbare. I didn't expect it to have CK3 levels of intruiguing, politicking, and negotiating, but what there is of diplomacy and clan management usually comes down to just selecting a couple of buildings to make, and then who you want to declare war on. There aren't, as far as I can tell, alliances between the major factions or much of anything other than declare war/peace deal.

Finally. the RPG system in this is way, way too convoluted. It doesn't need to have attribute points, skill points, favor points, and perks rolled into one. This system is one layer too many... I feel like skill, attribute points, and the perks are fine, but there's an additional layer of 'favoring' a skill to speed up its progress and it has its own points, too. And it doesn't help that there's no obvious explanation of what some attributes do, or what their related skills lead to for benefits. Gotta get the Steam guides favorited and bookmarked for the game, I guess.

----------

It's a huge improvement over M&B1 and its expansions, though. 

Graphics are a massive step up for terrain and buildings, and a decent step up for NPCs.

QoL improvements allow the UI to get a player right in to talk to someone without having to load the whole town and wander through it. Load times, in general, seem better in this (though it could be I have better hardware now than I did for the first game). 

I've yet to try multiplayer, though, so I can't compare there.

-----

In the end, it's short of what it could be. If they make DLC that add more to do in peacetime, and if they clean-up spawn points and some of the mechanics of larger battles, it could be lengendary.

But as it is, good luck finding an open-world sandbox that allows for this level of quality experiencing the Dark Ages in Europe.",1689532801,1689532868,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
