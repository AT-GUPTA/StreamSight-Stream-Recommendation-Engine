Overall a fun game with alot of basic design flaws that the devs either aren't aware of or have no interest in fixing.

Main one is how blurred the roles seem to get the further into the game. The base 4 characters are fairly generic.

Grukli is more DPS than tank.
Zek is basically the only dark wizard and otherwise the role is done better on Malukah.
Gustav and the entire ""song spell"" system being in rogue is just polluting the decks of everyone else because no one else can effectively do what he does and would make more sense in his own category.

Nezglekt is technically a healer, but mostly just a DPS with passive healing, which he does fine at but his entire deck is incompatible with everyone else in that category thus he's terrible using normal healer cards, and everyone else lacks the synergy to use his cards.

The worst part is Gustav and Nezglek have enough overlap in build that they legit could be their own category together.

The DLC seems to have decided to ignore the problem by just making a special DLC category for characters. It smells a bit of them attempting to hastily fill categories, thus Nezglekt and Gustav were thrown into categories to make them even 4s rather than any consideration on their impact.
It shows to as the warrior category is probably the most coherent and you can overlap cards easily on those. Wizard has alot of overlap though Zek has very little syngery but his cards at least have a use in the hands of the new queen character.

Ice is still poorly supported despite two band-aid characters thrown in to attempt to adress it, the system is still only a vague compliment to a different build rather than anything you'd actually be able to reasonably focus.",1679677490,1708650494,True,1,0,0.490463227033615112,0,True,False,False

That being said I get the most mileage out of this game playing it with a couple of friends. We all have different play styles which can result in some interesting synergy or counter synergy. It can be fun solo but I find the real fun is hanging out with friends and trying silly builds. Doing a random rain build and running into Phil was an eye opener. More variety would be appreciated of course but with the good sized roster, different acts, devs adding extra stuff (for free and paid), weekly challenges, and character options for events I'd say it's a good game.

both a strength of the game and the biggest hurdle to overcome starting out is that this game has a heavy focus on meta progression.  Playing one run unlocks a lot more cards, starting money, relics/equipment, and some very impactful percs/talents.  This adds a lot of depth to the game.  But it does make your first couple runs feel like a grind to unlock the meta progression before you can play the “real” game - you will be crushed eventually simply for not having enough percs unlocked to do enough damage/healing/block/status effects. 

But if you do stick with it, it really doesn’t take long at all to get past that and if you like the general deckbuilder concept, it is super worth it.  There’s a lot of depth, and you can really choose where you want to build your deck into as opposed to other deck builders where you kind of just have to roll with the luck of the draw.

Its somewhere down here, *dig dig dig*























































ope there it is, look how great it was, oh well i guess.....

This is a very fun game. People compare it to slay the spire, and it is very similar, but it definitely stands apart in a lot of ways. If you've never played a roguelike deck builder before this would be a great starting point to see if you like them. It feels very straight forward and its pretty simple to see/get deck combos that can get you pretty far. At the same time good time for experienced players will have fun combo-ing the different characters to destroy enemies. Different characters have different themes/roles/stats. There is a great range of characters, which keeps things lite and fresh while maintaining a lvl of difficulty. Its cool that you can multiple ppl join you, but its fun solo as well. unlocking characters/pets/items happens pretty organically if you just play the game. The difficulty does peter off after awhile do to unlocks, but that tends to happen in a roguelike like this, but the different challenges will keep you entertained. Honestly is an overall great time! -Ano",1678499990,1707259541,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

This game now features a launcher that presents ads and sends telemetry. I have a policy of always downvoting any such games. Steam's monopoly power is the only reason I tolerate it, and I certainly will not tolerate stacking launchers. Viewing ads is a cost. Sharing my data is a cost. I don't buy games with launchers of this kind, and adding one [i]after[/i] I've paid for it is a dirty trick.

""Join our Discord community"" is also an ad. Participating in Discord is not free. You are trading your privacy for using the platform. It's the equivalent of ""contact us on Facebook"". I'm not participating in that.

[b]A Short Opening Note[/b]

I like this game a lot, and I'll get to that. But I also have to mention (because it positively leaps out) that the only non-white human character is a voodoo witch. Really? Also, over 75% of the characters in the game are male, which is really weird. Is this a game world populated by electrical engineers? There are options besides either the tired cliches [i]or[/i] the hamfisted diversity checklist. Check out a D&D 5th Edition Player's Handbook, for an example of the third option -- art using the varied palette of humanity.

[b]The Game[/b]

[i]Across the Obelisk[/i] is a deep deckbuilder that I think must include several hundred cards and their upgraded versions, some of which are mechanically so different or specialized as to count as another card. More importantly, many of those cards are viable, so that even if you leave out the cards you'd never use, there are hundreds left to choose from.

There are four character classes available, and at the beginning, each corresponds closely to a party archetype:

Warrior (Tank)
Mage (Damage)
Ranger (Damage)
Healer (Healing)

The starting cards aren't strictly linked to these roles, but they encourage them if you want to survive.

But your options swiftly improve. Each class ends up with about 100 cards to pick from, and a decent deck only really needs 10 or fewer uniquely different cards, so you really do have lots of build options. As you play, you unlock a wide variety of new cards that expand the viable roles available to each archetype:

Warrior (Tank, Damage)
Mage (Damage, Support)
Ranger (Damage, Support)
Healer (Healing, Damage, Support)

In addition, each archetype has 4 characters unlocked through the course of the game for a total of 16 characters. Each of these characters lends themselves to a particular build, and sometimes have innate abilities really corral you into a particular deck build. For example, Cornelius is a fire mage. His innate abilities lend themselves to nothing else. In addition, he's so much better at being a fire mage than any other character that he's the [i]only[/i] character you'd ever build a fire deck for. There's something similar for So there's a certain amount of pigeonholing despite the wide range of options, but 16 build types is a lot to start with, and there are lots of viable strategies until you get to the extreme difficulty levels.

Your team doesn't have to be one of each class, so once you get enough unlocks you can get creative with your team builds. For example, a team with two healers, one that heals and one that uses shadow attacks. 

As a final note, I do think there's a pretty severe failure of imagination in a lot of the card design and naming. Many of them have names and effects yanked straight from Magic: The Gathering, World of Warcraft, D&D, and more. I know there's a limit to the originality of these things, but at least change some of the names so you're not breaking my immersion so badly. Your druid casts ""moonfire"" and ""starfall""? *sigh* I've played that game already.

its such a fun game and its not hard to pick up again after not playing for a long stretch. i love the upgrades you get on your town and how when you lose a run, it gives you some resources to use in your next run and you can stack it.

Why? For profit? I didnt ask for this. I wanted passion, art, soul. AtO has that. The games paradox made used to just feel loved. Now they feel like just an other cold dead product to be consumed.

I hope AoT the best, its devs deserve a good shot.",1662057221,1706345521,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

How to skip the launcher:

1. Click the cog to the right of the play button
2. Click 'Manage' and 'Browse Local Files'
3. A folder should open up, click the file location, copy it, and paste it somewhere you can type
4. At the end type '\AcrossTheObelisk.exe'
5. Put all of this in quotation marks ("" "")
6. Add a space and %command% at the end. As an example here's mine
""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Across the Obelisk\AcrossTheObelisk.exe"" %command%
7. Go to the cog again and click properties
8. In 'General' you will see 'Launch Options"" at the bottom. Paste what you wrote there
9. Enjoy playing the game without the launcher",1706059936,1706313226,False,30,3,0.685878276824951172,0,True,False,False

They sold their souls. It deserves every negative review it has been getting. Take my advice - look to other new indie games that will be even better and charge one-third of the price!




My main complaint is the perk system I mentioned below. It is an excellent system, but to have a game reward all of your characters experience in a run when they are not used is stupid and makes no sense. The best of the best games in history don't even do that (Pokemon, Final Fantasy series for example); it takes away from the challenge and fun. 

Quick Summary:
+ Unique characters to play and enemies to challenge
+ Many options for cards to select when modifying/building the decks for your characters
+ Smooth interface with battle card effect sounds and graphics
+ Different pathways and altering events each run to allow good replay value early on

- balance issues with energy needed to play cards (in my opinion) and a bug where the treasure chest does not give the gold/shards earned from the previous run when clicked on. (happened 3 out of 5 runs for me.)
- new mandatory perk system takes away from the roguelite aspects of the game as characters can level up without earning the experience themselves",1625765066,1706218501,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,True

If you've played tabletop RPG's, this game is the equivalent of having a DM who works against you. If you're familiar with literary and dramatic tropes, this game is the equivalent of one Deus ex Machina after another.

*Very minor spoilers ahead* It tries to be too clever for its own good. Build a deck around having thorns? Guess what, there will be an enemy with a card that not only removes all of your thorns, but heals by that amount! Build a deck around poisoning your opponents? Hey, now we have a guy who transfers his poison to you!

Simply put, it's lazy game design. Instead of installing such convenient devices, they could have balanced the game better.

The gameplay is solid and quick, the art is easy on the eye and gives off a somewhat nostalgic feelings for those that played flash games in the past. There are a lot of unlocks and ways to alter the difficulty, both to make it easier and harder. Multiplayer is generous: If one person has DLC, all the others can partake in it. This also works for achievements. The deck building is one of the biggest strengths of this game. You get good options of cards to add, which are upgraded the faster you complete battles, and unlike some games you actually get a compensation if you don't get any cards that are viable for your current build. In town at the start of each chapter you get even more options to edit your deck, making it so deck building is not entirely based on RNG.  

Negatives: There is hardly any story if you want that, and the music is rather basic. The game also goes hard on status effects, so if you're new to these kinds of games there will be a lot to learn even during the first map. My biggest gripe is how you are forced to retire/lose the game early multiple runs, as you are required to level up your characters several times before being able to beat the final boss (even if you know what you're doing).",1705875903,1705875903,True,0,0,0.499322474002838135,0,True,False,False

The single player is not as fun as the multiplayer that's for sure. Kind of only sunk in this much time due to people I played with. This game is not worth it for the single player experience. Was still hoping they could turn it around with updates and DLCs/expansions.

But.

As time went on the game kind of got worse and less fun. The DLCs are just not worth it. It killed all the hype for returning players. 

The Paradox thing was kind of a rug pull as well. The devs already had pretty bad DLC before I expect it to get worse. I honestly don't know what they would even get from Paradox the game was pretty successful already. I don't like the multiple launchers but it wouldn't have bothered me if the game was still fun and refreshing.

Sadly its not. Was a recommend but game slowly became a not recommend. ;(",1669290133,1705481813,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Many people claim that the new Paradox launcher is spyware, bloatware, or some other nonsense, and I'm pretty surprised at the number of programmers, coders, and indie devs in the review section for the community to come to such a conclusion.

This leads to classic RPG party dynamics with tank, healer, support and damage roles. Success, particularly at higher difficulty levels, relies on building groups that take advantage of one-another's strengths. The game has a heavy focus on support, with energy management, speed manipulation, card draw management and debuffs for almost every damage type, so there's a ton of ways to build support characters to enable a large variety of builds. 

There are 4 classes which each have unique decks, and 16 characters in the base game spread across these classes (+4 DLC characters at this time.) Each character has unique traits that focus on a couple of specializations within their class, which can be quite varied. Scout, for example, can be a ranged piercing attacker, a melee stealth attacker, a healing and buffing bard, or an evasive tank. There's a huge number of party iterations possible, and because the decks are flexible characters can fill a variety of roles. 

An important aspect of the flexibility is the game's reduced focus on RNG compared to other card battlers. At lower difficulty levels you can purchase most cards you want in limited quantities from the towns at the beginning of each act. Characters' starting decks typically fill multiple roles, so a cleric would have healing and damage cards, but they'll typically leave the starting town with a deck focused on their intended role for that run. This lets you focus more on refining builds than on waiting for the right cards to drop. There's still variety to decks each run because the highest upgrade level available to cards is only available from drops or some special events. Item shop RNG can also have a big impact on the direction of a run, though many big build-enabling items are guaranteed drops from certain encounters. 

These encounters are part of a fun game world that has a lot of variety in pathing and character-specific interactions and events. This adds good variety to runs, with certain areas or routes sometimes only being accessible to certain characters. There's a lot of granular difficulty settings that are nicely balanced, causing you to have to make harder decisions and deal with fewer resources and stronger enemies. The achievements are fun to hunt down and help you to learn the various encounters and their rewards. There's at least a hundred hours in getting all achievements, and many more in trying to clear the highest difficulty with a variety of teams. 

The principal negative thing to say about the game, and what's been driving negative reviews lately, is its recent ""upgrade"" from the Paradox Arc indie publishing label to the full Paradox label, which has coincided with the game getting a big corporate EULA and packaging the Paradox Launcher with the game, which serves the player ads. Currently this launcher is easily skipped and no negative gameplay changes have been made (a recent patch broke the game for people who couldn't get the launcher to work, but it's being addressed,) but all signs point to this being another Paradox DLC shop that'll try to put out new characters every few months. The 4 DLC characters they've made so far are all great, and the DLC zone is also nicely done, so this may not be a bad thing. Still, the future of the game is making people nervous, and if you don't want to agree to a Paradox EULA to play a cool indie game then this is no longer for you.",1703818801,1705357882,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I am then prompted to agree to the new terms & services. 

There is no way to bypass or disagree with these terms & services. 

This means, I am effectively locked out of the game unless I agree to the new terms & services. 

Paradox & This Developer now removes my access to this game if I do not agree to the new terms & services they set.

Paradox & This Developer now also reserves the right to change what they deem as ""services"" at any time.

Paradox & This Developer can change their terms & services at anytime in future game updates and force you to agree to the changes when you continue to ""use their services"". If you fail to agree to the new changes, they assume you automatically agree to them after 30 days. (See line 13 below)

13. Updates to this Agreement
We may amend this Agreement from time to time by posting an updated version on our Services. The amendments will come into effect after 30 days so make sure to review the agreement often. Your continued use of the Service after the changes come into effect means that you have accepted them. 

Here is the Summary of terms they wrote and they are forcing people to agree to:

1. Using our services means you've accepted this agreement. Contact your retailer if you want to refund a Service.
2. The Services are licensed to you for non-commercial use and Paradox reserves all rights to those Services.
3. You may need a Paradox Account to get the full experience of a Service.
4. Violating this Agreement can lead to suspension or termination of a Service!
5. Although we try our best, we don't always get it right the first time, so you agree that the Services may be modified.
6. Unfortunately, stuff happens and our Services may not always be available or receive updates and actions may be taken to protect you or anyone else. 
7. UGCs are cool but remember that you're responsible for your UGC, which you give us rights to use. The UGC shall be provided free of charge and only contain materials you are allowed to use.
8. Please go ahead and stream our officially released Games but be aware that some music cannot be included. We hope you make it big!
9. Follow the law and these rules, be nice, and respect our Services and the community.
10. We may require you to install and use the Paradox Launcher to run the Services. Failure to use the Launcher may make the Services unavailable.
11. The Agreement is in effect until terminated.
12. The Services will have the features and functionality described in relevant product documentation and we are only liable for direct damages no greater than what you've paid for the Service.
13. Let's try to solve disputes informally. If that doesn't work, arbitration or the courts in Stockholm will settle it.
14. The world changes and so will this Agreement when we post updated versions on our website and/or Service.

Here's how I would have handled this. The base game is good, roll in some DLC maybe Wolf Wars is now part of the base game. Raise base game price to $30. Sell new area DLC for $15. Can't have game cost $20 and 1 area DLC cost $20, and as people have said the base game is undervalued. But you can't just raise the price, you need to sweeten the base game pot a little to get away with that. Then you can make money going forward, keep rolling out new areas and heroes for $15...

I'm torn on whether to leave this negative or not, as the base game is great. However I will for now, since this really soured my view of this developer. I hope they can get their practices fixed. It's probably mostly the publisher but you chose to work with them.

Update: Well, I was thinking maybe it is time to set my review positive and play the game again, then I see all this new forced pointless launcher nonsense...

However, I am starting to feel that we're at the tipping point into a downward spiral. The DLC for the game is only getting more expensive and now the publishers have decided to push on a launcher that could have some questionable qualities to it regarding your data. It's great to see that the top reviews are showing ways to remove it, but the response by the developers was dubious at best. ""Oh you guys aren't big fans of the launcher? Sorry! It's only going to help the game in the future, we promise!"" It's just feeling like the beginning of the end. Yet, I would love to be proven wrong since I do really enjoy the game. I think it's best to leave some examples of development teams that solved both issues I've talked about.

You want a fun game with well priced DLC? Go play Vampire Survivors.

You want a fun coop game that had developers fix issues from public outcry? Go play Inkbound.

TLDR: I'm unhappy with the decision by the developers to not only work with paradox, but also use their launcher with questionable qualities regarding data. This is leading me to no longer play the game. I feel that they should've been more proactive with the community in this decision and apologizing after the fact is a bad tactic.

After 20 hours, I have played through the game 5 times, with the 5th play as my first victory.  Metaprogerssion is also slow.  I have unlocked about half the characters, and they are about halfway (I think) to max level.

That said, I'd still recommend this game despite all of that.  Combat is wonderfully crunchy, and individual decisions during both deckbuilding and combat feel important.  But my favorite thing about the game is the 4 character party and the depth it allows.  Want to run the traditional setup of a tank, a healer, and a couple damage dealers?  No problem.  Want to run a party of nothing but mages and see what happens?  Go for it!  I'm reminded of the original Final Fantasy, because that's how old I am.

It's also very satisfying to compartmentalize the cards you need into the decks of different characters.  Ever lost a run of StS because you drew all your block or all your damage at an inconvenient time?  Just put all your block in one deck and all your damage in another and you'll never have that problem again.

**EA REVIEW**

[b]Fun, Deep, and Grindy[/b], Across the Obelism feels looks like a mobile deck-builder game that went to 
college and learned a thing or two.

[hr][/hr]

[h1] The Good [/h1]

The game is rich.  You'll find 3-5 main builds *per class*, with 4 classes, and (as EA finishes) 4 characters per class that excel in certain builds.  For example, the warrior class could be sharp + bleed focused, defense focused, or blunt + debuff focused.  And there are meta-strategies within that like a fury+self-bleed build that transfers your bleed to enemies and powers you up.  The wizard can be fire, ice, lighting, or elementalist, or mind, shadow.  The ""thief"" can be ranged, melee or bard, poison/bleed, or direct damage.  And the healer can be one of the best nukers in the game (think shadow priest).  Very cool.

If you love party-based strategy games, you'll find this supremely fun.  

I love the game length.  At 2-5 hours it's immersive enough that I feel really invested in the characters and decks, but not so much so that I'm crying if I miss a roll or die in act 2.  The long-form Slay the Spire modality that is truly fulfilling, and I'm writing this when the fourth and final act isn't even done yet.  When you're first learning there are a lot of cards, items, and towning around.  You'll still be unlocking items and cards on your 15th playthrough... I certainly am.

While the difficulty is sharp at first, what makes this game feel mobile-y is that after you've ground out about 10-12 playthroughs, leveling up the core characters (permanent stat bonuses) and unlocking others, the difficulty flattens.  There's a ""juggernaut"" effect wherein the stronger you are at the start, the fewer rounds you need, the better rewards, the stronger you get.  The opposite can be said for when you first start out - beating Act 1 would be a miracle, and the game punishes you for being weak by giving you worse rewards.  It's basically designed to be impossible at the start, and becomes almost casual once you invest those 30-40 hours to unlock things.  

[h1] The Ugly [/h1]
(These are neither good nor bad, just noteworthy, potentially fixable by Devs.)

AtO is highly replayable, albeit grindy.  So... you're weak at first, pathetic.  You'll get further and further each play, as your characters permanently improve, and your town gets upgraded.  The difference between a party of level 1 greenhorns and the level 20+ is astonishing.  You'll be lucky to defeat a mini-boss your first playthrough.  At about level 15, two characters can kill it in the first turn, with the right decks and equipment.  Act one becomes a formality at that point.  To that end, the early game and mid game are the most fun.  Late game (when you have characters and pets unlocked and leveled) becomes more of a novelty to try different builds and parties.  Good thing there is new game plus.  

Some deck builds are just brokenly-good.  I think certain cards need buffs.  If you run a healer-nuke-and-buff, sorceress battery, archer and warrior as the main damage dealers, they can AOE down at least 1-2 enemies before they have a chance to go.  At that point it's 4 on 2.  This game favors aggressiveness which is fun, but it would be nice if turtling and debuffing were a bit more viable, like playing the Silent on StS. 

What StS did so beautifully was balance the characters and cards really well.  That's hard to do with 500+ cards and 4 different classes.  If they spent a lot of time tuning and play testing, they could get there.  

I hope they implement at NG++ etc.

So that's it for now.  I'll update after it gets out of early access.  Great game that's totally worth the small cost!",1629254989,1704062783,False,0,0,0.48554915189743042,1,True,False,True

Lots of room to explore synergies of builds and teams.

You may lose a lot at the beginning, but each character grows permanently during each run, and you as a player accumulate permanent trait points as you win fights, so your characters gain in strength and customizability as you continue to play. During a particular run, your team is locked  -- you can unlock new characters but they cannot join your party, they are available for future parties, and your traits are also locked after you start the run -- but the characters also have temporary growth where they can add perks that enhance them in different ways.

You can ultimately unlock 4 characters in each of four classes (Tank, Physical DPS, Elemental/Magical DPS, and Healer). Some cards are shared across a class, but each character has unique traits that give them their own niche within the class. If you're not being challenged enough, some encounters allow you to choose a more difficult option (for greater, perhaps unique rewards) and you can always crank up the overall difficulty (Madness level) in increments.

The game has a light feel with its cartoon look, and it lets you play hardcore min-max, risk death every fight, or it lets you play more methodically and experimentally and you don't lose everything when your party wipes. (You have the option to replay the last fight, otherwise the party is disbanded and you start another.) Very clever variety, and in the forums you'll often see discussions about ""I don't get this character, they seem so weak"" where people contribute insights and you see how that character is actually quite strong if you understand things and use them in the right party combinations.

You're also not restriced as to what classes you put in a party, nor where you place them front-to-back. (The front character bears more damage because there are more ""attack the front character"" cards that exist.) Once you form your party and start, the front-to-back order is locked, but if you want you can run a party of four healers. (Some healers can also be built to be good damage dealers.) Your order within a turn is dynamic and can be modified by curses (debuffs) or auras (buffs), and equipment, though each character does have a base speed.

You may read reviews addressing the Paradox launcher. These idiots would boycott a great game and deny its devs the finances to continue maintaining and improving it, all because ""Privacy!!"". Yeah, except they are posting their reviews on Steam, which requires an account and has their credit card information. So much for their vaunted privacy. The Paradox lanucher is not intrusive, it doesn't crash, and you don't need a Paradox account to use it. Don't be put off from a great game!",1701710640,1704037726,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The meta progression is perhaps a bit too extreme which limits the possibility of defeating the final boss until you play around 5 or so rounds so you can level up enough to get the relevant perks to your character.

The games equivalence to Slay the spire's ascensions are pretty decent adding for interesting modifiers that can greatly add to the difficulty and change how you build you deck.

The recent change that forces the Paradox launcher into the game whilst unneeded has also created an extremely over dramatic surge of negative reviews that really don't represent how bad the launcher is. I saw claims that it shovels ads to you which at least I don't see with my experience and its literally just one additional click. Below is a link of me launching Across the Obelisk

I ve been playing since one of the earliest betas and it keeps me coming back.

You like deckbuilding?
You like character building?
You like to develope New tacticts and find New combos?

Then ATO is the game for you!
4 Heros, each one unique enough to put some hours in to figure out how it wants to be played, only to throw everything overboard because you find a New nieche interaction  with some of the others.

The longest time my buddy and i thought to have figured out the meta and it Won US every game.
After perfecting it we began to brew and found at least 8 New combinations that are close enough and in our opinion more fun to play since the ""old"" strat revolved around a single item that is rng based to get.

The point is, this is the only rogue like deckbuilder where you can achieve your Strategie consistent enough to play a single style all the way which gives you a posibility to perfect play style, but it gives you unlimited ways to play diffrent.

So there is something for any play style.

There is only one thing that is bothering me a bit but lately it got way better.
The dlc inconsistency.

First dlc was cosmetic only which is fine. Get it you like some customisation which adds nothing to gameplay.

2nd Wolf wars: you get one New character and an way to long dungeon where you play with pretty boring characters. You most likely only play this onece to unlock the New hero which seems to suck at first glance but recently we had the un of hour lifetimes playing with his meat.

3rd dlc: 2 New characters a whole New act, many New enemies, some New bosses.
The price tag is slightly high but i would recommend since the New Heros are insanely fun since they are double class and add way more possibilitys.

4th dlc: 1 New character and not much more i think but it is reasonable prized and the hero is at a whole New level. 
Cant relly say anything about her since she seems highly specific in playstyle but once we fogured out her playstyle i bet she will be insanely strong and gives US a lot of New comps.


In short:
Try the base game at first. It is worth its money anyway.
Play together with a friend since 4 character at the same time can feel a bit overwhelming as a beginner.
When you think you understand the game, get the third dlc and start a over again xD

The DLC pricing has been pretty off so far, but the most recent one has been a solid step in the right direction.

They've added a launcher recently as they've gone from Paradox Arc to the more mainstay Paradox Interactive.  This has rubbed some people the wrong way as they didn't give people much of a heads up it was coming, which is understandable.  In the end it doesn't bother me much as I've actually played games here in modern times.  Often times its not up to the devs, but rather the publisher.

So you have 4 classes of heroes, You assemble a team of 4 heroes. Each of them has different starting cards (""skills""), possible bonuses from level ups and table of perks you assign before the game.
So already here you have a lot of possibilities. 

Then you start the game which is somewhat proceduraly generated.
At the beginining of each Act you enter a city where you can spend resources to craft or upgrade cards, remove them, buy equipment. 
Then you embark on your journey where you move between nodes, fight encounters and resolve events until you fight Act Boss. After killing the boss you move onto next Act and next region and so on. 
On the journey you will find new cards, corrupted monsters (harder versions that grant yield better rewards) and other stuff that may help you or curse you. You fight through all the bosses or die somewhere in the middle and you go again from the start - just like in all roguelikes.

Pretty fun game, lots of experimentation, lots of builds and decisions to make. 
If you are a fan of StS or DD or generally rougelites, card games and turn-based RPG strategies it's definitely worth a try. 
And all of those guys crying over added launcher - for real you haven't found anything more worthwhile crying over?? It's barely noticable. It runs fast (in opposition to most paradox launchers) and doesn't run when you game.

It's not perfect, but the flaws don't really matter until after you've sunk in enough hours worth to have more than gotten your money's worth (and I'm still playing despite them).

Cons:
- New players in a group with max rank players feel kinda useless.
- Per-character game-changer abilities aren't acquired until a few encounters before the final boss.
- The DLC characters etc. feel pretty power-creepy.
- The wolf-wars DLC area is pretty boring. The character you get is flavorful and fun, though.
- The story is paper-thin, and the writing quality gets a bit spotty in places (but not bad overall, and can be funny).
- Runs well on a steam deck, but some of the text can be hard to read. Not an issue once you're familiar with the cards, but not good when you're starting out.

I'd only consider the last one as a possible deal-breaker.  The rest are minor issues.

Pros:
- The core gameplay loop is solid.  Slay the Spire players will feel right at home.
- Characters of the same job/class can feel quite different.  Build diversity is pretty good.
- Executing a specific build for a character is always doable; the question is if the random battle rewards will hand you what you need, or if you'll have to scrounge up gold/shards to buy your kit in town.
- Healers can do solid DPS.  Also, no-healer runs are totally doable.
- Optimized builds can get pretty bonkers DPS output. Feels good when you do it.
- Multiplayer doesn't feel like you're only playing half a game (there's enough going on to keep you thinking).
- The semi-randomized map rewards both exploring unknown nodes to find cool new things, as well as system mastery (""oh, if we go here then here, we can get X, which can be used in the next act to unlock Y"" etc.),  This is surprisingly rewarding to play through.
- There are a ton of per-character custom responses to various event nodes on the map that are pretty well thought out.

- Monsters have 1-4 action cards each and are usually a pack of 3-4 in a fight, meaning you can get a lot of block of actions where you can only watch while the enemies do their thing. I found myself doing other things in the meantime. Sadly, this problem is still relevant, even if you set the game to fast mode. My solution would have been fewer actions per enemy but more effect per card. 

- Progression (run-overreaching) is slow and often seems a bit underwhelming. It's probably great once you have enough ""perk points"" to unlock a big chunk of the individual skill trees, but before that, getting +1 heal or +1 damage isn't really interesting. 

- Card rarities feel underwhelming. You would think that the power difference between a common and a legendary card would be drastic, but that's not how it is. In fact,  it seems the difference is so minute, that a lot of uncommon or rare cards see far more use. Mostly, rarity primarily offers variety in effects.",1703283728,1703289082,False,6,0,0.523622035980224609,0,True,False,False

Once again passing the responsibility to the consumer to handle fixing the game and using work-arounds instead of just delivering a working product. If you know the history of the paradox launcher you know the chances of them fixing it is slim to none, and going off what I'm seeing on the official discord it seems like the devs will be using the 'wait them out' strategy while complaining about review bombs as if people unable to play the game they purchased is unworthy of a negative review.

The most important thing to say is that if you have played paradox games before (with their launcher) and know for a fact you can launch, and are okay with your data being sold (read the TOS, also google it, its not exactly hidden), then this game is a great purchase and I sincerely hope you give it a try. The reason this is a negative review is because whats different from other paradox games: they introduced the launcher two or so years post launch.

Why is this different? Because when you buy a paradox game and you can't get past the launcher... you just refund it. No harm no foul, right? But introducing a launcher two years after release means (some) players who have bought and supported this game in the time before it was even published by paradox (it use to be independent) can no longer play the game they purchased. 

Not only that though, but this denies the 'don't like it, don't buy it' principle. The paradox launcher is known to sell your data. When we purchased this game two years ago (or anytime before the update), we didn't agree to our data being sold. If we had a problem with this we wouldn't have bought it. But its too late, isn't it? The introduction of the launcher changed the terms post-purchase.

Thats not the only reason for the negative review though. The devs of the game, who i genuinely believe have the best of intentions, are unable to handle criticisms or the consequences of their own actions. When they made a deal with paradox they presumably received a lot of benefit and support. It might even have saved this game, I don't know. That is a good consequence of that decision, but the bad consequences are that paradox have some level of control and leeway in terms of what happens; like forcing a launcher. Why I bring this up is because, on the official discord, the devs seem to be subtly trying to shift blame to paradox (they probably can't outright do it due to... conflicts). And its not the first time either. If you've seen the reviews on the DLC you'll notice a common trend of pricing issues. Guess what the response was to all that drama? 'lol paradox'. 

And no, using a player work around (you can find it on steam discussions, guides, and i think i saw it posted as a review) is not adequate. Heading down the path in which responsibility of the games integrity is shifted to the consumer instead of the company is not a good thing. If the solution to the game's potential future problems amounts to 'players have to fix it themselves' then this game is headed for disaster.

And one more point; the devs (and some of the white knights on the discord server) seem to think this game is being review bombed. The argument is mostly that its not reviewing the gameplay itself. So I'm just going to say this quickly; do you think the inability to experience the gameplay due to you including a launcher that is known to be terrible (seriously, just google plethora of problems surrounding the paradox launcher) is grounds for a bad review? When they literally cannot get into the game to experience said gameplay anymore?

The devs are good people. No, i truly believe that. They are willing to listen to the community in regards to feedback, but not to criticism. They are the kind of people who got into game dev to make great games, but they are not the kind of people prepared for public facing positions. They did what was necessary to keep their game alive by signing with paradox, and thats a good thing, but are unwilling to accept the negative consequences associated for that decision.",1702544038,1703210960,False,82,0,0.81735914945602417,0,True,False,False

Let me be clear, there is no valid reason to have included this PC bloat launcher (real funny how Risk of Rain gets stats without an independent launcher). Nor is there a good reason for saves to break. Plenty of games have frequent updates and saves/accounts turn out fine at the end of the day. Ive seen Hogwarts Legacy, Elden Ring, Subnautica, Warframe, Smite, Raft, Skyrim, Cyberpunk 2077, No Man's Sky, etc. all have major updates and they successfully manage to preserve a players progress, account data (for the multi-player games), and save files. With *very* limited exceptions, games should not be ruining saves with updates.

The DLC quality has been all over the spectrum. They've made some strides to correct the biggest issues but core decisions like the way the Wolf Wars campaign played out will always remain.

Signing with Paradox was worrying, their games tend to have heavy monetization. The most recent update added Paradox's launcher to the game. There are some workarounds to get past it and the account requirement for now. There's an update from Dreamsite justifying it but at the end of the day it's just there to help collect more information on you.

Well, because the launcher breaks the game. I even just bought the DLC, but the game doesn't work. Actually, the game probably works, but I can't get to you because the launcher fails. Bootstrapper.exe won't launch. 

Apparently, the brilliant minds behind the launcher never considered that some people might install their games on a different drive from where they install Steam. OH - and devs note that it also is frequently flagged as a virus. Not concerning at all. Nope. Nothing to see here.

So there's a 12-step program that involves uninstalling, re-installing, logging on as an admin, manually putting exceptions into your antivirus, and making blood sacrifices to the great goat-god. That's before the issues around corporate launchers kick in.

So a game I loved won't run because you added this completely unnecessary launcher. And it's somehow on me to spend the next few hours I would be gaming on making this - maybe - work?

Life's too short, and there are too many good games. I'm out.

I have read every ""whoops, didn't see this backlash coming"" response from these two and by the third time, the naive excuse has worn thin. 

Take a look at the comments on their latest community post. It sums up the feelings I have perfectly. This was avoidable. You didn't have to go with Paradox, but they showed you a shiny gem and you didn't believe enough in yourselves to take a second and look at all the successful indie publishers on this platform. You could have come up with ways to include us, your fans willing to go the distance, into giving you further publicity by making community events to have us share this game. There were options to advertise, there were pathways to further success, but now we're stuck watching this game get ground down by a company notorious for doing so. I'm getting off here. Such a disappointment. 

8/17/2023 EDIT: Had to change my review because - I'm sorry, $20 for your DLC? The game not on a sale is $20 and you're telling me that when you added 1 zone and 2 characters that was worth as much as the base game that gave you 5 zones and 10+ characters? What a disgusting, scummy practice. 

You even had the gall to brag about how well this game has done, becoming one of the most popular deck builders on steam. So...why the money grab? Should be a simple win to sell this DLC at $12 or even $10. You would have easily gotten half of your fanbase - if not more - that would have bought it, THEN marketed it to their friends and given you free publicity, driving more sales, making you over $1M, and that's me being conservative in my math using the numbers YOU gave me in the community post.

On December 12th 2023 they brought a new character DLC to the game and around that time an update.
I clicked on the button on steam to update my game (as you normally do on other games too) and without my consent or permission the first thing the game did was to download and install the launcher. But I just wanted to play the game and not get a launcher installed, that tells me to get a paradox account. 
I wanted to press the ""PLAY"" button like before to simply hop in and play. 

I don´t want the paradox launcher and I didn´t pay for it to get installed and if anyone comes here around to be funny and say ""oh wow you got something for free"" then I will respond ""Malware"" is free too and I avoid it. 

But lets be serious now. This sudden change of a 3rd party programm came without my consent. The worst part is that you can´t even get a REFUND now, since you played the old version for so long. 

Normally if things change in a contract or so, then people get informed that there is a change soon to be happening and that they can quit said contract or step back from it for free if they do not want these changes to happen. 
We didn´t get this option here. No one informed us about this step or change and we weren´t given the chance to step back from it in time or get a refund. 

The other part is that the DEVs announced ""possible integration of mods in the future through the launcher"".
I wonder how they gonna do it, since there have been no changes in the game code so far to make this possible. 

All in all this is a good game. Otherwise I wouldn´t have played it for so long, but the recent changes are non that I like. If it wasn´t for the launcher and all the shady things that come with paradox and their launcher I would have continued to support the DEVs, but this is a direction I will not support.",1703023382,1703023382,False,10,0,0.532338976860046387,0,True,False,False

This game is straight up amazing. I have mostly played coop with another friend or two. The amount of different synergies and ways you can build each individual character and party overall is phenomenal.

Comments/reviews that you should straight up ignore include:
-added paradox launcher (omg wah wah). Yes clicking one more button to play the game is ""annoying"". Learn to read and you can bypass the launcher completely - problem solved unless you have low IQ. However they probably should have communicated it out (as they stated in patch notes and apologized).
-""The Devs decided to turn their passion project into a business, and I can't support that business as it stands"" LOL - get f***ing real kid. Who expects people to work for free and deliver more content/updates for your enjoyment in exchange for absolutely nothing. Holy moly I just can't even..
-DLCs are ""overpriced"" - don't be poor then.. Sarcasm, some of them are slightly overpriced for the content such as wolf wars. The character DLCs though (2 paladin one and queen) really aren't overpriced for how much replayability they add.. The paladin one adds an entire new zone, few pets, and 2 characters that are really fun to play and very versatile. The Queen DLC adds a new mage which again can change your entire party synergy/builds.

TLDR: ignore the review bombing.. they are literally from children or basement dwellers. The game is phenomenal and I really hope work continues and more DLC comes.

- Right-click Across The Obelisk in your Steam library and select ""Manage"" > ""Browse local files""

- Locate and right-click on the ""AcrossTheObelisk.exe"" and select ""Copy as path"" 

- Go back to the Steam window and right-click Across The Obelisk again, this time selecting ""Poperties""

- You will see a ""Launch Options"" box under the ""General"" tab, right-click and select ""Paste""

- Add quotation marks to the beginning and end of the pasted path, it should look something like this: ""C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Across the Obelisk/AcrossTheObelisk.exe"" (the drive letter will be whatever drive you have the games installed on)

- Type %command% after the pasted path in quotes, which should look like: ""C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Across the Obelisk/AcrossTheObelisk.exe"" %command%

- Close the window and start Across The Obelisk through Steam as normal

- Enjoy the game we love and reject corporate capitalistic opportunism at every juncture we can manage

Copy the game's exe path and paste it into launch options, adding quotation marks to the path and %command% afterwords, then launch the game.

[strike] Let's be clear, adding a 3rd party launcher without warning (and a notorious one at that), [i] WITHOUT [/i] adding this information to the steam page, or even letting players know through an update post, [i] let alone [/i] just a simple post on the Discussions page is slimy at best. You need to set this straight, ideally by eliminating the launcher altogether. [/strike] Thank you for your response, apology, and explanation. Sorry it took getting review bombed to make it so.

I really hope that Paradox Interactive was the reason the DLC practices were so aggressively anti-consumer. Stellaris is the same way. If that was the devs' idea... yeah.

The devs have cooked up a magnificent game here borrowing the familiar flavors that we know and love; spiced with a bit of Darkest Dungeon, a pinch of Slay the Spire, a sprinkle of World of Warcraft and layer on that fantasy feel of D&D. It's all stewed together for something unique and refreshing, and it's made even better with co-op. My chief complaint is honestly the aesthetics, which won't be an issue for many players. The graphics are reminiscent of the old browser/flash games of 2007 like Adventure Quest and unfortunately the (royalty free?) sound effects are at the same level.

Across the Obelisk is a fantastic entry into the rogue-like deckbuilders and it is especially exciting for players that have been hoping for a co-op experience in the genre.

EDIT: After the review bombing by everyone annoyed with the launcher (because shocker it does affect the game and thus can be a reason to leave a bad review) in their discord its just disappointing how the Dev's are handling the situation. They are playing a crying victim card or straight up just mocking the people upset by this. It really is painting everything else that is happening in a worse light personally. Its highly unprofessional to be so dismissive of peoples complaints.

The base game is still pretty good, but this sh!t is scummy to say the least. Basically another overpriced Paradox DLC spam.

One of, if not THE deepest roguelike deckbuilder mechanically with a no-small-bonus in a form of a fully functional CO-OP MODE for up to 4 people, which the genre painfully lacks to this day.

Can't remember another deckbuilding game (and boy did I play a plenty), in which it was THIS much fun to experiment with decks this far into the game. It is in no small part due to an insane amount of interactions between the archetypes thanks both to the class system and an extensive list of buff/debuffs.

To name just one example:
You can build your priest to do shadow damage by either stacking dark charges, OR playing of of your rogue and exploding their poison stacks into shadow damage, OR go the insanity charges route with a madness ring, OR by doing 50/50 Holy and Shadow and stacking bless charges on yourself (OR just do it without dipping into holy), OR combine any of them in a wombo-combo type of blend, which applies 3 different resistance-reducing stacks with each hit of your repeating spells to setup a oneshot.

All of these seemingly endless build possibilities are viable and distinctly unique, which makes this game infinitely replayable and just as enjoyable.

There are so many different paths you can take that each experience will be different.

[b][u] Workaround/Skip Launcher:[/u][/b]
This workaround relies on directly launching the game from the executable. This workaround is specific to Linux versions, though can be easily modified for Windows users.

    1.) Right click the game in your library
    2.) Click 'Manage' and 'Browse Local Files'
    3.) A folder should open up, click the file location, copy it, and paste it somewhere you can type
    4.) At the end type: ""[b]/AcrossTheObelisk.x86_64[/b]"" (Instead type: ""[b]\AcrossTheObelisk.exe[/b]"" for windows). (Do not include the "" "")
    5.) Put the entire path quotation marks ("" "")
    6.) Add a space and %command% at the end. As an example:

    ""/home/wingedhussar/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Across the Obelisk/AcrossTheObelisk.x86_64"" %command%

    **If you are running a windows machine, replace [b]/AcrossTheObelisk.x86_64[/b] with [b]\AcrossTheObelisk.exe[/b]
    
7. Right click the game again and click properties
8. In 'General' you will see 'Launch Options"" at the bottom. Paste what you wrote there
9. Game will now start without the launcher

[strike]A great game for sure.

What I love:
- You have multiple choices for different location nodes with special interactions from the different characters and quest/reward items which increases replayability a lot.
- Interesting perks (meta progression).

What I don't like:
- Multiplayer desync issues. These are quite common. Thankfully the game saves the progress every turn.
- Can't build decks in the menu to theory craft. It's really annoying to start a game just so you can build a deck which also costs shards. Then if you want to make a change and ran out of the starting shards you need to create a new game plus have all the crystal perks on all characters or you'll need to spend your game rewards otherwise.

However, after putting the game on ice for a moment, it has come to my attention that it is now served with an extra launcher outside of steam along with new conditions of use that cannot be refused unless you're willing to not update your version of the game anymore. And why is it so problematic you might ask? 
First, because it serves no purpose other than advertising other games the 'paradox' company offers (When I bought a copy of the game it was an independant studio working on the game).
Second this launcher brings in a heap of others ads besides the ones about their own products, bugs preventing the launch of the game and other shady spyware (Their TOS mentions the sale of user data). Because a practice is legal doesn't mean it isn't foul. It is also extremely disrespectful for the previous player base that bought the game to shamelessly force them into using a third party software to keep playing the game they love.

To top it off, the launcher itself is buggy, keeps on popping up on the screen after the game launch and being a hindrance to anyone's gaming experience. It also now requires an internet connection to play a single player game.

I righteously feel entitled to refuse using this launcher that wasn't part of the game initially. Had I been informed of this inclusion at the moment of purchase I wouldn't have bought it.

On another subject, the prices of the dlc's have been increasingly more expensive lately along their content being poorer and we might yet again see a game that switches it's focus to selling skins and emotes rather than good gameplay.

To conclude, I still think the core content of the game is good, however if you decide to play it, you must also agree to install a less than friendly launcher that comes with it's load of issues, will scrape your data and sell it.

(Way to poison the well for other indie developers-- I'll think twice before making those kinds of purchases again.) In addition to business issues, the new mechanics added in recent updates are not fun or well balanced. It's a shame things went this way. AtO was IMO the best cooperative multiplayer deck builder around. 

I wish it were possible to leave a neutral review. It feels bad to ""not recommend"" a game I got so many hours of enjoyment from, but the fact is that the game I played with friends for over 300 hours is not what it was.

- Good game, tons of fun, great value (I'm currently $0.28/h at full price), especially on sale. Easy to get into deck builder with long term upgrades bringing you back.
- One of the better games to play co-op with your friends, especially if your skill levels vary greatly in games.

Neutral
- Just a comment amidst current downvote brigade. Paradox helped publish since Aug 2022 people noticed now because they added a launcher. The launcher does NOT require you to log into a Paradox account currently, nor does it have ads as some have claimed.

Negatives
- Legit just not a fan of having a launcher, but it's 1 extra click to play, no login needed.
- Questionable DLC pricing.

Takeaway: Very highly recommended. DLC pricing is questionable but certainly worth grabbing as a bundle sale, and very fun as a base game! By contrast, I think the base game itself is undervalued.",1702610247,1702610247,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It plays much more like an RPG where you must die (or end your run, but typically die) to get stronger and then do the same content again to be able to conquer it. It's slightly different than most games of this genre, as you don't rely on luck so much as foreknowledge of what courses/events to take. You can even (mostly) purchase your entire deck from the first town, even some killer combos - BUT, you have to unlock the cards first and carry over enough resources from your previous run. 

Pros:
Great graphics.
Smooth gameplay.
Cards and mechanics are easy to understand from text descriptions.
Decent music.
Large variety of enemies and attacks. 

Cons:
Sheer number of cards (seriously, it's quite large when you consider 4 archetypes for each class, and there's 4 classes, yielding 16 different deck types to familiarize yourself with). 
Lengthy gameplay. A run make take you 3+ hours. 
The main game doesn't have randomized events (mostly). They are pretty much set each go. 
You must use cards/abilities to see enemy intents. This is a large handicap where you can often feel powerless to counter or stop an enemy. 
4 party members each have 4 different decks/card pools to manage. It's a bit much when sometimes all you wish to do is sit down and play a card game for a bit. That isn't this game. 

***UPDATE***
The developers of this game have sold out to Paradox Interactive. Paradox has decided to add their own Launcher to the game, their own licensing agreements, and their own data collection malware to the package.

A few more negatives to add to the below mentioned ones:

- The quality of the Wolf Wars skins are lacking compared to the others, except Bree's for some reason
- Wolf Wars as a scenario is very unfun
- You're limited to 5 saved Perk trees per character, for reasons. Saved decks have a similar issue
- A basic ""next/previous character"" key to move between perk trees among my party would be pretty neat

Edit: Reworded a bit to sound less mean

If you mainly want to play co-op with friends and you think the price is fair, I'd recommend it. Otherwise here's a list of why I'd recommend other deckbuilders instead (a short bullet list because I suck at writing and don't feel like rambling):

- Runs are too much of a time sink and there's some quality of life missing to help you experiment with different team setups in a timely manner
- The game arbitrarily punishes you for not winning fights in ~1-3 turns by offering you crap cards and resources, despite giving you an absurd amount of options for building the kind of team you want (safer teams that aren't hyper offensive = bad at game)
- Madness levels, the way AtO adds extra challenge to runs, are probably some of the most unfun, uninteresting, frustrating ways of adding difficulty that I've experienced in a game. They lazily nerf anything even remotely strong and/or interesting for the player while making enemies godlike (and random if you chose that corruptor). I love challenging games, but holy crap M16 is a joke. You can make a game brutally difficult without gutting the tools that make the game fun for the player

The map where you choose your path is full of secrets and quests to complete.

It does rely quite a bit on ""meta progression"" and it's RPG part to be successful, as each run will get you ressources and XP for your heroes. It seems unlikely that you would be able to finish the campaign in one run, however you can get past the first boss for sure unlike some claims I've seen (Did it with no prior knowledge). I can see how some people might dislike that hence the mention, to me it's an incentive to keep on playing discovering new cards, creating better decks and getting my heroes stronger.

A very solid game.

Update: Early access is over; the game is polished with a lot of content and replayability. One of the best game in its genre.

Update after 2 DLCs: I can't get myself to change the review but it has to be said that the DLCs are utterly overpriced. Shame on paradox.

After almost 100 hrs, me and a friend have smashed through most of the game but can't stop playing. We've had so much fun finding new strats or synergies/combos with every run we do.

The game itself is pretty easy to pick up after only a run, but at first it can seem really overwhelming. Don't really worry about doing well at first. At any time if things are just too hard, you can retreat in any combat at any time to start a new run with a chunk of the resources you earned. It keeps the loop from being punishing and gives players incentive to pull the plug if a run is doomed or going too far for your current abilities. I honestly don't have any complaints about combat or any of the actual gameplay. Building decks and finding different equipment to build around has really kept this fresh for me now that I'm deep into the upgrade trees. A run is more akin to a dungeon crawl in a DnD sessions than it is Slay the Spire. Each hex has either a combat encounter, event, or a shop to buy new gear for your squad. Events play out like a skill check in an RPG with a dice roll represented by the cards in your deck. The outcomes can be devastating if you lose them, but you're usually treated to a quick laugh to dull the pain. Winning a roll can sometimes make an entire run a stroll down Easy Street at the same time which makes these choices even harder. Every run in Adventure Mode can be totally different with each setup, so change your team for more (and oftentimes better) outcomes.

Every character has a distinct personality and skill set that can help determine what kind of deck you build for them. I personally love Cornelius, the long winded and goofy old fire mage for some of his speech options during events. You also have separate skill trees for everyone and you can even save different builds for them to change it up once you've gotten into building teams with specific strats in mind. There's just a lot of flexibility in how you use each character and it really blows my mind (try Reggie with holy and fire specs! You won't regret it!)

I love the visuals for this game in a weird nostalgic way. It reminds me of a flash game I'd be obsessed with as a kid in the 2000s. It all feels and looks a little janky, but it still oozes this sense of personality. The non combat events that can pop up have led to some big laughs with the writing, as well as some genuinely cool moments that really surprised my friend and I. Don't be fooled by the look of this game. There's tons to do and lots of surprises waiting for you and your friends. There's also some great references to WoW, Magic the Gathering, and other fantasy games or media that'll give you a chuckle when you see them.

With the recent update, the devs have added the integration of the Paradox Interactive launcher. This move feels like a publisher influenced one and the launcher itself provides no useful purpose to a casual fan of Paradox games like myself. I have no will to play a grand strat game at all so it seems like a pointless addition to me and probably a lot of other players. That said, it's easy to bypass once it launches but the inclusion in general is more bloatware than it is helpful. I don't get all the chuds melting down about it as harsh as they are, but it's just a minor setback to playing a great game. The only other negative I have is that the DLC can be a bit sparse for what you pay, but all of them add something worthwhile if you really dig the base game.

This is a real gem and I highly encourage card game and board game dorks to give it a try. For maximum enjoyment, bring 3 other friends for a good time. Outstanding little game with a surprising amount of stuff buried into it.",1702492345,1702492345,True,0,0,0.490412235260009766,0,True,False,False

A solid deck-builder, with basic RPG mechanics.

Style of play is a mix between Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon. Combat can get a bit hectic, especially with the variety of buffs and de-buffs that characters and monsters can sling. Additionally, the speed at which monsters take their turn really leaves you in a daze about what just happened to you, what how you can counter it, and what tools you have at your disposal to work towards the future. Even though I felt in good hands with the general flow of combat, I always felt like I could be alive, dead, or anywhere in-between after a monster's turn, no matter how I built or what I did.

I like the style of play, but playing all four characters is way too much cognitive load. Playing with others is fun, but sessions are way too long to encourage play with randos, with typical game lengths of 3-4 hours, even if you know what you're doing.

ORIGINAL REVIEW LEFT FOR COMPLETENESS

Overall an excellent game and wonderful addition to the genre. If you play the game just to experience a majority of it and see what it has to offer, you'll comfortably get your value out of the game at full price. If you're into build-making or min-maxing, you'll get more. If you're into completion, or challenging yourself at the highest difficulty, you could probably buy the game three or four times and still be comfortably ahead in terms of time to value. Co-op just adds to the fun, in my opinion, and it's my understanding that there's even a limited scope of mods available for the game--hopefully we'll see that expand more in the future.

On to the details! The above is your tl;dr! Stop here if you're the ain't-nobody-got-time type.

Regarding the base game, there's really something here for just about everyone that enjoys this style of game. There's your true roguelike experience with random deck draws, no permanent perk progression, random maps and events, a difficulty system, and even a score mechanic if that's your cup of tea. There's the challenge mode which at least for one cycle, will net you a cosmetic unlock once per week until it loops and repeats, but also offers an interesting challenge with upsides and downsides--just a different spin on the roguelike game mode mentioned, really. And then there's your campaign/journey mode, which is where I've spent most of my time. Here is where you get your permanent level/perk progression system, as well as your more dynamic difficulty and challenge scaling. This is also where you can begin building your individual knowledge base of what nodes contain what events and rewards and what optimal pathing may look like on a given run with a given team. For challenge runs, this sort of strategizing is quite fun, in my opinion.

For characters, you have your four class archetypes, and then a character under that archetype will have their own intended forms of specialization--though there's more flexibility here than it first seems once you account for cards and items. And, of course, you don't have to keep your party to the standard warrior/scout/mage/healer kit--this too is up to preference. You can do four healers if that's how you want to be. Considering all available characters, I definitely find some scale better than others, and are just outright stronger or more versatile/less subject to randomness, but each character is nonetheless distinct and has a compelling role they can fit into that is viable at essentially all challenge levels. I can't commend the devs enough for managing to make such a broad roster of characters without having any be obvious throwaways. 

Relating to the above, the card system is excellent. I very much enjoy the upgrade choices that cards offer, as well as the class-based internal synergy between cards that can be possible. The variety of damage types, debuffs, and secondary effects available to each class also makes for a great deal of variety in build setup and makes for a large base of opportunity to synergize across party/class members. I'll also note that great care was given to card rarities and effects--higher rarity cards absolutely come with power and usefulness to match, but at the same time do not do so in a capacity that makes them mandatory--a run is never completely derailed because you didn't see that ""one card"" or failed to roll a mythic.

The same follows for items: a great variety, with many options, where rarity presents a dramatic power spike, but nonetheless almost all items are themselves clearly beneficial, with many even at the lower rarities even being compelling or build defining. In general, it feels that a great deal of care was put into making choices feel meaningful and fun, and where they can't be, ensuring that the choices made are still between resource benefit and usefulness, such that a reward doesn't feel wasted. This is especially true with challenge effects enabled.

With nowhere in particular to put this, it gets awkwardly tacked on to the end. A lot of games with this degree of variety in effects and complexity fail to convey information effectively. Here, the game provides an exhaustive encyclopedia/codex documenting all cards, items, unlocks, effects, and so forth. Effects--damage types, buffs, debuffs--each have their own definition and specified impact. Moreover, each card/item can be right clicked to bring up a detail window displaying upgrades and a tooltip for relevant effects pulled directly from the encyclopedia/codex. (Cards that generate other cards can run into some issues here, but there's not very many of those.) For those disparaging the game for not explaining things clearly, I can only say that this is a user-error issue.

About DLC's:

There's no two ways around this--people are upset about the DLC's, and are likely to continue to be. Whether or not it's justified, that's for you to decide. I will just provide some information to help you make that decision. First of all, when considering the value of the DLC, I would remind others upset at the pricing to assess the value they received from the base game. Personally, at >300 hours in for a $20 game, the price of the DLC is arguably irrelevant. Individually, the DLC's certainly are priced high for the content they include, but they're adding to this particular base game and further funding updates and development to this game--which, incidentally, each DLC has come with a decently sized base game update. Nevertheless, it's to the individual purchaser to decide if the value of the base game merits leniency for the value of the DLC's. Either way, I would just caution the more emotionally invested among us to remember that it is the publisher, Paradox, that determines pricing, not the developer. Please phrase your feedback accordingly.

Beyond this, I will just clarify the DLC content. 

The Wolf Wars DLC is a more lore/story-focused DLC. Not lasting, repeatable content. It unlocks some character skins, a pet, and a new potential party member. To be clear, this was explicitly stated by the developers during the DLC development, prior to release, and on release. I am also telling you here. If you buy that DLC, and are then disappointed that you only care about playing through it once and it's otherwise a nuisance for min-maxing because of the pet corruption--that's on you. Seriously. This is stick-in-the-bicycle-spokes meme material.

The Ulminin DLC is much broader in scope, with an entirely new map area (which is more work than people seem to realize), new enemies, new bosses, new cards (possibly--I can't recall if the new cards are just the character cards and the rest added are free to the base game, or if there's more than just character cards added), new items, new pets, and new characters which themselves add in the new function of being dual-class characters (allowing for two-deck types to be mixed [this is fixed; you can't pick and choose which two classes]).

That's it. I'm done now. You're free!",1698008975,1702427593,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

    [*]If you have a friend to play coop this game is ideal. The runs are really long (2-4h) and playing four players means every  turn takes a lot of time. 
    [*]the difficulty is adequate.
    [*]the game forces you to grind quite a bit, but it is not an annoying grinding.
    [*]map design could be better it should be easier to know where you are and where you can go.
    [*]music is nothing remarkable.
    [*]after finishing it once, unless you enjoy playing in ""Madness"" difficulty the game becomes a bit too repetitive, and tedious at times, but it has a lot of replayability for its price.
[/list]

There are other similar games such as Gordian Quest which is a boring version of Across the Obelisk; then there is Griftlands from a popular game maker, a terrible game in all aspects but mostly really boring. Avoid.

With this, this game is probably the third best option out there right now if you are looking for a deck builder. 

If you can get it around 12€ or less, it is a good purchase even for a solo player.

You can stop whenever you want and continue later on as a session can take 2+ hours with friends. I also like the fact that they also support selfish decision making, meaning that in case when multiple options are given, players can vote whatever they want to go for and it will be decided with a built-in tie breaker.

There are so many ways to build your deck and most of them are viable. However, I still miss some characters or cards to support certain builds (or maybe I am bad).

Furthermore, there are several ways to progress permanently. Such as perk points, character ranks, town/shop upgrades, retaining currencies for future runs. All these ways to progress are extremely satisfying as you notably see the change from a ""trying to survive"" to a ""make fun builds"" playthrough. As what I notice from many roguelike games is that shops are usually extremely expensive and when you purchase something it usually feels like selling a kidney or two.

The price for the base game is totally worth it. In terms of DLCs, The Sands of Ulminin on paper brings quite some content, but not a huge fan of the content. The Wolf Wars character Yogger is a great and fun asset on the other hand!",1701171180,1701171180,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Across the Obelisk does a good job with this by having different card sets per role and several characters per role that allow for a couple of themes each.

Characters also get points to distribute that can help further define their emphasis such as increased piercing damage, bleed damage, healing done, etc.

In addition to per character decks, characters chosen and their deck styles allow for quite a bit of synergy between characters.

Overall this makes for a lot of choice in how you can play.

There are a lot of unlocks to pick up: characters, card collection, items, and pets.
Some of them can be a bit hard to get because of RNG involved but the majority will happen through several runs.

I have really enjoyed this game for the balance of themes on characters and openness to kind of do what you want when trying to build into themes.

For now, SPLENDID.  Lots of variation on what you can do with your deck.  Some very interesting decision making when it comes to using resources --- do I remove a card I don't use? Upgrade a card?  Buy a new one?  All armor or weapons...   
The animation is great. The fights are complex almost right out of the gate: do I hit the front enemy?  Or do I hit the enemy further back who seems more dangerous?  Do I heal, or attack.
The game does an excellent job of making even minor decisions weighty.

Your TLDR is that it's a good game. It does well in almost every category and average in 1.  With the right DLC, I think this could easily graduate into one of the best games in it's genre of all time. 

Gameplay - 

You have the basic Darkest Dungeon playstyle. You control 4 characters who each have their own abilities. Each Character usually has about 2 archtypes that they can fall under depending on their specialization.  You can further level this up by collecting points and pets from previous playthroughs to catapult you ahead and this all feels very good with tons of replayability.

Dollar per Hour?

I've enjoyed 66 hours throughly on this game and I think I paid under 20. If this game was a 60 dollar game. I would not be regretting my purchase but with the smaller price tag.

Something tells me most people that recommend this game, with no critique, really have little exposure to the genre, don't value their time, and are easily distracted by flashy presentation.

My main issue, besides the mentioned lack of actual strategy, would be that difficulty can swing WILDLY based on lead in events succeeding or failing, forcing you to always click default or wait till you've... uh... GRINDED your way through a few more hours of meta progression, so you can just ROFLSTOMP into the next map, and push through more grind/meta progression all over again.

I could write a very long review on this game, but if you love coop, or controling multiple slay the spire like characters at once and maybe you have a vast background knowledge of strategy and card games? You will not only get the pretty much perfect game, but also tons of fun references and great art and rewarding exploration.

Some people with limited exposure to this game may take offense in the DLC's (or as I have read the ""audacity"" to show players they could go somewhere if they own the DLC) - but as a player who has played since the base content, you don't need to even think about buying DLC's until many, many, many hours into the game. There is so much content to explore and unlock that the DLC would only give you even more on top of that to get to know.

Take it one step at a time and give the base game a chance, ESPECIALLY if you have 1-3 friends who have a bit of patience and can sit down for a comfy evening of turn based gaming.

You can really tell by almost any aspect that the devs themselves love what they created. I would do many things exactly like them if I were to make my dream deckbuilder game.

But when the game uses one mechanics to wipe you out through the [b]whole[/b] game, (aka, stacking bleed and/or poison, burn and whatnot to burn your HP by a fix amount every turn), feels extremely cheap and makes the game kinda tedious. Not even mentioning how poison and bleed cannot be blocked by shields.

I have not finished the game yet, so I have not much idea how later will it go. But if the early game is all about surviving the DOT fiesta, then that is how you encourage your players not to continue.
This is not fun nor entertaining to use your block and shields to no avail, because those DOT effects ignore the only defense mechanics the game has to offer so far.
Even if you happen to remove a stack of DOT once in a while, it will quickly ramp up again thanks to all enemies applying it in stronger fights.

Whose idea was to make fights that cheap? Just throw bleed/poison/burn or who knows what dot on an attack and call it a day, players can't protect against it forever anyways, they won't say ""the game is too ez!"" anymore!

As a solo play experience the options are a bit overwhelming, game is a bit slow and the mechanics are a bit dull. It's not terrible but it's not as engaging as your slay the spires/monster trains. I think the art is quite average/ugly.

While this game can be fun the difficulty is all over the place, the spike from the end of the first map to the beginning of the second is something else, at first i thought it was just that i had a garbage build's but in 3 runs back to back with different builds I've hit a brick wall but for every fight before partway through the 2nd map I'm coasting through fights.

Also something that bothered me the most and I may be wrong but it feel's like im being pushed to buy the expansion(for 20 more dollar's) if i want to unlock any characters atm, I am pretty competent with these type of games and after 4 runs in 5 hours havent been able to unlock a single one except for the one behind a paywall which i cant access until i pay but it keeps reminding me up in the corner of the first map saying to come to this spot to unlock the character that's behind a paywall.

I think 1 or two more runs and ill have at least one character unlocked but its getting quite boring, I also dont really like the graphics, It reminds me of old newgrounds games from 15-20 years ago.

There's a decent amount of build diversity at first though it feels like it drops off rather then opens up as even though I'm unlock 30-50 cards every run I only see maybe 2-3 new cards in each subsequent run, the combat can be enjoyable, I read a few reviews that mentioned this game is a contender for slay the spire, it certainly is not but its a decent smaller sibling, while the diversity is good you're going to be seeing the same cards and paths and build styles for the first 6-10 hour's, its unpleasant.

There's good here but buy it on sale because its a little off.",1698818486,1698818486,False,3,0,0.483772486448287964,0,True,False,False

The adventure mode is the ''safest'' of the three because you can prepare ahead since the main points of interests and bosses stay the same, you can decide ahead which maps to take after the first one and build counter decks for the enemies' weaknesses. There are shops, altars and story times along the way, you can continue stories with characters you encounter and so on. You can have presets for the characters in terms of starting perks and decks which makes it very useful for each map choice further on. The rogue-like adventure is randomised every run and it's a great way to find out more about each hero, card and build, since the randomness can give you a better chance of uncovering new things. The weekly challenge is great if you like some competition, the run has some preset things, you can see ahead the final bosses of each map (not their weaknesses or quirks but i assume if you'd encounter them multiple times, you could prepare ahead), you choose your starter cards besides the default 4-5 , your buffs and you're ready for your run. Besides solo, you can play with friends, personally we had hours of fun on date night with the game. If you get easily bored, you are not for this game (and this game is not for you, but that was implied). Settle in (a run does go for about 2 hours in 1-2 players), don't get frustrated, you will definitely need multiple runs (especially on adventure where you need to build your character level so you unlock perks which give effects for the run), and enjoy!",1698795020,1698795020,True,4,0,0.529425501823425293,0,True,False,False

Cons - Finding multiplayer games can sometimes be frustrating, however I haven't tried to meet people on discord or third party platforms, mainly just tried joining matches via the game and sometimes it's empty.

Edit: Oh, great! A new $20 DLC for a $20 game! It gives you less than half the content of the vanilla game. Fantastic deal!!!

March update gave us new card art! I love how they added lots of white people to the new art Even if the original art looked great. I'd much rather have a poorly drawn Caucasian hand point to the constellations. People of color? Nah, anyone who isn't white will be purple, blue or red! Fantastic art choices. I really like the new poorly drawn Caucasian woman on ""Fade"".

Before the update, some of the cards had reused assets, you could tell, and it made some of the cards hard to tell apart. The update fixes that, at the cost of some actually cool art that didn't need updating at all. They changed the art style, which would be fine if it looked good...it doesn't. Looks like they commissioned it on Fiverr. The cards that depicted equipment like a shield or a character in a suit of armor now show a low detail Caucasian character or sometimes non skin tone colors (red, blue, purple). ZERO black or p.o.c. characters. Why default to a single race? Why choose white as the default even tho they are the minority in the world? Why not just leave them neutral with clothing/armor? The game was a 10 and you had to insert more white people, because apparently there wasn't enough... REPRESENTATION MATTERS! And you went way out the way to affirm how white the characters are in the cards. I can't help but feel this is why the cash grab of a DLC is $10.

I loved this game so much, I played 138 hours, got 100%, and was super excited for DLC so I could have a reason to play some more!

Then it came out... Base game used to be £20, it is now £17. You want to know how much the DLC is? £20... So of course to justify this it adds as much content as the base game right? No, of course not, it adds 1 new area. There's 5 in the base game. So you get 20% additional content for more than the price of the original game... Whoever was in charge of doing that math needs fired immediately.

I understand this is likely a greedy decision made by the publishers. But when I bother to reccomend games it's usually because I want to support the devlopers and I want them to keep making great games.

Don't know who is to blame for this insane greed but it doesn't really matter. I will not waste another penny supporting this team with it's current business model and I don't recommend that anyone else does either because it will just give them an excuse to keep treating their customers like crap.

The biggest one is the lack of variation between runs. Maps, enemies all remain the same, meaning you dont get a new challenge, or a new puzzle or a new decision to be made, nor must prepare for an unexpected boss. 
This becomes accentuated with the second problem, which comes from a the easy access to customization you get for cards/items combined with streamlined talents, making you aim for the same cards/builds in the characters.

Overall, the game is good, but would have loved to be able to face different enemies at the end of each map, or have the map have variations that were meaningful, so that way going for the cookie cutter build of the character that is guided by its lvl 0 talent, would have a chance of being not the right call.

At first, I did not like this game as it feels extremely overbearing. So many mechanics and words are thrown at you that you really have no clue what is going on, along with the fact you have to build 4 different decks all at the same time. Once you get a hang of the game, how classes work, what the buffs/debuffs mean, it's not nearly as complicated as it looks. 

The game sets a hefty goal by trying to compare itself to Slay the Spire and while it doesn't reach the same height, it does a good enough job to still be a fun game. The ability to split the party with friends is really what keeps me coming back, as I just find the game to be too much to want to keep track of solo. 

The game has two main modes, story and randomized. Story will take you ~2-3 hours to beat per run and has plenty of branching paths for future runs. That said, the biggest downside to this is after you really get to play the game a lot, story mode becomes more boring as the same enemies will always be on the same hex. The other mode is random, which much more mirrors Slay the Spire and I find it more enjoyable. It carves out the slower pace of story and keeps things more interesting. A lot easier to jump into, just like Slay the Spire. I enjoyed this mode more but it does lack some content compared to story.

People rag on about the DLC and while I frankly would like more content, as I think the game really doesn't have the same replayability that Slay the Spire has, the base-game itself is more than worth the $20 if you like deckbuilders. I'd advise picking it up base and going from there. If you find you really like the game, you can get the DLC to add a bit more content, otherwise the base game is more than enough to get 100+ hours on by its own.",1696372441,1696372441,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As you get farther, you get more resources at the start of the game to control your beginning deck, which makes you more powerful, which allows you even more control of your deck and allows it to do some really absurd combos. For example:

Fire mage + construct + starter healer (characters):
- on the constructs turn, I gave the fire mage a ton of defense, so that 
- on the fire mages' turn, I could take like 80 damage in burning and have a huge attack, and then 
- on the healer's turn, I healed up the burning damage that went over the defense.

Getting ready to launch a party SHOULD be fun, but it is mostly incredibly tiresome. If you can confidently play MTG with strangers, this game is going to feel extremely dull, most of the time.


Art style is cool, kind of post-Warcraft, post-steampunk fantasy cartoon - extremely familiar designs, but likely to avoid lawsuits.

The base game is very fun, well designed, and totally worth the price. I would even justify $30 for it.
However, now with the second DLC being released, I can't recommend this game, because I can't advocate for the dev's/publisher's (just referring to them as devs going forward) pricing decisions. Both DLCs are disrespectfully overpriced. The devs were flamed hard for the cost of the first DLC... and they just repeated the same mistake, but scaled up. 
It is remarkable to me as a business owner, because for digital content, the production cost is a one time R&D CapEx. You incur almost zero residual cost per unit sold, unlike tangible items which have substantial production, warehousing, storefront, and shipping costs to name a few. Which means the way you generate the most profit is to attempt to price the product at the exact ratio that is the highest price x units sold. So if i were to price it at $20, and it would sell 100k units, that's $2mil. If I price at $5, I sell 700k units, it's $3.5mil. However, when I price it at $10, and sell 500k units, I make $5mil, resulting in the best price. You know the easiest way to figure out the best price? Ask your customers, specifically. ""If I make a DLC that adds another zone and a few new mechanics, what would you all be willing to pay?"". You can work out the math from that data set on a napkin and potentially make millions more, while also not alienating a percentage of the player base, which will reduce your units sold regardless of price.

I looked for some good will from them before posting this and found them allowing people to play the DLC if the multiplayer lobby creator has it. This is the correct move, but quite frankly wouldn't be necessary if it was just priced appropriately, since a lot more of the player base would buy it.

I'd love a rep from the devs to comment and explain if there is some under-the-hood reason that I am wrong.",1693607142,1693607142,False,50,1,0.752623915672302246,0,True,False,False

Mediocre, but with decent variety and depth.

+Lots of content. Enemies, playable characters, cards, buffs/debuffs, strategies. It's Slay the Spire but with four characters at once (chosen from a larger roster), with lots of equipment and multiple classes to build around.
+Replayable.
+Long and short game modes.
+Co-op! It's kind of weird in this sort of turn-based game, but it's nice to be able to split up the decision-making.

+/-Acceptable visuals. It looks like a mid 2000s flash game with fairly generic fantasy art. Animations are limited to slightly rotating parts of a static image. Some characters are lucky enough to have special buffs that make them glow, emit sparks, etc.
+/-Bland story/writing that doesn't get in the way of enjoying the game. Some events are entertaining enough.

-Awful sound design. The music exists; that's as much as I can give it other than an alright final boss track. Many sound effects are reused and just pitch-shifted. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them are just the devs pretend-yelling/grunting/etc. into cheap microphones. It's bad, and not even so-bad-it's-funny. I'm sure there are much better royalty-free sound effects out there.
-Lots of RNG at play during events on the map. You can avoid some of it by taking certain characters to specific events, but even then, some character-specific interactions can be punishing if you fail a dice roll. Pretty annoying in the longer ""Adventure"" game mode, which can take several hours.
-Many card backs are locked behind a cycling weekly seed for the shorter game mode. Time gates are an awful design choice.
-The regular deck viewer for your heroes is pretty bad. It cycles down an entire screen's worth of cards at a time instead of having a smooth scroll. It's difficult to count how many of certain kinds of cards you have, which is necessary for certain synergies and to understand your chances for some events.

NG+++, Roguelite elements create massive repeatability (as long as you can outpace tedious start.. that is improved by the QoL features).

I completely lost myself in the many gameplay+complexity loops, but I could see where other players would hit snags in the gameplay. 

Latest DLC (Sands of Ulimin) adds a ton to a great game. My suggestion is to play the base game until you want more then add on the DLC you want. You don't need it to experience this game. 

The Wolf Wars DLC is so skippable. [spoiler]  The added campaign is rough. Yogger character is so much fun to play. His added mechanics feel so satisfying to accomplish [/spoiler]

Goods:
-Diverse cast of characters
-Huge variety of viable builds + complexity (cards<characters<perks<equipment<teams)
-Artwork
-Repeatability++
-Fun Multiplayer (Hijinks unfold)

So much polish in QoL features:
-Import/Export Loadouts
-Save Deck Loadouts
-Searchable Glossary of Everything that's accessible anytime
-Turn History

Bads:
-Slow start, base characters feel way flatter than they are. Need perk exp to truly experience the game.
-Overwhelming at first-glance
-Inconsistent UI in multiplayer.. hiccups here and there
-Sound effects can get tedious (each unique creature seems to have one HIT sound)

Its true what they say, never meet your hero's.

If they'd dropped a new zone every 3-6 months and charged $10 a pop I'd have brought every one.

Instead their first DLC was pitiful in size and now this new one is one zone for the same price as the base game.

Unless this game was in development for 5+ years I have no clue how this took them a year and. 

This Dev need to leave that the value people are willing to spend is not based on much they think their product is worth but how much similar products in the market cost.

Here is why you may consider adding it there too:
- Their games are mostly unfinished DLC cashgrab. 
[i]That's all stories folks![/i]

They are going to milk playerbase till the very last drop with MTX&DLC and abandon the game after that.
So far this game has a proof-of-concept story mode with 3 maps and a cheap weekly challenge.
Tiny free update once a year, no QoL improvements, no balance fixes. Before the first DLC release, there was an empty placeholder in main story, leading to that DLC. Imagine making a difficult fight, making a turn, expecting a reward to see something like ERROR: DLC #356 FILE NOT FOUND PLEASE BUY SOON, SEE YA FOLKS GIFF MONEY!!

Yes, I am exarating here, but just a tiny bit. So you would know what kind of dev attituide you may expect.
As for difficulty - it has nothing to do with enemy AI, it's just RNG and numbers bloated up.
As for progress - grind, like there is no tomorrow, imagine you are playing mobile Farmville to save some ""blue energy crystals"". I wonder why dont they add an option to BUY MORE BLUE CRYSTALS - LIMITED DAILY DEAL! Because UI/UX totally screams like it was a 5$ mobile asset for that direct purpose.

Yet they sell two DLC for the combined cost of 200% base game already.

Instead of one deck of abilities, players are allowed to curate 4 character decks and constitute an entire party.  There are different tank/warrior, mage, rogue, and healer options, so there is some variation to be had.

There is a rogue-lite mode, with a fixed series of maps, where players accrue currency to gain further control and power level, allowing greater specificity to character roles (all heal cards on a healer for example).  The bosses are interesting and even realm is characterized well.  

There is also a rogue-like mode, where you pick from random bundles of cards, start with nothing, removing the progression system that gimps early runs in the rogue-lite version.  

The combat is excellent and well balanced, but the later levels become more and more about debuff clearing.  Can you remove bleeds?  Can you remove poisons?  

I found the later game difficulty spike being associated with clearing debuffs, debuffs that are inconsequential up until that point, to be quite tedious.

Let me break down the stats for you (All stats from the wiki):

Bosses:
Base Game - Around 18
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 3
DLC has 1/6th or 16.6% of the bosses of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

Characters:
Base Game - 16
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 2
DLC has 1/8th or 12.5% of the characters of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

Pets:
Base Game - 13
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 3
DLC has 3/13th or 23% of the pets of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

Zones: 
Base Game - 5
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 1
DLC has 1/5th or 20% of the zones of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

Enemies:
Base Game - Can't find an accurate count, but it seems greater than 50, might be closer to 70
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 20, possibly a few more
DLC has (at best) 1/3rd (33%) or perhaps half (if we are being generous) of the base game. Same price as the base game.

Cards: 
Base Game - 500+
Sands of Ulminin DLC - Advertising around 60
DLC has 12% of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

Finally, items:
Base Game - Advertised as around 200
Sands of Ulminin DLC - 30
DLC has 15% of the base game. DLC is the same price as the base game.

So, in summary:

Adding the percentages together and you end up with a DLC that has roughly 21.3% of the content of the base game (using the generous percentage for enemy count) for the exact same price. Now my math isn't great, but that's the figure I got.

21% of the original product for the same price as the original product.

Would you buy a second hamburger that is only 21% as big as your first hamburger if they were the exact same price?

Was not let down and quickly convinced some friends to get it as well! The game is an absolute blast with lots of replay-ability and tons to learn and unlock. The game honestly plays better with a friend or two when you are starting out because of how overwhelming it can be building decks for 4 characters at the same time. The story is light but fun and the battles are interesting once you unlock more characters and try out new builds.

Only complaint is that when playing with friends the rounds take a long time. There is a setting to speed up the gameplay but it only works during solo-play. There is no such thing as a quick run whether its with 1 friend or 3. If they added a feature that allowed the gameplay pace to be increased if everyone in the party applied the settings it would make a huge difference.

It's fun to play with basically any amount of people. Some folks have complained about the last boss but I don't think he was that bad on the normal difficulty.

update 8/17 

I haven't played the DLC and haven't purchased wolf wars because it seemed like it was very little content for the $ that having been said I wanted to talk about the DLC debacle a bit. 

1. Don't blame the devs for things like pricing it's the publisher Paradox that controls that stuff so channel that stuff at the publisher (still with neg reviews)
2. They listened the price is the same but they got Paradox to follow suit with other DLC techniques and only one person in the group needs the DLC which makes a full price DLC a little more manageable if you're playing Multiplayer. 
3. The base game is still really fun without DLC 
4. I wonder if some kind of pricing plan with like main game $25 and big DLC $12.99 small dlc 7.50 might work? Paradox gets away with a lot of DLC shenanigans for other games but also tends to offer free major updates. 
5. Something that I've always admired is how The folks that made Ghostrunner do there DLCS. Basically they do a free update with a mode and then fund it with a cosmetic DLC. I wonder if you could do like a special card for each character for a few dollars and use that to fund free updates and dlc to the main game. The smallest silliest dlc with not content has crazy good reviews over in Ghost-runner land because they also added new modes and time trials and other stuff for free. IDK if anything like this would work out but there has to be a better way than just over charging and alienating the people who love your game.

Always skeptical about EA release games as they most often release unfinished in a crappy state. That does not seem to be the case here. 

This game is essentially a co op mix of slay the spire with more rouge like elements and branching story options with quests. It is rare that I don't at least have one complaint about a game however I am having trouble finding one here. 

Essentially if you like: 
Deck builders
Rouge likes
CO OP card games

Previous review: This is my favorite roguelike from now on. It is still in EA, and yet for me it is better than StS or MT, although I like all of them very much. The secret ingredient in AtO is persistent growth. Although you start every run almost from point zero, there are few things, that you can work on, to feel progress, so you grow attached to your heroes and towns you visit and develop. In that sense it is a lot like Rogue Legacy, but with cards. Also, there are obvious inspirations from Darkest Dungeon in team positioning and fighting, and devs already mention that they plan to elaborate on that part of the game.
So, to sum up, this game is unholy yet godly bastard child of StS, Rogue Legacy and Darkest Dungeon and I LOVE it.

The game is $20 USD full price. It features 5 zones to traverse through, 2 of which are required for each playthrough- the first and final zones are always the same. Each run you'll experience two of the 3 remaining ""middle"" zones. 

The base game without DLC has 16 characters spread across 4 different classes. 4 of them are unlocked from the start, and the rest require completion of a quest in order to play them in future runs.

The most recent DLC also costs $20 USD full price. It adds 1 ""middle"" zone, and adds 2 characters. Each character is counted as 2 of the 4 classes. This means that the DLC has a mere fraction of the base game's content, at the exact same price. I have zero intention of buying it. 

I made the mistake of buying the previous DLC, which added 1 sub-area that plays the exact same every time and doesn't give you anything for the main campaign- meaning the only benefit of doing it is for story- and one character, who was ridiculously broken before they nerfed him.

_______________________________________________________________________________
Base game includes 5 regions, 16 characters, 3 different modes-$19.99

1st DLC is puerly cosmetic, no new playable content-$4.99. They say it is to support the devs.
2nd DLC has 1 new region, 1 new character-$9.99. They say the devs already released a free content update.
3rd DLC has 1 new region, 2 new chracters-$19.99, same price as the base game. My dear devs, what is your excuse this time?

I hate to post a negative review on the anniversary, but I am disappointed. Seriously, what ATO needs the most is a market team. The devs still don't understand how to set the right price on Steam. The 2 DLCs with playable content (Wolf War and Sand of Ulminin) combined together cost about $26-$30 dollars. Let's look at some other games on Steam.  Slay the Spire base game-$25; Darkest Dungeon 1 base game-$25; Shadowverse, Marvel Snap, and Kards are free card games. I list these games just to get a general idea about the prices. The problem is not whether people want to spend $20/$30 on a game or not. The probelm is whether people want spend their $20/$30 on Game A or Game B. Why would anyone with their sanity would dump their money on a game with so little content? How can someone possibly convince their friends to buy these DLCs if there are so many other better options?

I'm not recommending the game because their DLC practices have been absolutely terrible, this likely being due to their publisher being Paradox Interactive, a particularly predatory company when it comes to DLC.

4 class archa types, each having 4 different characters with different specialties gives this game a great amount of customization, that doesn't take into account that you can build specific characters in different ways.

If you like card games, RPG games or rouge likes/lites then this is worth a try for sure. If you like the overlap of those genres this game is a must buy. It has quickly become one of my favorite games in this space.

DLC comments:
I've not personal purchased any of the DLC, I will say the first DLC seemed a little bloated to me so I have no intention of getting it unless it goes on sale. Mostly due to the fact it didn't add anything into the main story.

The 2nd DLC seems to be getting a lot of backlash for the pricing and I think its most likely fairly priced.
There were major reworks and new mechanics added, a new area with new bosses, enemies, themes and two new characters. 

Peoples biggest complaint is the DLC costs as much as the base game. Yet other games regularly release dlc for 50% of their main titles price with a 5% increase in overall content. A company shouldn't be punished for making their base game cheaper and more accessible but charging a fair amount for their DLC.  Additional characters regularly cost close to $5 in other games with the exception of something like Vampire slayers. 

These characters require new coding, new art assets, the creation of new mechanics. They are multi class characters which need good balancing to to fit with the rest of the party. That alone covers 50% of the DLCs price. Then you throw in the new area, bosses, items and enemies not to mention then introduction to continued support for the game, like sand box mode and that more than makes up the remaining 50% of the DLC cost. 15-20 is very reasonable for the pricing of the dlc, I personally will purchasing it as soon as I have the extra income to do so.

A downside to many though will be that the game is grindy, which usually doesn’t fit the RLDB genre.

The mage starts with half a deck of fire spells, gives you fire weapons at a common rate, asks you to build fire as the other spells are horrible, and then there is an entire zone dedicated to being resistant at best and immune at worst to fire damage. Immune to damage or WORSE heals from you putting fire on them. Boring. Save yourself the time and play something else. (They force you to include a mage).

EDIT: to the dev, you start the game with only 1 of each class. You are forced to use them, sorry. Additionally, making a boss HEAL from you putting fire on them doesn't count as ""not being immune"".

Positive takeaway - If these devs can publish this game and put it on steam, you can achieve whatever goals you want in life. Don't let any fear of not being perfect hold you back, because these devs stopped at nothing to make the most halfbaked ripoff of slay the spire you can imagine. God bless, and please play another game.

I wish I could down-vote this game again, the madness levels are a failed attempt to emulate what Slay the Spire (a game this is clearly ripping off) does well with their ascension. STS uses new mechanics and difficulty such as reduced healing, rarer and harder mobs, as a difficulty spike, while the devs somehow think that hard limiting and reducing all of the games mechanics is interesting. Completely random fights, with the worlds most unbalanced and poorly designed characters, cards, mobs, economy, and you name it it sucks. The devs reply to this comment implies that I don't like the game because I'm bad at it, but after even getting to madness 16 I can still promise you that the devs don't know anything about a well designed ecosystem or interesting mechanics. The text is horrible on all of the encounters, it's shallow and cringe. The artwork is another abomination on its own, the card ""open wounds"" has a closed wound on it. They can't even get the basic concept of what an open wound is. Let that be an indicator for what the people behind this game think reality is like. They draw bald characters from behind in all their artwork because they can't draw hair. There is not even a bald character in the game, and they clearly can't google a diagram for a brain because the various artwork that the game uses brains in is just not what a brain looks like.

Final boss has a bit too much health though - it turns into 10 turns of just waiting for the boss to die if you're not in danger of being killed.

10/10

IMPORTANT NOTE:
I do not recommend the DLC. The DLC is pretty expensive for what it is:

A new map that you have to play with preset, separate characters, and doesn't affect the main campaign at all.

A lot of reading in the new map (dialogue, etc.), but none of it is interesting. You make choices, but none of those choices impact anything at all in the map. The dialogue also kind of reads like fan fiction, where characters use lines like ""I, Yogger, will strike you down.""

1/10 for the DLC, cannot recommend.

Adventure mode is the most controllable, and where the most creativity can happen, as you can control basically all cards for all characters.

The final boss is a snoozefest that will make you groan the minute it starts and you remember the mechanics that make it much slower than necessary. He drains energy and forces you to play a special card which just slows down the battle but doesn't really make it dangerous.

The game really falls short in higher difficulties where a small selection of specific meta setups are the only way to play the game, which revolve around everyone being speed buffed, buffing a single hero's damage, using cards to view that hero's draw pile and discarding cards ahead of their turn to ensure that they draw a hand capable of killing the enemy before they even get a turn. 

This lame meta entirely defeats the point of playing a card game at all when you are not going to have most of the enemies get a chance to draw or use their cards before they die.

For a supposed roguelike deckbuilder, everything is preset and the only variety depends entirely on your routing in the overworld. You have access to all the cards you've unlocked at the start of the run, which mostly do the same thing. You wanna do 4 damage and 2 damage over time? Cool, here's that but with 9 different damage types. The only variety is from what gear shows up at the merchant or drops from events. There is no randomization.

The combat is an absolute slog for no good reason, there's about four times more variants and mechanics to every possible action from damage to dots to buffs than there should ever be in a game, your characters have uninteresting yet complicated moves which still barely scratch the damage sponge enemies while they pile half of your health pool in dots per turn, which you can only respond to by healing 15hp at a time. The game expects you to put in 15 hours to grind levels before you even start playing.

I tried looking into what exactly the deal is and the answers I've encountered most are things like ""skill issue,"" ""just grind"" and ""zoomers can't play hard games."" No. I'm a grown adult with limited free time, and I have no interest beating my head against a wall for a crumb of meta progress to continue not having fun in a game that has no concept of respect for the players time.

""But people beat the game with no meta progression!"" I don't care, that has zero bearing on new player experience. Why on earth would I want to invest more than the 8 hours I've already wasted to memorize fights, routing, and meta builds off some guide or website? That's still not fun.

Across the Obelisk takes the roguelike deckbuilder concept and adds two of the most annoying flaws possible: mechanic bloat and grinding.

To start, I don't understand why Across the Obelisk has roguelike elements at all. While it's natural to lose at first in these kinds of games while you learn the mechanics, in Across the Obelisk it's not only skill holding you back. You have to spend many runs grinding perk points and resources before you can sniff the endgame. The numbers are simply too high to survive without starting perks and upgrades that can make all your cards significantly better. Compare to Slay the Spire, where it's possible to win your first run, even if most players won't because they are learning the game. Compounding this issue is that events and encounters aren't random, so once you've tried the path branches you will literally be doing the same thing over and over again. If the devs wanted to have grinding and bespoke maps they should have just made this an card-battling RPG.

The other problem with Across the Obelisk is the huge number of mechanics and statuses that make keeping track of everything a chore and mostly add little to no strategic depth anyway. In a typical battle it's not uncommon for actors to have 10+ status effects, each with their own unique rules, at any given time. Now some of these will be things like ""+1% more damage"" that effectively do nothing given the numbers on attacks, but others will be important, and you have to sort through it all. Add to this 9 types of damage each with its own resistance, and if you're like me at least, your eyes will quickly glaze over and you will give up trying to figure out the optimal play in favor of what intuitively feels ""good enough"". This worked decently well, but it points out how including all these mechanics in an effort to create complexity and depth ends up being self-defeating.

Across the Obelisk is a bloated and incoherent mess, and once you're deep enough in for the inherent addictiveness of the roguelike deckbuilder concept to wear off and this realization to hit you, playing it begins to feel like wading through mud. To the people who think this is better than Slay the Spire--I want some of whatever you're on.",1690393590,1690393949,False,11,5,0.507425248622894287,0,True,False,False

If you hate the randomness in slay the spire, this game has 1 game mode without randomness which is the story mode. For people that love randomness I think there are also 2 other modes. Also there are random elements in it, I think the card rewards from enemies are random, and the divination rounds (basically card rounds in town for gold), and the items that spawn in the shops in towns. But being able to craft the 1-2 of the cards you need, without everything being random and unpredictable is just such a nice choice. If nothing else it's a change from the constant extreme RNG in rogue-lites and especially deckbuilders.

You are still limited by resources to craft the cards. And you can't make a deck full of one card only, as you can only craft limited amounts, which creates a complex balance. The developer has a few archetypes for each character in mind it seems, and those are really fun to play.

I can't see this game getting boring for me any time soon.

I just like to explore this game and it's story. Love to craft the best deck I can come up with. It's still extremely complex. The odds still seem stacked against you and the game is hard. But I like knowing that I had full control over the outcome.

Also the path is deterministic in story mode, it is still very complex. Triggering some events seems to require taking certain paths, some only unlocked by a certain event, which takes away some or most of your usual comfortable choice from previous runs, that you may have taken to make your life easier.

As a rogue lite it also has a nice power curve over a lot of games while being balanced pretty well. Any hopes of you being too powerful get crushed by hard encounters, or self chosen challenges, in hope for a nice card or item promised to you by the prefight screen, hoping to make your run easier, after a bit of hassle. You never feel stuck, because you will always unlock something new, like another hero, some xp/skill points or be able to change your game start setup in a lot of different ways (different cards, different items, different skill trees, different party members).

it's very, very grindy, and a complete run takes hours. Your characters level up permanently between runs, so eventually you become stronger and start with more gold and crystals and buy better stuff and so, on top of getting some of your gold and crystals from your previous run. Some enemy groups will just kill you if you dont have just the right card effects to counter their bs mechanic, so back to the beginning you go on another multi-hour journey. A lot of the better cards (group cleanse, for example), you dont unlock until like a dozen hours, two dozen hours into the game, which is frustrating

a particular pet peeve I have with the card roguelike genre, this game beeing no execption, is that they are always extremely unbalanced. 90, 95% of cards are trash, don't even pick them up, do you rather want to attack for 15 damage or 500 damage based on enemy poison stacks, hmmm? You exploit a few broken mechanics. Half the players likely just netdeck, as usual with these games. It's aggravating when you barely win a tough boss battle, and then you read comments on how others just one-shot every fight because of some dumb combos that you can not have any knowledge of - unless you netdeck

Unlocking the characters through quests is interesting, but can get frustrating at times. My first run I didn't know what I was doing, mucked up the quest; fair enough. My second run I want to try for the golem, pick up it's quest, make it to act two and a map event forces me down path that doesn't let me do the event, and into a fight I cannot win. Third try I take a different path and end up in a slog against some harpies that kill half my party, but I finally make it to the character unlock event; success, right? Nope, it's a whole mini dungeon that because the rest of act 2 ended up being overtuned I couldn't win. Guess it's back to just playing the 4 default heroes for another half dozen runs until their stats are good enough, or I luck into a god run of equipment and cards.

I'm sure people have beaten it with no upgrades, but I'm not interested in banging my head against the wall here until it clicks. I thought it would be a fun, deckbuilding rougelike with a bunch a heroes to play as, something I like in a game as I get bored playing the same class a lot, but the grind is too much to be enjoyable for me.",1689399303,1689399303,False,5,0,0.48855021595954895,0,True,False,False

However, there is something fundamentally wrong with this game. In many ways, Across the Obelisk felt like it was a game developed by people who knew what deck building games were supposed to be like, but forgot the parts that were required. In the limited run time that I had before refunding, there were many mechanics that were presented to the player that were completely unexplained - even to a veteran of the genre, it took some trial and error to discover. Alongside this, many of the mechanics are too focused and specific, such as cards that 'dispel' (remove negative) effects, but are limited to an effect that does not show up often enough to care (poison, as an example). New players would be entirely overwhelmed to the amount of mechanics that are unexplained. 

Through my playtime, I also experienced the strange feeling of not having any strategy. Your tanky character tanks, your damage characters damage, and your healer heals - though, almost entirely without creative thought. This makes Across the Obelisk's combat feel boring and stale, even though the player has access to many cards right at the beginning. 

These factors came together to make my experience with Across the Obelisk very unpleasant. I had been looking forward to the multiplayer potential, as I believe that experience would have been enjoyable.

It took a couple tries for it to click for me, and that is where co-op comes in. Playing through the game with some friends once, that had a bit more experience, helped me get a grasp of how to approach it. After this it became the game I booted up any time I wanted to chill and watch something on the second monitor. 

It is a straightforward deckbuilding roguelite with a lovely fantasy style and, bit flat, but nice soundtrack. The animations are almost non-existent, but seeing that healthbar drop on enemies as your build begins to take shape makes that a non-issue. Co-op works great, although you will need to agree on the roles you are going to go for if you want to succeed. Choices made in events can either be vote based or follow-the-leader. 

There are 4 base classes, with 4 variations in each. Characters and pets have varying degrees of difficulty when it comes to unlocking them, which gives you something to work towards. None which necessitates you playing on ""brutal"" difficulty, which is a plus. Classes and variations play quite differently and gives room for unique builds (although highest difficulties will force a meta). You can play typical tank-rogue-healer teams but also brutal high dps one-shot teams (with healer classes spec for dmg) if you want. 

The base game can be pushed towards higher difficulties with modifiers, called ""madness"". There is also obelisk challenges where you draft cards in groups of 3 which limits your approach and tests your knowledge of the game and flexibility. Then there are weekly challenges with fixed teams, with similar drafting as obelisk challenge.

THEN THE GODS DID ORDER YOU TO GRIND! Across four worlds you marched, murdered monsters of increasing difficulty for loot and EXP while abusing the Wikis to figure out where to get plot specific gear. Days pass, in game and the real world, and then you fall after you tempted the fates and accepted a challenge you could not defeat. 

Look guys, it is no Slay the Spire. NOTHING IS. That magic is never coming back. I cry in my sleep like everyone else wishing to relive that magic. But reader, if you want to grind achievements, weird in-game events, and loot all while trying to Min-Max like a boss then this game is ready to distract you from your inevitable death like one of those Final Fantasy games with the 8 hour boss battles that really have no business having 8 hour boss battles. 

A lot of people aren't going to like the pacing. The runs requires multiple sessions to complete. You're also unlocking powers ups while also increasing the difficulty in follow up runs because that's how these games are designed otherwise you'll have to live with the fact that you're a coward who didn't increase the difficulty. 

There seems to be two big camps in this community. The people who want to make this game crazy hard to warrant their absurd dedication to it and the others who just want the difficulty adjusted so if you just picked it up the first time it'll be difficult but not impossible then maybe slide the difficulty up from there. 

My friends refused to play this game with me. Apparently they're too cool for card battlers. Freakin' nerds.

Pros:
- Can be played co-op or in offline singleplayer (co-op is a huge attraction for me personally)
- Great amount of characters and build customization for each
- Different gamemodes and difficulties available
- Interesting dialogue and story in the campaign mode
- Unique options in routes and dialogue for unique characters

Cons:
- Some balancing issues for harder difficulties (especially in Obelisk Challenges)
- Stacking debuffs or buffs feels essential
- Some fights feel too drawn out
- No auto-reconnect or a grace period if someone's internet is unstable

With that said, the developers are very open to criticism and are responsive on Discord. A lot of the problems I listed are already being looked into, with some already having planned changes. In a world where deckbuilding games are starting to become slightly saturated, ATO stands out as a pretty unique take while keeping some tried and true mechanics.

It fits into a weird space relative to other deckbuilder roguelikes in that the meta progression is the real heart of the game. I get the impression while playing that my real goal, more than beating the final boss is more of a ""catch em' all"" style collectathon to unlock all of the characters and cards. As such, until you unlock a decent amount of the cards and mechanics, you're basically playing the tutorial (and there is like no chance you can beat the game) but after you've put in some hours (like probably 3-4 runs @ ~3 hours per run) you should be able to start feeling a level of mastery. I understand for many people that's quite the investment, but since the game is otherwise very tutorial-light and you can play with friends, I found that it didn't feel like too much of a chore.

There are a lot of mechanics to interact with that make the game a bit overwhelming at times, but generally feel like they help you to make smart choices and build fun decks. There's also a healthy mixture of strategic and tactical decision making that helps to keep all aspects of the game interesting, although I think overall the game leans more on the decisions made between combats than the ones made during. There are also a lot of quality-of-life inclusions that make the game much more forgiving and approachable than some of its peers. For instance, if you lose a combat that you feel you could've won, you can run it back with the same RNG seed and see if you fare any better.

While mechanically I don't find the game quite as engaging as Slay the Spire or Wildfrost, I'd say it's maybe just barely below Monster Train (which is still a very solid game in my opinion). However, the thing that makes the game undeniably great is the multiplayer. Granted, you need friends that won't be annoying back-seaters. The multiplayer experience of this game is very chill and laid back compared to most cooperative games which are commonly beat-em-ups, platformers, or shooters. The turn-based nature of the game made for a great casual experience where we were able to hold a conversation about things other than the gameplay while occasionally discussing next moves or optimal plays. It honestly made me wish there was more of an emphasis on multiplayer in the genre.

If you're looking for a solo deckbuilder experience, I think you can get better value for your time elsewhere. However, if you want a fun, chill, and turn-based cooperative multiplayer game and you're willing to sink more than a few hours into it, I think Across the Obelisk is pretty hard to beat.",1686728811,1686728811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Since building decks for 4 different characters by yourself might be a bit overwhelming. But solo players really shouldn't feel like this burden would be too big to overcome. 

You make your way across multiple maps with many fun and interesting events. At every event you get certain choices. Depending on how you made your deck, you will be more likely to achieve the goals of these events. Sometimes it depends on drawing a defensive card to block a innocent by passer from getting hit by an arrow. Sometimes you have to try to push away a boulder as a group, so then you have to overcome this challenge by drawing a card from each of your characters decks and see if the total costs is equal or higher to the challenge. This gives a really interesting dynamic, where a good combat deck might not be a great help in non-combat events. Giving you the option to be really creative in building your deck, figuring out a good path you want to take and combining different characters in a group.

+ interesting take of the card adventure game with a bit more ""tactic""
+ character are nicely different and their is a good spread for all kind of liking, you can choose your own group if you dont specificly wants the Support+Mage+Ranger+Warrior

~ there is not enough to differentiate one character from another in the same class they only have a 2-3 different card and sure they play differently its not enough
~ There is no randomness in the maps, making each runs sometimes too similar and you can too easily find the ""easiest"" path for your current build. And the boss of each map is always the same
~ some of the challenge make no real sense, the balance is a bit out of whack
~ multiplayer? well I dont see the point but whatever

- The huge grind to unlock everything is not fun
- the ability to craft the deck you want at start make the beginning sometimes really really long and unfun, it requires sometimes so many clicks to change/add/remoeve/upgrade cards even with the deck saver slot, the amount of ressource you can have each run can drastically change

Pros
- Many cards ,items and characters
- Many builds and concepts to try
- Good interface (functioning well)
- Upgrades/Unlocks worth runs after runs

Cons
- Ugly art (almost from 80's) & underwhelming sfx
- Each battle is too long
- Hardly random maps/events (not meant to be tho)
- Some builds are overpowered, some builds aren't so viable
- Not so much challenge after unlocking everything

If you have 3 more ppl to play with, this would be a fine game for a few hours. But I don't think I would play this on my own-there's too many things to do. It would be a dull, painfully slow version of Darkest Dungeon and STS. It's not so expensive though

You have multiple meta progression mechanics. You have town upgrades, you have card and gear unlocks, and you have unlockable characters and pets. You also get some of your resources from your previous run that can be used for your next run, based on your score. There's also a perk point progression. 

The Madness system is the difficulty scaling mechanic in this game. It is flexible, allowing you to customize your difficulty to a degree. And it does more than 'chunk up deck with bad cards' or 'bad guys have bigger numbers', it actually can limit number of stacks of buffs and debuffs you can apply, and other challenges that will make you rethink how to go about playing the game. On the one hand, the game will give you lots of meta progression, then at higher Madness levels, start taking them away to see if you can manage without them. Will you make it to Madness 18?

There's a lot of small decisions you make in the game that have a big impact such as whether to spend all your mana or keep some, going for repeat spells that can trigger other effects, dumping all your buffs on one hero that can get disspelled or that a monster might have resistance to, and so on. The depth is fantastic.

Only a few points of critique here - the perks are a bit too overpowered in that it makes it so repeat spells get relatively strong compared to non-repeats if you buff the damage on them, and thus making them relatively weak without those perks.

-Curated campaign and random options make for increased replay-ability
-Good synergies and satisfying end-game bosses
-Character designs and boss designs are great!
-The 3-upgrade system is really clever, and seeing those purple cards is a nice dopamine hit every time

Dislike:
-Enemy variety within areas is underwhelming (often it feels like you do the same fight 3x in a row)
-Having so much access to cards and carry-over currency means there are fewer tough decisions and lower variety of builds, but I suppose you could self-limit if you wanted
-There's so much healing available that the give-and-take of defending and attacking feels off

Strap in, dear reader, for this is going to be a review that takes you on a wild journey through the mesmerizing realm of wolf wars, dashing heroes, and unexpected love.

Picture this: a towering, muscle-bound wolf, with biceps that could rival Atlas himself, and a heart as strong as his physique. Magnus is the epitome of strength and valor, a true alpha among wolves. But what sets him apart is his tender heart, for he has found love in the unlikeliest of places.

Enter Yogger, another noble wolf, and the partner of Magnus in a heartwarming, romantic relationship. Their bond transcends boundaries and challenges societal norms. In a world where acceptance and inclusivity are key, the developers of Across the Obelisk have fearlessly portrayed this beautiful love story. It's a testament to their commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive gaming experience that resonates with players on a personal level.

I must also commend the incredible voice acting and sound design. The voice actors breathe life into the characters, making their emotions palpable and their stories all the more captivating. The haunting melodies and atmospheric soundscape enhance the immersion, tugging at your heartstrings and igniting your imagination.

But dear reader, let's not forget the icing on this delectable gaming cake—the inclusivity and representation that the developers have embraced. By showcasing a loving and committed same-sex relationship like Magnus and Yogger's, they have shattered barriers and proven that diversity is not just a buzzword but a vital component of storytelling. It's a bold step forward that deserves applause.

In conclusion, Across the Obelisk is a masterpiece of game design, storytelling, and inclusivity. It embraces the wolf wars, introduces us to the formidable Magnus and his heartfelt relationship with Yogger, and takes us on an adventure that will forever stay etched in our hearts.

On one hand it has EVERYTHING you needed and ever could wish from a Slay The Spire (STS) successor. Graphics are gorgeous. The gameworld is very full and fleshed out. The characters are distinct and interesting. It has heaps and heaps of interesting and worthwhile meta progression. I plays very smoothly and feels snappy. It feels fresh and varied with great player agency. It’s brimming with unlockables and options and gives a lot of player agency for a roguelike. It has teambuilding, characterbuilding and a lot of deckbuilding and starter deck options. Content wise, and I’m not joking, it has AT LEAST ten times more than STS, or any other well-known cardbatler-roguelike.

But it also has my biggest gripe with card games in general, and in this case exponentially so. It’s just too much, too many damage types, too many cards, too many statusses, too many dependencies, too many interactions and despite of it all, it actually feels pretty shallow. People play games for fun, card games in particular can feel like homework sometimes, there is a learning curve that needs to be taken before your real mastery of the game and fun with it starts. This is what Slay The Spire did perfectly, it was fun and engaging right from the first play, and keeps on giving after mastering and unlocking it fully. This game is almost the opposite, I have 60+ hours on record and killed the end-boss multiple times with multiple teams, unlocked a good chunk of options. But It still feels like I’m feeling my way around in the dark, it still feels like I’m hardly grasping it’s depth, and above all a lot of it feels menial and forced. 

The balance in this game is way off and it hurts the funfactor. Sure you’ll get good runs consistently, and sure you’ll unlock stuff and finish content. Despite that often it just feels like shit’s being thrown around and you struggle and get frustrated to get the level of control and insight better cardgames have flourished from. For the enormous amount op options apart from stat buffs, there actually are very few interesting emergent gameplay interactions between options that make it really fun. STS’ comparatively small cardpool did an excellent job providing you with decks that changed and grew during runs and provided you with different but fun interactions and burst/cycle/buff/debuff end-game decks that felt great to pilot. Here the good runs always end with maximising one or two pretty bland stacking archetypes and hoping it will hold up during the last boss, usually without really cool breakout cards that give that interesting turn-to-turn variation and OP meta-interaction. It does some new and interesting things really well, here the characters sort-off take the role breakout cards often have in other games, and provide needed build overlap and interaction. Where some characters can heal, buff or tempo the group really well, but it’s always a consistent archetype you can establish very early on in the game and after that it’ll be all you’ll ever do every next battle and it’s pretty boring. All the viable builds center around stacking, it’s the only meta it has. There are some real breakout cards or mechanisms, and it does have them enough even, but you HAVE to build around them completely so they go from zero to absolutely bonkers OP with nothing in between. This makes them contrived, it’s not like that one cool surprise card drop that spices up your run and adds interest to it, no it’s either you hunt and build towards it, or it’s a no-pick with nothing in between.

It's just too much. Nine damage types and even more buffs, debuffs, mitigations and vulnerabilities. There are 49 (!) status effects that all behave differently in almost every aspect, and have to be built towards to become end-game viable. Four character types with all four separate cardpools, skillbuilds and team interactions. Each character having four item slots with countless items to choose from and be RNG’d by, multiple upgrade paths, with pets and other meta and in-game options on top of that. Enormous cardpools, with small weapons, boons, curses, books, enchantments, injuries and many more variants, some not clearly stated how they behave.

It stops being fun at some point, and even though I enjoy it, this game firmly crossed this line. Finished it a few times and got burned out after seeing vaguely mastering my new unlocks would cost me another 20-40 hours of tedious gametime to feel fun and controlled. While at the same time I went back to STS, and played another 20 hours with a MUCH more narrow gameplay scope and had a LOT more fun and variation. That’s weird because the whole thing of this game compared to STS is it wants you to feel more in control, it wants you to have more choice and options, it hopes this gives you more fun but really it doesn’t.

The love of the developer for their product drips from every pore of this game, but they went too far with it and it got tedious because of it.

Almost all of the positive reviews mention co-op as a huge boon to the game. That's great! It's not a very good single-player game, though. There are hundreds of combinations of status effects and damage types. I played through the first map and it went literally from ""roll your face on keyboard"" easy to ""lol nope"" difficult at the first boss. Sure, if I knew what I was doing, I could probably make a stand against that boss. But it was absolutely shocking how little the game itself prepared me for the difference in difficulty.

Difficulty curves matter. You don't generally fight the Heart in battle 1 in StS. Difficulty should increase as you play, not suddenly jump up. When I hit that boss, I had no tools and no understanding of how the game worked. I'm too old and tired to sink another hundred hours into watching videos - since the ""tutorial"" isn't.

Very pretty game, though, and glad it's good for co-op.",1684355948,1684355948,False,2,0,0.519685029983520508,0,True,False,False

Look, I can confidently say that this game has quickly become one of my current favorites. Let's see, it has an good size roster of interesting characters. Each possessing unique traits that can impact the battlefield in different ways providing diverse and strategic gameplay possibilities. It's very fun experimenting with different character combinations. Learning how they work together. With a plethora of ways to build them. It keeps you engaged and excited to explore new strategies.

It has an impressive pool of cards and equipment. From different kinds of attacks, all sorts of protective defensive maneuvers, and everything in-between. The satisfaction of assembling a finely tuned deck that synergizes perfectly with your chosen characters feels great.

Not to mention it offers a lot of replayability. The game blends deckbuilding with roguelike elements. Every playthrough can present fresh challenges and encounters. If you want difficulty then you can ramp up the madness level higher and higher until the game gets insanely difficult. The sense of progression is well-balanced too keeping you hooked and eager to start another run.

If that's not enough, the game features exciting ever changing challenges, providing additional layers of gameplay and rewards like card backs. These challenges can push your skills and knowledge of the characters and cards to the limit and offer unique experiences that further expand the game's longevity. Whether you're a solo player or prefer teaming up with friends, co-op adds an extra dimension of enjoyment. Where you can do your best to coordinate strategies with your friends, or have all of your friends build crazy decks, then do your best to survive your adventure.

So, I wholeheartedly recommend the game to everyone who appreciates deckbuilding, roguelike, and co-op games. It is an absolute must-play in my opinion.",1684316132,1684316132,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I think i would describe the card design as hearthstone esque, most cards are simple and easy to understand, but the deck building/tinkering fun is in finding powerful synergies between cards, character traits, talents, items, and party combinations. And their are a ton of fun options to play around with.

multiplayer is also a nice touch, everything is more fun with friends. 

Their's a lot of variety to be had here Even though the bosses/maps are somewhat limited the multiple map paths, game play variety, and rougelike elements lead to substantial replayability. Their are also weekly challenge modes that shake things up. Easily worth the 20 bucks if it peaks your interest.

my only complaint is that I wish we had more map content for this great game. I hope the Devs release another DlC or micro expansion focused on expanding the campaign map for story mode. (Wolf Wars DLC was bit lack luster outside of the new character it adds) or giving us a second story mode.

Then I started increasing madness.  I like challenges of some of the madness levels - they actually make the game better (random + challenging monsters, for instance).  Overall, however, the madness levels just reverse some the selections you've been making to buff your character up, which is poor design.  Why have a whole system to make your characters all beefy, just to lose the buffs later?  Instead, they should have scenarios and monster buffs that increase difficulty.  At the very least, have all (not just some) of the challenge items checkable.  

I also did not like the obelisk and weekly challenge modes.  I thought I would - a random challenge to work through?  Cool.

While this game can obviously be compared to something like sts it actually is its own game. This game uses a perk system which actually means that you commit to a build type at the start of the run- but then the game also gives you a bunch of tools to craft that deck. This completely changes the thoughts from being super reactive to instead having to think about robustness of strategy etc. This game has a lot of things going on in it and I personally enjoy the layers of depth.

It does have a few things that are worth noting
- runs take forever (literally like 5 hours+)
-one does not simply start a run. Deciding on team composition, perk combos and then using the starting town to buy cards, upgrades and items literally takes me and my cousin an hour every run. 
-Some of the interactions are confusing and unintuitive. I'm not sure if the tutorial didn't explain them or if I just forgot due to everything that was happening but yeh turns out resistances don't apply when hitting block. Who'd have known.

Instead of 1 hero you play as a group of 4 heroes, which means 4 times as many decks to deal with, and all the heroes can get equipment. On top of that the game introduces the vast majority of the mechanics right up front, so the learning curve is effectively a wall. You'd think the complexity would make the game significantly deeper than its inspiration, but you'd be wrong.

The game is so unsophistically designed you still end up largely sticking with the same strategies: Bunkering down with a dumb amount of shields until you've stacked enough scaling damage like poison and/or bleed and brute force the enemies down. That is of course unless an enemy uses a ""fuck you"" card and straight gets rid of all the scaled damage, or a card that purges all your shield with no way of counterplaying against it. If brute forcing scaling damage doesn't get you there, you can always rely on slowly grinding permanent buffs.

That's right, it's not just cards you unlock as you play, you also slowly gain XP that you can spend on perk points that make your heroes better. And not trade-off types upgrades where you have to specialize and plan around synergy, I mean straight up do more block and do more damage type of upgrades. So no matter how good you are at the game, no matter how great your run is going, unless you have enough points in the right perks, you are simply going to lose sooner or later.

If the tightly controlled difficulty, ease of unlocking all the cards and genuinely fair but challenging runs in Slay the Spire are the things that appealed to you in that game then you will not find that here.

I lost a large chunk of my vision at the beginning of the year and Ive always been a big gamer so losing the ability to play most games was extremely difficult for me.

a friend of mine suggested this game to me so I gave it a try.  I am having a blast.  Ive always loved RPGs and Roguelite's but never really been into the card aspect. But with my condition, the slower pace and strategy is exactly what I was looking for.  That, combined with it being coop so friends and I can play together and they help me by reading the story aspects to me has increased my mental health tremendously.

I cant say how thankful I am to the developers for putting so much effort and care into making such a phenomenal game.  Tons of strategy and variety to encourage multiple runs to try out new things and have some fun.  I got lucky and discovered the game right as the first expansion was released as well so as soon as I realized I was addicted, I quickly snatched that up as well.

Niche items, cards, and hero combinations lend to a large, diverse ways to play, and they can all feel overpowered (in a good way) in the right circumstances. Playing as 4 healers can be just as powerful as 1 of each class, or 4 tanks, etc etc.

The game does a GREAT job at progression, with making the game easier as you play it with time through leveling up perks (+1 attack, +1 healing, +1 guard, etc.), which eventually allows you to beat the base game. From there, you can go into ""madness"" levels, and gradually play your way up to madness 16, with each level progressively giving you more challenging and limiting parameters. The gradual ramp up allows for MANY different hero and item combinations to feel incredibly overpowered for one difficulty 15 hours in, and then forces you (again, in a good way) to change that strategy as the challenges scale. Heroes that I thought were weak in the base game became my favorites in higher difficulties.

I've played this game with a group of 4, and our strategy/favorite heroes has evolved about 4-5 times over 60 hours of gameplay and getting up to madness 7 together so far. Overall a VERY solid pick if you liked STS or Monster Train, that I would highly recommend.

The developers put out a solid free update recently, paired with a poorly received expansion, since most of the good stuff they gave players for free. The developers have noted that it was a poor reception, and will most likely change how they release future updates/expansions. I HOPE they release future content to this great game, but even if they don't, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

I really enjoy that you can start off with a saved deck for each character and create party builds before the run starts. There is a campaign mode with a specific set of maps to unlock characters and pets, and then a randomized mode. I have unlocked all characters but only a few pets at this point.

I played multiplayer co-op with some friends, and that worked well. It was interesting that we could each bring in-game currency to have a ""mega-run"" where each player dumped their savings into their character's deck. The party can get quite strong that way. Players can also give each other currency. It was fun to only have to worry about one character's deck. Unlike many turn-based game, playing co-op multiplayer seemed to make the game's pace faster when all players are paying attention.

My one complaint is that the audio sound-bytes from some enemies are very repetitive and quite annoying. I wish each enemy had a few randomized sounds, some of which were not a load grunt/moan. The soundtrack is a little repetitive as well, with many short melodic loops.

But they have a Slay the Spire grind of increasingly difficult run restrictions. Starting at rank 4, you can no longer use chests. So I just. don't go past rank 3. I really wish they didn't make such a difficult power cutoff. But that's such a hard cliff. You just lose any run past that point. And can't do anything to strategize your way around it.

Problem becomes: once you enter the highest difficulties of the game, certain cards and styles become dominate. 75-90% of the cards and items become obsolete due to the game heavily encouraging certain play styles. Namely: 

Card Scrying to remove all RNG (no punishment for this)
Small decks for the same reason (no punishment for this)
Card Draw for the same reason (no punishment for this)
Speed and it's manipulation (slow the enemy), as there is no punishment at all for acting first and it is only a benefit to kill quickly
One Turn Kills - offense is king, see above. Also, the game gives better cards and XP by winning faster, discouraging any defensive builds
Buffs are superior to debuffs and become the defacto card choices due to the way damage is calculated 
Vulnerable is by far the best debuff and all you need to consider 95% of the time with a 5% nod to debuffing in your 'style' that run

In other games of this genre there are typically enemies who counter all sorts of styles and comps found in the game. There being no punishment for acting first is a huge issue in overall balance, as in this game, the enemies have no inherent buffs or counters pre-setup and need to have a turn to interact or setup. It leads to the feeling of you playing mere cardboard cutouts of enemies, who you have very little actual interaction with. You can see why getting fast early kills is a huge bonus: 4 vs 2-3 (or none) is superior to a real 4 vs 4. Having minimal interaction is not a good thing for a strategy game, unless you are just after building the perfect One Turn Kill builds (which is possible, it just handcuffs the player immensely, as pointed out above). And for some reason the game REWARDS 1-2 turn killing comps with improved card rewards and more XP to level faster (and a higher score, if you are into leader boards). Its quite frustrating to have all these fun builds and comps, only to find out only certain styles work on the highest difficulties of the game, as the lower difficulties become too easy with game knowledge and unlocks. 

In conclusion, I had a great time unlocking the new heroes, pets, gear and just learning the game over all. There is a reason I have 300+ hours. However, the reward for all your work is a very stagnant and repetitive 'end game' where only certain styles and comps are competitive and a vast majority of cards are just garbage. This is VERY frustrating as the experience up until then is quite rewarding. I think back to games it is compared to like Darkest Dungeon, Slay the Spire and Monster Train and how they better handle the speed equation and draw/scry/small decks and can't help but find this game lacking in design. 

There is a single quirky battle in the game involving a Bunny who out-speeds all comps and he summons other allies to the battle who are able to actually buff and setup a sort of defense and offense for themselves. It is so unlike any other battle in the game and is often cited as being quite annoying and frustrating to fight. The ironic part is this is the EXACT sort of battles that the game is missing in order to better balance itself. It's sheer existence is such a shock to the player's system because you are not GOD for a single fight, and it is jarring.",1682873178,1682873178,False,3,1,0.498188048601150513,0,True,False,False

Biggest complaints about the game: 
Lackluster late-game experience, most of the game's fun content is unlocking the characters and completing the game.

Not enough variety in builds, each character's only identity is in their talents, which some characters share with each other. Each Class of hero has only a handful of builds they could realistically run.

It has the right amount of controllable RNG to make it challenging yet not insufferable. Every run feels salvageable as long as you generally know what you're doing and what to look for.

It takes a little while to understand, but once you master the game, you'll have a hard time quitting a run even if you should have been asleep hours earlier.

If you're struggling to beat the game, then read the below spoiler.
[spoiler]I highly recommend unlocking Ottis (the Pigman) and Cornelius (the Pyromancer) first as the two have great synergy. Having those two units, along with Andrin and Magnus, are all you should need to beat the game your first time. For Ottis, get rid of any shielding or direct healing cards and just focus on Holy damaging cards that apply Sanctify and Burn. Additionally, only take traits on the left side of Ottis's tree, anything on the right is not needed.[/spoiler]

I will note, the ""combat presentation"" (some of the music, sounds, and animations) are pretty lacking, though are still a general improvement over those from StS that you might be familiar with, and this game does force artificial difficulty via giving you absolute garbage starting cards/classes and very few options to change them at first in order to encourage more replaying to unlock better items/cards and start with more currency in the future to progress further every run. Do NOT expect to make it far, have any real inter-card synergies, or even kill the earliest boss on your first run, this game is very much about meta-progression.

That being said, the meta-progression is fun and has many different facets to unlock and keep you engaged (including item/card/pet/character unlocks to be found in future runs, permanent starting perks for each character, next-run starting currency rewards based on your performance and progression from the previous run, and probably other things I'm forgetting/haven't learned about yet), as well as current run progression in the form of character level-ups and the aforementioned unlockable, improved items and characters.

This rogue-lite deck builder is an absolute gem. Mechanically it shares a lot of its core DNA with Slay The Spire alongside a few strands of Darkest Dungeon, but with plenty of it's own idea up in the mix too. There're some unique in-battle mechanics such as manipulating your party's/the enemy's speed to take advantage of the turn order and the addition of Sight as a debuff that reveals the next x cards the target enemy is going to play. There's also a whole host of interesting systems outside battles, with extensive progression in the form of per-character perk trees, your party composition & previous choices affecting the options available to you during events, mini-dungeons appearing at nodes on the world map, and that's not to mention the most exciting addition (which I have still yet to try out): four player co-op!

The gameplay is deep. As we unlock more cards on our runs, we are developing more complex builds and strategize as a team. We switch characters between runs to keep things fresh.

We’ve had problems in the past with the multiplayer of other games. This game has a fantastic save system that means disconnections are no sweat. Someone drops? When they are back, we resume fighting mid-combat within one minute. We lose hardly any gameplay progress.

I think I am about 40% through the normal stories (beat madness 2+8 when max is 8+8) and its great fun!

Be warned: if you do play multiplayer, be ready to offer 8+ hours of your life, or risk not finishing the run.

*EDIT*
Hard edit from yes to no:
If you like a hardcore deckbuilder with only a hand ful of viable strategies, this might be for you.
There are a hand full of strategies that are just WAY better than the rest.
Which wouldnt be the problem, if the RPG adventure part of the game wouldnt suddenly become a hardcore deckbuilder.

Throughout the game on adventure mode, you are given rewards to use in other runs, like chests and supply crates.
But at certain difficulty spikes, you can no longer use them.
Which means that you go from having a nearly complete deck before having your first fight (which isnt as OP as it might sound, as enemies get ridicolously tough lateron) to having basicially only your startdeck plus a few bad cards, because you are lacking ressources to build your deck.
That just happens with basicially no warning. 
Now you can either play the ""fun"" mode with enough money to build your deck, or you can start playing an even harder difficulty than before with a completely useless deck.
You feel so bad all of a sudden.

So I actually stopped playing now. After playing a long 150 hours in 2 weeks, I now find myself not enjoying it anymore.
Because I have to chose between experimentation, but weak opponents, or hard opponents and maticolously planning out my deck with more or less meta strategies.

So if you just want a hardcore deckbuilder, this game might be for you, if you want to have fun and get to max difficulty by farming ressources and unlocks... this is the wrong game for you... (after 100+ hours)",1681287021,1681942927,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

My favourite play style is using Thuls and Malukah to inflict damage using Poison and Shadow damage stacks. Running Nezglekt for heals and Heiner as a front line tank makes the base game a breeze. I haven't tried the madness difficulties, but having them as an option as a post game challenge is welcome.

Something along these lines occurs in basically every run at some point. 
The developers have a very bad idea of what a healthy card game is. They used to lock you out of the game by saying that you're just not allowed to play cards, class by class. (Silence you, so no spells; Disarm you, so no attacks; do this to your whole team for two turns every two turns)
I've got a great idea for a card game. Rule number 1 is that YOU aren't allowed to play cards.
Ok, now I get to punish you for everything stack of everything you put on me and punish you for every stack of everything you put on yourself, and and and....

The game is great, 50% like Slay the Spire and 50% like Darkest Dungeon and the result is great, with a lot of qol features and an extremely polished game. For sure a game among the best roguelike deckbuilders I have played... So what is the problem?

Final levels and final boss are a grindfest, the metagame is slow and runs take forever...

The fight mechanics are Ok but the balance feels unfair. You need to min-max a lot if you want to beat the game and I fund that design choice just unfair...

The main appeal of games like Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon or Monster Train is that fights are relatively short. This is also the case with the first fights in Across the Obelisk but it quickly turns into slowest fights... By the time that you reach the last acts it takes forever.

In general I do recommend the game, it is an easy 7/10 but still, I have some mixed feelings.

The seamless meta progression being shared in multiplayer is impressive and functions so well with cross-unlocks, rewards and rank points being shared exactly when you feel like they should be - the developers hit the nail on the head in that aspect for sure.

The presentation is charming, the soundscape is nice but the music can get a bit repetetive. Which obviously isn't a real problem if you just put on some music you like yourself. 

The one thing that comes to mind that could elevate this game even more would be alternative Act bosses and even more biomes to choose from when progressing.

There's plenty to unlock, a town to upgrade, new characters, and a higher difficulty mode. its a solid challenge and will require some trial and error to figure out what works and where.

It also has two player co-op where you can split your party and allow your friend to control a character. Though word of warning if you or your friend want to unlock a character it cannot be done if that character is in your party.

My only real complaint here is that the world is generic as hell, the story is boring and borderline nonexistent, and a lot of the characters look like they are either the most generic archetypes ever or straight up ripped from other IPs giving the world a bit of a cheap knock off feel.

I enjoy the little touches the devs added to this game.

1. Supplies to level up the town to provide perks and such. Eventually max out your town? Now you can sell supplies for gold. Still useful.
2. Talent Trees - I like how I can continuously level up my characters no matter how poorly runs go. I'm 40 hours in and no where near maxing our skill points that add perks and stuff to the characters. 
3. Skill Points in talent trees - Playing through a run ""levels"" up all of your characters even if you don't play them. Lets you swap characters for runs without having to grind them up individually. Get a new character? They start with the same amount of skill points.
4. Talent Tree Save - I can save multiple talent tree builds under each character letting me swap with ease.
5. Story narrative + different encounter options based on party members in the party - nice touch
6. Gold and Crystal carry over from previous games (up to 3 slots) - save the gold and crystals you don't use from a previous run and use them on the current run.
7. Customize your deck (build cards, upgrade cards) at each city. This is where using a previous runs crystals comes in handy. Doesn't lock a character to a specific play style.
8. Co-Op - Is a blast with your friend(s). You assign which slot(s) your friend(s) can control. They select a champion they have unlocked from their pool. This includes any perks they have for character. You each have your own crystal / gold pool and import your own if you wish at the start. You still gain progress (ranks) on your characters that were selected for MP. 
9. Character Ranks -  unlock little perks, cosmetics, and other items the higher rank a character. You earn rank by playing that character for a run.
10. The narrative and story are fun.
11. Many difficulty adaptions after beating the game to keep the game challenging as you get stronger
12. Restart fight / additional tries if you fail - if you want to learn tactics and learn how to improve you can restart a fight at any time. 
13. Choose your path - effectively choose your path through several zones and sub zones that have special events",1680667863,1681434076,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

- The amount of interactivity depth with every single node on the map keeps things fresh and interesting, I haven't seen this in others
- The progression in the game is very satisfying e.g., character levels and perks, card, item, node, and pet discovery 
- The fantasy universe is fun, the synergy between the characters is enjoyable, and there is flexibility in playing, you don't need to calculate everything like a robot.

It has a very polished set of closely-linked mechanics that make acquiring system mastery very rewarding. There's a huge variety of possible builds and combinations of characters, and a lot of interesting stuff to discover on the map.

I haven't played a huge amount (only 24 hrs so far haha) so I may come back to revise this later, but here's what I'm seeing right now.

PROS
Multiplayer: The multiplayer works *really well.* Each player controls one or more of the characters in a party of 4, taking their own turns in the initiative order. I was worried at first it would be boring waiting for other players to take their turn, but the game systems are complex enough that the game actually feels easier and even more fun bcos you only have to worry about the build of your own character.

Aura/Curse system: There are a lot of status effects-- which at first kinda turned me off bcos it seemed a bit over-complex, but as you learn what they do and how to take advantage of them or mitigate them as appropriate, you realize they're fundamentally the core of the game's scaling. This game has a *lot* of chip damage, and learning how to optimize the stacks you're putting out and minimize the stacks you're gaining is absolutely critical to getting through the game. However this also means effects like ""dispel"" are inordinately very powerful, but I consider learning this to be part of system mastery. It helps that each of the biomes focuses on one or two of the status effects and will teach you how to use / defend against those conditions, though I do have the complaint that some of them are never fully explained (looking at you, vitality).

""Hidden Value"" cards: Because of the way a lot of card interactions work, there are a lot of cards that seem kinda useless at first... but as you learn the game you discover a niche they fall into and they can become very effective. Cards that look useless until you get that critical +1 stacks of sharp, or a specific piece of gear, or a tiny energy discount and suddenly they're the core of your deck lends a really satisfying sense of discovery and really rewards system mastery.

Narrative elements: The game has a really neat system for interconnected story events to encourage you to try a lot of different paths through the map. I keep discovering new hidden areas, unique event outcomes, and fun story moments, and I expect to keep discovering new stuff for a while.

Boss design: I won't spoil any of the specific bosses, but I *really* like the design of all the different bosses. Though I do want a little more variety in the boss of the first area, I really like all the main bosses and all the zone mini-bosses are really cool and feel rewarding to challenge, and once again feel that you are strongly, strongly rewarded for system mastery as you learn their unique weaknesses and cards. On a similar note, enemy variety in general is really, really strong, but the bosses stand out as a high point in enemy design here.

CONS
Damage math: Because of how the resistances work, cards never deal the amount of damage they say on them. This is mitigated by the card showing how much damage it *will* deal on the enemies when you hover over it, a great piece of QOL, but it does make the math a lot harder on whether or not you have lethal. Especially when you have spark (which doesn't show up on enemy health bars,) changing initiatives, and multiple sources of damage over time. I would really love it if vitality bonus health and spark damage were shown on health bars... but I understand why they would start getting too complicated!

Card pools: While there are 16 characters, there are only four unique card pools, and you're usually going to be running with one of each. While each of the characters has unique passives and level-up abilities, and possibly a unique card, you're mostly going to be seeing the same cards every run. I would like to see more diversity in unique cards available to each character, since some of the cards in the pool are just not useful to some characters because of their abilities, which is frustrating at times. But I suppose part of the learning curve in the game is learning which cards are better on which characters.

Early metagame scaling: The way character perks change the relative power level of different cards as you advance is interesting, but also makes the game feel really punishing for the first few runs until you get the required +1 stacks to make a curse/aura build work. It smooths out once you've got a handful of perk points to spread around but that early power curve is really steep.

Sound design / Audio mixing: The sound mixing and design isn't perfect in a lot of places; there are a few sound effects (including a block sound) that are mixed noticeably higher than other sounds that always startle me. And a few enemies use the same ""hurt"" sound as some characters, which can be very confusing as a piece of audio feedback.

Town downtime & overworld shopping: As you get more into the game, it becomes possible to spend a *lot* of time in the towns doing upgrades, buying and removing cards, buying gear, etc. You can basically rebuild your entire starting deck in the first town, and it takes a long time, especially if you're in singleplayer trying to set up four characters! This is somewhat mitigated by getting free removes / upgrades from corruption events in the map, but often the shops and upgrade altars you can find in the world are actually *more* expensive than what you can get in the town, so there's often no point in using them unless you desperately need something upgraded. (IMHO, except in act 4, upgrade altars, churches, and shops in the map should always be cheaper than town, bcos in towns you'll have a ton of cash you just got from bosses, whereas when you're in the map you'll probably have spent a lot of cash in town. I'd like there to be a risk / reward for saving money for an upgrade altar on the map instead of just reliably getting everything you need in town). Maybe there's more to it I haven't figured out yet, but it seems like a waste of a map node to visit an upgrade altar in the map! (except in act 4)

TL;DR
An awesome new addition to the slay-the-spire-like genre that definitely scratches that same itch, but now with multiplayer! A few rough spots in overall polish but more than makes up for it with mechanical depth.",1681236082,1681236082,True,5,0,0.592326164245605469,0,True,False,False

First and foremost, I would give this game roughly 9/10.

I give this game a 9/10 not because I don't think it's a perfect game, but because of personal hopes that I would like for the game. The base game content I would say is 9/10 as well as the DLC [Wolf Wars] being a solid 10/10.

Why the base game is 9/10:
>Creativity 8/10
>Gameplay 10/10
>Graphics 10/10
>Multiplayer friendly 9/10
>Technicality 9/10
>Audio 10/10
>Value 10/10
>Market [Excluding Wolf Wars] 10/10
>Narrative 8/10

Why DLC [Wolf Wars] is 8/10:
>Creativity 10/10
>Gameplay 10/10
>Graphics 10/10
>Multiplayer friendly 9/10
>Technicality 10/10
>Audio 10/10
>Value 7/10
>Narrative 10/10

The creativity of the base game was honestly below what I have it at right now before the major update mixed within the Wolf Wars DLC drop. I say this because it seemed like a complete re-hash of Slay the spire [which you probably get way too often]. However, the update generated the necessary original feel that separates it from the clutches of such a similarity. Wolf Wars feels completely original itself with some very sweet looking card drops as well. The base game doesn't get the 10 simply because it still uses the exact same card names from StS as well as some very similar looking card mechanics and descriptions.

Gameplay of both Wolf Wars and base game were top notch. Different in their respects, but I appreciate the feel of selecting cards from my hand to place and watching the events unfold from my selection more than how many cards I have or which I can carry with me. 

Graphics of the game just look fantastic-- almost nostalgic! The graphic update in the newest patch / DLC drop made the game look infinitely times better! 

Multiplayer is a bit off due to connectivity issues and sudden game failures. While I don't think it is entirely ATO's fault, I just can't tell if the game is the reason for my crash when playing with friends or if it's one of us. For that, I couldn't give it a perfect score. 

Technicality is FANTASTIC for both the base game as well as wolf wars. However, the technicality of the base game- due to the high amount of buffs you get later on in the game as well as with the card upgrades- it becomes almost obsolete to think tactically. With Wolf Wars being solely played on tactics and technicality, I don't think the base game deserves the same ranking as Wolf Wars in this regard. 

The audio and value for the game at base game is 100% worth it, no doubt. The value is great for the base game, but not for Wolf Wars. After having played Wolf Wars, I can't say that I would buy it again at the price it is listed at right now. If the DLC changed to a 7$ value or below, I would totally buy it again as I believe it would be a fantastic price. 10$ for the DLC seems way too much as it isn't a drastic change in the normal gameplay of the game. A few new cards, a single character, skins, and a pet are nice and may change the meta of the players, but I don't think that warrants a 10$ price tag. Other games do the same thing with a 2$ price tag for dlcs. With that in mind, I think 7$ would be a fantastic price. 

The market for ATO is awesome when excluding wolf wars. Prices make sense as the content they release is mainly vanity.

Although, the narrative of the game seems a bit lacking. The story seems to be simplistic in the idea that the player must ""Save the princess"" but really find out that there is a larger ""Big Bad"" at play. The smaller lore nodes are fantastic and I would rate them as 10/10 for being rich with content as there are so many of them. The main story lore is just boring, though. And for that, I can't give it a 10/10 either. Wolf Wars lore was amazing though. I enjoyed the narrative of Wolf Wars and would give it a 10/10.

FINAL SUGGESTIONS / HOPES / TLDR

I love ATO. I wouldn't change much about it at all besides the $ on Wolf Wars, certain beginning cards to get a name change / description change, as well as main story narrative adjustments. One huge piece I wish Wolf Wars would have kept was the additional characters we play in the Wolf Diaries. [Shooter Wolf and Healer Wolf... I forgot their names..]  As well as making some of the enemies we play against part of the character roster. I know that characters should have a unique story as well as a great play style which might be taken up by another character, but involving the already created NPCs into the character roster [or skin roster] somehow might make the game feel like its content is significantly increased. 
I enjoy new characters being created and even if some of the NPCs became skins for certain characters with color rehaul, I could live with that being a DLC as well. Besides characters, I hope the game continues to grow. I enjoy watching it do so and will support it on its journey :)",1681069490,1681069490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The progression between each run is incredibly rewarding.

And of course, my favorite part, its up to 4 player co-op. 

I would argue this is the best co-op digital card game on the market.

Thanks for this, cant see what else this studio does, and hope they keep putting out DLC for this game.

The current DLC offerings are largely cosmetic, with a single additional character and related static story subquest.
An expansion is currently on the way, which will expand on the game's content significantly, alleviating its largest issue: a lack of content to explore with these varied decks and characters.

Question for developers (I hope you guys, checking the comments):
Do you have any plans for external tooling to simplify deck building? E.g. online calculator, like exists for borderlands games, where you can pick the team, items, perks, buffs, enemies with debuffs, and see the damage/heal numbers properly (base, damage calculation formula, final damage) etc.

As an aside: each of these cards has about as much impact feel as a sausage being slapped across a soft piece of bread when you use them. I can't believe there's fast mode option, because it basically starts on it.

Back to my main gripe, It starts you with two characters in a simple fight and I thought 'okay fine these cards have a lot going on but I can get into it'. Then it gives you two more immediately and throws you into upgrading your cards. With each of these four characters starting with 20 cards in their decks it's way too much to ease you into it and I simply can't be bothered to learn the million little +X percent damage perks and items each character has.

Also, the steam deck experience & controller experience is a little meh. Font could be bigger and also just playing a card is a little inconvenient to use.

If you enjoy Slay the Spire, get this game, it's just as good if not better. The devs are also incredibly responsive, fixing bugs in mere hours, and are active on the game's discord.

This game is a proper roguelike, and you shouldn't expect to win on your first attempt, but the progression feels very satisfying, and you never really feel bad for losing because you're always making progress and getting better. Characters get perks and equipment, which allow for tons of unique strategies and builds, plus your party composition further allows for all sorts of combos.

The up-to-4-player multiplayer is really well designed, and feels just as good as single player. Replayability of this game is huge, and there's still a lot of content i haven't even seen yet.

Some of the game's rare events also make cheeky references to various popular media, which is a fun bonus when you get the reference, but not immersion-breaking if you don't.

The feature I'm most looking forward to in the future for this game is increased modding support. It's just barely past its 1.0 release at the moment, and I'm sure it'll catch on with the modding community once more people try it. All in all, an 11/10 game.

But when I came across this game and saw that I could play this with my fiancee I was immediately excited. Him being the huge roguelike/rogue-lite player between us, I felt it would be a really fun way for us both to interact with the game and I learn what roguelike/roguelites are like in a much new player-friendly way. 

I started playing this and was immediately pulled into the deck building. I've always enjoyed card games but this one just endeared me so much. The art style is so much fun! The story aspect is fascinating and funny! (Cornelius do be burning!) And I loved how the mechanics worked between themselves. It's helped me to become a better roguelike/roguelite player and for that this game has become a fundamental part of my gaming journey. 

For new players to roguelikes I'd heavily encourage playing this before playing any of the big ""classic"" ones. I tried playing from the other way around and it left me feeling really overwhelmed. Now I play several different types of roguelikes now. From Binding of Isaac, Risk of Rain 2, to Slay the Spire and Gunfire Reborn.

The gameplay loop is really fun. Each time you start a new run you will get boxes that you can use to upgrade your time in the adventure mode. To make things simpler. So it builds upon itself here. However, there is a separate game mode that doesn't work with any of the modifiers. So this game is both a roguelike and a roguelite. Which is wild and fun if you want to experience both sides of the coin. Either way I highly recommend this game. Even the DLC can be a fun way to add more support to the devs and I have because I enjoy this game so much.",1680615530,1680615530,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The game is divided into a story mode consisting of acts, each with different enemies, and there is also a challenge mode where the deck composition is dictated by the initial offer of some card packs, as well as a weekly challenge where the party composition is fixed by the game itself. The graphics are extremely pleasing, with great artwork. There aren't many customization elements for characters except for some skins. The soundtrack is enjoyable, with some tunes sticking in your head more than others.

The basic gameplay is very simple, but the challenge level can be gradually increased by adding ""madness"" levels. Randomization of enemies and the addition of unfavorable challenge conditions are some of the modifications that can be made.

The game is highly replayable, with the ability to try out different combinations of characters and cards each time (including using characters outside of their ""main"" role), keeping the game always fresh and fun. The best way to play this game is with friends, making any situation or event even more enjoyable.

There are some criticisms that could be made about the final boss fight, which can be a bit boring, and the story isn't very deep, but it still serves its purpose as an accompaniment. Overall, the game is highly recommended, especially when played with friends, especially with the new DLC coming out that delves deeper into the story.

EDIT: There is no deckbuilding in the DLC, as it is a self-contained act that brings you back to Act 1 at the end. However, if you are interested in supporting the developers, delving deeper into the game world's lore, and trying out Yogger, a fun character to use, then I recommend purchasing the DLC.",1679907941,1680606601,True,1,0,0.5207100510597229,0,True,False,False

Playing this game is a fantastic experience that offers a great variety of deck-building possibilities and numerous compositions. You can play whatever you want and manage four characters with specific roles to create your own little team of adventurers. The game is very well designed with a clear interface and all the useful information is visible at a glance. The games are long and offer great replayability. Progression is real thanks to talent trees and cards/equipment that are unlocked over time.

However, the game has many narrative events, but it is only available in English, Chinese, and Spanish, which may be a disadvantage for some players. In addition, although there are two other game modes outside of the main adventure, they may seem quite secondary.

The co-op mode for up to 4 players is a rare feature in this type of game, but very well thought out and seamlessly integrated into the gameplay. The game's characters each have their own mechanics, and there are four types of characters, each with their own set of available cards, which gives a great impression of creating your team and embarking on an adventure like in an RPG.

Graphically, the game is beautiful and colorful, but the sound level is average without being exceptional.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed Slay the Spire or who enjoys card or rogue-like games. After 150 hours of gameplay, I am still as enthusiastic and plan to play a few more hours, especially with future content updates and DLCs planned. Although I did not encounter any bugs during my 150 hours of gameplay, which is very much appreciated, it is important to note that the game is not available in all languages.

For example, there are 3 different Damage over Time statuses (Bleed, Poison, Burn) but there are basically the same except for when they do damage or what blocks them.  The learning about these systems is probably the best moments of the game.  It all feels fresh and new.

I very much enjoyed my early experiences while playing with friends and alone, but the game began to feel rather dull after a few games and especially after my first eventual win.  While the various fixed maps are fun to explore and learn about, once you've run through major routes once, it's not very exciting hitting them a second time.  I think this game excels at being a deckbuilder with RPG like progression, but falls a little flat on replayability.  If you're a player would loves fiddling with builds and trying different mechanics, you may get more out of the game.

Right now though... the impression, the feeling, after a few hours of playtime is that it's just such a slog. Even on fast mode, and auto-end-turn, each combat encounter feels like a chore. And when practically each node on the map ends up in a combat... meh. Maybe it's the pacing, or the forced deck-size, or the small impact of cards, the onslaught of effects, percentages, debuffs, etc etc; I don't know. Something is off.

In fact, you can even build them up for 3 runs. If you don't spend as much gold and shards, you can ""transfer"" even more to future runs this way.

This system has SO many issues. First of all, if you make a mistake you now have to live with it for a full run. Or you even screwed up FOUR runs, if you grinded for 3 runs first. It takes a LOT of time to grind back up to where you were before. It's like starting all over. So much for your progression!

Secondly, it DISCOURAGES you from spending gold and shards in any given run...which is just stupid.

And third, it requires you to play suboptimally for 3 full games just to ""grind"" enough gold/shards for the next game. I don't know about you, but I don't want 3/4 of my runs to be pointless ones just not even trying to win.

And I also don't want to be so severely punished when I make one little mistake.

So I've quit playing this game. Sadly, it took me this long to find this major flaw in the game but I'm not going to continue any further until it's changed. If it's not changed, I guess I wasted $15. Oh well. Hopefully I save someone else from wasting their money by warning people about this stupid game mechanic.

EDIT: They came out with a new DLC with terrible reviews and made a long blog post basically saying nothing other than ""I'm sorry"". I replied saying they should have made the DLC free, and what was their response? They PERMANENT BANNED me from the forum.

TLDR: this game is the best parts of Slay the Spire and Darkest Dungeon.

The different options that this team has put together for every character is so incredibly well done. My buddy and I have been playing through over and over again unlocking different characters, pets, getting new events, and no run feels stale. We have gotten to the point where we try frankly silly runs, such as all mages, all clerics (damage Regi is beautifully OP). The combat is rewarding, figuring out strategies with a friend is priceless, and the fact that it is all done by a 3 person dev team is wild. I'm certain I'll be a fan of whatever these creative artists put together be it DLC or future games (maybe in the same universe!?!).

I could not recommend this game enough. By the way, there are (as of writing this) 3 game modes. I've managed to clock 125 hours in only the standard game mode alone. People, this game is dope. Co-op strategy goodness.",1680322855,1680322855,True,20,1,0.706495821475982666,0,True,False,False

In short, this game is very fun with huge breadth & depth of content, and absolutely worth buying if you enjoy these types of games.

So for a review, I should probably define what ""these types of games"" means.  I'm sure it's mentioned in at least half the reviews on here, but the obvious comparison for this game is something like Slay the Spire/Monster Train.  However, while there is a lot of overlap, there is a good bit in this game that differs as well; it is very far from a StS clone.

To begin with, in addition to just having a set starting deck for your characters, you have a 'Town' at the beginning of each area (including the first area) where you are able to use in-game resources to craft, upgrade, and/or remove cards from your starting decks.  The impact that this has on a run cannot be overstated.  At higher difficulties resources are more limited, but even still this customization opens up a HUGE amount of variety between runs.  Rather than *just* rolling with the punches and picking the best cards as you go, there are many different types of builds/archetypes available, and very different playstyles even using the same characters.  The ability to prime your characters to be able to lean into certain builds makes it much more viable to 'force' the types of builds you want to run.  This becomes increasingly harder the higher you climb difficulties and super optimal builds have a lot of overlap, but still allows for a lot of creativity and fun in the meantime.

Which leads into the next point - characters.  Having 4 character parties introduces yet another level of variety and complexity above other games of this type.  Coordinating a macro-level 'party synergy' on top of each character's individual decks is incredibly fun and rewarding, and allows for some truly over-the-top plays.  The best way to scale in this game isn't linear, but exponential, and having different characters form the backbone of your overall team strategy gives each character their own time to shine.  

All characters in the game are capable of supporting and fulfilling some sort of utility role, or hogging the spotlight and being the star-performer depending on how you plan your comp.  On top of decks, each character gets their own item slots, as well, which are a powerful part of each build.  The items typically give static buffs that apply to all cards of a certain type, and can give huge power spikes to the appropriate deck when picked up.

And while there is much, much more that could be written about this game - from the fun each biome/area has & how route planning can vary from run to run, to learning about the different bosses & enemies in each area, to the modes of play besides the standard adventure mode, etc. - I think I'm already pushing boundaries of how much info is useful to include in a review, so will begin to wrap up here.


All of this being said - I will say that it might seem overwhelming at first, but mechanics are overall quite intuitive and easy to learn with just a little bit of practice.  My advice would be to not worry too much and overthink things in the beginning; don't stress about your first town, don't worry about minmaxing your card rewards from the first fight.  Like any rogue-lite, you'll probably lose a decent bit at first and enjoy the growth & progression from run to run.  So at first, just try to roll with the punches, do what seems fun, and enjoy the journey.  The rest will come with time.

Finally, if possible I would definitely recommend starting with multiplayer; just to minimize the amount of information thrown at you at once.  Even having one other person to play with cuts the amount of learning to do on your first run from 4 classes to 2; if you have 3/4 people to play with and can just take one character each, even better.  It's fun to pick a class, try to learn that classes' cards very well while unlocking different heroes of that class to try a new spin on what you've already done.  And before you know it, after playing in multiplayer for a bit and learning the basics of the game, singleplayer becomes much more accessible and is quite fun as well.


So overall, this game is really freaking awesome.  There is a friendly, active discord in which the devs participate regularly and are very receptive to feedback.  The dev team obviously cares a ton about this game, and the amount of hard work, love, sweat, & tears they've poured into it obviously shows.  I've been playing for a year and some months already, and it's really cool to see how the game has evolved and been polished over time.  I've avoided the beta in anticipation of the 1.0 drop so far and can't wait to see what is coming with that.  And I know that the devs fully intend on adding to this game even more afterwards.

This is the first review I've ever felt compelled to write, but after the 367 hours of enjoyment I've already gotten from my purchase, and many more to come, I felt like I owed them this much.  If you're on the fence, let this be your deciding vote to give this game a shot.  Happy Obelisk-ing!",1660254603,1679944886,True,88,3,0.881861269474029541,0,True,False,True

Really close, but I think the negatives outweigh the positives. The game shines in introducing exploration into a roguelike/-lite deckbuilder with genuinely interesting events, areas and characters to uncover. However, the actual gameplay fails to uphold the experience to a sufficient degree.

THE GOOD:
The are quite sprawling maps you travel through on each playthrough. Within these maps are sub-areas, characters to unlock and even linkages across different maps, so that you could probably go for many hours and always have something new to find. This was the highlight in my experience and kept me hooked especially during the learning experience.
The roguelite-style also gives the game a very expicit power-creep which means that no playthrough is wasted. I suspect that this is more a case of the game keeping you hooked than engaged (which is bad), but especially for a highly casual gaming approach, this has merits.
Lastly, the game is competent and polished in all miscellaneous issues. I encountered no jank, the artstyle is actually beautiful and everything just works and all UIs are intuitive.

THE BAD:
I can't help comparing all roguelike deckbuilders to its grandaddy ""Slay the Spire"". In this comparison, Across the Obelisk does not hold up. First it lacks depth. Even after just some hours, I doubt that there are sooo many more non-obvious interactions to be found, while Slay the Spire feels still fresh after 400+ hours. There are sooooo many components, but they mostly fail to interact and produce anything noteworthy. This makes the game bloated instead of complex.
Here are just some examples where the game flunked the promise of a ""strategic gameplay experience"" on a basic level of implementation:
1. On my major playthrough I went for a ""block and poison"" build. Over time, I would build up poison and then focus on not dying. Pretty basic, but imo should be a valid strategy if done right and could feel really satisfying if you pull it off! The problem is, that some enemies simply have the ""Dispel""-ability, which can take the entire poison stack away in one move. Do you see the problem?? This didn't reduce the damage taken from it, it didn't stop new poison accumulating for some time; nope, just made ""Poof"" and poison was gone. The really terrible thing was that those enemies were still not strong enough to beat me, so that it just ended up being these battles of attrition, where the only challenge was my own boredom. Again - I only then realized that in Slay the Spire enemies nearly never can discharge poison effects, probably a very inspired and deliberate choice!
2. You can, with sufficient resources (which are not too sparse) just about entirely and freely change the layouts of all decks after each map. That undermines the fundamental thing that makes roguelike deckbuilders enjoyable, that circumstances form trajectories and keep every run fresh while forcing you to explore tactics further and further. A baffling choice!
3. The block-party member can get completely useless if they get ""slowed"" or chained unless you have the ""fortify""-ability. Like with the ""Dispel"" as a counter to status effects, this just seems too heavy-handed. Some strategies being better and worse in some situations than in others is great! But this is a flip between totally viable vs. totally useless, while the game does not hand you sufficient room to strategize to ensure or provision against that. This not only runs counter to strategic gameplay, but fundamentally undermines your willingness to approach the game on this level.

While the game gets some things right, it is flawed on a sufficiently fundamental level that I cannot imagine those concerns getting fixed later on. I hope that some future game can learn from this game's strengths and underpin it with a solid foundation of gameplay.",1679495469,1679495469,False,5,3,0.497152388095855713,0,True,False,False

The good:
It's simple to play and allows you a level of limited exploration to figure out every little thing before challenging yourself on higher difficulties. It's like... find the paths based on the way you make your team so you secure the items you need to fulfill your strategy and obtain victory! You can be as outrageous as you want so long as you're willing to learn the game!

The bad:
Eh... it's only up to how you feel: if you challenge the higher difficulties too early without really understanding the games and its limits, you can find yourself in losing situations all the time; so either you learn from those situations, or you work yourself up by repeating the same process that gets you nowhere.

I don't know if this is the intended design here, the devs clearly hate ppl using mages with a pet that auto attacks before turns, because of the silence aura on each enemy, that your pet hit the enemy to make you forever silenced even though my priest have tons of dispel which is utterly useless under this mechanic as dispel or not, your mage will still get silenced when the pet hit an enemy. Basically, the mage with an auto attack pet will almost never be able to cast any spell because this stupid mechanic. And clearly that's NOT ENOUGH, because this silence aura spell will be cast every 2 turns, forever silenced that is, I mean, ARE YOU SERIOUS???

The multiplayer aspect is unique in the genre making it fun to play with friends and families. It is a fun experience that is less punishing than other similar games, so it is a great way to introduce new players. I enjoyed building the decks and selecting perks to produce synergistic teams to tackle the bosses and fights, but I had the most fun with friends in multiplayer since it adds a unique challenge for team cohesion. There is a ton of replayability to the progression system that will keep you and your friends entertained for hours. 


Detailed Review:
First thing to note is that you aren't expected to win your first run or even a couple of runs like most rogue-like games so don't get discouraged by this. The progression systems will unlock items, cards, characters, perks, town upgrades, and even more to make your team more powerful during each run so the game will get easier and easier as you progress until you decide to make it harder via madness levels (similar to the heat system in Hades). With the unlocks and madness levels there is a ton of replayability to this game even after your first win.

The game has a great balance of difficulty and fun allowing a lot of different viable playstyles through 16 different characters with unique traits and shared card pools between similar classes. The cards are better or worse for each character based on their traits so figuring out what cards go well with each character is interesting part of the deck building system. You have more control of your cards and deck size than other deck builders so you can build very similar decks each run or experiment with entirely new cards between runs.

The multiplayer allows each person to control one or more of the characters and disagreements between where to go or what events to do are decided based on deck costs values (high cost, low cost, close to 2, etc.) so it is there is a lot of decisions that can be made by the non-host character compared to some other multiplayer games.  

A complete run tends to last for a few hours, but even if you lose a battle due to a bad RNG/play then you can try it again to see if you can survive it. This makes it far less punishing. I think this is great for a multiplayer setting since you and your teammates might not be in perfect sync. 

Overall if you like deck-building games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, Tainted Grail, etc. then this one is defintely worth a playing as you will almost certainly enjoy it. For new players to see if they like this genre, it overs a less punishing experience that is an enjoyable introduction to the genre. Further it has several unique features including multiplayer that makes the game fun, interesting, fun to play, and that distinguishes it from other games in the genre.",1677951204,1677951204,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

One of the things I love about Across the Obelisk is the game's stunning art style. The game's world is beautifully rendered in a 2D pixel-art style that is both charming and immersive. The character designs are also excellent, with each character having their own unique look and personality.

The gameplay in Across the Obelisk is also top-notch. The game features a deep and strategic combat system that requires you to plan your moves carefully and make use of your party's unique abilities. The game also has a lot of exploration and discovery, with plenty of secrets and hidden treasures to find as you make your way through the game's world.

Another thing I appreciate about Across the Obelisk is the game's story. It's a classic tale of heroes rising up against evil, but it's told in a way that feels fresh and engaging. The characters are all well-written and likable, and the game's dialogue is full of humor and charm.

Fun game with a solid gameloop: mow down mobs, open a pack of cards/item, get stronger, go again.
Played for 180 hours - it is very fun, and you can up the difficulty once you learned the ropes. but I recommend staying away from the despair modifier. It didnt really gave me 'difficulty', just made the game a whole lot more annoying and less comps playable. Enemies starts doing counter plays with the despair modifier, however the counterplays just takes the fun out of the game.

An example would be imagine youre playing slay the spire, and your enemy randomly has a card that transfers your 500 poison stacks on them back to you. Or an ability that says 'you cant play cards this turn'. Some enemies cast board wide slience spells which against a mage core team essentially ends the run. 

Enemy cards that undoes what you do or makes you unable to do what your build is built to do is certainly a valid design choice, but I wonder if its worth it when its actively taking away fun from players.",1677149033,1677149033,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The main issue is that to overcome first 5-10 hours of die-and-repeat runs, after which the game gets better and better.

Good stuff:
- really great replayability: challenges and randomness makes each run kind of unique
- 16 characters with own skills, though, some of them are unbalanced
- ability to filter cards by type, name, effect applied, etc, which is really helpful
- interesting combos with characters make the run really fun
- online co-op
- nice art

Bad stuff:
- main compaign is meh
- not so many unique areas, the world/map a bit boring, especially the last act
- steep learning curve
- not so many side quests, though events are interesting concept

The story mode adds a lot of strategy to the game as variance in enemies and map are dramatically reduced so you can plan around what enemies and events are upcoming. This has the upside of allowing cool special events that account for actions you took earlier in the run, giving you a lot to try out across multiple runs.

The characters all play differently in a satisfying way, and the perk system for the story mode enables you to try unique builds that fundamentally alter how you play. (For example, some perks convert damage types on buffs/debuffs, which means it now interacts with different cards and items). Items on your run can be incredibly synergistic and can change how you paly on runs heavily. This is the heart of making a good roguelite to me, as a plethora of meaningful choices that change how you play give the game a lot of replayability.

The mechanics in this game have a lot of depth and interact with each other in ways that are fun to explore and try to take advantage of. Sometimes you run into a funny anti-synergy or get punished for relying too heavily on a single strategy, but its always in a way that you could have played around, which makes your choices feel impactful and important.

Lastly, for better or worse though, runs through the story mode take a long time.

This is where it can be at it's weakest.

The thing is, play a little further. The first game is not a fun play through. I'd think of it more as a 'tutorial'/unlock cards. If you're unlucky, your next one will work like that too. Just try to stick with the basic cards until you've unlocked cards and then start modifying your deck in creative ways via the town.

Once you play more the game comes online with the card selection. The game itself is a fun long adventure deckbuilding game. It's taken us at least 3+ long sessions to get through one play through.

The multiplayer aspect is fun, though I'm not sure if I'd play the game solo other than to unlock things. The combat can feel bogged down sometimes, especially when you're first playing.

Once you get a handle on all the different buffs / debuffs and start unlocking some perks, it becomes a very satisfying (albeit grindy) single player game.

My main gripes are with the co-op. In a multiplayer match, you have access to whatever characters and perks you've unlocked in the single player game. That's all well and good until you play alongside someone who's new to the game and hasn't put in 20+ hours in single player. The new player only has access to the starting characters, with no perks or town upgrades to speak of (with the latter also changing the equipment that's available to them). This makes sense as you're introducing someone to the game, but your party becomes incredibly lopsided. Of course the devs want everybody to grind the single player in addition to playing co-op, but that's not realistic for everyone.

They advertise the ability for players to come in and out of a campaign at any point. If there was a way to level up co-op characters to match the highest level player, give them access to all the same perks, town upgrades, etc., this would be MUCH more enjoyable in multiplayer and would make casual co-op play a more feasible option.",1675711993,1675711993,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

As with most neo-roguelike progressives, it is impossible to beat the big bosses without having played the same paths and fights many times. That's built in to this style of game. It's a pretty good game across almost every aspect.  I have some personal preferences that the game doesn't perfectly suit, but none are really bad and overall this one of the best in this genre from the last couple years.

Example of minor negative peeve:

Inventory: I would strongly prefer a more traditional inventory system where I could store items and trade them between characters in a run. It feels odd and unpleasant to get great fighter armor and fighter weapon in a chest (along with nothing else of value), but only able to pick one because each character can only get one item per chest. That's a weird mechanism, perhaps related to simplifying UI for consoles? I have no idea, but it's pretty constantly disapppinting, especially after my 30th play through. No selling items, no trading. There's a consoley sense to a bunch of the less great elements of the game.

That said, the items are pretty fun. There's a lot of variation and new items unlock with play. There are interestingly complex interactions of combining character deck builds with specific item effects. There has been a lot of very good game balance work done and the system design was clearly conceived with these interactions and balances in mind. Great job devs!

Note on play time: Steam often over-counts my hours on games. I have played Across the Obelisk a lot, but the 200 hours counted so far is likely twice my actual play time. I don't know the technical mechanism, but I often leave games running while I switch tasks to something else or leave my laptop on when asleep. Steam says I've played Blood Card 2: Red Mist 900+ hours. I'm pretty darn sure that's wrong :]",1675702606,1675703153,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The fact that you're playing with 4 decks at once is great, so is the ability to save basic deck structures and load them, during a new run (at a cost, so you have to manage your resources). The gameplay is fun..... BUT, there's one big downside. At some point the devs decided to reblance characters and cards around accounts with full-unlocks and (near-optimal) gear picks. This ruined a lot of fun strategies in higher difficulty play and it's save to assume that it also had negative impact on newer players, especially considering that getting into the game can be a bit grindy, since progression sadly is quite noticably locked behind powerful permanent upgrades. 

Across the Obelisk is a great game and I enjoyed all 75+ hours I put into it, but it's worth noting that the game has arguably suffered from post-release patches.

It stops being much of a challenge unless you increase the ""madness"" level of the run which at best adds some minor additions to already known mechanics and at worse just things that make the runs more difficult but not necessarily challenging.

But at the end of the day the game is fun enough for me to recommend it especially given that it has a fairly robust coop with up to three of your friends to make a four player party.

In Across The Obelisk, there are many situations where if you DON'T build X Y Z, you CANNOT win. This is what sucks the joy from this game and makes it such a headache to play.




Yeah... so, where do I begin. Let me start off by saying I have overt 500 hours in STS and over 150 in Monster Train. Deck-builders aren't foreign to me. That being said, there's something about this game that makes it different, and not really in a good way.

First of all, with 3 hours of game play, I have yet to have a run that has been unique from the others. The card pools you're given seem too expensive to be viable, and I've yet to get any fun combinations or neat combos.

Second, the beginning of the game is explained VERY poorly. Apparently you can save decks, but its not really explained how this feature works. You're also locked in to 15 cards minimum. So... how do I even make a cool deck? What do the shops at the beginning EVEN DO? I can buy generic relics.. ok. I can buy cards.. ok. But the rest? Hell if I know.

Lastly, I've read people talking about how easy the first area is. What???? Sure, perhaps like the first 2 battles... but the first boss is completely ridiculous. 250 hp, he can summon minions, heal himself, and deal MASSIVE damage all in the same turn. Fannnnnntastic. The battles are tedious more than anything.

If you're coming from STS or other deck builders that I'd consider this game's ""competition"", you're gonna be very disappointed with how this game stacks up.

EDIT: Yeah, after like 5 more playthroughs I refuse to see how anyone can find this gameplay fun. Bosses that spam heals and summons and prolong fights are NOT good game design. This is hands down the first game in my entire Steam career where I'd consider the option ""I'd like to permanently delete the game from my account."" I don't even want a refund.

First issue I have is that I have absolutely no idea what happens when enemies attack, as the game shows the card for a half second before yoinking it into the abyss. It doesn't explain how you can find the cards the enemy plays, nor does it really help to figure it out, as you need an actual in-game index of the status effects. I discovered this was a problem when I noticed spiders spawning in a fight for seemingly no reason, only to find out that an enemy's attack will cause a card to be placed in your deck (there's no animation for this) that spawns a hatchling spider with taunt. The early game features no ability to block or avoid status effects, effectively making it so that your build should only consist of them and if the enemy ends up overwhelming you with them, then you have no choice but to die. This game is not fun after about an hour, it becomes needlessly complicated and frustrating because above all else, it has so many overlapping systems and mechanics that seem to function independently of one another. There are slows and freezes shackles all of which do the same thing, there's bleed and burn and poison, the only differences being when they take your health away, and of course there's about 5 ""mystical"" statuses that I just decided not to look into, as there was already too much being shoved down my throat.",1674378382,1674378382,False,3,2,0.419756501913070679,0,True,False,False

However, it's kind of a niche game, it's not CoD, GTA, Skyrim, etc.  I think you have to be somewhat into the turn based rogue-like genre to enjoy it.  I paid 20 USD for it, and it was a pretty good amount of gameplay for what I paid.  

In the game, you manage a party of four characters, each with their own deck.  As you move across the map, you get into battles, which involve taking turns with your characters and playing cards from their decks in order to defeat enemies.   Managing four decks is unusual in these types of games, which usually involve playing a single character and single deck, so the complexity is (at face value) a little higher than most similar games.  The game has fairly standard TCG mechanics like mana, which you will probably be familiar with if you've played those types of card games before.  Common TCG heuristics like ""drawing cards is good"" generally apply, although the game has an interesting system where mana rolls over between turns, meaning that it's not necessarily correct to try and spend all your mana on your turn (unlike, e.g., hearthstone).

What really drew me to Across the Obelisk was the [b][i]online co-op feature: you can play with up to four players total, each managing one of the characters.  This is pretty unique in the indie rogue-like genre.[/i][/b]  I initially purchased this game to play with a couple of friends.  I expected to get maybe 10 hours of ""slay the spire rip-off"" gameplay (with co-op!) and I would have been satisfied with that.  But I got about 55 hours worth of gameplay instead, mostly co-op, which I was pleasantly surprised by.

In general, Across the Obelisk does everything fairly competently, but nothing particularly well.  The art for example is probably better executed than Slay the Spire, but is stylistically less interesting.  A lot of the sound effects are high quality, but the lack of variety becomes extremely obvious, even on the first playthrough.  While there are some novel gameplay mechanics, the game borrows a lot from established RPG series.  As an example, many of the characters and cards are based heavily off World of Warcraft classes.

The game does however have a fairly impressive amount of content.  There are 16 playable characters to unlock, each with multiple playable deck archetypes, meaning that despite the somewhat repetitive nature of the map, the game has decent replayability.  If you are into these types of games, it's pretty easy to get 20+ hours of gameplay out of it, which is reasonable (in my opinion) for the $20 USD price tag.

With TCG style games,he question of whether the game is """"""objectively"""""" good often comes down to balance.  As players become better at TCGs, weaker decks and strategies are replaced by stronger ones.  A big test for long-term replayability is whether or not the strong strategies are interesting, enjoyable, or skill intensive to execute, or if they are so imbalanced that they trivialize the game.  If they are interesting, it means that even if a player has sunk hundreds (or thousands) of hours into the game, they can still get enjoyment out of playing it.

Generally, I think Across the Obelisk fails in this regard.  There is in theory a fairly high skill ceiling to the game, and there are some interesting sequencing optimizations that skilled players can make.  But  like a lot of card games, you generally don't have to play that well to win with stronger combinations of cards.  The first time you discover a particularly ridiculous combo or party set up, it feels pretty good, but it often trivializes the game.  

The last playthrough I did involved 3 characters buffing up a fourth character (by improving his damage, giving him more card draws, giving him more mana to play with, etc.), and basically every combat was completed in a single round, including the last boss.  All the decks were pretty meticulously constructed, but each character's turn basically involved them slamming all the cards in their hand onto the table, so actually playing the strategy wasn't too interesting.  While this wasn't on the hardest difficulty, it was on the hardest difficulty I had currently unlocked, and the lack of challenge was disappointing.

Still, that was over 50 hours into the game, and by that time I definitely felt like I got my money's worth.  I had played through the game several times before that and had a good time.  The first few playthroughs where I was learning the games mechanics, cards and strategies, and unlocking the characters were quite enjoyable.

TL;DR : While Across the Obelisk is far from the best rogue-like deck building game, a solid amount of content, reasonable price tag, and a unique online co-op feature make it worth trying out for fans of the genre.",1674372053,1674372880,True,11,2,0.669867992401123047,0,True,False,False

However it's important to know that after a good while it stops being fun as you realize that over time, the game becomes exponentially boring. All of the paths are the exact same. All the bosses are the same. So even if you have a different party set up each time, you're still battling the same exact enemies in the same exact setups. Of course you can play the other 2 modes, but the enemies become totally random. So there's no in between here. It's just incredibly repetitive, or totally random. I do not enjoy either. 

And once you start unlocking like 20+ perks to use, the game becomes completely unbearable. It wants you to start out knowing exactly what kind of build you want, which sucks because the choice of cards after each battle are completely random. Whereas it's really fun in other games like Slay the Spire and Griftlands to slowly figure out what deck build you want as you play, you totally lose that fun aspect in this game. The amount of time you spend in the perk menus and various store menus grows exponentially over time. At this point, I'm spending like 80% of the game figuring reading stats instead of playing the damn game. And there's really no option to ignore all that. You're kinda forced to if you wanna get past the first chapter.

It's also important to note that you can't really get creative with your card deck setup like in Slay the Spire, and the bosses become very tedious. None are really creative or special, and kinda just have a massive health box that you slowly widdle down over time. So instead of having to really think about what you're doing and when you're doing it, you're just constantly throwing up cards in the air and ending ur turn.",1674364688,1674364905,False,1,1,0.487785041332244873,0,True,False,False

It takes time to learning these many concepts/cards before it becomes fun. For the story mode, which most people begin with, I would not say it is a rogue-like game. I'd refer it more like civilization 5/6 where you have high level goals in the beginning(victory type for example) and gradually build and execute it through game progressions.

I have a mixed feeling and overall I had a good experience playing this. It turns to be fun once that high level goal is pre-planned, like a good team synergy, and then conquering the devastating difficulty I face in the beginning. The monster fighting part is OK. They are long and intense in the beginning. They become very short once a scalable build is found and become long and intense again in higher difficulties, which to me, feels rewarding. However it can be repetitive quickly within the same team synergy.

I'd recommend it when you are shooting for exploring combos to beat the high difficulties through PLANNING instead of ON THE FLY, as most of the time, I am not choosing card rewards and the deck is ~90% finished in the starting town in lower difficulties, probably ~60% in higher difficulties. This is definitely not the case when I play Slay the Spire.

On a side note, the game does offer another more rogue-like mode, but given the extremely high starting learning curve, I would not say it is as enjoyable as Slay the Spire, unless you are familiar with the system through the story mode.

In total, I'd say it is still fun and worthy the time and money. I had Flows https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) for the majority of the time playing this game once I pass the high learning curve in the beginning.",1674002513,1674002513,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Cons?
Runs can take a while, like 3-4 hours if you're all deliberating which you likely will when you are playing your first few games.
Animation and graphics are serviceable.  Enemies don't die, they just sort of fade away.  There's an elf archer that makes me wonder if the animators ever even saw someone use a bow.  It grows on you, it's almost quaint, but just fair warning.
Playing solo means managing four decks and four builds, which can be a lot of fun but I recommend taking notes on what you're trying to do.

With that said, I do have gripes. Despite the cons section being longer in character count (its easier to sum up high points in fewer words than it is to accurately describe the frustrating aspects) , I ABSOLUTELY adore and recommend this game. The game is worth every dollar, even when you buy two or more copies for your friends.

Pros:
- variable and complex deck building with many different builds and different synergies between characters. If you enjoy deck crafting, this is for you. It was incredible when it finally clicked for me and I went from 10-20 stacks of something to literally thousands of stacks. When you have a deck pop off, you feel rewarded for discovering combos and hilarious synergies. 
- Strategy and decisions matter. There is an option to replay combat situations, its interesting to see myself fail miserably in one, and then in the second I exceed with flying colors. Its not necessarily just knowing the future, its being able to assess a situation and figure out in your head what the best order and combination of cards on what entity makes the most sense.
- How well you do in the game is not entirely dependent on your permanent upgrades or unlocks. After a certain point, it becomes much more about your capacity of forward thinking and ability to combine cards in interesting ways. 
- COOP is great, as you have to discuss and make decisions with a friend, I enjoy team work and group strategy games. If you buy this only for coop, you wont be disappointed. 
- So far, the only DLC is cosmetic only. When you buy the game, you get the game, the WHOLE game. 

Cons; 
- The character unlocks are slow going. Its easy to make one mistake, two maps ago and be unable to unlock a character. I've only got 5 of the locked characters unlocked (4 come by default, so I have 9 in total). I finally had to look up a guide for it. 
- Some builds are incredibly item dependent, meaning if you dont get them in the starting shop, you might as well not even do it becuase you may never get the item you need to actually make it work, and end up dragging around a waste of a character hoping you bump into the item you know exists but cannot get. In the same note, it does get frustrating setting up perks on characters and then getting really good items for entirely different attacks/elements. Kinda wish you could change perks in the starting town to better match the starting equipment/items. 
- There are purge and dispel actions in the game, and I find them antithetical to the core mechanics of synergy. They dont feel challenging to play against in the same way a hard boss is challenging, in that these enemies with these abilities feel unrewarding to play against. You spend so long crafting a wonderful and powerful synergy not to be taken back by a conflicting system, but by abilities that universally decline all the synergies in the game. I once managed to get (through doubling and card copying) 15000 shielding on a tank, and then was hit with a card that does damage to me where X was my shielding; a rewarding defeat because now I know I have to manage my numbers (you can still stack that high, but youd need to purge it yourself or use the healer card that delays it for next turn). THIS was specific to an idea, a strategy, a synergy. HOWEVER, there seem to be more monsters that just straight up purge your buff stacks, regardless of what they are, and dispel your debuffs on them, regardless of what they are. Whats the point in having this wide variety of options if there are just universal ways for enemies to rid them, and do it often. Unrewarding gameplay design. With even that said, you can work around it, it doesnt ruin the game.

There's a lot I like about this game, and definitely recommend it to others. It has near infinite replayability, being a rogue-like card game. However, there is one flaw in the game imo; I personally think it would benefit greatly by including an infinite mode.

The game is your typical deck building rogue-like. You start with a base set of cards based upon which characters you choose.

Then their are the ""powerful"" cards that you unlock. Why do they cost so much energy?! If you take them they are almost always  just dead cards that you can't play. For example you start with 4 energy and then gain 3 per turn after the first, a lot of the ""big bad"" card cost 6-9 energy.

The game is fun at first. It's a different take on ""Slay the Spire"" with you having a party of 4, characters level up, you can equip your heroes with items, leveling up the town, perks, etc etc.

But the fun fades pretty quickly, to the point where I just kept playing because I wanted to finish the campaign.

I couldn't quite put my finger on what the issue was until I installed ""Slay the Spire"" again and did a few runs of that, then I realized what the flaws were in ""Across the Obelisk.""

For starters ""Across the Obelisk"" is complicated, and not in a fun way, while ""Slay the Spire"" is also complicated, but in a fun way. ""Across the Obelisk"" has all of that stuff I mentioned earlier, and it doesn't really make the game fun, it just makes it needlessly complicated, not to mention all of the buffs and debuffs in this game, at one point one of my heroes had a total of SIXTEEN buffs/debuffs on him.

Whereas ""Slay the Spire"" is complicated because you have to think about which artifacts you want (if they are going to benefit you or hinder you in the long run), which card combinations go together, which direction you want to go on the map, etc. It's complicated, but in a fun way that makes sense and it doesn't just throw a bunch of stats and items at you.

The runs in ""Across the Obelisk"" also take too long. You have 4 heroes, each of which use anywhere from 2-6+ cards during each round, almost every battle has 4 enemies which use anywhere from 2-4 cards each round, and even the easy battles typically last 2 rounds, while the more difficult battles can last 4-6+ rounds. It's just way too long. Then after every battle you have to decide which of 3 cards (or none) you want to get for EACH of your heroes, then sometimes there is a choice of 8 items you have to choose which you want each of your heroes to equip, then at the start of the game and after every act you enter a town and decide which of the dozens and dozens of cards you want to upgrade or remove, which cards you want to buy (and you can choose from almost any card in the game, and there are hundreds between the 4 heroes), which items you want to buy, which town upgrades you want to buy. It's just entirely too much and makes each run take so long, to the point where I was getting aggravated and annoyed every time a run ended. Compare this to ""Slay the Spire"" where the battles don't take nearly as long, there aren't nearly as many unnecessary choices to make, and the run just being fun along the way that I didn't really mind it when I lost a run, I just started up another run and dove right in without having to do any prep work at all.

""Slay the Spire"" seems rewarding when you make the right choices and get the right relic and card combinations going, and it's still fun even when you lose. ""Across the Obelisk"" just doesn't ever feel very rewarding even when you're doing everything right and it just feels annoying when you mess up somewhere and lose the run.",1672629405,1672976423,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Then I actually got the game. And now I'm sitting at 54.9 hours in two weeks. Lo and behold, the roguelite card battler is addicting, but there's more to it than just that.

This game offers you choices, a LOT of choices. Down from the characters you pick, the perks you choose, the map nodes you hit, the cards you build and the items you buy or collect.. It'd be a lie to say that this game gets stale after only a few runs. I feel so compelled to explore everything in the map, collect all the cards and figure out which cards synergize with which, try out different character and perk combos.. and even with the multiplayer aspect of it, the game can still be fully enjoyed as a solo-style game. The enemy randomization option also offers some fresh new fights, and the madness levels will challenge you in a way that will make you frustrated but reward you with the accomplishment of overcoming the wall.

It might take a few runs for you to really get an understanding of the base mechanics and what you should and shouldn't do, but once you learn the basics, the game will suck you in and you will lose time to it.

Solid 8/10 game for me. There could be more done with it and i am interested in seeing what else the devs choose to add in the future. It would also be very interesting to see a potential workshop added to add even more customization options to your runs, but I'm just spitballing ideas.

Good stuff:
* Excellent deck builder
* Many many interesting ways to customize individual heroes and their decks
* A LOT of replayability due to: several meta-progression systems, difficulty-scaling systems, RNG with pathing/nodes, and optional quests/unlocks.

However, as good as all that is, by far the best feature is the multiplayer. Not many games at all make it as smooth to start, deal with players changing, etc. Certainly none of this genre are as good.

In the interest of balance, a few rough edges:
* The options can be a little overwhelming at first, especially when solo and dealing with 4 heroes
* You really want a guide for the quests & unlocks. The steps/conditions are sometimes unclear and it feels really bad to miss something and lose a few hours of progress on that particular run.
* Games tend to run longer than I'd like. I enjoy every moment of it, but I do wish a full run didn't take as long

The deck building is satisfying, with enough progression to feel like there are different ways to play, without feeling like any one route is absolutely broken. But that's because the boss fights will smear you on the walls if you arnt careful, each one being a puzzle for your team to solve. Juggling 4 decks that synergize, without nullifying each other is a hoot. That's all before the random events and quest objectives come in. Knowing where to loot special items of having to figure out what random events unlock characters or items really helps you connect to the world.

Not that there *isn't* a story, but it doesn't matter. You are here to see how far your deck can take you. All so you can die, go back, and figure out if that sheep you unlocked a hour and a half ago was worth the 3 failed attempts.

It manages to create a system that can make any build staggeringly powerful if you are smart about how you apply it, which I've seen very few games pull off. Every character has a unique way they approach the game, but without it being so different that it forces you to constantly relearn how to play, which allows players to readily create new party comps and do all sorts of fun new shenanigans. There are enough cards in the game to allow a wide variety of playstyles, but not so many it is overwhelming.
One thing in particular this game does very well to an extent that I've only seen here and in Breath of the Wild (which is very weird considering how indescribably different the two games are) is the system of how you interact with the world. This game sets up a simple set of rules for how everything works and how your actions impact what naturally occurs, with everything else being simple cause and effect. This isn't to say you can't do anything complicated or absurd, if anything this simple base makes it much easier to do crazy stuff. 
The approach this game takes to difficulty and balance is very refreshing. The immense number of difficulty levels combined with the specific difficulty modifiers allow you to not only choose how difficult you want your game to be with far more range and precision than most games offer, but also where the difficulty is coming from. If you want the game to be hard because the enemies are very tough, that's an option. If you want it to be hard because you are weak, that's an option. If you want it to be hard because Monty Python references are waiting down every path to rip your throat out, that is an option.
The rules of cause and effect the game establishes also fit into balance beautifully by allowing you to manipulate the mechanics of the game and the stats of characters on the field to do some ridiculous things. Hell, one of the most popular tank builds is a glass cannon debuffing themself so much they're untouchable (tank eve go brrr), and you can use your hp as ammo with the rat boi (you can technically do this pretty well with any wizards, but rat boi is best at it), and more.

Let me start out by saying that this game is a decent roguelite deckbuilder. Though I can't recommend this for anyone who is looking to try out the genre for the first time. While the game has it's strengths, especially when playing co-op, I can't help but notice it's obvious flaws. 

- The starting cards in the game are pretty weak, you're barely gonna make it past the 2nd map on your first run.
- There are a few summoner mobs which can usually end your run if you weren't aware of their summons cause the spawned mobs are always at full hp. This tends to drag out fights where there are multiple summoners and your early game damage output doesn't help with clearing these out.
- The scaling in the game is ridiculous, the early game fights are quite easy with decent hp mobs with average damage but the late game fights are just hp sponges with multiple ways to out heal your damage or negate your debuffs. This is probably my biggest gripe with the game, as some of the fights (not just the boss fights) can last over 30 minutes with the enemies slowly being whittled down and me healing their damage back for multiple turns.
- You can get new characters by completing quests but they offer no unique cards, only their traits on level up are changed. Which was honestly really underwhelming.
- Some of the events require skill checks where you need to meet an energy requirement with your cards. Failing them often leads to fights where your opponents get to move first, letting them setup their armor/buffs and wall you off.

After a bit of grinding, some of these issues are mitigated. Each character has a skill tree that can provide stats and unique benefits on buffs/debuffs which really helps in progressing further. If that's the type of grindy card game you're looking for then I can recommend this game.

To the reviews stating that this is better than Slay The Spire, it's far from it. Unlike StS where runs are relatively short and keeps you wanting to play more, Across The Obelisk fails to deliver a fun roguelike experience due to a few balance issues. If they just lowered the max hp of some of the enemies, it'd make for a much better game.",1672420515,1672420515,False,57,3,0.554947197437286377,0,True,False,False

This game is good to play with friends and I used this game to introduce my friends to subgenre that I really like. Its great that you can build a team that can help cover each other weaknesses. Im glad, though it could use some improvements, that in addition to the main game there is the shorter runs that you can run with friends if you don't have 3 hours to play the main campaign. I do have some nitpicks that would prevent me from recommending this game for solo play over other roguelikes such as StS or monster train. 

I think fundamentally there is an issue with how this game handles rewards, this game has gold and shards that are used to purchase equipment and craft or upgrade cards. These shards are to be shared across four characters and can feel limiting, which can be good, it provides an opportunity to be creative with limited resources. My biggest problem is how these rewards are allotted, they are given to you based on your performance in the last fight which's only metric is how fast did you kill them. I think this is a bad way of doing card rewards because is prioritizes fast kill decks while stifling the less optimized decks. There are mechanics in this game to reduce the enemies damage and allow them to hit you to do retributive damage, but why would you ever build comps to capitalize on these mechanics when you could instead just kill them fast and get more rewards? These runs are still possible but only through another abusable mechanic, the town chests.

If you die in a run, a portion of the rewards you've collected throughout the game are given back to you at the starting town so you can craft decks. Being able to completely customize a deck at the beginning of the run is a good way to encourage build variety, but the only mechanic limiting your ability to theory craft being how well you performed in the last run. This means that some runs feel like you have no stress whatsoever, even on middle difficulties (I have not played the hardest difficulties yet), and others where you feel the doom creaping in. You are perfectly capable of crating a workable deck for 4 heroes based on the basic money you can get from perks so it isn't a true dicohtomy of dead run and won run, but it feels worse when you feel the differences. I wouldn't mind just getting more money on average and have no chest rewards.",1672355416,1672355416,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Monsters have seemingly endless heals, purges, armor cards and summons. I found myself groaning every time I failed a skill check and started a fight I'd hoped to avoid. 

If you don't mind endlessly grinding resources and selling your soul to the game to figure out its secrets I'd say go for it - there's a lot there and it certainly could be fun for the right person but if you're buying this thinking it's a quick, accessible but endlessly deep game like StS or Monster Train you will likely be disappointed.

It's a disappointment because I really wanted to like this game and I love the potential present here, however given AtO's age and the fact that it is no longer considered to be in early access, I doubt that significant changes to the gameplay mechanics will be made.

Once you beat the campaign, despite the inclusion of further difficulty levels, there is not much else to see. There is a lack of tactical depth: too many cards don't offer interesting or unique mechanics besides giving you large damage numbers tied to a damage type and a DoT and/or a debuff. The enemies do not offer interesting challenges which test your deck builds in meaningful ways. Additionally, once you progress into the final acts, the fights don't become more difficult or complicated, they simply become boring because they just receive ridiculous amounts of HP as an artificial increase to their difficulty.

I could excuse all of the above complaints if the creative aspect of AtO were stronger, however this game is also severely held back by its lackluster creative design: it has a generic mobile game visual appearance, these sound effects are laughably bad, the soundtrack is generic and I ended up muting it, almost half of all the spell names (and their effects) are rip offs from World of Warcraft or Slay the Spire, and the story itself does not enhance the game world.",1672283768,1672283768,False,8,1,0.498938292264938354,0,True,False,False

If you are looking for a good card-based game after playing Monster Train, Slay the Spire, etc., keep looking.

Meta progression is awfully slow, balancing of the cards is mediocre, starting decks for heroes are not really fun, the game wants you to handle four seperate decks at once, without enough control about it, the game is too much rng, and  ...

* You're deep into complex CCGs and can parse very complicated cards.

* You're only going to play it multiplayer.

The cards in this game are surprisingly granular, with many similar-but-not-the-same effects. For example, ""take +1 damage per stack,"" ""take X% more damage per stack,"" and ""take X% more damage per stack of a specific damage type,"" are all separate debuffs with their own names and icons.  Expanding a card so that those names and symbols become a long form description of what they do makes most cards a paragraph long.  Trying to learn what all these names and icons do is a bigger hill to get over than it sounds.  

Now do it for four different characters at once, while trying to figure out a coherent build for each of them that compliments the other three.

Most games don't dump the player straight into the weeds like this.  I would expect the initial cards to have less text than do here, and to spend more time at 1, 2, or 3 party members than the exactly 1 combat with 2 party members before filling the party out that the game gives.  There's a lot going on, and it's a bigger ask than it seems.  The flip side is that, if you're up to the challenge, you can dive right in without an hour long forced tutorial.

Multiplayer also reduces a lot of the load on any one person.  Controlling one or two characters instead of four means you'll be having to track fewer abilities and how they fit together into each character's build.",1671743923,1671743923,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

With a team of 4 characters, and 16 to chose from (after you unlock them), there are lots of combinations and different strategies to try.  So much fun building different combos.

I really like the progression of playthroughs.  Lots of different ways to go on the map each time with random events that spice it up too.  And there's tons of things to unlock, making you want to start your next playthrough to try another path even before you finish your current run.  There's a perk feature (tech tree) that makes experience gained by the characters translate into better stats and powers which also makes each run worth something more for the next run.

One thing to note, it's noticeably slower paced than other games in the genre.  Almost a bit jarring at first, if you're coming straight from Monster Train or Roguebook.  But don't let it deter you.  It's not a bad thing, just different.  And I've learned to love it.

Obviously this game is getting a lot of comparison to slay the spire. I think it misses the mark.
1) Pacing: AtO has really slow pacing. This is more or less linked to the party having 4 characters. I found it extremely difficult to manage 4 decks in a way that led to strong synergies, and fights are looooong. As someone who has done the 15 minute StS run, I would say that's impossible in this.

2) My point #2 of it being a 'static world'... Apparently there is a randomized roguelike version you just need to play a few rounds to unlock it. 

3) Not knowing enemy actions by default and the amount of enemy actions make a lot of fights guesswork. Are they hitting the tank? Random targets? All targets? NOBODY? Who knows.

Sort of if you had Slay The Spire, but all 4 characters each with their own decks with a focus on coordination of skills seeming to draw from games like Darkest Dungeon.
Has a bit of learning curve and definitely a feeling of the enemies being much more well put together than you at the start, but as you upgrade things and get more ability to change around your starting deck you get plenty to ways to build around the early hurdles so you have an easier time snowballing, yet still staying challenging later on if you're not careful. 
It can also feel a little overwhelming with having to manage 4 characters, but there isn't so much variation that you wont start getting used to it after a handful of runs and once you hit the curve there's a lot of fun finding wild combos with the different ways you can use each character.

My complaints are tied to the difficulty of this game feeling unfairly high, but if you're into that then cool! Maybe this review will sell you on the game

Gameplay-wise this game is reminiscent of both Slay the Spire, and Darkest Dungeon. On the surface I was all for this, I liked both of those games.


In practice I'm finding this game incredibly frustrating. Imagine the difficulty of Darkest Dungeon, but instead of having a consistent tool kit of moves available each turn you have random card draws like slay the spire. The monsters have better cards than you, more HP, and even basic encounters become deadly halfway through the first zone, to say nothing of bosses.

Now of course, the challenge is the point. I don't mind a bit of challenge. But the tools available to you are very limited, and often you'll end up losing not because you have a bad deck, but just through attrition. I've yet to clear the 2nd zone of idk how many. The enemies hit hard, heal for more than you can, and a huge number have health pools larger than your heroes. Play smart and you can win each encounter individually sure... but it feels like no matter what you do, you just can't kill the enemies fast enough to avoid being worn down

Now there is a permanent upgrade system with perk points that will make you stronger after each run. It's possible that after enough runs the difficulty will subside a bit. But 8 hours in I cannot recommend this game to most people. But again, I know some of you reading this are going to read everything I just said and think ""hey, that sounds like my kinda game!"" And if you're one of those people, have at it. The game is not poorly executed, and I like the concept, it's just more difficult than I typically enjoy in my games

I also have yet to try out the multiplayer aspect of the game. This may make things more fun, I do intend to give the game some more time to win me over before dropping it. There's a good game in here, but I cannot recommend it at this point",1670200832,1670200832,False,2,1,0.484242290258407593,0,True,False,False

What i like:
-Its a card game
-Its very in depth
-A lot of map events you can navigate through and also can give you extra buffs.
-There is a lot of potential synergies from what i saw
There is probably more i could say, but frankly there are just some massively irritating things in this game that completely negate any of those.

What i dont like to outright hate
Dont like:
-The endless stacking going on this game in both directions.
It gets to absurd levels and at a certain point, if you cant outright kill enemies quickly enough, all you're doing is just managing the stacking going on.
Its uninteresting and it acts more like a (non) ""difficulty"" layer, because its not really difficult at all.
It simply requires you to know thats all they will be doing and get a bunch of dispell cards in your deck to deal with it.
Thats not difficult at all, but its impossible to deal with at first since you lack said cards + dont know this in advance of course.

-A ton of very strange and confusing cards that say for example:
""This enemy attack will only attack the front hero""
And then proceeds to damage the second hero and then everyone else as an added bonus.
Obviously due to some random combination of whatever, but the game just goes too quick to figure that out properly. So im often just sitting there ""what the hell is this nonsense?"".

-Gigantic AOE damages that some of these REGULAR enemies are capable of doing.
And im talking, i got a truckload of all resistance and everything and i still lose a quarter of my HP on all my chars and/or they blast over half my shielding.
And then on top of that, they put a dozen different of a million stacks on your chars every single round.
That got old and tiresome really quickly.
its just absurd to have to deal with this on a regular, normal run.
Then they also have huge shielding going on whilst adding big thorn stacks as well, its ridiculous.

What i actually completely hate in this game:
-Whoever thought up that mechanic where an enemy can just switch everything on them back on your characters: did your brain shut off when u thought this up? honestly, how did that even get past the brainstorm stage?
That is the single most awful mechanic i ever seen in any game in the 25 years i been playing games.
I cant even properly put into to words how awful that is.
Burn it with fire, no, shoot it into the center of the sun.
Atrocious is what that is.

A) The rogue aspect of this game.
Well i played more then a few rogue games (even darkest dungeon), yet none of those not even DD, manages to make losing so unfun and frustrating.
And thats because you go from ""this is working well"" the previous fight, into ""I simply cannot win this fight no matter what i do"".
The total lack of counterplay ability you run into at some point is just straight up horrendous game design.
Making mistakes and having to try again is the most typical thing in a rogue game.
But with these fights i never felt that i made a mistake at all.
I just felt ""well here we go again, once more i didnt get the specific cards that specifically deal with this particular enemy spell so all my efforts where for nothing once again"".
Again, bad game design.

B) To follow up, if you need to build your entire deck around a single enemy spell, the problem isnt in the deck building department, but obviously with said spell being the problem at hand.
Its nonsensical you would need to have card X in your deck to deal with card Y of the enemy.
Not only is that completely uninteresting, its also utterly pointless.
It simply becomes a moot card thats just there to nullify eachothers card.
So the natural question then should be: ""why even have this in the game when it adds nothing of value?
And moreover causes the aforementioned situation?

Ill just leave it at that, i could drone on for hours on more particulars ive run into.
And im sure theres people that will say oh you need to do X or Y and Z.
Yes i probably could and should.
But i dont have the cards you people keep mentioning, and so i cannot do this.
What i understand is that i just need to grind and throw away runs to unlock those things.
Well that just isnt fun at all, first its very time consuming (especially for a rogue game) and whilst im doing (and have been doing that) i just got more irritated and pissed off with these aforementioned losses then anything else. 
It simply far exceeded any of the fun i had with the game.

And yes, i am mainly talking about ACT 4 here.
ACT 4 is what done away with all the good fun and just sat there going ""you shall not pass"".
Welp, indeed i wont, because i cant be bothered anymore with this BS.
And im also sad i cant refund this game.
This game has a lot of potential and i can see it cleary, but unfortunately the aforementioned just completely destroys it for me to the point i want a refund and i regret buying this game.

[h1] Summary [/h1]
I never had as much trouble figuring out a review for a game as I did for AtO. I'm really sad to leave a negative review because I can see that the devs have put so much good and so much work in this game. I have rarely been so optimistic for a game, unfortunately they decided to gatekeep all these treasures behind at least 20 hours of sadistic homeworks. 
I really feel like some aspects of the game are preventing it from being more than ""just another indie title that everyone forgot 1 month after release"", when it as the potential to overtake Slay the Spire or Darkest Dungeon.

So I really hope the devs could fix those before the window is closed. That's why I decided to leave a negative review, and yes I usually hate the people who do that but I really feel like there is too much wasted potential.

[h1] Positive [/h1]
I will be really brief about the positives because lot of reviews explain it quite well. The gameplay is really good, the card system is well done, the enemies are very interesting, the visual design is nice, the map really make you want to explore it all, etc.

[h1] Negative[/h1]
The problem revolves mostly around the very weird fracture between how the game plays and its meta progression. Both are very good but they are not working well together IMO and it gatekeeps the enjoyable part of the game, for absolutely no reason because the content clearly isn't lacking.
As most of the negative review highlighted, the game is very rogueLITE oriented. You quickly understand you will have to make a lot of runs before you can make decent ones. The problems are :

[h3] Rythm [/h3]
The game is extremely slow paced. Every fight is a 4v4 with very strong enemies that will block, vanish, spam summons, reduce your damages, taunt and everything you can imagine.  Progressing through a map takes a lot of time.

This shouldn't be a problem because it fits the DnD aspect of the game extremely well, but it is very incompatible with the fact that the game asks you to make a ton of runs with very poor builds (more on that in [Status Festival]) and the same starter characters before you can really make runs that don't just [b]feel like kamikaze missions with a butter knife in the name of the holy grind[/b]. Slow and immersive adventures are, IMO, not compatible with senseless grinding.

[h3] The Wall [/h3]
As you tediously progress through a run you know that you are very quickly running toward The Wall ™ as in any roguelite. The meta progression is extremely strong, and without it you will quickly get absolutely stomped by common enemies. 

Again, it's not a problem in most roguelite but is aggravate the point made above, especially since meta progression is quite slow (yes, even on a per run scale, when a run can easily take more than 2 hours).

[h3] Status festival [/h3]
As it as been said in other review, enemies will simply shower you in debuffs and unblockable dots while they giga-buff, heal, dispel and shield themselves. 
And [b]again[/b], the status system is really interesting and well implemented, I actually like it.
My issue is with the fact that you have nowhere near as much versatility as your enemies do. I feel like it will take a lot of time to have the agency required to actually duel your enemies on the status battlefield. The starting deck, even with quite a lot of modifications, is really lack luster, especially when it comes to dispel and heal.

[h3] Can we switch sides ? [/h3]
As I said earlier, the enemies are really well designed. So much that I would actually like to play their hands instead of mine most of the time ! They have very well designed, thematic, decks with so many OP combos and so much versatility. And it would be great to play against them if it didn't mean miserably shielding and auto attacking while slowly but surely getting melted by all the status effects. 
This really underline how cool the combat system [b]can be[/b]. After ten hours I realize how much potential deck building has. I have seen enough cards to understand that they are so many cool builds with crazy combo to pull, if only the game let you make one ! 

[h1] Solution ?[/h1]
[b]I really believe, you should have more agency over your starting build and get that agency much sooner.[/b] Not just adjust one or two cards per character after 10 hours.

It wouldn't necessarily make the game much easier or faster to beat because you still have a lot of meta progression and learning to do, but it would give more sense to each run and make you forget that you will still hit The Wall™, by making the journey much more interesting and ""self-contained"" ([b]the run would feel more like its own adventure that was worth doing, D&D style, not just ""a run to meta-progress""[/b]). Right now [b]you are constantly reminded that your party is just meat for the meat grinder, that was never meant to succeed because your tools are inadequate. So you quickly feel detached from them and their adventure.[/b]

Obviously the meta progression has other problems but I think most of the issues I mentioned here could be alleviated by letting player make there starting build. Considering that you have to unlock card through your runs, that runs are really long and that combat quickly requires to have very well balanced and versatile decks to be somewhat enjoyable, I don't see why you couldn't just build your deck as you wish with the card you have unlocked. You just need a system of cost and limitation of cards in the starting deck.

So, what if after 20 hours you have complete control of your starting deck ? 
Meta-wise : You still need to unlock the cards, explore all the paths in every map, unlock and upgrade the characters, fight all the monsters and bosses, use the corruption/madness system for maximum power and find the ultimate builds with your favorite characters.
Run-wise : You can still add new cards (above the starter limitation), focus more on upgrading your deck, remove cards, buy items, etc. 
Character-wise : You would still have the talents and the visual but you could also have character bound cards that you have to take in your starter deck.

You loose almost nothing but you avoid a very discouraging starting experience and gain a lot of customization. What's more, I'm not even sure you get that level of customization latter even if you start with much more fragments and gold.",1661097236,1669929108,False,177,6,0.640227854251861572,46,True,False,False

It is welcoming to both seasoned players and total beginners alike and the multiplayer brings a vital collaboration element to the game that Slay the Spire and its descendants desperately needed all along, but no one really knew yet.

The developers also fully understand the depths of the genre and have created sincerely challenging scenarios that still feel balanced even while you doing something completely unfair.

Some aspects are a little bit annoying: like card drops don't mean squat and you rarely really pick any up - instead you craft your deck at the beginning of the run. That eliminates the random deck building on the go element that is present in aforementioned ""Slay the Spire"". Also, some boss fights feel like a tedious job to complete - you have a strong fun deck, but it takes a very long time to complete the fight (so you do the same stuff over and over until you finally win, and you know you will because your setup is strong - with good mitigation, damage and healing).

Tig is capable of protecting an entire team and tanking for them, effectively acting as a sub-healer and sub-tank. Now, the best way to play Oinker is as a Mig.

Every single post online you read all this amazing hype. Even a lot of the reviews on here are tooting the horn for it. I question the authenticity of these reviews/posts now and wonder exactly who wrote them. I must admit though, I got suckered in. 

I got pulled in due to the very fact of attempting to get my friends into deckbuilders. We all thoroughly enjoyed StS and I thought this experience would be great for us all. 

Dear god. I was wrong. Clunky animations, bad sound design... Just honestly felt so slapped together. I WAS willing to overlook this though.

I loaded multiplayer with the intent of  finding some randoms to flex on me with tech and strats and really leave my mouth wide open. You know, something that could make me really see the charm and the magic underneath the hood. Unfortunately over the space of a month I would open a lobby and NOBODY; not one single person joined. Decided to go into the discords LFGchannel and....... Well let's just say the community isn't exactly the nicest bunch. (Basically had one bloke fly down my throat and tell me ""F*** off then!!!! The community is better without you"" after I said the game feels dead... Oh! I'm a narcissist aswell apparently) 

Funny how a game that boasts to be a MULTIPLAYER deckbuilding game, doesn't have that much of a streamlined experience for it. Like the rounds and are drawn out as it is and there's no local coop. I shouldn't have to dedicate yet more time to interviewing potential teammates for a 2 - 3 hour RUN.

But as you unlock perks, level up, and uncover card synergies, there is a depth that few deck builders achieve. If you find the game too challenging, stick with it a bit: deciding how characters will support and specialize unlocks a wealth of game play options.

Yes, this means that Across the Obelisk isn't a true rogue-like, as perks and a portion of your money carries over between games. But there is a max on perk points (50) and money stops carrying over at the higher difficulties.

Across the Obelisk is up to four-player online co-op with each player assigned a subset of characters to control. When the group disagrees there is a successful random mini-game to determine who steers the party.

Overall, Across the Obelisk breathes fresh life into the ""rogue-like deck builder"" genre. Personally, I believe the true game begins at 50 perk points, and the games leading up to that point are an extended tutorial designed to familiarize yourself with the cards and options.

No matter what I'm doing at the moment  they keep coming and yanking me into another run. Very fun. Would recommend.
Update: You can pet the dog.
Update 2: Still love the game and it has almost nothing that I find terribly unfair or frustrating, besides the dark constraints card that purges energize and applies fatigue. Looking forward to the 1.0 release. I give this game a 9/10.
Update 3: Now that version 1.0 has come out I can only say that the game has improved tremendously. The new perk system allows for some fun/goofy builds. One of my favorites is using dilute to turn Grukli's bleed into wet and then turning the wet into bless. I managed to do over 100 thousand damage with one hit, even though nothing comes close to having that much health. Very fun, can not recommend more.

A bit intimidating for a new player partly because the rogue-lite element means you have to play many games to power up your characters in future runs but this is greatly improved if playing alongside a friend with higher level characters to smoothen the experience.

It's great for achievements and looks very doable to 100% the game without excessive grinding and it encourages you to seek out all the paths / hidden / rare encounters. You get decent pay-off as well for learning the game and what different paths can bring you if you're going for certain builds or earning items to cash in for effects later in the adventure. It creates nice 'aha' moments where that fish you caught in a pond in the first chapter suddenly has a use later on which you weren't expecting.

The game heavily encourages you to win each battle ASAP which means the goal is to not let any monsters even have a turn, making non-boss enemies not have much personality and they feel like dungeon trash to get through as quickly as possible. The only time enemies will be getting turns is when your player level is low and your characters are weak. 

Overall would recommend but try and play with a friend especially when new as managing 4 characters and their decks, equipment, traits etc is quite a lot to handle.",1669329778,1669329778,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I love the way they handle energy…if you don’t spend it in a turn it rolls to the next, meaning skipping a turn or getting a bad draw doesn’t have to feel bad, and choosing to save a bit of energy can often be a good choice.

Solo it can be a bit overwhelming to play, keeping track of 4 decks. With 2-4 players though the lacing is awesome. Sharing resources is elegant while each person feels free to use their own. Highly recommended.",1669310192,1669310192,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False

Dont think of it as just another Slay the Spire clone, cuz its not. Ofc u play cards and ofc u will build combos but the game differs from its sibblings a lot!
While Slay the Spire for example is a lot more about finding that sweet spot exploit Across the Obelisk is way more about telling a story, introducing characters and their personal story.
The game has a lot of charm and character, is fun to play, solo or as a group and hast at least 50 hours of content if not double the amount.

Difficulty is adequate so far. Took me about 35hrs to 1st successfull run.
Sound design is not bad, but subpar - restarting music with divination rounds, and some monsters on-hit effects are most notable offenders.
Visuals are nice, but some high-end cards are a bit underwhelming (you know, heavy hitters for 8+ mana out of 10 possible should feel IMPACTFUL)
Core mechanics are well done and that's main game seller for me.
If you like Slay the Spire or Monster Train - give this one a try.

Across the Obelisk is a cool competitor in the already giant ecosystem of deckbuilder roguelites. The main difference that lets it stand tall above the rest is the fact that there is online co-op available. This makes the process of playing through the original campaign much more difficult and chaotic when 4 people of different mindsets and experiences start playing. Although the story may be slightly bland, the overall progression system and scoring system provides much replay value to the original game. There are also weekly challenges and events that can throw of your otherwise perfect team setup, which provides another layer of variability to the overall experience. I think that this game is going to go far, and even be mentioned among some of the greats (Slay the Spire, Inscryption, etc) Definitely worth the asking price, dumb to buy if not on sale.

1- This game was made around multiplayer, which just overall makes the game more enjoyable when you're journeying across the lands with friends.

2- The great detail of the deck building system. This game starts off simple to help you learn the basics but becomes unforgiving quickly to teach you just how crazy some of these cards get. The synergies you can make with your friends as well is so fresh feeling that each journey feels new and exciting.

3- The simpleness of the game. This game doesn't have the AAA graphics team or the experimental mechanics to stand out. It's got a simple art style that still looks good and doesn't take away from the main focus. THE GAMEPLAY! This game has a great focus on what's important to players and that's how it feels to play. 

This game overall is just plain fun to play and you can easily sink hours into a session without even noticing the time on the clock. I'm 27 hours into this game so far and I haven't even beaten the main story as of yet. 

Bonus points for whoever did the music for this game. The soundtracks during the boss fights just made me feel more hyped to defeat them.

Across the Obelisk is a great game to ungie bungie.

Pros:
- I don't have to devote 100% of my attention to the game while my friends are taking their turn so I can do some other things on the side.
- I don't need to stress about making perfect decisions, and mistakes aren't detrimental to runs. Runs are rarely doomed, so I don't have to worry about upsetting friends.
- The perk system (and perk system revamp) is refreshing. I like the permanent stat boosts that the perk system provides, and it's not a huge grind like in some other games.

Cons:
- Some of the cards available early on in the runs are not very useful, so the first map is somewhat boring.
- Some of the enemies are not difficult to fight but extremely tedious to kill.
- At times, I found my runs to be frustrating due to the terrible rates for certain cards. Perhaps if the game had an option to select what type of cards you would like to get for clear rewards...I've gone through entire maps without finding any cards that worked with my deck.",1658384918,1669170277,True,13,1,0.618208408355712891,0,True,False,False

Worth the full price if you like deck builders or co-op games.  There is story, humor, challenge, replayability, and versatility.

I would be ashamed to not write a glowing review.. So here we go!:

[h2] Price:[/h2] 
Worth the full price if you like any of these titles: Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Monster Train, WoW TCG. I like it better then any of these.  

[h2] Meaningful Choices:[/h2] 
The story is interesting but but not bloated or waste your time if you want to move on.  Pay attention to the couple of sentences to make your decision and you will be rewarded with humor and unlocks. 

[h2] Deck Building:[/h2] 
If you make a good deck, any of numerous strategies can beat the game (ie. all 1 element, all one class, burn, poison, bleed, fury, sanctity, insanity, the list goes on...)

[h2] Game Experience:[/h2] 
The game is turn based.  This makes for a casual friendly game.  You can take care of life and come back.  But also, the game auto saves after each node meaning you can close the game whenever and not lose progress.  Combat can be reset if you make an accidental error (but wont change much else).  The game is excellent for single player but maybe even better in multiplayer.
If you have played WoW TCG, you will love this digital improvement.  Duration of game is much less, stop and pick back up where you left off, set up, and deck building is quicker because you do small edits throughout your run.  The changes you make are more controlled than games like StS.

[h2] Community:[/h2] 
I never have experienced such a responsive, helpful and active  [url=https://discord.gg/tQkDeXzTKd]discord community[/url]. Cannot believe I am adding such a comment on a game review. [u]Never[/u] have I had this experience in a discord.  Questions are answered promptly, clearly and completely so you can get back to the game!  
Feedback also appears to be used and implemented by devs. With this said, I feel it is critical I also mention the user interface is phenomenal! Right click on anything and it gives you detailed info easy to digest with hoverable key words to save you from wasting any extra time.

in other deckbuilding game you get the resources or skills you need to win, in this game, you dont get the skills, or items or resources to win, instead, at the start of a new run, after dieing you get some resources to upgrade your cards and a perk point or two, which, lets you minorly upgrade the characters.
well this sounds good its not enough to have you win the next run either. you will need to have 4 to 6 failed runs to have a chance at winning. so in order to win you will have to grind for many hours, but thats just to have a chance at winning, it does not mean you will win. 
so i will have to grind for many hours just to have better chance at winning. i wish the game had pointed this out. if it had i would not have bought the game. maybe this is their first or second game but i feel the game is really wasting my time.

Cabe recalcar que al ser un roguelite, la mayoria son desbloqueables a medida que juegas y subes de nivel.

Por otro lado, el juego tiene su toque de comedia en la historia, esta implementación me gusta mucho ya que estos tipos de juegos requieren en su mayoria enfoque y una actitud seria. Ademas, cada personaje se siente unico tanto en su personalidad como jugabilidad y estrategia.

There are some differences between this game and other popular games of this style, such as Slay the Spire or Monster Train.

The strength of this game is in the sheer variety of builds and combinations available. You start with 4 characters, each with their own decks. You'll unlock cards after every fight, and depending on how quick you beat that fight and how much xp you have on your run, you'll be rewarded generally higher quality cards. In addition to this, your characters all have equipment slots, perk points, pets, etc. where you can augment your build strategy.

However, as been noted in other reviews, all of this wonderful stuff is locked behind the roguelite progression. The first couple of runs, you should be able to make it through the first Act, and then after that you should be able to have amassed enough town upgrades, starting gold and crystals (when you die, you get a good helping of gold and crystals to start the next run) to start to try different synergies and see how they do. Your options will be somewhat limited in those first few runs, but I didn't have any feelings of oppressive grind, as even in those first runs, I was unlocking quite a bit of cards to help customize those first four characters. Things started to really click for me in runs 3 and 4.

Part of the learning curve of this game is realizing that some builds are nearly useless against certain monster types, their resistances, and the status conditions they afflict. When in these situations, you have to make sure your party is diverse enough to be able to handle the monsters in your path, or knowing which monsters are in which branching path and avoiding them if you don't have a good answer for them. For instance, if your party doesn't have any way to remove the Chill status effect, the Ice realm boss is probably going to wipe your party, since it does an AOE breath attack that builds based on how much Chill you're inflicted with. In general, unlocking and having cards that dispel conditions on your heroes is usually a very good idea.

With all that said - this game is not meant to be beaten in a couple nights. I'm 20 hours in, and have only unlocked 3 new characters out of the 12 available, and haven't gotten far enough to unlock the truly powerful legendary cards. The joy of this game is in the journey of unlocking everything, trying new builds, and discovering synergies with the myriad of options that slowly unlock as you play. It's a great game, but keep in mind the progression curve is somewhat slow compared to other roguelite deckbuilders.

At first I was kind of ambivalent, but once you understand how to get through the different levels and build up a bit of a rune and gold nest egg and unlock characters, it becomes a blast.  I'm trying to figure out how to get all the pets now.  I'm sure there are guides but what's the fun in that?  I also need to unlock 2 more heroes but I kind of forget about them because of other objectives.

To me, that's what makes the game so cool.  There are so many different things to do when you set out.  I honestly don't care if I beat the crazy wizard dude in some runs because I'm looking to unlock a pet or a hero or just take a different path.  For reference, I suck and I've only beaten the wizard guy once, though been to him several times.  However, I genuinely enjoy the game.

Its pretty cool that the different heroes have different specializations (unlike Tainted Grail where the heroes are just rehashes of what came before with a different way to gain power).  I guess that, in effect, they don't really mean a whole lot since you can basically force the characters to be anything you want them to be via skill points and replacing their starting objects.  But it's such a cool dynamic to have heroes focused on different skills and abilities and allows for fresh approaches to the game. 

The game is vast (as card battlers go) as well, which helps for replayability.  Yes, I am to the point now where I am going through the same fights without thinking in some places but there is a great little Merchant Caravan thing that allows you to skip like 3/4 of the start so it's not so terrible there.

Lets be honest, this shit is mediocre at best. I will say though the side story dialogue that rotates every run (depending on the path you choose) can be interesting and fun to read. But as a rogue like eventually you find a plateau that just leaves you feeling like you're doing the same thing over and over again...(odd)
Repetitive game play is fine but every 3 runs seeing the same story lines just leaves you wanting to skip them, Lets go straight into combat. Reading is for nerds anyway.

Gameplay🟢🟢🟢🟢
I think the intial game play is fine. The best way I can break it down is pro v cons

PROS: 
🟢You can upgrade cards at the start of your run to build a deck based of a desired play style.
🟢(when you actually start to unlock characters) you can swap around the layout of your team
🟢The skill tree is pretty simple so even if you don't have cards unlocked or know what your future builds will be you can still understand wether or not if you want the tank to have more hp, ya feel me.
🟢mod support

CONS:

🔴This game has deck building but it requiers an ingame currency to even edit or change cards. they aren't asking for human money but i just think it's kind of goofy.

🔴Unlocking new heros is to difficult, 89 hours and i just unlocked 1. (no it's not a skill issue you cunt) 
To unlock characters you need complete a mini boss for them and reach that said boss ofc. 


🔴Game feels like a drag.


🔴lastly, everyone has the same skill tree. There's no unique perks for specific characters. They have their own cards sure but that aint enuff big fella

 
CARDS🟢🟢🟢🟢
Honestly not that bad, you can edit decks you unlock new ones as you go through the map. Specific story lines can drop pretty high value cards for that run. ALL in ALL if your looking for a card rogue like there's no reason to not pick this up. But it's 100% not THE game.

It's really not similar at all to something like slay the spire outside of the superficial card interface.

The multiplayer is also very similar to divinity where while technically you are playing with another person, you could realistically just play it solo and it wouldn't be any different.

One complaint I would mention is that each play through is quite long (like 2+ hours if you're kind of slow), so it feels a bit like a grind at times.

One shortcoming this game does have, though, is its obelisk mode, which is supposed to be more of the traditional Slay The Spire-style gameplay. In truth, it feels tacked on compared to the love that went into adventure mode.

I'm kind of having fun playing it with a friend, but at the same time, we keep finding ourselves sighing to each other and saying ""It's because it's not well designed."" Seriously, when the game works the way we expect a game to work, we comment on how surprised we are.

For example, it's 100% impossible to finish the game on your first attempt (and probably 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th). It's locked behind something of a pay wall... but instead of paying with real money, you pay with hours.

I'm 15 hours in and still haven't beaten the second level's final boss. When you die, you get stronger. In order to get stronger, you have to grind.

Some of the design choices are good, but the game reeks of someone's first game dev. Ignoring the fact that a lot of the assets are random ones you can buy online (That's fine, you've got to start somewhere), there are really strange decisions throughout the game.

Let's go back to that second final boss. 2 fights before it, we had to fight a spider boss, that rinsed our health. Immediately after that, we had to fight some enemies that played special cards, where if you hit them, you took a lot of damage.

With our health that low, the only way we could win was by electrocuting the one in the middle (so they'd spark the two either side of them), and spending our turns blocking so that we wouldn't die, as well as having our healer patch up what they could.

After half an hour, we finally beat the fight. It wasn't hard... it was just boring. If we attacked normally, we'd have taken too much damage and just died. So we had no choice but to cheese the fight.

Immediately after that, we had the boss encounter. However, before that, a message popped up giving us 4 choices.

1. Stand in front of enemy A. 2. Stand in front of enemy B. 3. Stand in front of enemy C. 4. Heal yourself 40%.

Seeing as our health was low, we chose option 4 and healed ourselves. We then get a message saying ""You took too long, and now the boss is tougher.""

How were we meant to know that?!?!?

We tried 3 times, but could only beat 3 out of the 4 bosses, and eventually gave up.

There are also a few sound issues that bother me (pet peeves). When you hover over a button, the game makes a sci-fi ""Beep!"" which is really out of place for a fantasy style game.

The enemies all seem to make the same grunt when you hit them.

At the start, text will appear in front of your character, showing stat changes, or abilities... in complete silence. We had quite a few at the boss, and sat for about 3-5 seconds in complete silence watching text slowly fly out of our midsections.

It's strange, I do like the game, but at the same time I've been playing Slay the Spire and Griftlands lately, and both of which are much superior games, imo.

When I die in Griftlands, for example, I feel like it was my fault. When I die in Across The Obelisk I find myself saying ""How was I meant to know that was going to happen???""

Very few games ever in my life have held my interest for so long.  I had recently gotten into Roguelike Deckbuilders, starting with Slay the Spire, played many an hour while ignoring my college professors, and Monster Train, played many an hour ignoring my postgrad responsibilities.  The one thing that Across the Obelisk has to make it immediately better than either of those is multiplayer.  I was almost always prefer playing games with friends than without, so being able to play one of my favorite genres with friends is amazing

The game is just a good game period too.  There are 16 characters each with their own specialties, and many of them have two distinct playstyles to them, due to a two-branch level up tree, making it feel like way more than 16 styles to play. The adventure mode has tons of secrets and unlocks to discover, and the obelisk mode is a very solid traditional roguelike experience.  

If I had to put any complaints, I have a few small balance issues (but no game is gonna be perfect on that) and the only real complaint I have is runs are pretty long.  An adventure mode run with my friends is 4-5 hours.  I don't mind it, but that can certainly be a problem for some people.  We usually break up runs between 2-3 sessions.

Pros:

Truly the only coop roguelite deck builder I know of

A wild amount of synergy builds

4 classes with 4 characters each. All of them play quite differently despite using the same card sets per class.

Once beaten, there are multiple difficulty settings for a challenge.

Soundtrack is pretty decent.

Neutral:

Card art is OK at best. Not a big deal.

Roguelite progression, some people might hate this type of progression but I for one love it.

Cons:

One of the worst cases of AI cheating I have ever seen, the ""Random"" attacks always hit the person most vulnerable, the suddenly get the perfect cards to combat you. Its up there with Age of Wonders as far as AI cheating.

The art to me is the worst and kind of ""Furry"" like? It almost looks like a flash game from newgrounds in 2012. Animations are weird and clunky. I would have preferred anything to this.

Sound design, a lot of people hate on the sounds in this game. As a person who works on music and audio in games, I tend to agree but honestly, it may be intentional as some of them are hilarious. (Sheep and owl killed me when I first heard them.)

If you like deckbuilders just buy it and stick with it. Absolutely solid, much different from Slay the Spire, but good in its own way!

I occasionally saw Across the Obelisk in the pool of games but always saw Monster Train as a comparable game to StS. After playing Monster Train and also really enjoying it but not getting as much replayability out of it as I hoped, I decided to try Across the Obelisk with some friends.

With that background being said, I actually had the most fun with Across the Obelisk out of the three. I feel as if it doesn't get enough visibility and often goes unnoticed, or people don't give it a chance due to the art style. The fact that the game has a very fun co-op makes it stand out for that alone, but the amount of depth this game has with the various unlocks was refreshingly surprising. I will say, going in mostly blind and exploring everything probably added to that experience for me so if you're someone who likes to look everything up your hours played will probably be shorter. However, there are a ton of build combinations with the many class options and deck/artifact/perk routes so I personally think this game should be rated much higher compared to the other two mentioned.

I am a diehard strategy and roguelike fan.  Europa Universalis 4 and XCom (EU/2) Long war mods are my jam.  Renowned Explorers, Battle Brothers (modded, of course), and Into the Breach are treasures of my collection.  I love complexity, and Across the Obelisk has it in droves.  YET, while my 6 year old son would have no idea how to even begin to approach EU4 or Renowned Explorers, he LOVES across the obelisk, and will gladly play the default difficulty with me, even understanding how to form some functional strategies with his deck (which he loves to grow to 40+ cards, eyeroll, he has a long way to go before madness 1, even).

Plumbing the depths of this game will take a long time.  There are ~20 buff, 20 debuff, and each hero (there are 16 heroes spread evenly across 4 classes) has about 10 of their own unique cards/items/enchantments/passives.  Each class has some 80-100 cards shared across its 4 heroes, with some 20-30 more campaign/event cards shared across all classes.  Each hero has 5 item slots, and there are some 50 items for each slot, many of which completely change how a hero plays.  Just as an example, one item applies poison charges when you apply a wet charge, bridging a strategy of a wet + lightning mage (wet increases lightning damage) with your party rogue stacking poison.  Each card has a corrupted version with stronger or different effects, and this goes for class/skill cards as well as items.  As you increase the difficulty, these corrupted cards become more common, a feature I especially like, as it adds some flair to higher difficulty (madness) levels beyond just ""enemies harder, player weaker"" like you see in slay the spire, for example.

Some might assume that the ""static"" campaign map takes away from replay-ability.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  There are 5 zones at time of writing, of which you will play 4 in a successful campaign.  The first and 4th are set, but the 2nd and 3rd are pulled from a pool of 3 possibilities, player's choice.  Each zone has 3-4 ""major"" paths through it that are totally different and exclusive from the others, and each major path has 1-3 minor path variations depending on choices you make, key items you have obtained, and characters in your party, which you must learn over time.  TO TOP THIS OFF, the events that occur at each node are pulled from an RNG set, so they are NOT static, though the sets are limited, allowing the player to learn some key events over time and intelligently choose paths that will give them build enabling cards/buffs/items/pets.  400 hours in, and I have still missed some paths/variations.  And if that isn't enough for you, the devs have made daily challenge + full RNG obelisk mode for those people that just HAVE to have fully PRNG levels.",1666716492,1666716658,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I really wish it had an unlimited mode where you could assemble your dream team with free access to all cards and items you've unlocked instead of relying on the roguelike mechanics, but then that's the point of the game.

The power build over time is just at the right pace to keep you pushing further and further, and because the way the maps and mini quests work, you plot a careful trajectory which will lead to a very different playthrough each time, even though you're working through the same 6 rather small maps. The exact path you follow will have strong impacts in the game and you unlock enough cards each run that you'll have access to just that one or two new cards which really fit well into your play style.

66 hours in and I've barely changed up my heroes and build because there's plenty here to flesh out and refine even though other hero combinations would flip my entire strategy on its head and offer entirely new possibilities.

A few of my friends and myself saw this one and thought it'd be a fun game to play as a group, and that is definitely the biggest perk of the game overall. The co-op is very well implemented, and while I don't think I would jump into a room with randoms, there solid means in place for conflict resolution and discussion. Easy resource sharing and strategies that you can build off of each other.

The gameplay feels solid too. All the characters feel like they have a specific niche, which can feel a bit like getting pigeonholed, but there's enough variety that it never really feels like an issue. The exploration of the different builds and how specific pieces of equipment shift and change builds over the course of a run. The enemy and route pathing feels varied enough to make choices feel impactful, and events being set randomly run to run is good, but it does feel weird that enemy positioning doesn't ever really change, which makes it easier to plan for fights, but takes away from some of the roguelike properties. 

The only other thing people might consider a downside is you will reach a point where you can see the end of your time with this game, which is not something typical of most roguelikes these days. I'm almost 50 hours in and I can easily see myself playing another 100 hours but I can also begin to feel that there is a definitive point where I will have seen all the game has to offer and won't have a reason to return. This may or may not be an issue for you, but it is not for me because even only 100 hours for a roguelike is still very good when a game is only $20.

Because how you can purchase cards and pick optimal routes for certain events/items, the game become a bit too deterministic to me compared to other Rogue lite games.

The game is very good.

This review is centered towards People looking for a Co-op game. This is towards the adventure story aspect of the game. 

Pros: The co-op is really why the game interested me. Being able to play a deck builder with friends, in an adventure story loop, with lots of progress unlocks. There is decision making where you can work together or compete at some map locations. There are lots of map locations to explore and find. Once you learn paths you can gear runs with certain nodes. The variety in locations is awesome and all the maps are inter-connected with quests. They improved graphics in the 1.0 update which i am very thankful of. The Developers seem very cool and seem thrilled to make more content. I'm hoping this continues in a positive way and it will be interesting to see what they do in the future.

Cons: I think that you should be able to access all green, blue, red maps before entering the upper-floors. I've found the game to be very strangely balanced. Most all cards in the game applies a status or effect to a enemy or character. There are upwards of 15+ different status effects. Each stat with its own specific change in what it does. Sometimes on the first turn before you can do anything your character will die, due to crazy amounts of status effects. Its very complicated and feels very overdone, cluttered, and difficult to understand. As a new player it was overload trying to keep track of them. I'm not sure why this is. After awhile I figured it out. but i could see it as a large turn off to some players. It needs to be improved. 
After this many hours there does not feel like enough cards in the game for enough long term replay-ability. There is a large selection but i would like to see the card count increased by like 25% at least.

Summary: This summary is focused on a Co-op centered review. At this review time the final boss has been beaten and 95% of items are unlocked. So 60 hours is a marker for game play The game is very enjoyable a great group game. But It didn't last as long as I had hoped.",1654311914,1666246362,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

A lot will compare the gameplay to Slay the Spire, and I will say as a fan of deck builders I prefer this game and Monster Train over StS. Very well done game, I'd love to see more classes and content added, even if through expansions like Erannorth Chronicles.

If you like deck builders, I highly recommend this game.

Update after an additional 50 hours: So I have unlocked all the characters, still have half the pets to figure out. I've been thoroughly enjoying the character combos you can create. For example at the start of the game you have 1 Healer, 1 Scout, 1 Mage, 1 Warrior. They are designed to be ordered with Warriors in front, then Scouts, Mages and Healers in the back. So I thought to myself, what if I try mixing this up... Enter, the mage tank.

I put Zek, a self-destructing mage in the front. Why, you ask? Because Mages can apply Insulate, increasing elemental resistances by 30%. Zek also has the ability to apply Chill charges to himself. Using the in-game Tome of Knowledge I looked for items with the ""Chill"" keyword, where I discovered in Act 1 there is an item you can get that gives Reinforce based on your number of chill charges. Reinforce is a warrior buff that increases physical resistances by 30%. Zek also has a talent once you hit level 5 that increases his damage by 30% and causes him to heal 30% of all damage done. So I figured... Lifesteal tank!

I made sure to grab Dispels on my healer, as well as skills that apply Courage, granting 30% Shadow, Holy and Mind resistance. The objective being to apply all 3 of these resistance buffs to my life-stealing tank that has solid damage.

Will this work in all madness levels? I'm not sure, but I'm eager to try more combos, such as an Evasion tank. This is the kind of customization and fun that you can go through with this game. There is a lot to it, but it isn't overwhelming at any point (in my opinion.)

But you probably want to know why, yeah?
Well Across the Obelisk, doesn't actually do much to really break the mould of a deckbuilding roguelite. It's a good mix of Slay the Spire deckbuilding and Darkest Dungeon slot-based combat, specific attacks can hit specific slots and require you to be in specific positions, you know the drill. While it doesn't do much in this regard to really stand out, it also doesn't need to, it takes those mechanics and executes them really well.
I found it quite fun having to plan and build 4 different decks for 4 different characters with their various bonuses, just like matching up the characters in Darkest Dungeon.
I think what really drove the game home for me was the... treasure system? I don't actually know/remember what they call it. When you finish a run, succeed or fail, you get a treasure chest saved containing currency based on how well you did, the further you got, the better the contents.
On subsequent runs you can then claim these chests, each chest can be claimed once and you can stack up three at once.
What I find really great about this system is the fact that you can buy a lot of the cards you'll need in the towns, including the starting town. That means that if you do well on a run, and you have the necessary town upgrades, you can tailor your starting decks to the style you want. You circumvent getting a bad start or just not getting the cards you need. Drops, luck, events and what not still play an important role during the run of cause, but the simple fact that you can guarantee getting at least the basic cards you need for a certain type of deck is a blessing.
Slay the Spire is a great game, no denying that, but it can be very frustrating wanting to play an Ironclad with a strength focused deck and then not getting strength cards. That's the issue Across the Obelisk solves, you can guarantee the strength deck from the get go, it might not be optimal or exactly how you want it by the end, but the base you can be certain is there.
This system alone is such a quality of life improvement over many other deckbuilders it really does make the game shine for me.
Now now, hold your horses, I know what you are thinking. Yes, this does harm the replayability in the long run, if you can influence your deck so much, you will relatively quickly run out of things to try. It does away with those runs that don't quite work out like the Strength Slay the Spire deck i used as an example.
I have 46 hours in Across the Obelisk and have tried everything I wanted, the game is done for me (at least for the moment). But that time has been very efficient compared to my time in Slay the Spire for example, doing away with those doomed runs has severely cut down on on my playtime, but none of it was wasted.
It's a strange thing to commend a game for making me play it less than i otherwise would. But thinking about it, the time saved through this treasure system would be little more than wasted, hoping for those good runs where i got the cards that i wanted.

At this point it becomes apparent that the choices you make aren't affecting the success; the hours you put into the game is the only real factor.

It leans pretty heavily into RPG elements and eliminates the usual heavy chance/RNG aspect of card games by allowing you to craft cards at every town at the beginning of acts, and upgrade them regularly (at towns and random events). You also gain experience every time you end a run (be it successful or not), which earns you perk points for your heroes - You can use those to make them stronger permanently, and they can be reset for free which is fantastic to try out new builds!

The main reason I usually stay away from this genre is the randomness of it - This game still has some of that as you get cards randomly that you can pick after fights and during events, however the core of your deck can be crafted manually when you reach towns, making it possible to create strategies to prepare for the route you want to take, and win with specific party compositions.

The difficulty scaling is also well done, in my opinion - The game isn't actually challenging unless you want it to be. I personally had a few failed runs until I managed to beat the final boss, which allowed me to figure out the kind of strategy that worked and from then I just didn't lose... until I started doing Madness runs. Madness adds modifiers that make the game more challenging. The monsters can get new cards, you have to win before a specific amount of turns, you get limited armor/shield, etc. - Strategies that previously worked on Madness 0 can become completely obsolete, forcing you to figure out how to win from scratch.

My one gripe with the game is that runs can be lengthy - Depending on how fast you play, they could take anywhere from an hour and a half, to three hours or even longer, especially if you are playing with friends in the multiplayer mode. The nice thing is that you can leave at any point and the game will save your progress, so you can play in short bursts if you want.

For the price, it's definitely a must have if you enjoy this genre - I think it's got a really good take on it and I'm frankly surprised they aren't charging more, considering the amount of content you get! If you're looking for a game to earn all achievements on, this would probably take about 50 to 60 hours. I finished in 62 hours, but I made several mistakes and did not try to min-max or do things very efficiently so I'm sure it can be done much faster.",1665704886,1665707415,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

I have played it with my wife and we have finished it. We are now doing new campaigns to level up characters, unlock new ones, and discover new cards.

For all those who don't understand, roguelike games are premised on dying and losing to come back stronger, until at some point, you start to have enough access to damage and the necessary things to be able to complete the game. You can safely ignore those comments.

I personally find it hard to find things to play with my wife as she suffers from migraines and the screen shakes exhaust her, forcing her to rest. Being a fan of the Darkest Dungeon, this game clearly earned a place in her heart.

The only criticism I could make of the game is that I wish there was more speed available. Sometimes the animations make everything long and tedious, and personally it annoys me, especially when you have to play the game several times.

The price of the game is so cheap for the amount of hours you are going to get out of it. It took me roughly 45 hours to be able to make it to the final boss and beat him.  At the time of writing this I have just unlocked all the characters and fully upgraded my town. I still have lots of pets and some cards/items left to unlock. I haven't even touched the ""Madness"" difficulty after beating the game.

The game has a very difficult starting curve. ( It took me several attempts to beat the act 1 boss ) but each time you play the game, no matter how good or bad you do. You end the game with new talent points to assign to your characters for your next play through. ( just make sure you assign them and hit confirm before you start your new adventure.)   Keep at the grind and every play though will get just a bit easier every time you add more of those talent points to your talent tree.

The game also has a choose your own adventure aspect where you can take any path you want in the game and have new things happen. Each map node has events where you can pick and choose different options to have different end results happen.

The game soundtrack is amazing. They really made each zone/ battle feel unique.
The art work is really amazing as well. I love all the background animations and monsters.

There are so many different play styles, character combinations and builds you can do which make the game have endless replay alone.  Once you unlock everything in the game you can still play on madness levels to make it more challenging.  If you end up getting bored of Adventure mode, There is 2 other game modes to play as well!

This game also have a 4 player co-op feature, so if playing alone is not your thing. Invite some friends and journey to the obelisk together!

However there is a problem that while might just be a personal gripe, leaves me unable to recommend this game, and that is the difficulty curve. The game's main play mode adventure, goes in acts, you go through the act, fight a boss, pick the next map, proceed to next act. However the jumps in difficulty between acts are utterly absurd. You go from fighting 60 hp enemies with some decent damage and and debuffing in act 1, to mobs with over 100 hp that can place double digit stacks of debuffs on you each turn in act 2, to monsters with 200+ hp that that apply over double digits stacks of debuffs to your whole party, while turning off your buffs and in some cases, stealing them from you in act 3. This all happens while your characters become slightly stronger at a snails pace.

However if it was just an absurd level of difficulty, that wouldn't even bother me too much. The real problem is that this game has a progression system. Level up by going on adventures, get more perks, make the characters stronger. There in lies the problem. The game isn't difficult, it seems made with the express intent to make you lose, until you've reached the pre approved meta level. This is, at least in my eyes, a terrible design flaw.

At first it was a little difficult because you have to manage 4 sets of cards and build 4 characters' skills and items, but after a few (dozen) runs, you really get into the swing of it. It's a difficult game even at normal level, but losing a run doesn't feel frustrating because you're constantly learning and getting better.

Really loving the flashes of character personality you get to see from your crew. They're all varied enough to be unique personality wise, and the way you recruit them is such a nice flavour that they didn't have to add but gently enriches a player's immersion into the world. Each character plays fairly different even within each class, so I have a very clear favourite team- I don't find that any specific character is lacking in abilities though, I just found some played to my style better than others.

I don't know what it is about the art style, but it really captures that DnD feel- It's comic/cartoon-like but also detailed and kinda cool. I'm not sure how quite to explain it but it's goofy enough while still lending to a serious vibe when it needs to be.

Props to the music by the way! I loved the build up of the last boss' score. It's not epic or overly memorable, but the music elevated the experience- Again it's a little reminiscent of DnD, because DMs sometimes put ambient music on during a session to elevate the session.

An absolutely must play deckbuilder game. I had no expectations of this game because I'd never even heard of it before Steam recommended it, and it caught me by surprise by just how solid it is.",1665006381,1665006381,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I did use a guide to beat high madness, which led to really nice combos that were even stronger than builds I had come up with on my own. 

People like to complain about the slow start, but I only felt overwhelmed on my first run. If you have a good grasp of the genre, you'll enjoy the complexity that ATO brings to the table.

The multiplayer aspect is okay. It was fun to dive into the game with a friend who also loves deckbuilders, but the multiplayer is just splitting up the single player tasks into two or more players.

And boy is it fun. 
Our first attempts failed miserably, as we did not knew what we were doing and what was happening, granted we didn't read any tutorials and like to figure stuff our by ourselves. After a few attempts we were reaching the 2nd area boss and got completely clobbered. We were both eager to try again as we unlocked a few new chars and wouldn't you know it, we beat the final boss.

This game really shines if you have a group of 2 or 4 friends to play this with, it is insane fun and incredible polished. We had no bugs or crashes and there are so many quality of life features that are actually really useful, I can't stop wondering who had the audacity to create such a great game that is somewhat easy to learn and makes actually fun to wander the road to mastery.

Positives:
- Deck building is varied, there are enough characters and items to try multiple different ways of solving the combat problem. 
- Each of the characters make you play the game in notably different ways and each have multiple ways of being played. I keep wanting to play again because a different deck idea or character combination has occurred to me. 
- The story is not great but the mechanic of travelling through areas to pick up and complete quests or interact with occasional rare events is a good way of adding more variety into something that could become staid otherwise. 
- The in game glossary is a really good tool for understanding how powers can and will interact. Overall the game does a great job of teaching you about a lot of mechanics. 
- Enemies on their own and in different groups combine to make really interesting different challenges. Figuring out what to target and how to protect yourself is a constant puzzle to solve.

On the negative side; 
- As a solo game it can be a bit overwhelming trying to build 4 decks at once that work in themselves and interact well with each other.
- The story is not really interesting at all
- Some of the bosses can be quite grindy. You end up in situations where you can't really lose a combat but winning it will take a lot of time
- The game expects you to craft a powerful deck to start with which reduces the fun of the roguelike elements (although the obelisk challenge goes a long way to address this if you want to feel more like you're crafting a deck that makes sense from some nonsense you drew)
- The game resolves enemy turns very fast, this is a good thing to keep things moving but sometimes its hard to understand the mechanics. When your tank gets a hundred to zero-ed you want to understand why to fix it next time.

The interesting deck building, ability to build really powerful decks, the challenging enemies and bosses, and the co-op implementation have kept me coming back to this game.

As someone who's addicted to these kinds of games, I can confidently recommend Across the Obelisk as one of the best entries in the genre. Keep in mind, however, that it leans more heavily on the dungeon crawling aspect than the roguelike.

There are two main modes in the game, one of which focuses on a very lengthy adventure with some (very light) story and much less randomisation, and another, far speedier mode that more closely resembles your typical card battling rougelike. Both are a lot of fun. The adventure mode is almost like a full game in a single run. Runs can take upwards of five hours, there are numerous alternate paths and unlockables to increase replayability, and a roguelite progression system allows you to slowly improve your characters over time. One thing I'd have to praise this mode for is how well it embodies the lengthy dungeon crawl. You have much more control over how you build your decks compared to the randomised mode, which allows you to exploit some really busted combos once you start wrapping your head around how all the systems work. And on the harder difficulties, those combos are definitely something you're going to need.

One thing that initially turned me off about the game was just how much information it throws at you compared to some of its contemporaries. Whereas in something like Slay the Spire you only need to worry about a few simple damage vs defence numbers on either side, in Across the Obelisk you have two parties of up to four characters each all throwing out multiple cards with unique effects every turn. There are dozens of buffs and debuffs that all do different things, and information is intentionally limited unless you run cards that reveal enemy actions. Put simply, if you try and play this game like Slay the Spire and optimise every turn perfectly, you'll be stuck on the same battle all day long. That's where the Darkest Dungeon comparison comes in. The game is less about responding to perfect information and more about running with generalised strategies and builds, with adjustments coming on the fly as you react to different situations.

With sixteen different characters and four unique decks to build a party around, two completely different game modes (plus a daily challenge), multiple progression paths through any given run, and an insane amount of stuff to unlock, there's probably more content and replayability in Across the Obelisk than any of its competitors. The core gameplay isn't quite as tight as some of them due to just how many options you have, and the pacing is a bit more of a slow burn, but for every sacrifice the game makes it typically has some upside to compensate for it.

If you want a long-form Slay the Spire that plays more like Darkest Dungeon, you'll probably have a very good time with this game. I wouldn't call it the most elegantly designed deck builder out there, but it's got the legs to hook in and keep you playing for dozens if not hundreds of hours.",1664585989,1664585989,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,False

Slay the Spire is a laser focused deck builder where you craft a unique deck that's sculpted by the push-pull of forces between the deck you Want to have, and what the game actually gives you to work with.

Across the Obelisk is a game where you control 4 characters, each with their own turn initiative and deck that needs to be built over the course of an adventure. Each area of the game has a starting town where you can buy any cards you've unlocked at a card store, and take any number of cards out of your deck at the church, up to the 15 card minimum. You Will have a deck for each character that does generally what you want it to do, no real surprises there.

These differences continue across every aspect of the game, where usually StS has depth and AtO has breadth. 
In StS, you have tons of unique relics, in AtO you have a hard limit of 4 equipment items and a pet per character. 
In StS, each character has a unique playstyle and cardset, with some colorless cards mixed in, in AtO, each class has a common pool of cards that each character in that class shares, but with little to no overlap between classes. 

I think the most fundamental difference between the two games is the energy system. StS uses a ""You get X energy per turn, use it all because you can't keep any of it (barring unique relics/cards)"" system, and AtO uses a ""You get X energy to start, and Y energy per turn, but don't be reckless, any energy you don't use is carried over, and you'll need it for the bigger and better cards"" system. This makes AtO's combat much more planning focused, and sometimes sacrifices will be made on one turn to set up a future turn to be even stronger. 

Overall, Across the Obelisk is a super fun time, and the multi-player is very well done and fun too. 

It's well worth playing, peace.

It is a card building rogue-lite (or roguelike, depending upon mode) game with meta progression. It combines the 4 person party + positioning (sort of) of Darkest Dungeon (Along with town improvements) and many of the card building elements + roguelite nature of Slay the Spire.

[b]Bad:[/b] (first because it is a relatively small list)
- It is definitely an indie game. The art itself is nice enough, but the animations are very paper-doll. The sound effects are mostly stock. Music isn't especially interesting. Writing is okay, I suppose, but the story is essentially nonexistent. This is absolutely being played for the gameplay, presentation is ""good enough"" and functional.
- However, there are a few small random issues. Bugs (not many), small UI problems, balance issues. Things that are being worked on. They don't drag down the game too much.
- Information overload at the start. The game kind of throws you in and there are a lot of terms and keywords. You quickly realize that many of these are simply damage types and associated resistances, so it becomes easy to understand but initially can be overwhelming.

[b]Good:[/b]
+ Easily the game's trump card is multiplayer. The ability to play cooperatively with friends really helps the game. While some may say ""anything is fun with friends"" some things are more fun than others. I would say that this game works very well with friends. The game was built with it in mind, and there are various ways to make decisions on events via voting and tiebreakers. In game, you control 1 or more characters. My personal favorite is two players, with you and a cooperative partner each controlling 2 characters.
+ The game's foundations are strong. While it is certainly inspired by Slay the Spire, it is fun and enjoyable. Character and deck building are great. You feel like each class and character are capable of multiple types of builds based on cards selected, equipment found/purchased, talents chosen, and perks chosen. Though due to the crafting system of cards it is possible to play a similar build each run if you desire.
+ Has lots of unlockables and things to keep you playing. If you're a goal oriented player than this game is very good for that. You can focus a run on unlocking a new character or two, trying to complete a quest you failed previously, trying to find a new pet, or fight a new boss. I suppose this could be a negative for some, as there is plenty to unlock and do and maybe you'd feel like it is a ""grind.""
+ As said earlier, the game is highly replayable. Not just because of unlockables, but just by going through different paths to see different events. RNG determines if you succeed or fail (shown by an actual percentage) so even going the exact same path can have different results. Sometimes frustrating, but overall a good thing.
+ Game is challenging, but can be made easier or more challenging based upon your decisions. You naturally get more powerful in the Adventure mode the more runs you do, but then that can be made more difficult if you desire. Then there is the roguelike mode where the difficulty is always the same, and can be increased. Many times I thought that a certain fight was too difficult, only to approach it later with a new strategy and build and manage to win. It can be very satisfying to beat a boss you struggled with before (Looking at you, you dumb Dragon).
+ Game is priced very fairly. $20 is certainly a steal for a game like this.

More variety than Slay the Spire, with the potential for co-op. Less brutal than Gloomhaven. Downsides are long run-times and a lot of time lost to card/item/perk management. 

Pros:
-Slay the Spire with way more variety and options for co-op
-More accessible than Gloomhaven, but scratches the same itch
-More agency over deck management
-Quests to unlock new characters or pets keeps your early playthroughs fresh and goal-oriented

Cons:
-The variety of character perks and town upgrades also means you spend a lot of time managing your roster and less time playing them. Especially playing co-op this can slow a run down by quite a bit
-The rogue-like progression means that the early game can quickly become a too-easy tedium to plow through
-Once you're able to reach endgame, each run can take multiple hours rather than the streamlined 20-30 minutes it takes to get through Slay the Spire. I found that once I unlocked a new character or pet I was after, I was pretty much ready to end the run early rather than slog through the end.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An interesting middle space between Slay the Spire and Gloomhaven. Gameplay is pretty much exactly like Slay the Spire, but with the twist that you have a 4-character team that are all building and playing their own decks. The quests and campaign format along with the team synergy aspects are reminiscent of Gloomhaven, but with a less brutal learning curve. 

There are 4 main classes with 4 characters each. Each character has a unique specialty and levels up for perks that set them apart from other characters in their class. This adds a ton of variety in game mechanics and synergy builds between certain characters, not to mention the equipment that you can collect throughout the game. 

Across the Obelisk also takes place over 5 acts, as players move from map to map. Along the way random events and quests to unlock new characters and pets will keep things fresh as you navigate through to the next unlock. This helps runs feel productive even when your team isn't tuned for endgame. 

That said, because this is a rogue-like your starting team will eventually blow through the early game without challenge, but if you don't slog through for the cards and upgrade materials, you're risking being unprepared for the endgame.

I have ran through the first act three times and got my butt kicked at the end by the level boss - but that's  a good thing! At least that seems to be the
game plan for ATO.

Since I mentioned the difficulty, I might as well address it by saying you will die a lot playing this game. Now if you never played DD you might resent this type of game, but even Slay the Spire is no cake walk starting out, and no I don't see a whole hell of a lot of similarity to that game except for deck building.

So you might be wondering why it's a good thing to get your butt kicked when you start the game? Well you have to learn the mechanics of the cards e.g. deck building, and other aspects of how the game works, so you might as well jump in, get mollywhomped and start figuring things out.

The saving grace of getting your butt beat is that you get gold, leveling points/perks, and card buying points as your reward for being whomped on. So the more you get beat up, the stronger your characters will eventually be and hopefully your team will be strong enough to give more than it receives.

So before I wrote this,it I fired up my DD game just to refresh my brain on its details. I had forgotten what a challenge that game was/is.  DD has been out over 5 years, has DLCs, and a ton of player mods in the Steam workshop, Conversely, ATO is still in early access and is still unfinished. Comparing the two games, I would say that the authors are definitely familiar with DD, but they have some different twists in ATO that DD doesn't have.

Summary/Where's the Video?

If you're a fan of DD or another game like it, you would probably enjoy ATO. If you have no idea what DD is, I suggest you buy that game and see how that works out for you.

Monster Train, One Step From Eden, and some smaller ones which I thought were good, but just didn't stick as much, like Dicey Dungeons, Slay The Spire, and Inscryption. Out of the ones I have played in the past, I can safely say Across The Obelisk is my favorite.

It's something about the entire game is played. Normal card games you typically have one deck to keep a track of. Across The Obelisk can be very confusing at first, considering that you must keep track of FOUR different decks at once. But I believe that's the magic in it. Being able to build four different decks at once around each other. And with four characters in each class, with their own starting cards and abilities, there's a lot of diversity to be found.

The way characters are unlocked is pretty simple, you find them on the map and then pretty much get the hint on how to unlock them. Although some characters I found were much harder to unlock with the hints the game gave, and I ended up having to search up one or two of them. The way they're unlocked is good, but some felt a bit unclear.

The map system is really cool too, being similar to Slay The Spire in the different paths you can take and events that can occur depending on what you choose. Of course in Obelisk there's 5 different areas total, and depending on things you do in said areas, or items you pick up, they'll affect things later. Of course with character unlocking, but also simple events can be changed by picking up items, or you can save yourself some time or gold in the same way. 

The loads of different types of bosses are really rad, even if they felt really difficult to beat in the first few runs. The mini bosses were also really rad too, and there's even some cool rewards you can get only from them that help you in the run that you wouldn't get anywhere else, sort of giving you intention to go back to them in the future (can be done with characters too!). Some were really freakin' challenging, but in a fun way. I remember one mini boss left my whole team dead besides ONE person, and I somehow scraped by and go past the boss on dangerously low health. It was really fun, and some bosses/mini bosses are even challenging in current runs.

The multiplayer! The main selling point of the game to me. Me and my brother are always looking for new games to play. Unfortunately other card games aren't multiplayer in the sense Obelisk is, which is why we decided to pick it up. The tags for the game just screamed ""right up our alley"", and oh boy playing with someone else really made me love the game. I think it's really the way the game is meant to be played! With 2 people, or even 4 if you can. It's much less pressure being put on at once, and puts you at much more ease with learning the game. Considering that you not only have to learn the game as a whole, but 4 different types of classes can be pretty confusing at first glance, and maybe even a bit unwelcoming. Only needing to focus on 2 classes at once, or even 1 is just a whole weight off your head when you're starting off, and personally made my experience all the more enjoyable. Not that you can't play solo! It's a perfectly valid way to play, and I do solo runs all the time now. Just playing with a friend duo style, or even a full group made the game really fun! And even made for some funny moments.

The OST. At first, the OST wasn't extremely appealing. Yeah, it was fitting for the theme of the game, but didn't strike as all that interesting to me. The further I got into the game, especially the final area of the game, the OST picked up DRASTICALLY. The use of instruments in some of the late game songs is absolutely amazing! The OST was overall pretty nice! Not as extremely amazing as some other games I've played, but good enough to not mute and put other music on when playing with friends. (Also I found it interesting the OST was on Youtube, some from 3 years ago when the game wasn't even out!)

I'll keep the ending short, Obelisk was really fun in so many aspects. There isn't anything terribly bad about the game, all the parts of the game were really appealing to me (maybe besides the intro and ending to the story lol, that really isn't a big deal). Just if you like card games, maybe want a card game to play with friends, go for it! It was really fun for me and I would do it all again if it meant I could play with other friends  who are interested in playing the game!",1664093305,1664093305,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It has a lot of quality of life improvements over its obvious predecessor and inspiration Slay the Spire that seem obvious once you've played with them.

This is a deep game with a pretty steep learning curve and no real tutorial to speak of that I've seen, which made the first game or two a bit confusing, but once I had that light bulb moment and it all clicked I fell in love. The interface is polished, the art style is distinctive and easy on the eyes, and it feels good to play once you get into the flow of the game, but it doesn't hold your hand at all in your first play, and you'll be figuring things out as you go. 

There are 12 characters to unlock, each with unique skills & perks that make them all feel very different, and a giant assortment of pets, items and cards to discover, so the game has a ton of replay value (as most roguelike deckbuilders do). A full run of AtO will take you significantly longer than a run of StS, though, clocking in at something like 4-6 hours on average in solo plays for me and varying wildly in multiplayer based on how much backseating and trashtalking your group does.

And yeah, this game is fine solo, but personally I find it a bit more informational overhead to maintain than I want in a single player experience. I think it's best experienced with three friends so you can each focus on being amazing at your individual characters & can really dig into the tactics of how each one plays and how finely tuned your decks can be.

This game takes the best of both and smashes them together in a Multiplayer format reminiscent of Divinity: Original Sin where each player can control some of the 4 character party.

They've nailed the multiplayer aspects, and the game itself is very satisfying with how you can build your deck to hit some awesome synergies. The Meta rewards are really nice and unlocking new characters keeps things very fresh. Lots of party compositions means a ton of mixing and matching of different characters. I've started playing the game solo as well, where I can really optimize my party Dankest Dungeon style.

If you like games in this genre, this one is awesome. Even without the Multiplayer aspects, it shines. Add in the Multiplayer and it fits a really special role for me with my friends. I don't usually like online games, so the comfy coop aspect of it feels just right.

Only downside is that if you don't have experience with games like this and you stary playing solo, it's gotta be extremely overwhelming in terms of number of options and stuff.

- There's a good variety of group compositions, pets, items, and town upgrades

[h1]Why does every slay the spire clone have the same problem?!?[/h1]
You get thrown into a game that you have almost no chance of winning on your first try.   You earn more permanent buffs the longer you play.   You will  have a fighting chance to win after a few runs.   Permanent buffs ruin a game's replay value!!!!

[h1]Problems with permanent buffs[/h1]
This has lazy developer balancing written all over it.   You begin the game underpowered and against overwhelming odds, but after a couple runs it becomes boringly easy because you earned so many permanent upgrades.    The starting area is super boring now.   Fights rarely feel fair.

Make your game so that each hit point matters.   If players can stay at full health all the time, then you lose your momentum to keep the game engaging.    (smaller heals, less monster damage)

Single player experience was a good time as well.  Its an engaging game to learn.  Sometimes a single card upgrade is a huge deal or you get an item that makes an unreasonable card almost trivial to use.  Each zone has its own mechanics making niche cards worth getting.  Some you take and then you  remove them after one zone.  So while some decks will just  build one way the whole game through, others might change roles as the game goes one.  There are a couple scenarios where a particular build might get hard countered and how you play can challenge that.  Anyway its systems work really well together giving the gameplay some depth.

Art for the game is beautiful.  The cut scenes were serviceable, not my style, but once you see it once you'll smash the skip button anyway.   It spent the time on the stuff that matters and I enjoyed the enemy design especially in the early area. Music was pretty good and fits the tempo of the fights.

There are some barriers and nitpicks.  The game takes a decent amount of setup.  From the start you can buy items, new cards, remove cards, upgrade cards, gamble for cards.  If you have money/shards from previous runs you can dump that into your current run.  Oh and there's talents you can allocate on your characters for each run.  This can lead to a long time to even start the run, and for newer players the game itself is going to take a few hours.  This is where it being a rouge lite can be a bit frustrating.  The game holding out on things like fortify charges and actions is huge.  Having a card being too expensive due to not having something unlocked can be a bit frustrating.  Speaking of frustrating unlocks some of the pet stuff is a bit rough.  Go to the second zone and then even if the event does spawn you fail an RNG roll and then don't get it due to nothing you could have changed.  I get it, varied run and all but the pets aren't RNG once you have them you just buy them in the shop.  So I would have preferred they be like the characters in that they are more straightforward to unlock.

To summarize a few reasons for this:

1) Playing by yourself is a lot of work to effectively build 4 complete custom decks for each character and manage each of them well.  Playing with a friend cuts this in half (you each manage 2 decks).  It's just bad single player.

2) Unlocking new content outside of random cards is a HUGE disappointment.  To unlock characters you have to go to specific nodes, do specific things, hope you have the specific requirements met and then make specific choices before finishing the run.  You have to look this up or you'll likely never complete more than 1-2 unlocks (of characters/pets)

3) Similar to above, many of the unlocks require VERY specific configurations.  For example, one of the pets requires that you pass a RNG check and roll less than 3 in total card cost of all your party.  That means you have to pull a 0, and 3 1 cost cards (or similar) in order to be successful and maybe unlock this pet.   We've failed 3x attempting this and each attempt requires HOURS of investment (or you can scrap the run all together after 1-2 hours of getting to the attempt.

4) Progression feels good initially but quickly falls off.  Card unlocks come to a complete stop and what you have unlocked is only available late into runs.  Item unlocks also don't show up till way late during runs making them feel bad overall.

5) The card upgrade choices (that you make each run) feel really bad.  You are basically choosing between adding a small amount of damage or making the card cheaper to use.  Typically the cost of using the new version goes up making it a neutral upgrade at best.

I compare number 5 above to a game like Monster Train where you get to upgrade cards that make MASSIVE changes to how they are used and really make you feel like you're gaining power as you progress in each run.",1660927414,1663450393,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Sadly it did not live up to the hype. I still put 25 hours here which I think is enough to have a fair opinion. I just couldn't get into it for a few reasons:

1. The difficulty doesn't scale properly IMO. After beating act 1, I've only been able to make it a few spots into the second map regardless of which route I take. The monsters in the encounters just start doling out so much damage. Maybe I just need to get good, but I feel like it shouldn't get that difficult so quickly.

2. The cards and their upgrades seem very subpar. I never felt like I would be able to pull of a mega combo if I built my deck in a certain direction.

3. The mini quests you get by stopping on certain tiles are meh. Once you get back to the map there is a notification on the side of the screen, but hovering over it doesn't give you any more info on where to go, etc. Also, if you can't path to your destination then the quest should disappear or say failed or something.

I could go on but I think these are my main gripes. I'd say if you have to choose between this or StS then it's very clear that sts is the better choice.",1663436447,1663436447,False,2,0,0.484711915254592896,0,True,False,False

2)	Select your Madness (difficulty) 0-16
3)	Draft style card selection

5) 	Try to get to the end of the map aka Slay the Spire. 
6) 	At the end of the map, fight a boss 
7) 	Beat  the boss? Proceed to the next map.

There's also a weekly challenge where random modifiers gets added but I did not play that mode (160+ hours and I barely scratch the surface of 1 mode).

Why I would recommend the game
•	 The choices and combination of characters is truly crazy and wonderful. On the higher madness  (14-16) there will be some combinations that would not work. However half the fun is trying to make them work. 
•	The perk system is also quite fun and allows more crazy combinations. For instance, if you have a cold and fire mage together there isn't really a synergy. However, there's a perk that transform all the fire burn damage to cold damage...
•	The map system in the Adventure mode is also another gem. The map itself doesn't change but certain node gets events or quests randomly so the path is never the same. This allows a RPG expereince without over complicating anything. Which brings me to:
•	Each run take 2-3+ hours long. But there really isn't any downtime. No sorting of loot, no extra tedious task that's not part of the core card game gameplay.  The game is long is because every battle is a fight and more importantly; each battle is interesting. 
•	All the above would not be nearly as good if it wasn't for the perfection that is UI and interface. 
You mange 4 decks in this game! But not problem, you can save (and name!) your beginning layouts. You have to twiddle with perks for 4 characters every time you start. Again, no problem! There are perk save slots too with the ability to name them.
Need some battle information? Chances are it's there where you think it should be.
Want to upgrade a card? Guess what all the keywords and upgrade paths are available to you on command. 
This is only the start, never in my 150+ hours was I annoyed about the interface. I don't think this every happened before. I know I sound crazy but if you ever want to spend a long time with a game, chances are the interface and UI are one of the top things that adds to your enjoyment of a game. 
•	None of the cards have anything special about them but the combo of cards, classes of characters, equipment and enemies make this game card based combat highly unique. 

Somethings to consider if you’re on the fence
•	Don't. Unless...

Full achievement takes ~100 hours depending if you're just playing for fun or just for the achievement. You can probably get 100% faster (maybe 80 hours ish) but it would be beyond boring and you'll have to follow a guide for almost everything. Half the fun of the game is discovering the quest lines and hidden items.

Here's the Unless. There's a multiplayer co-op achievement. I don't know why the devs decide to put it in but it's there. It's easy to do (win or lose a multiplayer game), takes only 10 minutes at the most if you manage to find someone. Currently it isn't tough to but if you're reading from this future (do we have Skunk Pox yet?) and 100% is important to you I would check Steamspy before buying. 

Devs if you're reading this, I would get rid of the multiplayer achievement.

Also love the small quality of life stuff packed in, like restart battle, surrender, and fast mode.

I see myself putting 100+ hours into this game.

EDIT : So far the only complaints are suuuuper minor. The first is that the voice acting is horrendously bad. Like, it's comical how bad everyone sounds. I would like to see an option in the audio settings that lets me mute voices but not other sound types. Currently the only thing that mutes voices also mutes most other game sounds, which I don't want to mute. It's just that the voice acting is so bad lol. 

The other complaint is pretty specific --
When in co-op and you're all picking equipment, people who are NOT currently picking are not able to right click on the equipment being viewed. The cards are darkened, not clickable, and not right-clickable until it's your turn. This can be frustrating because you can't really do much of a deep dive on the choices until it's your turn, which means you slow everyone down in the picking unnecessarily. If you don't already know what an item does, you're stuck twiddling your thumbs until you can actually right click on stuff. Cards should have the right click option in basically every single view, including this one. The right click on cards thing is a great feature and should be available everywhere for the sake of consistency.

As of writing this review, I have 36 hours of playtime and have finished the game for the 1st time on my 9th attempt. So on average you can expect to spend 3-5 hours on a run, depending on how far you progress and how much time you spend deckbuilding in towns.

The mechanics are similar to Darkest Dungeon, but with more of a deck building element and somewhat more of a story. You travel through a map where each node has some kind of event or encounter; in normal mode, these are not entirely random, but selected from a set of encounters for that node with varying probabilities (i.e. you have common events, ranging through to epic rarity). This makes each playthrough a little different, though fortunately when you've unlocked a certain encounter/event at a node, this is revealed to you in future playthroughs if it appears again (so you know what's there in advance). It feels a little like a Fighting Fantasy book/game, but without the unavoidable deadends. In Aot, I mostly die from being too greedy, as the game often allows you to make a fight harder, in exchange for higher rewards - proceed with caution! :D 

Unlike Darkest Dungeon, where new heroes just arrive, in AoT you must unlock new characters (as well as pets, items and cards for your deck, the latter of which are usually upgradeable). Unlocking these gives you a reason to keep playing, even once you've finished the game, especially because it can take several runs to work out *how* exactly a character or pet is unlocked. There is also a madness mode which you can unlock, which basically lets you customise the difficulty in exchange for potentially higher rewards. 

The bosses are challenging, but not impossible, and quite satisfying to beat, though I feel as much of the fun in the game is exploring the world as the deck building / grinding (I didn't find the final bosses hard, but they take a while).

Aesthetically, AtO is much brighter and less gothic than DD; I like the artstyle a lot, and the music is also quite cool.

To summarise, I think it's a great game if you like roguelikes or deckbuilders and I expect I'll continue playing as there's so much still for me to explore!",1663149734,1663149839,True,1,0,0.519999980926513672,0,True,False,False
1385380,122221715,76561198017653398,0,3,7085,0,3072,1697844232,"VERY good deck building game with a Rogue Like approach. It sucks You in, so suddenly You find You where playing for 5 hours straight and You need to go to best since it's 2 AM and a responsible adult should be sleeping 8 hours minimum.

I would brake the review to the following points:

+ Cool characters each with a fun twist to make them play unique
+ T-O-N-S of cards, almost all with two types of upgrades and even addition ""extra"" effects that are springled at random
+ Plethora of synergies to explore, much more deep and complex that Slay the Spire, more setup required to execute a combo, harder to get a one-trick-pony working out of only few cards
+ Various enemies to explore and prepare Yourself to face. Lot's of challanges. One area You can blitz and the next suddenly becomes hard as nails because You didn't prepare well enough for it. 
+ Very nice art style for the illustrations, maps, etc. Clear and colorful with some fun designs for some of the monsters (that frozen head squirrel)
+ Lot's of flexibility on how to configure Your party - wan't to run 3 tanks? Sure You can! All wizards party? Give it a go.

- Pretty difficult. Especially towards the start. It's a Rogue Like so YOU WILL DIE even sometimes before reaching a boss. Still this will take a significant ammount of time as runs are not as fast as in other games. This will be frustrating before You get a grasp on the mechanics/monsters/encounters/heroes/cards/upgrades/etc. It took me probably 20+ hours to even beat the 2nd boss and more than 35+ hours to beat the game on normal difficulty. It could be a little more approachable from the start.
- Status salad. There are a lot of status effects. Most of them are not hard to grasp. But the problem comes from the amount of them that are applied towards the end of the run. All characters will easily have 10+ status effects on them so it's very hard to track what is happening and what are You doing good/wrong. Statuses can also vary very much between stacking/not stacking effects, being percentage/value based, etc. AND on top of that are also special skills that are not status effects and can have a very complex structure like ""On hit, apply XYZ status, cast rain on all, grant energy, give card, etc. works 5 times"". I think to beat the game on normal there should be much less of this at least from the enemies perspective. 
- Starting town crafting should be revamped. You can more or less prepare nicely after the last run using some currency retention but it's generally not enough to fully equip the team with what You want. I think the common cards should be free to add to the deck and left the uncommon, rares etc. with a price to craft. This would not really make the game much easier but would enable the more experienced players to tailor the decks from the start to at least work how they want. 
-While the graphics are overall very nice, the sound and animations are quite lack luster. The animations are a little awkward and they just blip so quickly on the screen that You will soon just forget about them. It would be nice if they would be more snappy like the ones in Darkest Dungeon. I would like to feel the weight of a spectacular play more - for the stronger spells to be highlighted more, not just a quick blink and it's over. The same goes to sound, the music is VERY mediocre and I even sometimes turn it off and just run some fantasy music playlist from YT instead

* I think I would prefer to have an option to randomize the maps more. Sure there are ""fluffy"" regions that should stay where they are (like caves or extra dungeons) but it would be nice if the roads towards them are more randomized, so next run I can have a totally different encounter on the road towards the Wolf camp or different enemies. or maybe the road zigzags rather than being the standard 2-3 roads. At the moment the only random thing there is, is that some encounters may appear or may not - those are usually connected with quests to unlock something further down the road.

* Since runs are quite lengthy and You can get killed by one small decision at any point I think I would contrary to the usual Rogue Like approach prefer to have a Save Game option. Sure You can retry the current fight but I once had a very good party setup, good cards and was plowing through the whole game only to misunderstood how one artifact works that screwed my whole composition. If I could just revert that one point I'm 99% sure I would finish the run with a success.

Still a very entertaining game. In my opinion better than Slay the Spire although less approachable. Also played it fully in Single player if You would have friends to play this together with it would in my opinion only gain in appeal.",1663147845,1663147845,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There was something about the challenge/reward curve that didn't strike me as strongly as some other titles in the genre, which is why you won't see many hours accrued.

Because the combat features an RNG element, there would be times where I felt powerless to prevent one of my characters from, say, getting crippled.

The meta progression keeps things interesting... but I would say that the game is ""effectively"" impossible to beat on your first run, even if you're very skilled. You need some meta progression to win which feels a bit gamey. Most progression is tied to actions taken within the game itself so it's not just a stale ""leveling"" system. 

You actually have to set out to achieve certain goals when playing to unlock certain content. Additionally, the events are only semi-random. The same nodes always give one of three (sometimes four) events which I find really cool. Add's a lot of variety while also encouraging exploration.

the game can certinly be played alone however managing 4 different characters at once is quite a lot so multiplayer is how I would always recomend the game to be played.

The game itself has many different mechanics to work and play with and 12 seprate characters that interect with many of them. if however you just want to do it your way, the game just lets you completly wipe your starting deck every run and replace it.

+ great strategic depth, in fights, in planning your route, and in developing your characters to meet challenges
+ co-op is well implemented, makes a fun party game
+ difficulty scales well in a predictable manner. bosses are interesting and tough.
+ the variation even in 'campaign mode' makes the game highly replayable
+ glossary/tome is easily accessible in game and tells you 90% of what you need to know, though some interactions are unclear and some cards are missing?
+ barely any bugs I've found

- art style is hit and miss. some factions look cool or funny, others look kinda dorky, like the trees
- what is with this sound design? super cheap, like an online casino, and buggy sometimes. some factions make distractingly dumb noises (ex: dracomancer)
- animations need some love too
- the music was so bad I turned it off in the first 2 minutes of playing. you can find free playlists online that are way better

price is reasonable, because the gameplay is very solid. Devs: please allow sound/music mods?

Playing at first was slow and a bit overwhelming - there's a bunch of enemies to learn, on top of all the individual characters, cards, and status effects (and their interactions within each other). But with each failure, you learn how the game works and are able to get further on the back of your newly-found game knowledge, a hefty chest of gold and shards, and a little bit of luck early on. Soon, you're easily clearing what initially felt like BS, with your new favorite characters who fit your playstyle.

My main criticism of the game is that it feels like the most viable strategy for most combats is debuff stacking and turtling up, which isn't inherently a bad thing. Big number go brrrrrrrr. But it starts to feel like some other strategies that don't rely on hundreds of poison/bleed stacks fall off, as your direct damage often won't make a significant and consistent chunk into the boss's massive health bars.

It's got a significantly more prominent meta progression than something like Slay the Spire, and the campaign is long enough that it feels like you get to really watch your deck develop out longer-term than it would in, say, a 30 minute run. You also have significantly more control over it than most deckbuilders give you, which (to me) is a very welcome change - the town at the beginning of each act gives you a lot of control over how your deck is going to feel and look, while still leaving you limited enough that each potential card drop from an encounter is impactful.

It's not great feeling in the beginning, though - the vast majority of characters are locked, as are most of the cards, and you really need a few runs to have the perk points to get into the meta progress swing of things.

At first it felt kind of bad in comparison to what I loved and expected from Slay the Spire, but this game offers a very different experience that is just as enjoyable, if not more (because playing with friends is just more fun). 

The similarities stop at ""Roguelike Deckbuilder"". In Across the Obelisk, you have access to a team of 4 heroes in which you can split control over with up to 4 friends. Each hero has a general role that they excel at, healers will provide support and healing, warriors will take the frontline role and aid in shielding the team, mages and scouts can provide a mixture of damage and support. Although there are general class roles for each character, you can definitely mess around with fun concepts like dps healers and tanks.

I find the most engaging part of the game is the overall team and deck building experience. Although you do receive RNG card rewards, you can also edit your character's decks at the cost of gold and crystals in the starting town before you even take off on your journey. Your resources will start off lacking but through perk points, selling supply boxes, or chest rewards from previous runs you can gradually build yourself up to start with more and more resources each run, giving yourself a much stronger start. I often find myself spending a lot of my time just sitting in the starting town making sure I allocate my resources across the team as efficiently as possible because it is extremely rewarding to do so.

The overworld might seem boring at first as it is always exactly the same layout but it actually has a lot of depth to it and feels a lot like a DND campaign. Each node you go to has a variety of different options all of which affect future outcomes. You can pick an option at one node that rewards you with an item or quest that will be relevant in future nodes you come across. You can gain access to some game changing equipment through these options, so being aware of the choices you've made can be extremely beneficial to future runs.

My only gripe with this game is that it simultaneously feels like there is a lot of variety and no variety at all. There is a score system within the game that rewards you for beating encounters faster. In most cases you can only get the maximum reward bonus by beating an encounter within 1 or 2 rounds (more for bosses). Because of this, once you understand the basics of what makes a team excel at clearing encounters quickly, alot of the variety disappears. But don't be fooled, that doesn't mean you still can't mess around and have fun with meme comps.

All in all, Across the Obelisk is a very fun game to play with friends or alone. It stands out as its own unique experience amongst the plethora of roguelike deckbuilders, definitely worth a buy.",1662714643,1662714643,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Roguelite - Adventure/RPG mode is pretty fun, can be a little annoying trying to figure out how to unlock certain characters. Maybe 30-40h of content there if you unlock everything.

Absolutely not for everyone but oh man is it for me. There are SO many builds to go and so many more to discover. Each mechanic you encounter you'll say ""oh that's busted, lets make a comp around that"", and each one seems stronger than the last. Then you'll get so good at making comps, killing the final boss before he casts a special spell is a mark of quality. But it will take some time to get there. By the third run my friends and I got to the final boss but weren't able to beat it with that comp, but next run we smashed it. Each run takes about 2-3 hours and is autosaved every fight, so even with some of us having very tight schedules it's easy to plan to play. 

Can you beat the game on the first go? No, but yes. You are absolutely strong enough, but there is no way you would instinctively know what cards are best. How do I know? There is a mode that removes all of your rougelite upgrades and gives you way sh*ttier random decks in a draft-like mode, and my friends and I just beat it first try. You also can use any character regardless of unlocks so you can try out and look at their decks before you go unlock them.

Speaking of character unlocks, the grind for upgrades is fair and you see most of the cards by your fourth or fifth go around. It really depends on how far you get. And I personally like the process of exploring and unlocking characters. It is confusing at first to be fair. Overall AtO has way better paced upgrades than games like Rogue Legacy or Loop Hero.

This game is also a secret Warcraft loveletter. Well, somewhat secret. The first boss is called ""Yogger"" after all. But it goes much deeper. I bet most of the card design notes were ""Hey remember that time I Mortal Strike'd that druid so hard he uninstalled? Lets make that a card"", ""Hey remember when pyroblast was terrible? Lets make that a card"". The game does have its own identity, however.

Far too often I was encountering enemies that could not only outheal my dps but perpetually summon new enemies as well.  Losses would almost always feel completely one sided with no chance at all.

In the attempt I got the farthest there was a sudden dramatic spike in enemy strength that would just obliterate my team easily,  When I consider the lead up I don't see any solution to prepare for it, the starting difficulty just seems to be tuned to masochist mode.

The so called progression from perks and such was so minuscule that it really made no difference, even after dozens of runs I would still get easily wiped by something random in the first zone.

Finally, co-op mostly works well, and can be a lot of fun - but be aware that the netcode is twitchy (even after recent fixes) and may kick players out and cause you all to lose progress if someone has an unreliable connection.

Pros:
+ Fun deckbuilding and combat
+ Unlockable characters with very different styles that add much to replayability
+ Several paths with different events, again adding to replayability, because you'll want to see what's there
+ Combat is ""locally balanced"" - there's always an area where the fight is challanging and fun
+ Great graphics

Cons:
- Card/item unlocks happen randomly and very quickly, making them much less rewarding than they could have been
- Slow combat - eventually you realize the animations take too long and the combat just drags, which wouldn't be problem, but...
- It's not globally balanced at all - which will need a bit of explanation:

Over playthroughs, characters earn perk points which permanently improve them. The improvements are very substantial and turn characters into killing machines... in the given act. That... doesn't exactly ""add to replayability"", it forces you to replay. 

During your first playthroughs, you are going to get massacred in second act. The characters have no chance to get through until they buff up on perks. Then they become well balanced for second act, but the first one becomes boring. You rampage through monsters which usually don't manage to even hurt you. Then you beat the second boss and get massacred in third act and so on.

I consider this one a really bad design choice, because the initial acts can't be skipped and one has to go through them again and again and again to get to the fun part where the strengths are evenly matched. Part of first act can be skipped, but then again, you get to skip events that start quests or provide items for them, so you go through them in the end.

Still, while the above mentioned seriously irks me, the game had me playing repeatedly, unlocking characters, struggling to empower them enough to beat the boss and now that I've finally managed that, I have to say it was money very well spent.",1662404289,1662404289,True,1,0,0.502288341522216797,0,True,False,False

My second biggest beef is that the campaign isn't procedurally generated.  Although there is a mode for this, it doesn't have the same feeling (IMHO).  This is because all of the characters are already unlocked and what you have unlocked from the campaign and this mode is somehow a separate experience. 

My last biggest beef is that there just isn't enough hype about this game.  

This game can get really brutal and tough.  There are a lot of interesting points in the campaign that makes you think about how you proceed and not just spam your cards.  Adjustments in your deck and strategy is a must!  

I have to admit that at first I was fairly skeptical at the thought of multiplayer, but it absolutely works!  What you have unlocked is separated from what others have unlocked and of course the more you play, the more you are able to bring to the table.

What I don't understand are those simple things:

Why do my characters only have 3 starting energy when enemies dont use this mechanic????
Why does every enemy (including DPS ones) have 30% more HP than my tank with health upgrade equipment?
Why does the healer sucks so much?
Why do simple enemies have some overpowered bshit cards and why they spam it every turn without drawbacks? Example:
 
 - Deal 8 damage to everyone
 - 2 poison stacks
 - 2 hemorrhage stacks
 - Repeats 2 times (activates 3 times)

So with this ONE enemy from the opposite party (which mostly have 3 or 4 enemies in total) is dealing MASSIVE damage to your entire party for free and stacking absurd statuses, when you think it's over (it aint) its the other enemy turn, which does just the same or just kill your backline character for free, first they turn invisible with 3 stacks (+20% dmg per invi stack) and then they spam a backline attack which deals a lot of damage and status effects for free, like reduce speed or applying stacks of hunters mark (1 stack = +1 damage for free every time they hit him).

All of that in a single card, let's read one of my mage card, oh boi! cant wait!
 - 4 energy cost (to use this card you need to pass a turn with 1 energy at least)
 - 8 damage to every enemy
 - Applies 4 electric stack (deals 1 damage every time the enemy does an action to him and others around him).

The first boss sucks ass, spawns with 2 goons, summons them again if you kill them, heals/buffs a lot and if you lack dps your game is over because has an AoE attack that hits for ~15 dmg and stacks hemorrhage every 2 turns, another that slows and repeats 2 times and on top of that another one that stacks hemo and repeats.

Another nice touch I like is the fact there are quests and mini-stories built into the game. It gives it a very unique feel and makes each run feel a bit more like an adventure.

There are four archetypes each with 4 unique individuals to unlock, each individual has unique dialogue in certain situations which adds a lot of replayability.

It feels almost like a World of Warcraft dungeon simulator: You need a tank, a healer, and two DPS. As a long-time WoW fan and card game fan, I was delighted by this.

One big innovation here, and something I'd like to see other Roguelikes do as well, is, if you die, you can retry the fight. You can't go back to prior town or anything; so if the problem was something fundamental, you're not going to succeed. But it does let you recover from mistakes in a fight itself, and possibly eek out a victory even against long odds. Note that RNG seems to be fixed: If you play a fight exactly the same, you'll get the same random spells, random draws, etc.

I'm also a big fan of the large campaign map. There are lots of routes to try, lots of different quests to aim for. And one reason it works so well is the aforementioned ""retry fight"" feature. A huge campaign map might overstay its welcome if one mistake in the final boss fight sent you back to the start.

I'm also a big fan of the extra rewards for finishing a fight early. You're encouraged to be efficient with your time. You could drag every fight into an hour-long battle of attrition if you want, but do that and you loose out on significant rewards. The game rewards you for playing efficiently, but doesn't overly penalize you if you don't.

They have added tonnes to unlock, loads of progression, a nice amount of quests and events and more.
I was actually excited to unlock the character I liked the look of and killed our party on purpose so we could restart with them.

why you ask? well simple, some monster have a random attack card, and it always either hit the one withouth a shield, or the one with low healt, i feel like its not that random, or its just that i'm getting the worst luck known to man, for now it only happen, lets say an average of 9 times out of 10, which kinda make it easier because i know which charater its going to be hit by the random attack, and so make sure that it doesn't die. thank for staying through my ted talk. have a nice day, and buy the game! its really fun!

There's a LOT going on, and it does co-op perfectly. If you enjoy deck-building roguelites, table-top RPGs, Slay the Spire, Darkest Dungeon, Divinity: Original Sin, trust me and spend a risk-free 1 hour and 59 minutes to assess the game. You honestly won't regret it.

[h1]**Some minor spoilers follow.**[/h1]

My friend showed me this game, and we both agreed that it looked mostly unimpressive: ""another Darkest Dungeon and/or Slay the Spire clone"". But the promise of co-op sold us to try it. I am extremely glad we did. 22 hours in (on first edit), we've barely scratched the surface. It's impossible to discuss everything here, but I've done my best to provide a thorough overview.

[b]EDIT[/b]: After 120 hours, I'm still really enjoying it, and there's still a lot to see and do (different deck types and combinations; harder difficulties; collecting things).

[h1]WHAT IT DOES WELL[/h1]
[b]Co-op:[/b]
Firstly,  the co-op works beautifully. We've never had a single connection or lag issue, and we're playing across continents. It's flawless--really some of the best net code I've ever experienced.

[b]Content/Delivery[/b]
There is a lot to see and do, and the devs are very active and responsive. Apparently there is more (free) content to come (additional mini--locations and a full combat log). I'd personally love to see any DLC for more maps/worlds/characters. Very exciting.

[b]Art[/b]
I wasn't much of a fan of the art style at first glance, but it really grew on me. I really quite like the art now, and it's all hand-drawn, which is a nice bonus. Each character has 3 skins (basic + 2 unlocked), which is a really nice touch.

[b]Classes[/b]
At the time of writing, there are four classes, for which there are 4 characters (total 16 characters) Each class has one (quite large) pool of cards available only to that respective class. You begin the game with one character from each class unlocked. Characters have different intrinsic traits, statistics and a choice of two bonuses per level-up (level 5 is the max level).

Although the pool of class cards are the same, each character begins with very different decks and play refreshingly differently. Characters are designed to promote two archetypes, but you can run anything. You unlock new characters (and other character-like stuff that I won't spoil) by completing quests while playing. The characters each have a personality, which is done fairly well, but there are some (unintended) comical motifs (""BTW, I'm a wolf."").

[b]Branching/routing/events[/b]
There are 5 maps (worlds) split across 4 acts. You visit 4/5 each run, and you can always choose where to go and in what order, but the first and last acts are always the same map. Each map has a number of different nodes with both random and determinable events/combats. Each node will typically have multiple choices (some bound to specific characters who you may or may not have in your party), and decisions in certain nodes will affect certain other nodes (in multiple ways) as you progress. Some choices involve (optional) individual or party checks (think DnD dice rolls but with cards) that impact the outcome.

[b]Deck archetypes[/b]
Boy. There are a lot of different options for each class and character. Want your healer class to be your carry instead? Sure. Want your tank to bludgeon everything to death instead? Sure. Want your mage to be a full support class instead? Sure. You can compose your party and build them how you like. You can also alter each characters' starting decks and perks (a bonus-providing tree, e.g., spending a point so when you block, you block one more). Resetting points is free and easy, but you can only configure all perks when creating your party, but you may change non-resource perks in the first town (very nice addition).

[b]Replayability[/b]
[i]Extremely[/i] replayable. 120 hours in, and the game is still an absolute joy to play: lots of deck and class combinations I still want to try. There are 16 level of Madness (hard mode), and I'm on level 10. Superb stuff.

[b]Music/SFX[/b]
At first I didn't really hear the music because I was concentrating/talking to my friend, but the music tracks are consistent bops. No wonder folks are asking for YouTube links/track names on Discord. The sound effects are really well done. Everything audible is fantastic, with exception to some of the ""voice-acting"" (which is a suitability rather than quality issue--see below).

[h1]WHAT IT DOES OK[/h1]
[b]Complexity[/b]
This game has a LOT of effects/keywords. My friend and I absolutely adore this, but I also understand how overwhelming it could be for some. If you're uncomfortable with how many effects, interactions and statistics there are in Slay the Spire or Darkest Dungeon, there are probably at least triple the number here. At first glance, it seems like a difficult and complex system, but it really doesn't take long to pick up, and adds to the fun and strategy exquisitely. It's very similar to the Divinity games; e.g., wet extinguishes the burning ailment, but it also increases lightning damage...

[b]Meta progression[/b]
Personally, I like meta progression, but I placed the category here because it's an issue of extreme controversy. I think the game's progression feels good, but for those who do dislike it, I am unaware of an ""unlock everything"" button. Consequently, you are almost guaranteed to fail your first run(s) (the difficulty ramps up very quickly in each act).

Meta progression exists in a few forms: card unlocks, town upgrades (e.g., shop item rarity, price to remove/upgrade/buy cards) and character perks. The latter allows you to customise and fine tune your character for exactly the role you want to fulfil. You also bank a % of your gold and shards (card buying/crafting/upgrading currency) after each run, and you can use up to three banked caches when you start a new game (this is removed in the harder game modes). This means if you do three good runs and bank a bunch of shards, you can craft a strong backbone of the deck you want in the starting location.

[b]Randomness[/b]
I know some folks still suffer lingering trauma from their Hearthstone days, but I think some randomness is necessary (and fun!) for the roguelite/card game genre. Here, you occasionally feel really punished. But then you also often feel really rewarded--it mostly evens out nicely. There are cards that select a random target (in the default decks also), but those cards are easily removed/changed. However, in the later acts/harder difficulties, it does happen that the enemy will 100 to 0 a character before they even get to act. Some of this is preventable (equipment), but still can and does feel bad.

[b]Lore[/b]
The choices and interactions are interesting, and there are definitely some good ideas there. But sometimes the writing is very typical and follows uninspired tropes of the fantasy genre. There were some copy-editing issues that have been resolved since the first edit (thanks, devs!). However, the writing is still definitely not the game's strongest point: it's often too direct--a little laborious and lacking subtext.

[h1]WHAT IT DOES POORLY[/h1]
[b]Voice acting[/b]
The character grunts (attacking, damaged, etc.) have little to no variation (and can repeat multiple times in sequence, to both humorous and annoying effect). Moreover, some sounds just don't fit the character. For instance, the starting warrior (tank/bruiser) is a big muscly male werewolf, and the voice acting just doesn't capture that. I just wish for more variety and more fitting voices for some of the characters.",1661309942,1662210744,True,71,0,0.869036674499511719,2,True,False,False

(+) While cards are broken into tiers (Uncommon, Rare, Epic, etc), they don't correlate to them — the same card may have a rare and epic version, not to mention upgrades, sidegrades, and corrupted cards that are stronger than normal. This very much prevents deckbuilding from going stale — the same card may be mediocre as an uncommon but become strong as a rare, and different upgrades change how they play — so you don't fall into a pattern of always picking the same cards. A very flexible, if unusual, approach to card variety (I don't think I've seen different rarities for the same card in any deckbuilder).

(+) In most battles, you can agree to a modifier (that may sometimes makes said battle prohibitively hard — pay attention!) for an additional reward. Your rewards also change based on how quickly you win, which is a great way to stop players from prolonging battles endlessly for a full heal (an optimal, but extremely unfun strategy in some games).

(+) The exploration and unlocks are done really well! The world you explore isn't that big, but various events (that again may spawn in different rarities) allow you to grab items to use elsewhere during this run. These small quest chains are your main way to unlock new characters and pets. You can always at least guess where an item can be used or what a character wants from you since the world makes logical sense. It's very fun and adds incentive to thread different paths through this world.

(?) The number of modifiers is ungodly, and you have damage types, buffs, and resistances, meaning that cards don't deal the precise damage written on them — it's modified. This is a robust system — way too robust, perhaps, but it provides fertile ground to explore class synergies as you can spec several heroes to specialize in the same type of damage, boosting each other... (until you meet enemies immune to this type, of course) But keeping track of all modifiers is a pain.

(?) The setting is bog-standard, but that's all right for a game of this genre.

There's a good amount a variability per-run, yet the abililty to purchase limited quantities of most cards allows you to commit to a general strategy at the start of a run without being super rng-dependant.

There are a wide variety of characters and playstyles available. Each character has multiple builds and playstyles they can pursue effectively. Each type of damage has it's unique flavor and synergies, and generally, most things feel viable in some context.

Additionally, the world is fun to explore. There's a bit of randomness in each run, but also set locations and events that unlock new characters, pets, or give unique rewards that support certain playstyles. For instance, I know that a certain path will reward a bleed-chill synergy item that is a VERY powerful way to reduce ice resistance. I can plan my route, team comp, and decks to make sure I'm stacking all the cards just right to produce limited determinism in my run. At the same time, I can't plan to overload my deck with the rarest and most powerful cards, and there are plenty of powerful items that don't have a deterministic way to acquire, so I have to take the opportunities presented when I'm lucky enough to come across them.

I'd say it's superficially similar to Slay the Spire and Monster Train but if you're looking for something that's like those outside of JUST building a deck this is likely not going to scratch that itch.

It plays the same way as many of these games. You get a map, you go from node to node dealing with events or fights. After a fight you draw new cards and/or upgrade your cards. There are a total of 6 maps in the game and you go through 5 per playthrough. Each area has characters to unlock which are effectively quests that will help to define your run. And change your future runs!
They also have a town where you can buy new cards/remove cards/upgrade cards. This is a new mechanic for me and it's an interesting one. The town can be upgraded too which adds another level of meta progression.

And talking of Meta progression after each run you earn perks to spend on upgrading your characters overall abilities. Buffing their skill with specific magic (usually towards whatever specialisation that character has), or their health or ability to heal or etc. When you gain perks every character does, even ones you don't use.
They level within the run (there's 5 levels, with different abilities that change how your character plays) and also outside through use where that can unlock different skins and etc. This rewards you for using characters but also doesn't mean characters you never use are worthless.

You have four class Archetypes - Warrior, Scout, Mage and Cleric. Each archetype has a deck. Then each one has four characters within it that focus on a specific part of that deck. Zek the mage uses Darkness related mage cards, Wilbur the mage uses Lightning related mage cards. Heiner the Warrior uses Defence related Warrior cards, Bree the Warrior uses Thorns related Warrior cards.
While those characters will be able to draw cards from the ENTIRE deck of the archetype they have their specific focus and their level up abilities will focus on the cards they're 'meant' to be using. It means they've got their own character but you can still use your favourite cards from that deck if you so wish.

I absolutely loved this method of play. It allows you to experiment within each archetype's deck but in a curated way. I can be a Lightning mage and have this supported and promoted by the game. It helps that you don't have to take one of each archetype - if you wish you could make a party of all warriors. Or do what I did and go Healer, Mage, Mage, Warrior.

This leads to the biggest issue I have with the game. Some of the characters specialisations have very few cards. Bree focuses on Thorns and there's only a very limited amount of thorns cards and it can be frustrating having draw after draw without cards that are useful to your particular character. That can also encourage you to water down your deck, perhaps it's on purpose.

Overall this approach works pretty well for me. I enjoyed the choices I had, the difference in play it created and the chance to have a ""goal"" of unlocking characters for each run.
I'm not a player that just wants to do it over and over with different difficulty modifiers so the extra characters gave me something to do.

30 hours in total to beat the last boss for me then 35 in total to unlock everyone. I will say I had to look at a guide for two of the characters - what you need to do with some isn't an easy guess, or easy to plan for.",1662018308,1662018308,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is great deckbuilding at the heart of the game and excellent progression and RPG elements to complement it. The fact that it is 4-player co-op puts this game in a class of its own among deckbuilders. 

The game is a little complicated to learn - there are something like ~20 conditions/statuses that can be applied to characters/enemies, which can be daunting. There are obvious signs of a small team, such as poor VFX, SFX, and animation. Fans of Darkest Dungeon will sorely miss the 'punchiness' of that game. A very poor plot, but none of these things are essential for the game to succeed, nor are they truly detrimental to enjoying the heart of the game.

Some of these points will be pros for others, but to me they're cons.
-Overly complicated: Countless buffs and debuffs, Too many damage types. 
-Setting up a game: I don't want to spend 10+ minutes figuring out what cards I want to craft at the start of a run. I just want to hop in and play and build a deck as I go. I fully recognize this is great for some, but for me it turns this game into a slog.
-Tank is near useless outside of group wide defense. It seems like every fight after the first zone is just a constant spam of aoe damage. I had a stealthed unit with 70% health die just from aoe. 
-Downside to cards: Too many good cards come with a downside. Good cards can already seem overpriced, having them also come with a negative effect just makes me not want to use them.
-Healer is pigeonholed into healing. Good luck trying to mix in some damage with your healer, you'll be too busy trying to keep health up from all of the previously mentioned aoe damage.
-Getting currency from previous runs. I thought this was nice at first, but then I quickly realized that if you aren't stacking chests from multiple runs you can quickly fall behind. Makes it feel like you're only supposed to try every 4 runs. 


I don't regret getting the game. I put almost 20 hours into it. Was fun enough to try but I have no desire to keep playing.

Tons of customization, you can craft new cards before setting out, remove others, upgrade, or buy card packs for the run. It has a bit of a learning curve because theres so much available, but for fans of the genre its amazing. Its sort of a mix of slay the spire and darkest dungeon; while it doesn't have the multiple floors from demon train, it expands their efforts to make every hero have multiple builds. I've been obsessed with it these last two weeks since I got it. Story tone is pretty run of the mill. I like that relics have become equipment; that introduces limits or makes you choose between them rather than just trying to accumulate every one you can find. I just got through the game a couple days ago and have been struggling with madness but I'm getting better all the time. I enjoy in the story mode how you can engage or avoid many minibosses, which I guess isn't full roguelike, though there are more flexible nodes which can have different events.

PROS:
Wide variety of characters and build paths
Exploration of world fuels unlocking characters, items, pets, and cards
Huge amount of monster variety

CONS:
Repetitive bosses - helped by madness levels significantly changing play patterns but still the same boss.
Default mode allowing crafting/removal regularly reduces ""roguelite"" aspects significantly as optimal builds emerge rather swiftly with little variety (made up for by sheer number of charcters, and at higher madness DOES become more limited).

Will never play this game ever again. You need to store progress per round of combat in an online multiplayer game, literally unacceptable that this isn't implemented.

It's fun. Very fun. I like it a lot.

I feel like a number of negative reviews I saw were upset that it's not just ""Slay the spire but with 4 decks."" It's not, and it's not trying to be. Below are my thoughts on negative reviews I saw on launch, and how I feel about their sentiments.

One review I saw said ""it feels like shit to build a bleed deck and come across enemies immune to bleed!"", among others lamenting that enemies have resistances and immunities. This is another way the game is not StS -- you can all-in a deck into one damage type if you want, but you're going to have to build either that character's deck or another party member's deck to compensate for when you run into their inevitable weaknesses. That's the game.

Another review I saw complained that ""block falls off at the start of every new round, and tanks have slow speed, so they never wind up blocking anything when they go after everything and all the enemies deal their damage."" Had they bothered to look at this system a bit more, they'd see there are tools to work around this. I prioritize speed on all my tanks precisely because of this, from held items to utility cards on themselves and their party members. Not to mention there are cards that apply a status that preserves block until the next round, as well as a delayed-block resource from many sources that applies block at the start of a following round.

Lastly, ""there are too many different buffs and debuffs. It's bloated and hard to follow."" To that I say, if you've ever played pokemon, or have an elementary understanding of how elements work, I don't know how you could have trouble interpreting that water increases electric damage received, or that adding fire to more fire will make even more fire. I will concede to the one negative review I saw pointing out that, seemingly arbitrarily, poisons deal their damage at the end of a character's turn and bleeds do it at the beginning. That part I don't quite understand the implementation of, but it hasn't bothered me all too much.

What you've got here is an extremely unique deckbuilder based around 4 classes, each with four characters that can excel at two archetypes within their class (or a mix thereof, or even borrowing elements from outside their archetype binary if you build your deck smart enough). All classes are capable of some mix of offense, defense, and utility, and it has been a lot of fun thus far to experiment with all the different combinations you can make within even just one party configuration.

The deckbuilder staples are still there: manage your resources, keep a deck that can keep cycling through the good cards, look for synergies, get your builds enhanced or outright enabled by held item pickups, etc etc etc. If you're even somewhat interested, I highly, *highly* recommend AtO.

This game brings aspects from both and creates a whole new experience. It incorporates a level of coop play that I haven't seen before in a game like this. It took over 40 hours of play without looking things up to finally get all the characters unlocked and I still don't have all the pets unlocked yet. You can easily play through the game blind and have different experiences every time. The different variables per run consist of character choice, equipment, pets, perks, traits chosen, and a whole lot of RNG. Not only due those factors change the play, but each run may generate different events to happen. 
I am a huge fan of anime and games that reference different animes. This game references a few that I know of so far consisting of: That Time I was Reincarnated as a Slime, Pokemon, and Re:Zero. It's been a fantastic surprise every time I get a chance to encounter one. Not only is this game just out of early release, but the devs already have concrete plans to expand the game even further. There will be more sub-zones within the different zones. Hopefully they also have plans for a whole new suit of characters to play as and perhaps a whole new class of character. That would be awesome!
Madness levels can be very cruel, but ultimately a great experience and a lot of fun. Once you work out who to pick, how to combo, and what builds work best per deck per character the game without madness levels gets very easy. This is nice for unlocking things and cultivates a welcoming experience for new players but also allows veteran players to progressively enjoy more difficult and immersive experiences. Madness levels allow more corrupt items and cards to be found which can be very powerful. 
In the end, I haven't enjoyed a game as much as this one is very very long time. I usually get bored of a game after 40-50 hours and not touch it again for some time, but this game has got its hooks in me. I've played 76 hours in only a week or so and I plan to dump a lot more into it especially when playing with a friend or two. 
I hope this game blows up and gets a lot of attention. Not only does it deserve it, especially for the price to value ratio, but you can really tell the devs put a lot of love and work into the mechanics, pay a lot of attention to the fans and fix things quickly, have a creative attention for detail, and made a very spicy game that anyone can enjoy. 
Runs can take a while, 3-6 hours a while, but are very worth it. I've spent a few nights up until 2 am finishing a run and then not being able to sleep afterwards because I was too busy thinking about the next run to come. Please snag this game even if it isn't on sale. $20 couldn't be more of a steal for what it is. It's easily a 40+ dollar game. This means the devs are practically giving it away. The best part is they aren't giving us a half-assed game like most game developers now of days. They are giving a complete game and expansions for free as far as I know. Even if they did charge for expansions, that is just what they would be expansions and not a part of the game that should have been there from the start. DLC would be 100% worth the money.

There is a lot to appreciate about this game: just an incredible amount of depth and possibility, an elaboration on the formula in slay the spire, adding nested levels of complexity to it. If you're a slay the spire veteran looking to put a hundred or more hours into this game in order to see what it's got, you will absolutely love it. And my hats off to the people who can play this on upper madness levels... 

The difficulty on the game is overtuned and the play through time is a bit on the long side. The difficulty really doesn't cater to beginners; so many systems and interactions have to be internalized before hard difficulty walls become navigable.  That said, there are so many different secrets and angles that the world gives itself to exploration.  does not cater to anything shy of an elite player base who has a lot of time to throw at it.

A deckbuilder similar to Slay the Spire, but you have a party of four adventurers in any combination of 16 characters of 4 different classes, each with their own unique specialties. Journey across a typical fantasy land with just enough of a plot while fighting monsters, grabbing new cards for your deck(s), grabbing some equipment along the way, and maybe stopping to do a side-quest or two along the way. It's a pretty solid experience all around.

But the thing that elevates this game, that makes it stand out, is that it's co-op for up to four people, each person able to play a single character. It's perfectly playable solo, but this *makes* the game imo. Having to only concern yourself with one deck to build instead of four makes the game quite a bit more digestible, turns don't take *too* long, and outside of combat everyone gets to vote on options in terms of where to go and what option to pick for events, with decisions being made by having each player draw the top card from their deck to either get a high or low card, players taking turns deciding which over the course of the game.

Bosses can be challenging, but between out of game meta-progression and experience, you'll quickly go from being hopeless in certain fights to acing them with no damage in a matter of runs, RNG permitting. Just don't fill your deck with crap or too much stuff, and you should do just fine. It's satisfying overcoming a boss that early on felt insurmountable, and when draws the one card they need to clutch a round with heals, shields, or *just* the right amount of damage you can't help but get excited.",1661834501,1661834501,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There is some minor balancing issues, but those are present in most games - especially early on. Nothing major. If you enjoy Rogue-Lite, as well as deckbuilding and RPGs, the game is likely worth your money.

It is also an EXCELLENT Coop experience, which is rare. Your group always consists of 4 characters. You can play alone, or with up to 4 players. So you can control any amount of 1-4 characters personally. While playing alone gives you total control, playing with friends is a load of fun, and also lets you focus more on what your character(s) can do in the grand sheme of things, making you less prone to mistakes.

True, friends bring more fun to every game, but in this case they also bring some really practical improvements to the play experience.

AtO is a very complex game. Handling four characters and their individual decks all at once while watching for dozens of debuff types, enemy resistance profiles, and piles of actions and damage flying all over the place each round all combine to make it a test as a single-player game, at least initially (more power to you if you take the dive solo, you can do it). For me, it really helps to have more players, both in figuring out how to weave through the combat and in focusing your deck building on fewer decks.

The art is great; the music is fine, if a bit short for looping (the town song gets stuck in my head in not a good way). The UI is stellar, particularly in multiplayer: it has emotes for targeting and heal requests, signals for players ready to advance, conflict resolution for quest/path decisions -- even without voice, it feels like co-op could still work.

With friends on voice, it's a blast; all the twists and turns of a Slay the Spire run with others on board to cheer as attacks hit home or lament as plans fail miserably.

Heavily inspired by slay the spire (even the title gives it homage), I find this game to be much deeper and have many more viable strategies than StS. I'm impressed with how different the characters feel, and how fun and entertaining the random events are. Most characters have at least 2 viable builds to use, and the different zones have unique enemies and strategies which all blend to make an excellent game which is very replayable. Add in the dash of multiplayer and I don't see myself ever feeling the need to go back to other roguelike deckbuilders

My major criticisms of the game are all minor, mainly having to do with certain underutilized strategies and classes. These aren't deal breakers, but more of disappointment and potential for further gameplay development.

1. I find that ice and electricity are under supported damage types. Fire has representation in both the support and warrior decks, why not those two? Nezglekt 'has ice damage' but there are no cards in the support roster to make that a viable archetype for him to pursue. Even Zek who is the 'ice mage' doesn't really become an ice mage until level four. Magnus has a single card you can take which gives you electricity, but no other class besides mage has any cards to make use of it. Compare that to fire, poison, dark, mental, poison, bleed and physical damage types which have synergies across multiple classes with the support in the card roster and abilities on characters to make use of them.

2. The warrior class in general feels under-explored compared to the other classes. With grukli a notable exception, Bree, Heiner, and Magnus all play the same when performing frontline duties. While each of these also has a damage build associated with them which can lend diversity to gameplay, frontliners are very clearly supposed to be tanky and survivable (many cards target the front hero). There isn't really a difference between any of the warriors when doing this, as it seems to just devolve to stacking block on top of them. This either means that Otis or the warrior must do that, and it limits creativity. I would like to see some diversity in how this is performed so the class can be fresher (i.e. abilities on magnus that reduce damage taken so that block isn't as vital and healing his health back is viable)

Pros:
- The progression in acquiring combinations of heroes, cards, items, and ""perks"" (the talent tree), does a great job in providing variety and keeping gameplay fresh.
- I haven't played online multiplayer yet, but couch co-op is fun. It's not officially supported, but you can hook up two mice and just swap turns very conveniently.
- It takes a little time to understand where everything is, but once you're there the battle UI is well laid out, providing all the info you need conveniently - buffs, debuffs, turn order, enchantment effects, item procs, etc.

Biggest con:
- The game expects you to tailor your team to matchups, and you can be punished with pretty quick deaths or grueling long matches if you make a mistake. It doesn't, however, do a great job at giving you information that you've already learned about monsters / items. E.G. if you've seen a monster before, there should be a beastiary you can use to look up all of their resists, attacks, etc. When you enter a new zone, or start a new battle, you should be able to give yourself a quick refresher. If you've seen an item before, you should be able to see how you acquired it, so you can execute on building out your synergies. [1] This is especially crucial, because the game doesn't let you change your talents after the first town. Conversely, I don't like how the game reveals cards, items, etc before they are unlocked. Learning the potential for synergies is fun. The sweet spot, IMO, is hide the information until you learn it, then make it easily accessible in any context.

Pros:
+ Party-based deck-building rouge-lite.

- Tedious deck crafting to start the game. Decks can be saved, but this is marginally useful unless all cards and town upgrades have been unlocked.
- Opaque dialog choices with unpredictable outcomes.
- Easy to make unrecoverable mistakes such as going the wrong direction on the map or abandoning upgrade / reward screens.

Enemies seem to be able to spam out status effects constantly, and I have yet to unlock any cards that generically deal with the constant barrage of DoT. I've found a small few that can deal with specifically one or the other, but nothing with the 'Dispel' tag that enemies seem to have easy access too. Maybe it's because I don't have any of the meta upgrades, maybe it's because I don't have cards unlocked, maybe it's because I don't have much experience, but every combat feels extremely unfair and turns into an incredibly long slog. This is only compounded by the fact that the monsters quickly get resistances of over 30% in most areas, and a monster being 'weak' to a certain kind of attack quickly becomes 'oh, they ONLY have 15% resistance to that!'.

I want to like this game so much. It has so many things that I do actually really like. But the lack of information on many mechanics (like card tags), the inability to even set the game to a lower difficulty while learning the ins-and-outs, and the overall frustration I felt just trying to figure out how to even start designing my character's decks just added up to a very poor initial experience.

I'd like to keep playing, to try and learn this, because I feel like I could love this game if only I got to know what I was doing and how to work with it.

Every char has is own deck and cards to choose from, some have damage, some have heal, some have block, and it end up being a party efford to take down enemy parties, and not just 1 guy doing all the work.
Gameplay wise, the Multiplayer COOP mostly just split the control of the party, and nothing more, but (almost) every choise made in the game, the players can vote on what option to take, and the game randomes who gets to choose. 
The interface could be a little better, like when hovering enemy actions, it should show the effects, and hovinger end turn should show the effect of all enemy moves, but besides that, it's pretty flawless.

I had initially skipped this game in my steam queues because I had just sunk a decent chunk of my life into Slay The Spire and didn't want another succubus of a game that was probably just a clone of a great and famous game.

I circled back around to it once I saw the multi-player streamed and boy was I ever wrong about this one. It's incredible.

I had a great experience with Roguebook as well which also takes a more RPG-ish approach to the well-established rogue-lite card battler core mechanics. In this take, they give such an incredible variety of cards it's viable to build in a lot of different ways. Make a slim consistent deck of powerful cards or a huge library of spells with card draw & demonic tutor-esque utility; both work. With over 550 cards to unlock, each of the four classes shining in 4 different ways each depending on character choice, saying that this game has customization and replayability is an understatement.

The risk reward and choice-making in playthroughs is also refreshing. The meta-progress feels similar to Rogue Legacy where there's so many upgrades to achieve that it feels exciting to try that next run with boosted stats. The ability to stack 3 chests of rewards also gives some interesting incentives to start the game differently each time. You may opt to play 3 rounds in a row with just the starting gold and crystals to try and stack up a huge run.

I gorged myself on this game over a school break and feel like there's so much content to yet discover after 50 solid hours of game-play.

The combat system is frustrating, as having such a variance of damage types (nine different types, not including status effect damage) makes it hard to build a consistent deck that does what you want it to do.  

This is combined with the fact that, past the first area, enemies are considerably more powerful than you. Each enemy is getting a minimum of 3 actions each (of which each of their actions does considerably more than yours does) while you will average 1-2 actions per turn, of which a considerable amount of effort goes into defending. This makes the action grind to a halt, as you are desperately trying to fend off their assault while slowly plinking away at them. Combat just takes way too long. 

That difference slowly erodes over time, but on average, a 40 minute-plus run might allow you to go 1-2 nodes farther the next time, assuming no bad luck happens. This slow progression really kills my interest in the game. 

This is where this game really pales in contrast to its inspirations: both Darkest Dungeon and Slay the Spire can be beaten the very first time you go through them. Unlikely, but possible. Due to how this game is set up, I would say that not only is such a feat not possible in this game, it would probably take dozens of runs to even be in a scenario where beating the game is feasible. Actual progress is so incremental that it just feels unsatisfying.

If the gameplay loop can become more efficient/quick (maybe by simplifying the combat a bit), and the overall progression a bit more rewarding, this game might be something awesome. As it stands right now, I would say its only for people desperate for this kind of game.",1661645279,1661645279,False,4,0,0.468346655368804932,2,True,False,False

The game all but requires you to stack tons of buffs and debuffs on yourself and enemies in order to stack and multiply your damage. Often these are done with cards that ""vanish"" after playing. Then it gives you enemies that just outright steal your buffs or dispel your buffs and debuffs, and now that your cards are gone, you can't get them back. The final boss does this repeatedly.

Add onto this that the runs take hours to get through because most fights are a big slog and there are 4 big maps to get through before the final map.

- Why do you have to unlock cards just to make the game playable? Your first run of this is going to be painful since you can't customise a decent deck at the starting town, but then you unlock a third of the library more or less immediately?

One mental shift I had to overcome was the difference in how long it takes to complete a run.  StS I was going 45 minutes to an hour for a run, but here I'm looking at twice that time.  It makes it slightly less approachable for the way I play games, but it's not a bad thing.  You can always quit and come back to a run.  

That being said there are a number of systems and it was overwhelming at first, but once I got through a few runs it made a lot more sense and the progression curve was nice and smooth.  There is still a number of characters to unlock and cards to see and toy with, but I have enjoyed the fact that my particular way of enjoying these types of games (defensive, passive damage) is more than viable.  

I recommend the game if you enjoy StS.  The D&D aspects don't hit the same way for me, but they are a nice change of pace and add to the game.  They don't, however, feel they do a great job of simulating a tabletop experience.

Nice to experience but probably not worth more than $10.

It is very much a rogue-lite where you have to run multiple runs before you get to start experiencing the game at a fair level.

And because the options for deck building/manipulation are so large and the RNG is low it's quite easy to metagame everything.

Also, most of the enemies are just health bars with different stats so all the player needs to do is identify which one is the biggest threat and kill that enemy first (the player doesn't need to adapt/change their playstyle in any situation, and if they lost it's probably due to a direct damage counter or lack of stats).",1661577508,1661582153,True,1,0,0.510030567646026611,0,True,False,False

At first I didn't vibe with this game. It felt too complex and I didn't realise how all the pieces work. After a couple of runs though, things begun to click into place. Systems started to interact and the way they do feels very rewarding.

I can't emphasise enough that this game really is worth the price. There's a ton of replayability and so much build variety with the amount of characters and different team comps allow for wildly different runs. It's also multiplayer! Which is such a big deal that I felt I needed to include it in this review. Oddly enough the game feels fun with or without multiplayer; the latter just adds a new experience as you chat with your friends.

Battles take way, way, way too long. Oftentimes, you are way ahead and slowly killing enemy units, and even though you've created an inevitable game state, you have to play it out for another 10-15 minutes in mindless tedium. Enemies are far too reliant on absurd HP values, insane amounts of defensive buffs, healing, and summoning.

Most of the cards you are offered during a playthrough are incompatible with your deck. Many cards require a chain of other cards to be played first in order to use their effects. Even if your RNG is good enough for you to assemble such a synergistic deck, the effects often aren't worth it.

This is definitely a game that isn't designed to be fun until you have played for a long time. After enough failed runs, your characters will be stronger and perhaps the later battles will only take 19 minutes instead of 20 minutes.

Some of you are going to say ""but it's a roguelike!"" Yes, but perhaps roguelikes don't lend themselves to this style of game. At least not when the progression metric is an occasional ""+1 damage"" while enemies scale to 5x or 10x in HP and defenses. Oh, and did I mention resistances? Have fun playing a physically-oriented character, because before long, every enemy in the game starts to have 50-85% resistance to your attacks. Now that ""+1 damage perk"" is just +0.15 damage.

Pros:
- Multiplayer

Cons:
- Enemies are too tanky; battles take too long
- Enemy decks are strong and consistent (to an annoying degree). Hero decks always feel clunky and unoptimized.
- Visual communication is poor (too many buffs/debuffs; combat happens at blinding speed even on a slow setting; you spend a lot of time thinking ""What the hell just happened"" when your party is wiped out.
- Roguelike progression is too limited.
- Enemies are uninteresting. They all just spam resistances/heals/buffs/summons over and over while you slowly whittle them down.",1661531200,1661531200,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

This game is chaos, random is everywhere - in battles (9 types of resistance, many buffs and debuffs, good luck with randomly drawn hands and deck to face same party of four but with 1) bigger resistance 2) stable drawn cards 3) probably better synergy than you) and on map (some events are randomly appearing, making planning less helpful, you can obviously lose any roll which is not 100% and fail run due to it, hidden path require experience/farming/guide to find out)
Add to that chaos in multiplayer, when one of four players each probably could be ***holes and act in a way which dangers everybody else in party.
Deckbuilding aspect tries to say ""I'm good"" by allowing to build your own deck from start, but for that you need to farm. Also deck is minimum 15 cards and depending on rarity they are limited in numbers, so no infinites or spams for you. Even more, some items are limited in number of activations per turn/battle, making them them less desirable than possible.
Even as long-time player I see how I need to farm and learn a lot to survive new mechanics and crazy final act with powerful enemies. I don't see how newbie who just bought the game would understand mechanics fast and they need to understand that they need to farm, farm a lot in this game to have a little leverage which could not even work in their favor because of random.
In current state game is enjoyable in artistic and even some gameplay sense, but, again, it's CHAOS, it's FARMFEST and without friends to play with, this game is much less appealing to go and try to get as much achievements as possible.",1661502505,1661502505,False,0,0,0.436507940292358398,0,True,False,False

Playing the solo adventure and customizing your teams is really fun. On top of that, you can play with friends and each control a character or 2. The coop games are long, but can be really fun (and sometimes annoying) discussing which paths to take, which items to get, and what cards to play.

I'm sorry, but effects like ""takes 1% more fire damage"" are not exciting. You're bombarded by 90 different icons, damage types, and status effects in the first few fights of the game.  Some people will be into that... but I find the whole thing to be hilariously overdesigned. 

There's also still a huge difficulty spike after the 1st boss, which we beat pretty easily on our 2nd run. Where we didn't struggle at all against the boss, the 1st combat encounter completely destroyed us.

This is an ALMOST recommend game for me. The game seems like it has potential, but seems a bit overcomplicated.

Pros:
- Coop is a neat concept and works well. Joining is unintuitive (I couldn't just click the ""Play"" on the steam invite), but once you're in it seemed to work flawlessly. 
- Art is fairly nice and polished (though honestly the ""fantasy trope"" style is kinda overdone, especially on the ""busty female sorceress"" character)
- Has some cool roleplaying concepts, like using the values of cards from each character's deck to determine successes/fails
- No bugs that I ran into

Cons:
- Overdesigned combat system. It's honestly overwhelming. There are 9 (maybe more?) different damage types and a billion different statuses. Each enemy has varied resistances to the various damage types (whcih you can only see by clicking on them and looking at a table). Some of the status effects are things like ""Deal 1% more cold damage per stack"", and you're likely stacking like 6% before it gets cleared, which amounts to a few cards MAYBE dealing 1 extra damage. I'll admit that some people may love this, and in theory it would encourage your whole party to try and synergize a bit, but in the few coop playthroughs I did, we rarely got shared damage types across the characters, and with each run unlocking 15+ new cards with different damage types, I don't see how it'll get much better. 
- Overreliance on meta-progression and grinding. Again, this is a preference thing - some people love to get way stronger from run to run, and don't mind the inability to beat the game on early runs. To me, that's a big turn-off. Maybe I'm overestimating, but you get a large number of ""perks"" per character that level up between runs. Also, you carry over all your currency/""shards"" from your previous playthrough, so the game seems like it wants you to be able to create the perfect deck right at the start. 
- Sounds are... extremely hit or miss. Mostly miss.

If they simplified the combat system and tried to lean more into varied runs, I could see this being great, but I think it just isn't for me. Some people might love this stuff though.",1621010440,1661467283,False,4,0,0.511235952377319336,0,True,False,True

Complexity: 
Honestly its not that bad, yes there are alot of effects but they are literally so straightforward its hard to call them overwhelming, all the elemental effects do -1% res + effect(fire is dmg, ice is slow, etc), and the only real ""combo"" elements are like water and lightning(water buffs lightning dmg). Then theres like the straight -% res or shield lasts multiple turns, or -%heal, like i see people saying its hard to understand them and im like, my brother in christ just read the effect, water gets rid of fire = surprised pikachu face.

Replayability:
The map itself is p much the same each time with slight variances, so most of it does come from new builds/different characters/different pathing. Like you can play the same map 100 different ways but its still the same map so yk its not a true procedurally generated but it lets you choose a ""consistent"" route and you kinda get to know where ur going after you play it a few times, whether thats a pro or con is up2u really.

Grinding: 
If we are being honest, id say for harder madness levels(the difficulty meter), yeah you probably need to be a little leveled up but like personally i beat the game the first time on madness 0 in like 3ish runs(didnt get any legendaries either) so idk what the complaints on that is, i normally die to greeding a challenge level rather than not having a higher level character tbh. Like once you kinda know where your going and what you want with a build(and dont be greedy af), you can win like every time
Also the chests from runs don't exist in higher difficulty anyways, they are literally there to help casual/new players to win runs and figure out builds imo, so saying you ""have to grind for chests and suicide runs"" is just a bit of a diagnosed skill issue

Difficulty: 
Really not that bad, the game does punish bad pathing, like going into the fire zone with a fire build(crazy) but like once you can figure out what to run it really isnt that hard and 90% of deaths/failed runs will be to greed imo. The game does get p hard on higher madness tho and will prolly require a bit of luck and a bit of good deck building rather than just throwin shit at a wall and seein what sticks. 
I personally didnt look anything up to like actually win the game, but i did for getting certain pets and chars, you probably should just look up the unlockables and make it easier for yourself, cuz not all of it is super clear. 

Music:
i like and boss music go hard

Each class has 4 different characters to choose from with different unique ""talent specs"" like abilities to choose from.  If you like offensive warriors, there's a bleed based berserker, if you like debuffing warriors, there's one who specialises in vulnerabilities and slows, and if you just like to create as much block, there's a low-speed guy who can do that for you.

Some complain that each battle is slower paced that StS or Roguebook, but once you unlock just a few cards and perks, combat can speed up quite a bit.  Across The Obelisk does have more of an emphasis on powering up your heroes before they get to ""max"" than other Roguelikes, which will feel familiar to MMO veterans.  It's pretty fun to still be unlocking new cards, items, pets and perks well into your 10th run.

While StS and Roguebook have a lot more randomness to the cards, artifacts, and special gifts/events that can appear on any given run, Across the Obelisk has a much more pre-determined feel.  It's much easier to aim for a ""build"" or ""talent spec"" on each of your 4 part memebers.  If you're a StS player that only likes particular styles and gets frustrated when the ""good cards"" or ""good artifacts"" for the builds you like dont appear, than this is the game for you.  In Across the Obelisk, there is an opportunity in each act to ""craft"" a limited number of specific cards with the currency you earn, which means that you will never have to go without the ""staple"" cards you feel like you cant live without.

In games like sts, monster train or 99.99% of roguelikes/roguelites you can win on your first run not having really unlocked anything major,  purely relying on, ""math skill"", choice making and a fair bit of luck when you decide to go for greedy or risky options. 

That being said, this game is really fun & reminiscent to games like slay the spire or monster train (card games). However this game does make some weird choices like hiding enemy intent, not giving you a realistic way to actually counter enemies in combat unless you have them debuffed with sight. But thats more of a gripe for me really as a few other things also could be seeing multiplayer is the draw & what sets this title a bit apart outside of how the game actually plays. However what is EXTREMELY bad about this game is the fact that its progression based & not in the way you might think or are used to with other card games. While in other card games you unlock cards along the way as you go improving your odds steadily over time for better card pulls to help you out, you can still ""beat"" the game on your first run. However this will become blatantly obvious at some point that something like that is far fetched here and most likely Impossible. Having a skill tree and skill points you eventually just run into encounters that completely will demolish your team, if not put your first foot in the grave as you can sometimes get past the first obvious upscaled fight. 

Not to mention run times, wich i suppose is a bit of a result as of playing coop. But normally in other card games a full run wont take you more than a hour. Meanwhile for me and friend to get the end of act 2 this will usually take us around 3 or so hours atleast- Where still are getting powerhoused by the act2 boss even with 4 fully upgraded decks & even on certain pathways in act 2 you can also feel the issue of imbalance going down certain pathways will just lead to an even sooner death since the mobs scale up all of a sudden. I Am sure this is a great game to play over time and once you have your foot far enough in on the progression, but outside of that it feels tedious losing to something, not because we made actively bad choices playing cards, but because we have merely gotten to the point where the game basicly want us to die, reset, grab xp and start a new run. Wich also brings me to point of this being a multiplayer game, however if you wanted more friends to join and have been playing by yourself or with another friend for a while already. You are effectievly gonna have to somewhat start from scratch as you will have to ""carry"" them trough the same progression first, wich seems really garbage for a multiplayer game thats a card game with a boardgame feel. 

Talent tree wich hardlines progression is fuccccking garbage i cant even recommend this game to my friends because if i wanted to play with them, that would ultimately mean i would have to start the same act 1-2 grind over again, or as mentioned earlier carry them slightly further. 

In other games you cling to what you have and still hope to achieve the ""impossible"" because you know it is possible to achieve! Wich over time is very motivating considering your are also getting acess to new cards and chars.

Here however its the opposite where you gradually over time lose motivation & start noticing the packs you should avoid to not abrutly end your game due to the lack of dmg/healing needed from the talent tree! Sure you get the cards and some goodies here to but that just feels like taking up a loan where you wont be able to truely allowed to enjoy these before having paid it off AKA the lack of dmg/healing/mitigation from talent tree",1661439880,1661439880,False,1,0,0.458015263080596924,0,True,False,False

Slay the Spire, plus everything but the kitchen sink

PROS:
* Collecting all the things is fun
* Shorter paths to boss fights and less RNG in the paths themselves means you're not waiting forever to lose to the same boss for the 80th time
* Boss fights are fun and diverse, with lots of hidden bosses on every level
* Obelisk rewards make every mob fight potentially more exciting (like Monster Train)

CONS:
* The art style is meh, even by genre standards
* Sound FX are pretty canned-sounding
* Strategy in AtO is weaker than StS and Monster Train: there's significantly more RNG (mainly because of the events system and the town/shops) and more RPG elements, so a lot of getting better at the game boils down to just playing it over and over again until you have enough resources to craft the deck you want when you want it. The default being NOT knowing what the enemy will do and the relatively high amount of per-turn energy (and low amount of per-turn card draw) means that you have fewer choices every turn, and less ability to plan around enemies

My enjoyment has   trended upwards from those opening minutes. Playing with a good buddy, choosing paths, making decisions, and laughing when we get suddenly screwed by a single boss turn is a fun experience.

This game has also grown on me with the escalation of gameplay, the satisfying feeling of a good run as your build comes together. That's nothing new, but it's a dopamine hit I may never fully tire of.

Runs are long, the interface is a clunky and often unclear. The presentation can be charitably described as unassuming, or that it looks like a high quality browser game- but it's solid fun and can be a worthwhile co-op adventure with enough mechanical depth and strategic choice to sustain itself. On top of that, Across the Obelisk does actually have a certain heart and personality to it that can be endearing. Those strange and unclear UI choices get cleared up once you figure them out, and you're left with something that feels fondly nostalgic in a 2008 flash-game interface sort of way. The art may not be distinctive, but it is detailed and colorful. The starting group of characters you have access to at first is a bit bland, and all the ones you unlock by playing the game have more memorable designs.

A lot of the early battles are modeled after some of the least fun archetypes in deckbuilding games.  If you've ever faced off against freeze in hearthstone, or turbofog in MTG, you'll know what I mean. Healers that spawn healers.. Invulnerable spiders that spawn spiders you have to kill, before they go invulnerable again.  Gorgons that freeze you and while you're frozen, you guessed it, spawn more enemies.

Im sure the game is more fun once you get some more unlocks, but unfortunately I couldnt bring myself to grind past the point of the janky starting party.

You start the game with a premade party of characters and are tasked with moving across a map full of enemy encounters.  The combat is based around cards, with each character getting a chance to spend their energy in exchange for playing a card from their hand.

I think where this game lost me was giving me a premade party.  I don't know if there is an option to create a party from scratch , or focus on a single hero at first, but I feel like that would have got me way more invested in what was happening.  I was completely overwhelmed with all of the cards and character stats, and I had no real investment in any of the dudes I was in charge of.

Outside of that the combat feels limp.  Casting fireball on someone just makes a wimpy little sound and you see a few numbers fly off screen.  Compared to Slay the Spire I found the combat really unexciting.  It feels like you're slowly chipping away at enemies with massive health bars , while they do the same to you.  The stakes seem really low and the battles feel way too drawn out.

Overall, it seems like a solid game if you're into slow paced deck builders but this one wasn't for me.   If Steam had a ""meh"" option I'd choose it, but it doesn't , so this'll have to be a thumbs down for me

Basically this game misses the mark in terms of what I enjoy about other Roguelike Deckbuilder games I have played. 

Enemy intents being hidden by default is bad. 
Not having fun or interesting card synergies is bad. 
The UI and layout is confusing and not an amazing experience.
There are lots of systems (usually something I enjoy in games) but they are introduced all at once rather than as a progression. 
Non combat checks add interesting flavor but are too random and variable to be a viable mechanic. Sometimes it checks your deck for high cost cards and sometimes it checks for low cost ones. 
Unused energy stays on your character which is yet another design choice that differs from the current standard of basically every other Roguelike Deckbuilder game out there. 

They made a Roguelike Deckbuilder game but removed or messed up all of the parts of Roguelike Deckbuilders I normally enjoy.

There are tons of choices to make, secrets to find, and reasons to take one more trek Across...you get the idea.   Mechanically it delivers a deckbuilding roguelite experience with a large number of effects to manage, each with their own counters and synergies.  While this can be initially overwhelming, it provides a ton of room for classes to interact with each other: a warrior redirects a bleed from themselves onto an enemy which allows the rogue to turn the bleed to poison, freeing up both the mage and priest to use shadow damage effect that scale off poison (after the mage redirected additional energy to the priest to enable more heals to be played).  Fortunately the game has solid tooltips and an in-game glossary that will offer a straightforward explanation of every effect, their interactions, and their counters. 


The unlockable characters allow for a solid amount of variation within their archetypes: though both rogues, the gameplay of the singing frog is distinctly different than that of the stabbing lizard.  Moreover, the individual overworld maps crossed over the course of the campaign have enough internal variability to offer new events, choices, and options that keep the runs from feeling too ""samey."" 

Initially it felt that the game leaned heavily on metaprogression elements as we found ourselves losing a numbers battle against late game content when we pushed ahead more quickly than our stats allowed, but it was only noticeable in the first few runs.  That said, the runs themselves are LONG, particularly if your group likes to narrate the events, and it can be hard to coordinate 4 players for a task that may take upwards of 5 hours.  Still, the generous autosave on the overworld map means that you can put sessions down and resume them at a later date if yours is a group that can only play intermittently.

Across the Obelisk borrows ideas from titles such as Slay the Spire and Rogue Book; and it mashes them up with classic RPG elements into something wonderful. And, IMHO, the reason Across the Obelisk succeeds in it's ambitions are the cleaver game systems. On numerous occasions I've found myself thinking ""this is a neat idea"" and it usually some new or borrowed system that the developers have polished to a point where this game feels like a true successor; a leap of progress for the genera.

Pros:
* Smart game systems
* Lot's of depth
* Nearly perfect balance of player agency and deck-builder randomness
* Solid graphics and animations
* Tons of replayability due to team composition and build choices
* Multiplayer! - everything about this was more fun than I expected

Bad:
* lacking a good UI for seeing what cards the enemies played -- later in a run cards and interactions get more complex while happening very quickly. And there's not a great way to review what the enemy played and understand what happened.

Other: 
* If you like Slay this Spire this game is it's spiritual successor -- it's an improvement across the board.",1661352047,1661352047,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

It's a great game and I wholeheartedly recommend people to get it. [i]However...[/i] the artstyle, the music and the sound effects are painfully generic. They remind me of old Flash RPGs of back in the day.

There's no identity in it, there's no surprises, nothing looks amazing or bad either, it's just generic. It looks incredibly cheap, with no effort to dare stand out from the usual fantasy design tropes. The art is flat, it doesn't have the grime or feel necessary to really get personal with you, the music sounds royalty free, totally acceptable but completely forgettable. Not event the story has anything interesting that stands out from the usual tropes. There's potential here that's not reached and it could've been much better with such little effort.

That said, the gameplay itself is fantastic. It's fun, it's a great little adventure. This is why I'm commenting so much on the appearance of the game. It's like a Kia Spectra, it drives like a dream, but the outside is forgettable and generic. There's so much on the inside, but the outside is so bland that it hampers the rest.

Considering the diversity I've seen so far, and having a peek at some of the achievements, I can only guess it will take at least a few hundred hours to have seen all the different event combinations and outcomes.

The only real downside I could think of is that the equipment system is overall less interesting in across the obelisk. Most of the effects are very basic ""+1 type damage/healing/resistance""  items. Slay the spire relics are a lot more varied. Also replacing my ""+1 fire damage"" wand for a ""+2 fire damage"" wand doesn't feel very satisfying. The ever increasing stacks of relics in slay the spire feels much more rewarding since it doesn't take anything away when you get something new.

In slay the spire for example, you didn't have much control over deck building, the game would give you choices but you would have to take what you were given and play whatever build you were getting cards for. Across the Obelisk has a spec of mercy and gives you the option to buy cards some cards before the run starts. Meaning if you're going for a specific build, you can actually build for it.

To further give the player options to specialize into a build, instead of 4 archetypes each with a specific gimmick or two, you have multiple characters within that archetype who specialise in specific gimmicks. Not in a limiting way, as in you only get certain cards, but instead, giving bonus towards a specific gimmick and even then, as your character levels up you get options. In both single and multiplayer you can also bring multiple characters from the same archetype. if you really wanted you could do a run with 4 healers. or 2 mage and 2 rogue.

In terms of negatives, I'd say the game plays a bit too hard into the roguelite element, After playing even a handful of runs you gain a ludicrous amount of power. The perk system allows you to increase the amount of debuff stacks you apply to enemies, So for a simple example, In your first run you'll play a card that does 5 damage and applies one stack of burn, in your later runs you'll use the same spell and do 9 damage and 4 stacks of burn. Even if those numbers mean nothing to you, you're doing 4 times the debuff and nearly twice the damage.

a warning though that you should expect your first few runs to be really rough: the meta-progression aspects are definitely necessary to feel like you have a leg up on even some of the earliest enemies, and the default characters aren't *bad*, but they kind of suffer from lack of specialization (unlocking thuls, for instance, was like night and day as far as progress was concerned).

that being said, if you're willing to suffer through a slow start for your first half dozen runs or so with some characters that don't quite feel like they have a strong flavor to them, things will start to feel like you have a chance at least. definitely recommend you get a couple of friends to pick it up if you can, too. it makes the more difficult grinds bearable when you can be miserable with a comrade (or three).",1661323962,1661323962,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I've always wanted to get into deck builders but their complexity has always intimidated me.

Basic concepts are super easy to grasp, and as you slowly get introduced to more and more mechanics and card effects, you're able to use the knowledge you've already gained to put together what cards you want to use to fit a certain playstyle and how you want to build your team.

It's insanely fun, and I find myself excited to start over again every time my team is wiped out to see if I can get any new events or figure out any quests that stumped me in previous runs.

those that love:
1. card games :  
There is the excitement of pulling the perfect card at the just the right time (and setting yourself up for an insane combo only to miss a card) 

2. team building :  
Each characters feel different and can be used in multiple roles--ie. rouges as tanks, tanks as main damage etc. 
If you enjoy team building, you will enjoy the variety of teams you can create. 

3. rogue-like : 
Even if you don't beat the game your first few tries (or dozen tries in my case), you will still unlock things that will help you--along with developing the know-how. 

Cons:

1. If you don't like any of the genres (above), I'm not sure how much you could enjoy the game, since the they are such a core aspect of the game. 

2. It can be very confusing at first, and you may not figure things out the first few tries. 
Without upgrades and unlocks, the game can be very unforgiving, especially to those who are new to the game and its mechanics. 

3. Art style may not work with some people & sound effects are... amateur at times to put it kindly. While I laughed at it, you might say no way. 

------

Final Note:

Playing this with friend(s) is highly recommended. 
This game becomes a different game playing with other people for few reasons (that I experienced):

1. People may want to play a specific build. However, it may not align with the team. EVERYONE wants to do TONS of damage. 
It's like everyone's trying to be a striker and no one wants to be a goalie.  

2. People may want to travel different paths or take the same items--people become political, sabotage each other just because, and everything in between. 
I loved it. 

3. It was awesome to support each other in boss fights--sweating together as we find that our scheme is failing or cheering as we land the final attack.

there are a lot of tools available to communicate without a mic, although it is easier to communicate in person. they have thought out a good way to balance split decisions and they make communication and tactics a must. one aspect that could be a good or bad thing depending on the group is that there is no timer. additionally you can have up to 3 single player runs and 3 coop runs at a time, and it is easy to pick up where you left off. additionally, they did a phenominal job of having each class have unique roles, and made it possible for each class to be damage and support (especially nice for the healer class)

some things that i have issues with is that unlocking characters is a bit of a chore and can be obtuse(i would recommend looking it up online), the way the character upgrade system works, they are expecting you to spend a lot of time going through the game, for the obelisk challenges (optional difficulty spikes for random encounters) there isnt a good way for the party to give their input. there is a group chat, but having them vote for an option would be nice. and there is no variance to what boss you face.

I never knew I needed this in my life, and it's just so seamless and fun to play with friends.  You each control a certain number of characters (based on how many players you have) and you use your own gold/shards to upgrade the decks.  All the rewards carry over from your single and multiplayer games as well.

Fighting enemies which heavily defend and shield to the point any contact damage does next to nothing makes you rely on posion/bleed which draws out the fight. I feel if you started this fight on very low health, ended it completely full, hardly took any damage whilst also dealing loads yourself, you should get a better ranking than ""underwhelming"". It is a strategy game after all.

On the learning/difficulty curve being tied to playtime or more specifically, unlocking better cards and ranking up your character, I do like this system personally. Its less of a traditional rougelike in this sense as It gives me a sense of RPG style progression.

Takes too long to rebuild your chosen deck each run and generally when you've got it where you want it the run is over and you have to start over.

Class unlocks are mostly pointless.  Yes they have different skill-ups, but these take almost an entire run to gain 1 or 2 and then you guessed it, it's time to start your run over.

Too expensive to rebuild even the starter level decks so that if you don't do a full run prior to this one so you have something to carry over and help pay for this you're stuck doing a couple VERY BORING runs with anemic (non rebuilt) decks in order to afford a good one again.  Basically meaning if you get past say the first world and want to scrap the run and restart you can't, you're stuck playing as long as possible to build up a warchest to pay for the next run.  BORING.

This game is the furthest you can get from both of those titles, and it's incredibly confusing to me why this occupies the genre of deckbuilding roguelites in the first place. 

[h1]Damage types[/h1] 

I'm going to list all of the status effects that one enemy had in the 1st combat:
Burning, Bleeding, Poisoned, Shocked, Slowed, Vulnerable.

Why does this game need 4 DOT effects with tiny differences? This amount of complexity being introduced so early feels very inelegant, clunky and is visually messy.

Some effects transform once they reach a certain number of stacks. Some enemies will be completely resistant to the status effects your party members apply. In theory this encourages diversifying your party. In practice it is a very boring way to do that.

Compare this to STS, where enemies that ""test"" your deck in different ways. Some monsters punish you for playing skill cards. Others want you to deal damage to them quickly. Others need you to last a long time in battle. Some might put you on a timer or reduce your ability to draw cards. They test your deckbuilding, not the damage type you use or status effect you apply.

There are 9(!) damage types in this game. Each enemy has a whole character sheet with 9 different numbers you can look at to see what they're resistant to. All 4 of your characters have something like 6 different cards in their deck with different number of copies doing different types of damage.

Compared to something as elegant as STS, where you start with 6 simple attacks, 5 simple defends and 1 or 2 class-specific cards, this game feels the need to throw everything at you at the very start without creating any depth or interest. 

[h1]Cardplay[/h1] 

There's next to no card interaction when it comes to your character's decks.

STS does this by letting you remove cards from your deck during battle, discarding cards, drawing cards, having cards have additional effects after being discarded or removed, etc. etc. This creates a lot of interesting interactions which emerge from the fact that you're playing with cards.

ATO, from my experience, has the following:
Draw a card
Look at the top 5 cards and discard any of them
Shuffle something into your deck
When you play a card with a matching tag, a passive item gives you a small bonus

This is probably one of my biggest gripes with this game: [b]I haven't seen anything that would explain why my characters have their abilities represented by cards.[/b] This might as well be an RPG where your heroes have random abilities every turn. There's barely any card draw, the combos that exist are mostly debuff-reliant. Many cards fill similar roles with differing damage types.

[h1]Lack of information[/h1] 

You can't see enemy intents unless you debuff them with ""sight"". A debuff that does nothing but let you see what the enemies are doing, and may often be useless when the intent doesn't change your planned actions or if you've memorized the enemy patterns.

Many events will be given vague descriptions and you are given similarly vague options to choose from. You will be inexplicably forced into combats, given negative affliction cards, etc.

For example, I stumbled upon a cave that had hot fumes coming out of it. I could have all characters risk it individually, going in one-by-one, or I could look for a safe opening, which could make me skip the encounter if I don't find it. I choose the ""safe"" option, and after I succeed the game throws a second skillcheck at me that I can't skip. My party fails it, and they get an injury added to their decks.

Compare this to STS or MT where you're given explicit explanations to what most actions do in an event. Take damage to remove a card from your deck. Duplicate cards in your deck. And it's not like those games don't have unexplained consequences either. Difference is, those are an exception, not the norm. Most of the time you're at least given an idea about the consequence. Take this relic, but it will trigger a trap. Take this relic, but you will take damage. Fight in the arena, but you don't know who's the opponent.

[h1]The class system[/h1] 

The game features 16 different characters with decks made out of their corresponding ""class pool"" cards. What are ""class pool"" cards? Well, while the game may have 16 characters, it only has 4 classes, many of which combine abilities from different fantasy archetypes. Your ranger will be able to find cards that the assassin or the bard use. 

Yes, the ranger, assassin and bard share the same pool of cards. This makes the characters feel very shallow, as the main things that differentiate the characters are their starter deck, level-up options and event options, which are often underwhelming.

[h1]Improving your deck[/h1] 

Altering your deck is incredibly unrewarding. After you finish a fight, you are presented with 3 cards to choose from for each character. The issue? The cards you are given are often the [b]same[/b] power level as those you started with.

What's worse, is that because you're sharing the card pool with other characters, your ranger can get bard cards he can't make any use of. [b]This is one of the most infuriating mechanics in this game.[/b] Most of the time you will be skipping your card rewards, making them unexciting and frustrating.

That sounds quite bad, doesn't it? One of the most exciting parts of deckbuilders is gradually improving your deck after every encounter. Well, it gets worse.

[h1]Meta-progression[/h1] 

At the start of every run you can look through the 40+ common and uncommon cards present in each card pool and buy them, ensuring that for the next 10+ combats any card you'll find will be completely useless because you've already optimized your build. Not only that, but doing so will make the whole act trivial and boring. 

What's worse is that you are shown every common and uncommon card that you have access to, overwhelming you with options either because you can't find the card you're looking for or because you're experiencing decision paralysis.

All of your characters will increase in their rank, granting them permanent powerups via upgrade trees. This could have been an opportunity to make the characters stand on their own by giving them unique upgrades, but instead all 4 skill trees are copy-pasted across every single character sheet.

And it's not like you can skip the meta-progression, as the game throws difficulty spikes at you every act. I can't tell if I'm supposed to overcome these spikes by getting better at the game or if I just need to increase my character's skill points.

[h1]The second gamemode[/h1] 

There's a secondary gamemode that I've tried before publishing this review. It seems to remove the meta-progression and puts you into a randomly-generated world instead of a static one. While this is an improvement in my book, the rest of the issues are still present, namely the lack of interesting cardplay, surface-level synergies, an absurd amount of status effects, etc.

[h1]The rest of it[/h1] 

Personally not a fan of the artstyle and the overarching story.

The towns where you buy and upgrade cards are a mess to navigate: there are 5 unlabeled merchants that you can click on. They allow you to: buy, remove, upgrade, discover cards and purchase relics. Why couldn't this be done from a single screen?

Cards take half a second to resolve, and you can't queue new actions until the animation is finished.

My god, the sound effects. I assumed they were placeholders, as they sounded like something you'd get on a free SFX website. The game is now released, and those sounds are still there. The boars will grunt in the same way the bandits and naga would. Most holy spells will play the cheesiest jingles imaginable.

I expected a level of gameplay similar to MT and STS, and those games are miles ahead of ATO in that regard. Cheaper, too!",1661270154,1661272638,False,91,9,0.604245543479919434,3,True,False,False

Make no mistake, I would absolutely call Across the Obelisk a Slay the Spire clone, if only because no one has come up with a less cumbersome name for this new genre. That isn't a criticism tho, as I think one of the best things about the video game industry is how games sample and re-work ideas into genres and sub genres. 

So terminology aside, here are things I liked: normal and boss enemies. I liked Monster Train, but said at the time I would have preferred a game with standard enemy fights and boss fights rather than a boss rush, as boss rush games tend to have a jankier difficulty curve. Across the Obelisk has that and it's refreshing. I also very much enjoy the roguelite elements. The upgrades feel very necessary so don't think you can strategise your way out of some good old fashioned grinding. That's not really an issue, though, as there are so many mechanics to learn that keeping a tight grip of the pacing improves the learning curve. Visual design is nothing to write home about but does the job and the sound design is... well. let's maybe step into the bad section.

Things I liked less: Okay the sound design isn't great. I've heard worse but eh. this one gets a C- and a 'see me' note. Mechanically it may be a bit of an odd choice forcing us to take a full party of bumblefucks on every run as it means learning four decks at once. It was odd when Monster Train did it and I don't love it here either. That I can live with more than the fights tho. And here we have my biggest gripe with the game: the fights are too damned long. Health pools are so deep and damage cards are so low that even easy no damage sweep fights take upwards of 20 turns. All attacks play out so slowly and there's no Monster Train style speed up button that makes this less tiresome.

In short, I think this game has oodles of potential and I really like what I see. I have issues but they're small enough that they didn't stop me enjoying the overall experience.",1661176853,1661267595,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

1. I found myself avoiding battles not because I wasn't sure I could take them but because I didn't want to sit there for 10-20 minutes wailing on some baddie. 
2. Card rewards are not exciting. Gaining 1- damage on a 2 cost card is not really a lot of fun when going against 4x 200+ hp mobs. Most of these rewards are not upgrades from your starting deck. 
3. The choices are not interesting and there's very limited choices to be made until you unlock all the nonsense roguelite elements.

[b]What this game is/does[/b][list]

    [*]Class-based party system that allows for a more RPG-like approach.
    [*]Knowledge, card and resource acquisition between games.

[b]What this game isn't/doesn't[/b][list]

Right, just to clear up. Something I consider a roguelike is a game that the moment you pick it up, as long as you have perfect knowledge of the game, you can just play and win most of the time. This game is not that. Its progression between games is core to its design. So yes, your first few runs you're likely to get stomped by something that feels unfair. Come back, acquire more resources and card unlocks and come back stronger the second round. [b]If you come here looking for a roguelike experience, this game is not for you.[/b]

However, if you're looking for a game that's great to play with friends (solo is decent, but more overwhelming and micro-managing), something you can play every now and again and journey together to become stronger everytime you play, [b]then this game is for you.[/b] This game is maximalist in its approach (many numbers, many cards, many things to keep track of). It is DENSE. Personally something I like. Also the resources it rewards you after a run to use in your next are really generous, allowing you to craft a focused deck from the get-go. If that all sounds great to you, this is the game for you.

Most every effect in the game is color coded, and show their reaction with other effects quite clearly. It should only be 'too complicated' if you're completely new to RPG mechanics in general. Something is wet? It takes more damage from lightning. Chilled? More from cold. Burned? More from fire. Etc, etc, etc. Is the buff/debuff situation more complicated than Slay the Spire? Sure. Every game has nuances though. This would be like complaining about the two character system in Roguebook. A single play through should be plenty to learn how everything works.

As far as my full thoughts on the game.
Pros:
+ A nice amount of characters to enjoy with different specialties for each class
+ Good build variety for each class
+ Nice music
+ A fun branching story for multiple acts, now with the ability to avoid troublesome zones for your build since only 4/5 maps are visited per play through
+ Compelling reason to play higher difficulties, as better drops are available on higher difficulties to make it so you're not just outright being nerfed with each successive increase in difficulty
+ Multiplayer has good connection saving - even if someone drops it saves well, and if a desync occurs it will regularly restart the fight, instead of dumping everyone out of the match and forcing a reconnect (though in reality over over 100 hours of multiplayer I've had only 3-4 of these total)

Cons:
- Could use better animations in some places

The game doesn't look like it would be great, some would even call it ugly. The setting is generic fantasy, the writing is dumb at parts, the music can be repetitive, the sound design comical and the art is cursed (pope pig.)

You were wrong.

The world has a tonne of thought behind it with some fantastic moments and many decisions and quests linking up to one another. There's no Shakespeare here but a lot of quotable moments and for a game that needs a glossary, it does a good job explaining every little thing clearly. The music has a few amazing tracks - something I'd listen to in my off time that really make battles extra fun. The sound design is c o m i c a l and the game overall looks really nice.

Pros:
- multiplayer
- art?

Cons:
- little to no synergy, each deck is designed to be played by different players
- boring gameplay.  You play so many cards since you manage 4 players and each fight takes 4+ turns.  Thankfully, only 3-6 fights each act and by act 2 I find myself falling asleep.

The focus on slow grindy progression, most of your deck being basic strikes and defends until very late in, and a million different status and debuffs effects make establishing effective synergy a chore.
Again, there is a lot to love about this game, it innovates in a lot of ways that help it to break out of the shadow of slay the spire, but I ultimately found the core game-play loop less satisfying than spires, and think this will need a bit more fine tuning before I can recommend it.",1661223085,1661223085,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Opening combat reminded me so much of Slay the Spire, that's what I expected, and while it's similar, there's a lot of things I had to teach my brain to adjust to the combat (in a good way, I was making my own errors).  

Things to consider if you want to try this game:  Expect to lose.  I love making all sorts of team combinations now, but it took me three runs to get past the first boss, it took me six runs before I beat the game, and I spent a lot of time learning and getting wiped out along the way.  But that's part of the game.  There are a ton of status effects to learn, but it's not impossible.  You learn the basic ones at the start, hovering over any icon tells you what it does, and as you struggle further into the game, you teach your brain what the new stuff does that you haven't seen as often (I had to change how I built several of my card decks to deal with the Act 4 enemies but it was so satisfying when I succeeded).  I've been introducing the game to friends, and we've been doing co-op and trying to promote it in our friends group because this game is such a great team building game, to learn each others synergies whenever we try new characters.  

Time to rave about some other stuff.  LOVE the way characters have not only different classes, but how each of the characters have different strategies.  Each healer has a different strength, and you can go typical format, or if you're feeling crazy, go wild with 2 tanks and 2 healers (don't knock it, with the right characters it works rather well).  Different characters go really well together and can play off each other, leaning more into knowing your team and your teammates when preparing a game, and I love how you can feel the progression in strength as you play more, get more perks, collect rewards from previous games, and unlock cards as you explore.

There will be a lot of negativity, but stick with me and hear me out.

On paper, [b]Across the Obelisk[/b] represents something I’ve wanted from the Deck-building Rogue-lite genre: Co-op. In theory, this could have made for a good entry-level game to help bring in players who were too intimidated to master games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Vault of the Void on their own. Papers and theories don’t matter in the long run, however, because I have issues with how the execution played out.

First, let’s go over co-op issues. The game suffers from what is referred to in tabletop circles as Quarterbacking. What this means is that a player experienced in this genre will know the optimal way to play and maximize action-economy, and because the game’s difficulty necessitates that everyone do their part correctly, there will be frequent occurrences where the experienced player needs to speak up and give out orders. If you don’t care about losing, then this isn’t an issue, but I imagine since many will want to win, you almost always need to have vets speaking up in order to avoid preventable wipes. Sure, the inexperienced player might learn from the veteran player, but if the game gave more room for mistakes, a veteran player might not feel inclined to quarterback much.
 
Which leads me to the mechanical discussion, and the biggest gripe I have is the fail-to-progress philosophy in this game. I want to establish that its three big contemporaries, Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and Vault of the Void, all have unlockable content that make for enjoyable meta-progress-collecting. However, what completely separates those three from Across the Obelisk is that those unlocks are not mandatory for completion. You can, with good play, blindly complete those games on their base-difficulty without unlocks. I must emphasize ‘blind’, because I’ve already seen comments stating that you can complete Obelisk on a fresh save as long as you know what you are doing. That is not a good measure of balance if I need to already know what I’m doing to complete it.

Failure means your next run is easier. One of the first town unlocks that set off red flags for me was the ability to freely remove cards in the first town, an option that had an instant difficulty-shift between run one and two. It meant we could surgically modify our starting decks. Later on, pets enter starting equipment as useful early/mid-game boosters. Discovering cards during initial runs means these can then be crafted as, once again, strong early/mid-game boosters in subsequent playthroughs. Perks, especially, are designed to make runs feel easier, to a degree that some perks can absolutely trivialize the early-game.

I don’t want the game to become easier as I play. I want it to be challenging, yet fair. Beating the game should be the result of the players improving and not because of character and town upgrades.

Another issue is analyzing enemy intent. Enemy intent is one of the most valuable tactical elements to these games, because it is what ultimately decides how you’re going to balance out offense and defense in your decks. Not having the ability to know where the enemy’s attacks are going means your tank is playing a guessing game regarding who to defend (and before anyone asks, yes, there is an ability that grants intent, but I’m talking about attacks that are ‘random’ or ‘middle’, where you can’t predict the attacks). I’m not the type of player to make noise about RNG, in general, because RNG is always going to be a main fun-factor to deal with in this genre (mainly in deck-arrangement for optimized draws, card drafting, item/relic selection, enemy-encounter, etc). However, there is a limit to how much randomization you can throw at players, and I believe this line was crossed by making enemy targeting randomized.

Furthermore, I’m not a fan of adding resistances on top of block because that adds unnecessary analysis-paralysis over the way you attack your enemies. What should be a simple “I’m going to use this attack on this enemy” becomes a sudden “Wait, wait, don’t do that. That damage-type does less on this guy; throw it on that guy, instead.” Is this strategic? Not really. It just slows things down (in a game that already feels slow because you’re managing four characters instead of one), which is more compounded by the fact that the tried-and-tested debuffs, vulnerable and weak, should have been the two core debuffs without over-complicating the game with unnecessary extra variables. It also means that your ‘route’ is going to be static, because the encounters you choose to take on will be based on having the foreknowledge of enemy-resistances in mind.

Speaking of static, the runs feel repetitive, and while you might be inclined to point out that its contemporaries have recycled encounters/events/elites/bosses, it’s the arrangement and order that you tackle these in that prevents the run, itself, from feeling recycled. Knowing that I am going to face the same encounters in the same order means that I am now expected to build in preparation for these predictable scenarios rather than being adaptive. After each failed run, the encounters become easier because you’re now fully aware of how to exploit the encounters if you’re pursuing the same route.

The last point I’m going to make is a lot more subjective, and I apologize if any offense is taken: I don’t really find the audio aesthetics to be as good as others in this genre. There’s no oomph in the attack sounds, the enemy grunts are lackluster and silly, and the overall soundtrack feels all over the place. Boss music is decent, but standard encounters feel too soft and not matching in tone to the adrenaline of combat music should sound like.

So now you’re probably wondering why I still gave this game a positive review after all of these complaints? It’s because right before I was about to push the red button, I tried the Obelisk Challenge mode with my partner, thinking that if this mode did not win us over, I’d just move onto a different game. The end-result was that, despite the aforementioned issues with quarterbacking, meta-unlock-chasing, enemy-intent-management, resistances, and audio-nitpicking, the unpredictability of the Obelisk Challenge, combined with the full distribution of characters and deck-drafting, led to us feeling like we were playing a different game. A better one, even, in my opinion.

All of the fights felt fair and balanced, so much so that despite never even completing the Adventure Mode after hours of experimentation, we were able to go in, blind, and complete the Obelisk Challenge on our first attempt, which gives credit to its arrangement of encounters, especially since we barely have perks unlocked. We got to pick characters that we found synergetic, and that gave us better control over how we would dictate the encounters, especially when choosing our randomly-generated routes. We thought we were about to lose at two points during our run, and we even admitted that even if we lost, we were still having a great time.

This is good.

I’ve seen discussions about whether it’s fair to compare Across the Obelisk with games like Slay the Spire, but here’s my viewpoint: If you’re looking for a light-fantasy RPG that has deck-building elements, then the Adventure Mode will be for you. If you’re looking for a game like Slay the Spire with added co-op, you will probably enjoy the Obelisk Challenge more. I have to give credit where credit is due. They gave players two different ways to enjoy the game. As said before, there are issues I have, overall, regardless of mode, but at the very least, I can give it a recommendation now that I have given it its fair shake.

I like the mechanics (if you've played Slay The Spire, it's that, but with four decks at once), but this game just does not respect your time, and that's a pet peeve of mine.

After seven hours of play, I have unlocked a single character out of twelve and a ton of cards, most of which are pretty obviously terrible. Runs take several HOURS to complete, and death means a total restart, and considering how comically unfair the game can get later in the run, this is infuriating.

Let me set the scene for you: You know how in Slay The Spire or Darkest Dungeon, an enemy might slow you down with an attack, or maybe apply poison, or maybe lower your ability to gain block? Across The Obelisk enemies can do all at once, to your entire party, no dodge chance, while also dealing okay damage. This isn't a boss thing, almost every single fight has at least one enemy with a strong, damaging, AoE debuff. This isn't even a dealbreaker as far as it goes mechanically, but fights take SO LONG to finish. Regular enemies can have over 100 health on a regular basis, and high damage spells can do 30 damage. 

So it's just hours of whittling down enemies over and over again, getting debuffed over and over again, which just slows you down more, only to get to a fight that hard counters you after a two hour run that just farts in your mouth so you can restart and do it again.

There is a macro-game going on in towns, where you can upgrade them, but these upgrades aren't anything more exciting than ""make X cheaper"". You can also upgrade your heroes permanently between runs, and these upgrades are busted to a hilarious degree. Extra block, extra damage, extra energy, whatever. I think the reason why the game is such a slow, grindy mess is because you are expected to die many, many times to turn your characters into fantasy Batman. This would work just fine, if the runs didn't take hours to complete. 

There is a good game here, I know there is, and it's trying to claw its way out. The problem is that you have to wade through so grindy gameplay to see it, and it's so heartbreaking. Numbers are just too high for what the game wants you to do, and it turns into watching paint dry battle after battle after battle.",1661205663,1661205663,False,3,0,0.461261272430419922,0,True,False,False

The game is completely and unnecessarily over-complicated by all of the different stats, buffs and debuffs - it's frustrating,  overwhelming and adds nothing to the game. There are so many modifiers, and the choices of cards and monsters you're given that may have WILDLY different use-cases that eventually you just think, ""what's the point"" and close your eyes and draft a card. The RPG elements to your character are neat, but also have very little impact on your runs until you simply grind the game enough to put stat points into everything. You may want a lightning-focused stat wizard, but good luck with that because you're not going to be seeing more than 1 lightning card in 5 runs due to there also being block, shield, cold, chill, fire, burn, mind, shadow, wet, insane, dark, insulate, slow, speed, and MORE that may show up instead for your wizard card choices...so you just put your points into generally useful stats as specializing ain't worth it for the first 20 hours of the game.

Finally, because of the above, it feels extremely hard to construct a cohesive deck strategy. In the extremely rare scenario that you do somehow manage to gain a semblance of one, you may run into an entire MAP of enemies that shut you down, not just a few mobs. If you're chasing that satisfying feeling of finding synergy between your items, particular deck builds/themes, and game-breaking synergies like in StS, Dominion and other deck builders, you're not going to find it here as there's just too much in the way.

TLDR: too many stats and modifiers to actually plan for anything, overwhelms you and the game both. More isn't always better.",1661199189,1661199726,False,1,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,False

While some may include Darkest Dungeon in their comparison really the only thing DD style is the ""upgrade your town for future runs to have more advantages"", yes you have some skills that only hit the front or back or hit an enemy and the enemies around it and you have enemies who have 30% resistance to x but are 40% frail to y but I mean that is pretty standard and isn't just a DD thing.

As you level up classes instead of just being a card unlock like StS instead you get perk points which you can spec and respec before any new run, so if you want to do a run where you start out with a lot of bonus attack and defense you can, if you want to start a run where those are default but you have a ton of extra gold/crystals to build your entire deck removing all default cards you can, you are not locked into once you pick this perk you are locked in forever for the heroes, for the town on the other hand as you upgrade it you are locked in and if you want everything you need to beat a lot of bosses.

Talking about custom perk settings lets talk about the random events, some events you can only pass if your 4 heroes draw a card value of 6 or higher others only if your party draws a total of 3 or lower, others require the tank to draw a defense card or the priest to draw a holy card, so depending on how you built your default deck you may have easier or harder time with some events just based on your deck, so you can alter your odds of certain things by how you build your deck unlike StS where it is basically a 50/50 chance for any random encounter.

One twist is in the shops gear and stuff is only for singular heroes and once you buy it for one hero no other hero can buy it unless it shows up in a later shop and you can not trade gear so you have to pick who gets what carefully. 


All in all it is a much more in depth more complicated Slay the Spire with the only real downfall being the fact that controlling 4 heroes at once means that runs take longer as well, so don't expect to be able to beat all ""3"" ""floors"" in under an hour like in StS, just the first ""floor"" alone took me nearly just over a hour, sure it was my first run without any upgrades but still it is not as much of a lunch break game as StS, specially if you are trying to min max by allowing the last enemy to live so that your priest can full heal your team before you kill it.

This game is simply a slog to play and lacks any true form of strategy.

Played the game co-op for 4.5 hours and we both hated it and came to a sad conclusion of its flaws from that short time playing. 

Lacking the ability to get a refund I decided to play it a bit more constantly leaving the game running because I was so absolutely bored and could not stand anymore for the time being.

Yea it is a rogue-lite, and it leans into that way way way too hard. Instead of actually developing the game and coming up with ways to balance and make the game fun they decided to make it where you need enough meta progression in order to start winning.

The entire resistance, buffs, debuffs and HP system they implemented into this game is simply in the game to appear 'deep and strategic'.

Fights are boring and take far too long. The enemies hp scaling is absolutely absurd and the constant summoning of adds is annoying. Debuffs are mostly pointless because you are rewarded for killing quick. The cards are so lazy and uninspired and lack any real depth. Most cards are auto plays, auto picks, auto removes or are balanced so incredibly poorly you wonder why does it even exist. There is so few ways to move cards to the top of your deck and so far there are no ways to keep cards in your hand at the end of turn so situational cards in turn become very useless unless you burn your deck down to so few cards you draw the card you want every turn just if you need it.

Events are randomly random for the sake of...idk flavor and the flavor is putrid.

Unlocking heroes is not fun and really screams ""LOOK AT ALL THIS CONTENT"", when really it is just a way to trick you into thinking the game is once again much deeper than it is.

The game is severely and actively anti-fun, boring, slow, repetitive and actively makes me mad while playing it. I was begging for no more encounters despite having an entirely broken set of decks and heroes.

This is now the worst rogue-l(ike)ite card game I have played. I wrote this after winning a run and I am so furious right now that I was unable to get a refund and that I wasted so much time on this game looking for entertainment that it cannot offer.

As per most games in this genre, do not expect to do well immediately.  People seem to complain about a grind, but after every (failed) run you learn encounters, synergies, as well as unlocks and passive perk points.  Yes, you can be seemingly doing great, then all of a sudden meet an encounter or boss that smashes your little acorns into a fine paste, humbling you and forcing you to start a new.  Some reviewers seem incapable of handling that kind of gameplay loop, which is odd because that would indicate this is the first ever roguelike or card battler.  Slay the Spire was notorious for that (in my experience, I sunk 150+ hours into that game and still would only consider myself decent).

I personally feel the game rewards you plenty with every unsuccessful attempt, and the power increase in your characters is palpable.  Of course there is RNG to contend with, and even a great run can get derailed fast with a bit of bad luck or crappy hand draws.   All you can do is learn how to build your chars and decks and try to mitigate that as much as possible.

Where the game really shines is in the co-op.  Splitting the characters between your friends and having to communicate your builds and strategies and work together really adds such a nice facet to these games, which are rewarding in their own right, provided you actually enjoy the genre.  I truly wish more developers would try to find ways to put co-op into their games, across all genres, because despite what the sweaties bashing their keyboards in forums say, there are LOTS of people out there who enjoy playing games with friends cooperatively.  

Technically, seems pretty polished.  The sound and music design is a bit meh, the soundtrack for combat is pretty laughable when compared to something like Darkest Dungeon.

All in all, I'm only scratching the surface of the game but I'm enjoying myself immensely for the price of admission.

I'm a fan of Monster Train and slay the spire. This game is very good at being different from both, however having all the elements that makes this genre so nice.
It feels like there is a lot more content than monster train and slay the spire, due to the huge combinations of classes, items, decks, perks and team combo. Initially I was disappointed because it didn't usually have the WOW factor some builds get in slay the spire and monster train. However playing it more and unlocking various characters, cards and pets you can make such combos in this game too.

So I would say is less immediate than both slay the spire and monster train, but so far it feels it's much deeper and more complex.

The only downsides I can find is the town music (were you will spend lots of time tweaking the build) which is very repetitive and not relaxing enough and the amount of times you need to complete the game to unlock all characters and pets. However, due to being so complex and good it's not that big of a deal.

Singleplayer is also fun and might be more your style but be aware you'll have to make and operate 4 different decks, 1 for each character. Once you learn the game it doesn't take long for you to find a playstyle you like and make decks easily/quickly.

So I simply cannot recommend the game to anyone.

Whilst the game mechanics are good and enjoyable, and all the makings of a good game are there. There are just far too many combat encounters. Combat takes a while and almost every tile on each board is combat. There needs to be less or at least more 'events' instead to give players a break/lower the overall game time.

If you join a random multiplayer game and someone disconnects in those 5 hours, whilst you keep your rewards, only the host can relaunch the game from the last checkpoint. Leading to multiple hours of wasted gameplay. Whilst this function could be useful for a play group, picking the game up, putting it down, playing it over 2-3 nights etc, it's horrible for playing solo with randoms.

I got this game to play with friends, but sitting down for 5 hours is far too much of an ask for any play group, let alone rando's online. You could do it in multiple sessions if a friend hosts, but I can easily see that getting tiring/boring.

The runs are far less random, especially in the start. You can recreate your starter deck every time after the first run and actually improve it a bit as well if you do better on the next run. You get gold and shards based on how well how you did in the previous run that you can use to add, remove and improve the cards in your deck. For example the starter mage isn't specialized, starting with fire, frost and lightning spells, however you can purchase say 6 or so lightning spells and then remove the frost and fire spells and bam, lightning specialized starter mage.

TO THE DEVS
Anyone saying there are too many status effects is an absolute idio.... ehem, not your target audience! 

Yes, there are a lot but they all make sense and are not excessive. The majority of the status effects just deal with damage or resistance, extra frost/fire/lightning,mind,shadow,holy damage/resistance. Aside from that there are about 20, and that does include things like thorns, weakness, regeneration, etc. Things that any old RPG player would know, you'll have every icon memorized after one run, two if you aren't as experienced with old RPG style buffs/debuffs.

And I won't say ""in it's current form,"" because too many of the bad decisions are integral to design that they aren't going away.

What rules did they break?

1) In a PVE game never ever CC your player.  This is rule number two (after game must work).  If the player doesn't get to play your game, they aren't going to play your game.  This is especially true here where each individual character can be run by a different person.  Hmm, the same middle player doesn't get to play for 50% of the boss fight.  Guess who isn't coming back to play next time?

2) If the time penalty for failure is long, don't make progress dependent on losing to unforeseeable abilities.  It's not just that this game decided to make enemy intention not inherently visible by default (it's a game mechanic to see intention), a lot of enemies have abilities that make you learn that the clever thing you just did is about to bite you because it turns out that on THIS specific enemy it's a bad idea.  Sure, you know next time, but next time is 2+ hours away.  There's a reason enemy intent is visible in most games of this genre.

3) The enemy (essentially) takes more actions than you do.  One of the rules of multi-member-party RPGs is that the players can beat things because they get to take more actions.  In this game, the bosses get 3-4 actions, and after the first zone, standard mobs take 2 actions a turn.  This means you're up against about 8 cards a turn, into your own 8-12.  But isn't 12 greater than 8?  Yes it is, but your cards have less impact.  Enemies cards either hit more targets, or cause more effects per card, or both, almost out the gate.  The game essentially uses more energy worth of cards each turn than you do.

The idea appears to be to grind up your characters to make them more powerful eventually, but it's a slow, frustrating grind.  You have to enjoy the getting there, and the progress is just too annoying to be worth putting in the continued time.",1661147496,1661147496,False,5,0,0.486561506986618042,0,True,False,False

Only other complaint is we do get some disconnects during multi. about 3-4 in my 8 hours so far, but only once did it not save our last progress. It us unfortunate  if it happens during a fight though as it makes you restart the fight.

The few 'negative' reviews I seen talk about the game being too hard.., I'm sorry, but this game is really easy without any madness difficulty level added or without choosing any corruptions in fights.

Same goes for the monsters being immune for certain things, it's needed to have a form of challenge in the game. Once you figure out what build/item combinations are strong, the game actually becomes too easy. So we started to look for more non-conventional builds, like; frost/mage as a tank, with the new minstrel/hunter as a healer.

The game has great art, but that's personal taste. I love the new perk tree, makes for better customization. It's fun to try and make cool build/item combinations. Mind damage priest, that applies burning when he applies sight, and applies sight when he applies dark. So the items start activating each other.

Try to make it more challenging for yourself by doing all the possible corruptions (extra difficulty level, different in each fight, where u get unique corruption version of cards), and try new builds!

The cards, character level ups, and perks allow for a lot of variety, customization, and crazy combos. The game is overall really well polished and the devs really put a lot of heart into listening to the community. On top of that, I think it fixes the 2 things I hate most about Slay the Spire:

(1) This game has up to 4 player co-op and it's really fun to play with friends. The whole roguelike deckbuilder genre was lacking in any multiplayer, so whenever I wanted to play with friends, someone had to just backseat drive. In this game, there's an adventuring party of 4, so each person gets to control separate characters. A good party is not only well balanced, but also synergistic. You can have a healer that focuses on shields with a tank that deals damage based on shields, or you can have a bard that buffs a rogue who throws a bunch of knives.

(2) Slay the Spire had a lot of randomness and little control over the deck. You had to make do with the cards you were dealt and just cross your fingers for the right cards combo. If you wanted to try a specific combo, it was basicallly impossible. The story mode in Across the Obelisk lets you have a lot of control over what cards go in your deck, so it's much more reliable to go in with a plan and make broken builds, then try them at higher difficulties. If the unpredictability and RNG is important to you, this game might not be for you.

If you specialize your decks (as games like this encourage you to do to emphasize playing to the strength of your deck) you run the risk of fighting enemies who can't be bled with a bleed ranger deck, or enemies who resist fire with a fire specialized mage.

The one game I played took nearly 2 hours for me to get halfway through the second area, despite the fact I was just trying to kill the enemies as quick as possible without min/maxing the +1-5% status resistance/debuff effects.

You are definitely going to be overwhelmed whether it be from lack of damage/defenses, lack of speed, or how much enemies heal/dispel—they try their hardest to be as annoying as possible to the point where you will hit a wall with an encounter.

Even before you've unlocked any of the other characters, as you have 4 characters you'll spend your life in menus configuring your deck, accessories, perks, etc etc for each of them.  You get a certain amount of resources to upgrade your deck, remove cards, buy accessories.  However, anything you buy only lasts for that one game.  I played three complete runs through.  The first time I didn't realise the resource mechanic worked this way (no instructions on it at all), so when I started a new run, none of that gold was there and I'd already 'claimed' the resources from my previous run so that run was literally a waste of my time.  You don't have an overarching character that gets the resources, they're only claimed once you actually start a run.

The second run, I got to the end but I honestly can't remember if I beat the big tree boss, I don't think so, but I got some good loot which I used to buy a bunch of card upgrades, extra cards, ban a few and buy some equipment (which took ages as you have to do it for 4 characters) However, even with all the upgrades and cards I had bought using the resources from the last run, this time through I actually got less resources than the time before even with all the upgrades etc.  
To reiterate, when you complete a game the only thing that remains persistent is the resources, which you claim when you have started your next run.  If after upgrading loads of stuff you end up with less resources than the previous run, then what's the point?  I'm literally making zero progress as any upgrades I made previously are gone again now. 

If I'm mistaken about any of this persistence, then that's because the game gives you zero information on mechanics like this and you have to figure it out for yourself. 

Additionally, with 4 players to deal with, and the fact it's a pain to try and manage them all at once, it's very difficult to get any kind of synergy without clicking every single character every single turn to see what they have in their hand.  This is where multiplayer would be great, as I've seen streams of the Yogscast playing it and does seem like fun but I'm a solo kind of player and on your own it just seems like, well, work.

Certainly in single player, the game seems more heavily weighted towards luck rather than skill unless you want to analyze stats, cards and characters and spend ages every single turn just to make a strategy.  
After three runs through, which took ages, and I seem to have less progression than I did the game before, I'm tired of this already.  Perhaps if I manage to find some friends who want to play with me and I become a beautiful social butterfly I will enjoy this, but until then, I'm just bored already.

I tried the Obelisk mode, but it has some really in depth configuration before you start playing and honestly after 10 minutes messing about sorting stuff for all the characters I just ran out of patience and quit.  Particularly as this is another area where the game introduces you to something new and tells you absolutely nothing about it and just leaves you to figure it out, which considering each run takes so long, is just unacceptable.",1660997313,1660998538,False,4,0,0.479745924472808838,0,True,False,False

Game:
This game starts off slow. 
In the beginning you have few cards to choose from you slowly unlock more cards for each class. 
You will unlock cards that can alter the way you see your class and vary how you play them. 
Threw out each run you will be working towards unlocking new chars and clearing the boss at each floor.
New chars are hard to unlock but will change how you play that role and cards that you thought where bad or dont fit with the class will start to make sense. 
Each floor has its own challenges that you will have to find your way to over come.
Theres a town between each floor where you can upgrade your cards (2 different variations), change some out, buy items to up grade your character and level up your account from beating the boss that help make the game easier.

Pros:
great with 4 friends!!!!
great options for each class and each char with in the class 
   -i was using the healer that later turned in to a anti healer big holy dmg dealer 
Cards Feel powerful 
Healthy game play mechanics
  -never felt cheated or robbed 
each class feels impactful and usefull
Experimenting with each char to see where the exceed with what cards 

Cons;
Difficult
limited in early game for cards
  -because of this i know it will turn ppl away its hard to see what is possible.
takes along time to get good cards
   -16hrs in and i only have a few for each class
limited money to upgrade cards before each run
  -if they gave a bit more really help open up the game more in early stages of the game.

conclusion:
Overall we love it 
Not a big fan of card games either played a bit of slay the spire and others like it and id say this is my fave!
Its not perfect  it has a slow start because of lack of funds to upgrade cards and due to lack of cards in early part of the game. 
found it difficult to unlock chars due to gate kept by a mini boss that hits like a truck
grab a few friends and try it out stick with it and you will love it 

GOOOD LUCK ;)

I would like to tell you more about the game play, but I can barely tell what is happening most of the time. I normally am pretty patient with games, but this one is frustrating the heck out of me.

First of all, there is no tutorial to explain mechanics. The game assumes you helped design the game even though you've never played it before. There is a glossary that tell you some things, but it in now way describes how the game systems work. You are left guessing on what does what.

So far, I just click on cards and hope for the best. Most of the time, I'm not even sure what was supposed to happen. It sure doesn't help when it's the AI's turn to go, and it plays through it's cards at nearly the speed of light, and all you notice is your hit point bars now have 2 or 3 colors on them, and is now shorter. You also need to have the reading speed of someone in the Guiness book of world records. I checked the options, and I don't have the checkbox checked to speed up the game.

Good job Devs. You can kiss my ass.

My last game ended with my entire party getting wiped out, and I don't have the slightest clue how.

If you are a natural speed runner, this game may appeal to you. If you like to just relax and enjoy things at your own pace, forget it.

There are little tiny bars and pips on the screen that are not explained,  nor are there tool tips that give you a clear description of what they are. The UI is hard to figure out and adds to the mystery. If you want to play this, I suggest you spend a lot of time on message boards or videos explaining things if you want the slightest clues of what is happening.

I spent many hours in Slay the Spire and similar games, and figured those out just fine.

The music is also terrible. It's like a bunch of kids in grade school band practice tooting their horns and twanging some strings. It doesn't fit fantasy at all. It barely qualifies as miserable elevator music. You would expect the music to change once you enter combat, but nope. It's still twing twang happy music that gets on your last nerve.

If unicorns were in this game, they wouldn't be farting rainbows. All you would get is a ""toot"", and you wouldn't have any idea which unicorn just cut one. They would just stare at you waiting for your take on the book War and Peace. Then they would blame you for being confused.

There are tutorial ""messages"" that do tell you things like ""This is a town. It is where you buy things"" and ""This is the info screen. It has info on it."" How quaint.",1660942466,1660942466,False,4,5,0.40609431266784668,0,True,False,False

^^ This was the review in early access.

BUT it is not the most beginner friendly game, as the ice area (blue portal) and act 4 are a bit too difficult currently. New players should go to the green and red portals, not the blue. It is somewhat unbalanced for the ice area and the act 4 even on madness level 0. Some act 4 corruption challenges need to be reworked as some are impossible even on madness level 0 (level 3 and 4 corruption). Someone new in the game should avoid the corruption challenges in act 4 or the run may be doomed. 

As a new player, if you're fine with not being able to finish a run until your 3rd or 4th try then go ahead and try it.

Lots of content and build variety. and I'm very impressed with the amount of characters. The roles of each party member work great in a multiplayer setting overall, and though not everyone would expect it to, the multiplayer element definitely adds a lot here. Which is fantastic. 

Though the positives /way/ outweigh the negatives, I do have some problems with it, and I would say some of the things need refurbishing before it's truly a finished product:

1) Enemy Resistances
It feels like there are too many damage types and enemies being resistant to things feels very counter-intuitive in a deck-builder where you can't easily switch your deck. In some other games, an enemy might be resistant to fire. Ok - then you can pull out a frost blade or something. In a deck-builder you can't just... Change your damage type completely. There are some cards, yes (Evelyn's 'Elemental Weapons' card does this to some degree) but you can't expect it to be done easily. It just needs to be removed. I don't want to add 5 damage types to my deck 'just in case' all the time; sometimes I want to focus. Focused builds are fun.

2) Immunities to Bleed, Poison, etc.
This one is simple. It never feels fun to build completely around - for example - poison, and someone is just immune to it. ...Ok? If you can't change your deck mid-battle, what's the point? It adds some layer of tactics choosing where you go to - sure - but it brings a negative experience and dissuades the player from using certain deck types. It takes away more than it adds; just remove things being immune to certain elements, even if it should make 'sense'. In Slay the Spire you can poison a blob for example, and nobody's complaining about /that/.

3) Stop purging my debuffs so often!
Also sort of adding to '2', the one time I /do/ build up a lot of poison or bleed... So many enemies seem to be able to just remove it all! This really isn't fun and makes you feel punished for not playing an 'unga bunga' deck. Either seriously limit which enemies can purge debuffs, or don't make them purge every point of the debuffs (maybe 25 or something). It isn't like the game is lacking difficulty.

4) Needs better game feel
In terms of sound effects, the impact and effects when your character makes a hit, the animation when things die... I'm not suggesting things should explode into gore with an ULTRAKILL!! combo meter or anything. Just make it feel and sound a bit better to hit things. It goes a long way.

5) Speed is an issue for tanks
A lot of the game relies on your tank going first so you can block before the enemies hit you. I wouldn't say the issue is 'game-breaking' and you can still counteract it with speed buffs and equipment, but I think there just needs to be less 'slow' debuffs by enemies in general, and you should be able to stack speed better. Or tanks should have higher base speed overall. There's just a point where it feels inevitable that your tank is never going to be able to do their job. Other roles always seem to work fine despite speed, though, it's just tanks mainly.

6) Music & Writing
Might just be a personal preference, but the music and writing style of this game could stand to go up a notch. It all comes together to feel a bit... Childish, with the high saturation, when I'd say this is a game that appeals to more mature audiences. We don't need Darkest Dungeon gritty lovecraftian writing, but I think things could be reconsidered and taken a bit more seriously. The music reminds of flash games, which - whilst it has some kind of charm to it - isn't a soundtrack with any 'bangers' in for certain.

Initial 15 cards are mostly useless, because it's simply 3 set of cards putting together, if you want to only use one set? not possible unless you have played at least 5-6 times. Then you have enough resources to make a set for one hero. But you have 4 hero to go.  Why I need to spend several hours to just get a playable set for a hero? 

Secondly, your card are just weaker than the enemy, the difference become bigger the later act. 

Thirdly, the card upgrade is problematic, you can spend quite a lot resources to upgrade one card, and you got 2 choices, in most case, your card is slightly better after upgrade, but your energy to damage/heal rate will drop in certain upgrade choice.  The resource to upgrade higher tier card is just ridiculous compare to lower tier. We are talking not 4 or 5 times, but 20-30 times more. 

Fourthly, the shield is just useless in most case given you don't see which of your hero will be attack by enemy, even with some special card to show enemy action, you still don't know who will be attack in most of the case.  

I can continuously list way more problem in the design or balance.  But I won't waste more time here.

I wish this was designed differently.

Throughout the game you will find random events scattered on the map and they are almost always super bad. Like sometimes straight up game ruining bad if you should randomly fail them. And the reward you get for succeeding isn't even close to worth it. I find myself mostly just ignoring these if possible so far.

There's also such a large amount of status effects that it sort of ruins things. It's too easy to be offered cards that just don't work with the build you are going for. You are making a poison deck? Here is a bunch of cards that do shadow damage instead. Going for a stealth build? Sorry don't got that anymore, but we do have 80 other effects to choose from. It's also easy to build a deck that suddenly doesn't work against the enemy because they are immune to your build. Made a bleed deck? What were you thinking, dummy? All these trees are immune to that. Too bad for you.

There is a lot to love here, but sadly for me this game just isn't anywhere near as good as the games it's compared to.

It has deck building, you progress through a global stage, and you use cards that interact with each other. If that seems vague that's because those are the only similarities between these two games. Ultimately I would say this game is kind of a mixture of Darkest Dungeon and a deck builder, partially combined with the effect system of Divinity (water makes lightning attacks stronger, etc), however to break down further here are my thoughts.

Positives:

- Game has an interesting style of art to it
- The four party building four different decks is actually kind of cool. It's akin to Darkest dungeon and it works for the game, it's fun to have different units doing different things.
- The ability to start a run with a partially built deck is a neat idea, and can help with some of the Slay the Spire issues of having to tough it out with a bad deck.

Negatives:

- Game is way too bloated, to a convoluted scale. That system I mentioned above of the Divinity type of combo cards, is just way to much there are like 20+ status effects in the game with 90% counteracting one another. While also having just confusing systems, like burns and bleeds ticking at the beginning of an enemies turns, but poisons ticking after which I'll cover more in my next point. Also as a small adendum, scry skills that let you see the enemies deck is completely useless as half the time enemies don't even have cards before their turn starts so you don't know what they're going to use on you until they use it. 

- There is little counterplay to the enemies in this game. Blocks drop off whenever a round resets, however the game has an initiative system, so if your tank or block spammer has low initiative (which the tanks do) then the enemies will all attack you before you can apply blocks. Similarly the enemies both spam constant purges to remove your debuffs, and apply dozens onto you while you can remove maybe one or two at most in a turn. To add as a last point, poisons suck, the reason they're great in Slay the Spire is because the tick on the enemy at turn start, but when an enemy can do its full damage set (potentially wiping your party, purging the poison, or healing) it makes it a worthless skill.

- Immunities/resistances. The game has resistances and immunites which enemies have innate, and in a game like this all I have to ask is ""WHY IN THE ACTUAL F**K?!"" This is why I compare it to Divinity a bit, if an enemy has a resist or immunity you can at least during one turn or before the battle switch weapons, or try and counter play. However in a roguelike where the game seems to want you to go towards one specific debuff/attack type to maximize damage, and where you get only ONE card after battles, it's a huge middle finger to be like ""Oh sorry you built a bleed deck, all of these enemies are immune to bleed, sorry."" The towns at the start are meant to somewhere mitigate this by allowing you to reroll a bit, but rarely will you end a zone with enough crystals/gold to specialize for a zone.  It's honestly the WORST design decision of this game and the biggest reason I am refunding it.

- The next biggest reason is the difficulty scale. This game isn't conceptually hard, you use cards, do damage, and try and outheal the enemy damage. But my word, I ran into a random event near the end of the first zone where I fought an enemy whose health matched that of the boss of the zone, and he would summon help every few turns. All of these enemies combined did easily triple my damage while I had no counterplay as blocks are useless when the enemies all have bonus initiative, and debuffs for days. This isn't even the only instance of difficulty either, the game will at times give you challenges which you can choose to do with a debuff for a bigger reward, or fight normally for ease. In the second zone I went to (the fire one) I got a max difficulty event that I did with the debuff on and it was significantly easier than a challenge that was only 2 on the difficulty scale that I did not have the debuff turned on for. I went into fights that were regularly as hard as the first boss.

- Too much RNG/useless choices... Why do I have to go into an already random event and roll to see my outcome? A roll which can literally kill a run if you're unlucky... Why even give me the choice if it doesn't matter. Further more there are also some blantantly useless choices, such as sneaking up on the boss. An effect that gives you an initiative bonus (which you also get from charging the boss) and stealth, and while the stealth seems good as it makes you untargetable... it dispells if you use any skills... and remember YOU HAVE AN INITIATIVE BONUS....

Honestly I could rant about this for paragraphs and paragraphs more, and power to people who like this game, but it just isn't there for me, and I appreciate the work the devs put into it, but some suggestions if you are interested.

- Trim the fat, get rid of half of these status effects. 1 damage more or 1% increases in damage (which btw 1% of 10 is 0.1, doesn't appear to round up from what I saw and most skills aren't high damage) are useless. If you want deck synergy then really add deck synergy, lightning on water can cause stuns, or much higher damage onto spells, but purge the water debuff when you pop it. Or maybe it spreads a debuff that takes away energy from enemies. Have frost on a wet target freeze them. This might also promote deck synergy between your allies, rather than having each one be poorly specialized. It's okay if a combo is OP, because if they are then you actually don't really need to adjust enemy health or damage, because like in Divinity you could potentially stun lock an enemy out of a turn. Ontop of this, turn down the purges the enemies have, if you give the player access to ""this skill purges one debuff from one teammate"" give the same stuff to the enemies instead of what they have ""This skill purges all debuffs from every ally, gives +50 healing, and debuffs the enemy""

- Get rid of resistances/immunities. This isn't Divinity, this is a roguelike, I can't rebuild my entire team in one town visit with the amount of resources provided, don't screw me over because I exclusively got bleed cards in act one and all of the tree bosses are immune to bleeds.

- Remove the roll mechanic in scenarios, and just give the player a choice, you can still even add RNG elements to it. Don't potentially ruin a run because I clicked the ""run away from this overwhelming hard fight"" and you went ""Nah you fight it, but now with no initiative."" That's risk versus reward, you can even still add themed stuff to it like slay the spire does an example is the eerie stone in slay the spire, which you can ignore or if you have a high damage card you can break it for gold. They even have events that give you negatives if you don't have the right cards, can do that just fine.

- Make unlocking cards more consistent, did multiple playthroughs and before my refund I was getting one or two new cards between all 4 of my characters every other fight or so, which with how long a run can take was like 20 minutes a card.

- Actually make your speed up mode fast... it's way too slow, a fun of a roguelike isn't spending 3 1/2 hours in a three fightso nly to lose and realize you have to do it all again.",1660808765,1660808765,False,203,18,0.534633100032806396,0,True,False,False

I'm not the world's best deckbuilder player but I'm good enough to beat games like Monster Train on lower difficulty levels. I've seen other reviews describe this game as a slog and that's probably the best word for it in its current state. The first act is decently balanced, but even there one enemy encounter type (Stumpies and Dryads) give you a preview of the issues to come; those issues being too many debuffs, massive enemy health pools and your own attacks not doing enough. I've lost count of how many times I've grumbled ""Is everything an AOE with a stacking debuff attached?"" or watched pretty much every enemy bypass the starting tank character and constantly pick on the mage/priest in the back. Barricade helps, but only so much. 

There are also some UI issues and grammatical errors. A skull will appear on enemies' health bars if your debuffs like poison and bleed are going to kill an enemy. I've seen that skull appear and yet an enemy live through its turn and be able to heal itself. I'm not sure if it's a translation issue but it took me a bit to parse ""on enemy sides"" to mean ""does X to adjacent enemies."" 

It's little polish issues like those on top of the aforementioned slog that gets the ol' thumbs down from me. A hearty balance pass fand some UI/grammar cleanup and I could see myself revising this to a thumbs up.

It has a deck, cards and paths you can choose and that's about where the major similarities end.  If you enjoy deck building and figuring out fun combos, get this game.

I think this is a really well thought out game, with tons of different combinations and play styles that you can do. With the full release they just updated the talent tree to even allow people to play more varied play styles. This game is certainly challenging, but as you play more, you learn more about the game and your characters all gain more perks. In addition you can carry over resources from play through to play through to make the next run easier.

I get this game isn't for everyone. I think single player it might be a lot to manage.  It might play longer than some people expect, I would consider each full run to take like 3-4 hours, more or less depending on skill levels and if you just get stomped by something. Maybe there are just too many options for some people as well.

The map layouts are the same each run through, but the events on the maps change, which really can influence the flow of where you want to go.  Additionally they have a randomized map mode that is also quite challenging and worth poking at.

Personally, I think this game is great, I've been playing since early access and looked forward to see what they do with it.  I think this game plays best with friends, but I'd still suggest single player.

But it's not a game I would introduce to my friends, nor do I want to play solo.  I'm sure a lot of people would love it, but how could I possibly recommend it, given that?

I think as a deckbuilder, compared to Slay the Spire or Monster Train, this game doesn't measure up despite some of the great ideas it offers (like leveling up the town where you can level up cards and such).  The crux of my issue is that the game requires me to manage 4 decks.  Griftlands did something similar, but the decks had nothing to do with each other (inside rant here).  This game, however, offers potential with building decks to synergize with each other.  I wish all the players out there who enjoy this game the best of times building those synergies.

However, I'm a purest with my deckbuilding and believe a deck should never require planning about what's in other decks to create it.  The best designed decks should be little gods in their own right, not mere props to help other decks work properly.  And the fun with a roguelike deckbuilder is struggling to make that little god deck despite the RNG throwing curve balls.

But that's just me.

It's fun, it's hard but not too hard, and there's so much stuff to find, so many secrets, so many decks, it's just amazing. 

It's an extremely replayable game. Even some good rogue-likes feel repetitive when you have to start over again, but with AtO I found I was looking forward to it. With multiple pathways through each map, different items and secrets to find, and a bunch of different options for your decks it doesn't get boring. Keep in mind you have 4 characters and each character has their own deck- and each deck has a lot of different options. Characters level up over runs and you unlock extra stuff like new items and pets. Now that all the characters and levels are out I can only imagine how much extra content there is from when I played it.


At roughly the same time I played Inscription, Monster Train, and Across the Obelisk. Tho all three are deck builders each game was different from one another. They had their own unique identities, and I felt that Across the Obelisk was easily on par with those other games.

The team building from 4 classes, the unique characters with different specialties, the different maps and biomes, the level up choices, the light roleplay elements and overworld events. Across The Obelisk does all of them, and it does them right.

[b]Team Building[/b] There are 4 classes with 4 characters, and no restrictions on the team composition. If you want to roll with 4 mages or make the tank your backliner, you can do it. It's fun to experiment with different lineups and synergies.

[b]Overworld[/b] After several dozens of roguelikes, I'm kind of over the Slay The Spire style map. The detailed overworld with different biomes is refreshing - and informative. You'll get markers for quest lines and character unlocks, and different nodes for uncommon/rare/epic events. The events grant resources, gear, pet & character unlocks, but can also add curses to your decks. Every character has a few unique dialogue options, many of which bypass the skill check and/or give special rewards. 

[b]Deckbuilding[/b] Each character starts out with a default deck that can be modified before starting a run (depending on funds and unlocks). Each run grants two resources - gold (used for gear, pets, card removal) and shards (used for card upgrades, transmutations between the 2 upgrade paths, and unlocks); the more successful the last run was, the more funds you get. Decks can be saved and quickly crafted, and there's a generous amount of slots. Classes share a pool of available cards; each character has a few unique cards.

Each new biome/map starts in a village where you have access to the upgrade altar, church (card removal), armory (gear and pets). Valuable cards, special gear shops, removal, and free upgrades can also be earned by winning combats with Corruption challenges (optional trials like in Monster Train), so there is a good amount of opportunities to modify the decks on the way.

[b]Enemy Variety[/b] This is where many games in this genre, even pretty polished ones, fall short for me - and AoT doesn't. There's a good balance here. Runs always begin and end on the same maps; you know the first and last bosses you'll fight. Otherwise you pick a path through portals - you'll visit 2 out of 3 biomes each run. Each is centered around an element/damage type with different regular enemies and optional mini bosses; the final portal boss is always the same. You can somewhat reliably plan ahead for encounters or specific gear.

[b]Madness[/b] The Ascension/Covenant/however you want to call it. There are 10 levels and a list of modifiers ('mutators') to mix and match.

[b]Character Design[/b] Each character has their own gimmick, so even within a class, they don't feel same-y. While all can fill their respective roles, they do one thing much better than their peers (for example, mages specialize in different elements). The art is vibrant, the unique events and questlines give them personalities, and I'm just really happy that I can play a mindflayer with a pet beholder.

I have played hundreds of hours with my friends, and 95% of the time it's been a great time.  As others have noted, this is similar to other games like Slay the Spire, Monster Train, and has a perk system for each class and specific traits per character.  In all my time, I still have not unlocked every item or card.  Almost nonexistent on the bug aspect.  

There are different game modes such as Obelisk (Much more randomized, quicker) and the Campaign (can take ~4 hours sometimes).  The game is very liberal about saving, so you can always exit and pick up a run later.  Some characters do seem slightly more overpowered than others but they are always balancing.  Items make a huge difference and make for some really interesting builds, and one has to balance gold (for buying items) and shards (crafting/evolving cards).  
Randomized event choices impact unlocks or events in later maps.

It may be a little rough early on when you don't have perks for characters, but I enjoyed that gradual progress.  Also playing 4 characters by yourself and crafting all their decks can take some time, hence the Multiplayer aspect.  Some of the specific combats are spikey in difficulty (Harpies!), and some RNG can hit you hard and end a run. Some of the fights before Act bosses can be harder than the bosses themselves, once in awhile frustratingly so.

The art style is fun and quirky, and the writing humorous.  I'm still not tired of the game due to the extreme variability in each session, but I definitely have some favorite characters, and some have better synergy with others. 
There are scaling ""madness"" difficulty levels later on where you can customize your run's difficulty in exchange for more score rewards.  Highly recommend this game and it deserves far more attention than what it's received up to this point!

Great art and general theme of the game.
Fun events and story-telling with enough unique interactions to last 100s of hours.

This is an A tier roguelike deckbuilder, with the potential to be S tier (Slay the spire and Monster train being the only other 2 in S tier category)

Slow at first, and I was kind of frustrated and bored sometimes tbh, but it soon builds momentum after a few runs and getting used to the system. The cycle of unlocking cards, slowly building up character upgrades via items, and progressing through maps is almost perfectly balanced. I would say they need to give more random rarer cards early game, and less endgame, however. Early game sometimes feels like a slog, and then endgame by the time your deck is essentially built they throw epic after epic card at you, it's not paced quite right but still good enough. Card variety and design is great. Item variety is lacking, but that should be easy to add in future updates I'd think

If they fixed:
1. pacing/spacing out of cards
2. item variety (randomize, instead of essentially the same at the same places every time - maybe make an alternative procedurally generated type run like all the other roguelikes)
3. and just a tad bit more content

1.) If you try to resign from your current campaign while an enemy is taking their turn, the menu will close and the resign button will stop working, requiring you to restart combat and wait for enemies to finish their turns
2.) More of a gripe than a bug but you cannot attack a stealthed enemy when they are they are the last one on the battlefield. It's extremely annoying sitting there and passing your turn just waiting for stealth to wear off.

The encounters all seem fairly well balanced, a few hiccups but nothing major, and they all feel different.  This is even more true for the bosses that all have their own style of combat.  Each character also feels unique and when you do what your character wants, it can so much fun.  But is not a game I think you should play.

If you do want to try this game, I think it is near essential that you have someone to play with.  The amount of decision making that has to be done for each character is too much for one person to handle.  There are way too many status effects that have to be learned too and trying to learn every character at the same time would have made me go insane.

But now onto why I cannot recommend this game.  The last act, and in particular the final boss, is just a slog.  Whereas in the earlier acts where combats were fast and exciting, fights in the last act are just long and slow and boring.  The enemies just have way too much health and the amount of healing that they have access to makes these fights near impossible if one of your damage dealers goes down.  One enemy in particular comes to mind that revives when it dies and cleansing basically every debuff.  It just isn't fun when there's one enemy left that you need to spend another 3 round stacking debuffs on until you get a good enough hand to dpr them down before they heal back to full on their turn. 

The last boss suffers from something similar in that it just has way too much health.  The bosses damage output isn't even that high so there's no tension in the fight if you have a good healer, it just becomes turn after turn of slowly chipping away the boss' health, stacking debuffs and hoping against all hope that there isn't a second phase.  There is.  And it manages to be worse than the first one.  If you thought that 4k health was a lot, try 5.5k.  It's just way too long. 

This is a sad review to write.  Me and friend were having so much fun with this game.

(i almost did)

pro:
- multiple characters not just one
- perma progress ( gold from last run, town upgrades, you can remember mob attacks and pathing / quest. there are also perks.) -> this is the only reason i will keep playing this some more.
- visuals are decent. 

con:
- the decks are pretty superficial. shield, attack, elemental magic. every element has a resistance and can therefore be lowered. you see a pack of enemies, kill the lowest life guy or the guy who heals/shields/summons new guys first and if you get hit you shield /heal yourself. if you have one, you play the card that lets the other cards deal more damage first(those are obvious like ""deal +1 damage with other attacks""). thats about it. no cool combos or nice synergies. 
- i like when card games let you stack armor (no remove after turn) for the whole combat round. this one removes it. the little information about enemy attacks (when and who; see other ""con"" points below) amkes this worse.
- the upgrades are so little. town upgrades seem ok (havent tested them yet just read through them) but the card upgrades suck dick. example: you have a heal card on your heal char. you can upgrade to two ""upgraded versions"". you have to choose one. 1. you heal 10 instead of 8, 2.) you heal 9 instead of 8 AND your card costs no energy BUT it vanishes (meaning its one time play and gone for the whole round). so a vanishing heal card is like WTF xd (there are also ones that deal 2x damage -2 (aka 7*2=14 ; 14-2 =12) damage BUT cost twice the amount (which isnt really un upgrade either because of opportunity cost). and the mediocre 2 more heal (60-100hp on chars, enemies hit between 9 (trashmob) and 28 (boss) damage, average 15 (normal mob). 2 heal is like nothing since your enemies are also up to 4 AND each have multiple ""cards"" they play themselves. this wouldnt be as bad if the upgrade cost wasnt as high in relation to what you get. IMO. 
- you start with 15 cards per char and can remove cards in town in a building, but 15 is lowest limit. i find that a bit high AND would like to (am used to) being able to reduce my decksize at the very beginning. my heal char for example should have as little attack cards as possible. 
- your first run feels bad. without knowing i would get the gold at the end for next runs and having perks / other upgrades i almost quit the game (wouldnt have touched it anymore.) i guess some different difficulty gradient would be good (making it easier to reach and kill first boss but fucking you up mid-stage next area). so you coudl at least spend some stuff and ""accomplish"" smth.
- perk upgrades are the same. +7 life, +3 % allres. its basically neglectable and doesent feel good. i would rather have +20 life and +10 % allres and therefore much stronger enemies in the next area so i feel like ""nice, now im much stronger and can prob do it"". this way it feels like a grindfest for minor upgrades. IMO. 
- what i really hated was the reveal stuff. you have a card to reveal enemy cards (next attack). not everyone has it (heal and archer with your beginner setup) and the worst part: it is uselless. what do i mean by that? you do a reveal, you see two cards aboth the monster. one is some debuff bullshit, the other is an attack card. so what do you do now? nothing. you do the same as if you didnt know. because you dont know WHO will get debuffed and attacked (i should mention here that some cards can only attack front enemies so there are exceptions but for most of the time its useless.) and now the WORST implementation of it : if you reveal the next attack and the enemies are the first 4 guys in rota in next ROUND to attack, you simply DONT KNOW because the reveal only shows their actions of this round. so if you dont have more speed than your enemies its useless even if you reveal before the next round even begins. they might have the stack but you see nothing. why? bad game design IMO. also pls make them show a red line to the target they will attack when hovering over the cards once revealed. if thats would be a thing i could play a bit more strategically instead of ^^^point one of my criticism
- the card synergies are superficial. reduce resistance of whatever you wanna hit with. thats about it. there are also a couple of stupid cards like +2 global regen. meaning you give the enemies regen as well. (yes you also give everyone ""wet"" which increases lightning damage taken but the regen is stupid on its own). im also missing smth like a +3 heal for all heroes card (if thats in the game i would like it on first champ. its a standard thing in these games). 
- the monsters shield and heal a bit to much IMO (same or higher values than player chars)? summoning adds as well? no matter what, the strategy to kill the heal AND or the summoner first is a no brainer. no variation, you dont even have to think about it. 
- items also give such minor upgrades. +1 heal, +1 wet, etc. and cost alot. indifferent of the balancing ( like i said ,if you like, make enemies harder as well) it doesent feel rewarding. humans evolved to like big numbers :P. 
- i used the guy in my group in the event text choice (which you can only do if you have him with you) and still got a bad outcome? isnt it enough to give bad outcomes (RNG) with normal dialogues? cant my special dude at least give me a guaranteed good one? 
- not being able to spend your gold regularly in runs feels bad? there was only one ""trader"" icon (i assume) in my possible roads between start and boss AND that wasnt possible to take because i did the pig character thing and he needed me to kill the bandit (cant path to trade from there). either make it accessable at any time? or put in more tops with trades? feels bad to lose (especially first run without any upgrades) if you play perfectly and sit on 800 gold with no means to spend it. (a character item costs around 130 for example). i should mention here that the mode you are allowed to play at start has fixed path encounters (no random gen, its handplaced). later there is supposedly a random one as well. 

conclusion: it had some very annoying aspects, doesent feel to rewarding and the card decks arent to original, BUT i like the perma upgrades between runs (even if neglectable and grindy- wish they felt better) and the graphics are appealing (have seen worse). so i would barely recommend it. doesent touch the level of ""monster train"" or ""slay the spire"" or ""tainted grail"" or etc. IMO. play those first. 

Update: made it to area 3 now and i feel liek the game gets better  if you play it longer. if you know the immunities of the enemies in the areas and build around them it feels a lot less random. also the upgrades / items etc. on higher tiers get better. with more starting gold (perks) and the town upgrades you have much more variation in what to do. also the random encounters are plenty and therefore pretty interesting. also my bad that i thought my guy had a bad chance when he was the only one for the dialogue option...there are slot items that give you 100% chance AND you can see the chance when you hover over the dice. 
new conclusion: its actually pretty good :D i still dont like how the reveal works.",1659503451,1659565721,True,0,0,0.47826087474822998,0,True,False,True

otherwise it's a massive time sink
battles in the later stages are very long. With the different heals, shields, and dispels a character / monster can be brought back from the brink of death.
There are also too many status effects and combos to learn. There are 7 magical statuses (ice, fire, electric, water, insanity, darkness, holy), at least 6 physical statuses (bleeding, poison, target, broken armor, slow, weakened), 6 different buffs (regenerate, shield, block, bless, power, fury)
there are probably still more that i'm forgetting or haven't even seen yet

Most of those statuses are very similar with some variations (water makes you weaker to electric and removes fire, and insanity weakens a target)
some statuses don't really feel useful. Like bleeding and poison do the same thing except bleeding happens at the beginning of the turn and poison at the end (which means bleeding is always better?)
And every monster / hero has different natural defenses towards each weapon / magic attack

on top of this there are so many different synergies between heroes and monsters and combos between different cards

all of these things should make the game more fun but often it's just overwhelming
especially in battles that can last 20-30 minutes for some enemy types

the rogue like aspects of the game are pretty fun. It's great discovering new cards and abilities. Finding items to put on your character and leveling up the town so you can craft the good cards from the beginning.
the deck building is also enjoyable. trying to stuff your hero's decks with powerful cards but also keeping it trimmed down.

playing with a friend rescues some of the more painful parts of the game. now you can share the burden of managing character decks. you can also work together to decide how to divide up loot, what direction to take on the map or what decision to make in an event.
That big battle that lasted almost and hour now you can share the victory or defeat with someone else.

A combination of Darkest Dungeon and Slay the Spire, it lacks the charm or personality of either. It also feels like it is lacking some of the mechanics.

A core aspect of both games is the ability to see what enemies are about to do, and plan accordingly. Not only is this not provided by default, requiring a card play to do it temporarily, it also is fairly useless. In the ~3 hours I played, every attack was either ""hit front"" or ""hit random"" and so the correct course of action was ""play the defense stuff, and then play attacks with my leftover mana."" 

Battles in this game tend towards the long side, particularly given that almost every enemy comp features a healer in the back row. However they also tend to be blowouts- either you win hard, or you lose hard. The biggest reason for this I feel is that the game has what feels like a dozen status effects, yet enemies can dispel them with ease and most are marginal at best. Nothing feels ""good"" to do. There are so many cards with effects like ""turn poison into wet"" that could potentially let you, say, poison an enemy and then hit them with electric damage...to do like 3 extra electric damage. Which you would have dealt with the poison anyway. 

In my time playing, I saw no enemy repositioning effects, got no consumable items, and got microscopic level-ups to my characters. In addition, since you start from the beginning each run, there's no real feeling of growth or progress ala Darkest Dungeon.

Also, the event ""roll to see what happens"" trait is infuriating. Why add RNG to events? Why not just give me different choices with pros and cons? Instead you have a 41% chance to get a good effect, or a 59% chance to get utterly hosed. 

This game feels cobbled together from other games, but in a way that didn't quite grasp what made them good or special.

Positive notes- graphics are pretty good, interface is mostly smooth with some quibbles (why can you ignite party members?), and the quest variety is nice. Although I didn't play long enough to unlock any new characters, it looks like there's a good variety of those too.

Play this game if you really want a multiplayer deckbuilder. If you're solo, play any of the other ones instead.",1658979755,1658979755,False,15,0,0.508262574672698975,3,True,False,True

For example, take healing: do you want to build up the bless buff to push out direct heals while also healing your damage dealers (esp. the multihit damage dealers)? Or would you rather build regeneration so you can carve out some action economy for other stuff? Or maybe you'd prefer to develop the sanctify debuff, which heals your team when they hit an afflicted foe? Or you could trigger heals from specialized skills or equipment...there are a lot of possibilities, and that's just for healing.

I think it being a roguelite kind of works against it at the start, as it really limits your early runs until you have unlocked most of the cards to make a synergistic deck, which can make your early runs feel like a waste of time.

This has quickly skyrocketed into being one of my favorite games of all time, even without being in its final state. The combat is very enjoyable, with build variety being incredibly diverse, fun to create, and engaging. The amount of time that can be put into building your preferred deck on each character, or even for each run, can range from brief thought experiments to deep interaction between characters.

Characters: Each character is diverse, with their own starting deck and equipment, and each is fun to play for their own reasons. I personally love going through old areas with new characters I have just unlocked, I usually find that the characters either have their own unique interactions with the area, or even better they have interactions with other characters. Without getting into any spoilers: I was delighted when I brought two healers in my party to the area that I unlocked one of them, because my new character offered to show my old one around and teach him one of his spells. It seems like such a small interaction, but it made me realize how much effort and love was put into this game.

Locations: The areas involved in the game are all beautiful and engaging for their own reasons, least of which is the variety of enemies that can be encountered. Each area has around a dozen or more different unique things for you to fight. This includes Bosses, sub bosses, as well as unique and standard enemies each possessing their own tactics that they use inside of the fight. The events are my favorite part of each area though, ranging between simple choices of whether to rest or forage, housing unique interactions between your characters and npcs, or engaging events for you to take on or interact with. Many even have the chance to give you additional choices in later events.

Multiplayer: The multiplayer is unbelievably fun to play with a friend, especially if you are able to talk with each other and plan out what you are doing. My fiance and I play this game together, and trying out different characters and party compositions has kept us entertained for dozens of hours. The way it resolves conflict between players when you want to go different directions or to pick different actions in events is in itself a fun interaction to me. I have not played alongside anyone else, so sadly I cannot speak about how good or bad it is playing alongside randoms or people who you cannot speak with during the run.

Equipment: Equipment can be everything to a build, ranging from simple damage increases, immunity to certain effects, a mixture of the two, adding special things that happen at the start or end of combat, start/end of each turn, or even drawing cards when you take certain actions. Certain pieces of gear are guaranteed from events or fights, others you simply have to stumble across throughout the game.

The cards and classes themselves: Each class has access to a list of specific cards which you can get through combat, events, completing quests, or by creating them at the town after you've discovered them. The cards themselves vary wildly even inside of classes, allowing for diverse options to choose from. You can play a warrior who never plays attacks, instead choosing to specialize in defense or buffing your allies. You could also choose to rely on slashing attacks, causing high damage or causing your opponents to bleed with each strike. Choose a mage who only utilizes one damage type, or choose to use all of them. Play as a scout who relies on stealth and evasion to avoid damage, dealing damage through the use of small weapons. Alternatively you can use poison to whittle down your foes. Priests are each varied with what they choose to do, those most heal in some way or another even if they choose not to run many healing spells. Apply debuffs that heal anyone who attacks them while dishing out high holy damage. Heal allies by applying defense to them, or when you apply specific debuffs to enemies. Whether you choose to go pure healing or pure damage, you are still more than likely going to be supporting your teams health bars.

Story: While it isn't finished yet I do enjoy what elements of the story we have been able to see so far. From the start of the game upon hearing your quest, to the final boss, the game kept me engaged to the point of wanting more. Personally I wish that there was more along the way, mostly it is in the title cards when you complete and travel across the obelisks, but I am hoping that it will be added to when the game is fully released. Side stories along the way are fun and engaging narratives. Usually accompanied by a quest, as well as some loot, they provide nice plots to carry you through each area and try new routes.

Overall: I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys roguelites or deck building games. If you don't know whether you do or not, I think this could be a fantastic game to start testing the waters with. As mentioned previously this has quickly become one of my favorite games, and I sincerely hope that it continues to grow in popularity. As the game develops I eagerly await to see what the developers plan to do. I will continue to enjoy this game in early access, and excitedly await the release of the full game.",1658065016,1658065016,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It should say a lot that, according to Steam, ~46% of players have beaten the game! That is a difficult task that requires both a long time investment and some clever thinking. It shows that, while it may be a niche game, it really sets its hooks in you with its compelling strategy puzzles.

The reason you would pick this game over the titans of the genre (Slay the Spire or Monster Train) is because of its variety and complexity. 

The game's biggest appeal is also, however, my only gripe with recommending it. It was a hard learning curve for me. The first hour I was not having much fun, and spent most of it just reading tooltips and tracking stats. I thought, ""There is too much going on with too many stats/percentages/buffs for me to possibly keep track of it all"", and that left me feeling like my choices didn't matter very much. My enemies would be Burning, Bleeding, Poisoned, Weakened, Insane, Frozen, Shocked all at once - and that's just some of the debuffs! But, after a few more hours, I finally got to grips with all the conditions and card-text in the game, and now I feel like a mad genius when playing. I found that the game is actually very cleverly designed and each of the many stats/conditions are there for a reason.

I have some neutral comments about the game, too. These factors just depend on what kind of player you are and whether these are pros/cons for you: 
* Runs are LONG. My runs have taken me anywhere between 1-3 hours depending on how far I get. I pause lots and have no problems picking up where I left off the next day.
* The battles themselves can be LONG too. Usually between 5-10 minutes. This can be a little tiresome, but it does mean all the statuses and buffs have a chance to shine.
* Controlling 4 characters really can feel like playing 4 separate games of chess at once, AND you want them to synergize with each other. I liked this aspect of the game, but other players might find it overwhelming.
* The game is quite generous with card drafting/removal/upgrading opportunities. You have plenty of room at the start of a run to buy/remove whichever cards as you want. This is fun because it opens a lot of build options right out the gate,
* This is very much a META-PROGRESSION game. You will not beat the game on your first try - not even close! The game is balanced around meta-progression upgrades to your characters' cards and perks after each run. I thought this was a fun and balanced difficulty curve but others may find it disheartening knowing they can't win on their first few tries.


After 25 hours I still feel like I am unlocking lots of new cards and that there are dozens of strategies/builds I haven't tried yet. It may get boring eventually, and I may discover imbalances here and there, but so far it has been A+ deckbuilder. I even personally prefer it to Slay the Spire, the reason being that I get to manage 4 synergistic decks in this game as opposed to StS' single, streamlined, thin decks. 

I think I am going to put this game down for the time being but come back to it with each new update. I'm excited to see new characters and encounters added, even though there is already a ton of content. You will not be disappointed picking it up in Early Access.",1657840414,1657840414,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The fact that this feature works seamlessly and functions perfectly should really be commended most highly.

Pushing aside the above, Across the Obelisk is a well designed deck builder with a beautiful aesthetic and lovely characters. It combines 'Slay the Spire' style map progression with story based events, that really make it feel like you are part of a living world.

The combat plays very similarly to 'Monster Train' but one of the best things about this game, especially when you are playing multiplayer is those moments when multiple players work together to pull off a victory from a seeming defeat. 

If you have always wanted to share your love of deck building games with friends or loved ones I would highly recommend Across the Obelisk as a way of introducing them to the genre, and the best thing is you get to join them on the adventure to!",1657723633,1657723633,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True
