I didn't have time to enjoy going through the enemies and building. The update I have played strictly alone. I like that it's painstaking. It's not impossible, but even on easy mode with no base attacks, I am struggling. I enjoy that I can't powerhouse through this game and I get to enjoy learning to play.

It has a real fun game play loop, which is, admittedly, better with friends, but the exploration, crafting, and survival mechanics are solid. You can customize your experience by adjusting enemy, survival, raid, and loot options. I've been having a blast with the game. 

The looting system definitely needs to be fixed. It is rather frustrating to be looting junk, run out of inventory space, and have all of the contents of what you were looting drop on the ground. This happens a lot when I am filling up the chests at my base, and I click on a stack to move to a container, and instead of moving only the number of items that fit in the chest... it puts what fits in the chest, and then bumps the rest of the stack on the ground. I have also been known to accidentally hit the take all button when I have a full pack, and dump the entire contents of one of my chests on the floor in front of me. ugh... that is annoying.

The combat system is rather basic, and the AI is kind of stupid. If you can get enemies into the water, they can't swim down, so you can get under them and attack up, making them incapable of attacking you or defending themselves. I think they are working on enemy AI, though.

The trader system is pretty good, once you get used to it's intricacies. You can haggle with them a bit, and play around to get the best deal possible out of them. It almost reminds me of trading good in Morrowind.

Some progression blueprints are tide to exploration, which is nice, because I have been known to neglect exploration when I get into a good survival loop. I have also found various ways to sneak into enemy bases and rob them blind without needing to engage them in combat. I like being able to find ways to complete things which the developer may not have intended. I think it makes the exploration all the more rewarding.

With all of the things the dev has planned, I am hopeful for the future of this game.",1708722968,1708722968,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Unfortunately, right now (2/23/24) it has only around 15 amazing hours of great playtime with well made progression, and about 10 more hours worth of grinding for guns which this game makes only somewhat fun. Though it is clear this game does need more updates, I still really enjoyed it, and it reminds me of Subnautica early access days. Of course this game does have a core gameplay loop more similar to Rust. I do think that the gun crafting system and obtaining iron is extremely grindy, but as long as the devs cut down on this a bit once more content is added, I don't think it's a big deal.

   I would love to see advanced blueprints/advanced guns used in later mission islands, and make the gun scrapping system less random. Furthermore, it'd also be great to be able to actually find guns occasionally, even if they are just crappy ones. 

   My biggest complaint for this game however, is that it absolutely SUCKS to complete an island and either 1. make multiple trips back to my base to save the loot or 2. sort through and leave behind alot of loot. I had the best backpack, which definitely isn't enough, and it's not like Subnautica where you can make bases which are closer to the later game content. Instead, the islands are all spread out on the East side of the map, and unlike Subnautica's formula where late game content follows a certain path/direction, your base is guaranteed to be far away from many islands which you will need to visit.",1708713087,1708713087,True,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

The game is too heavily dependent upon finding blueprints to craft items and upgrades and can become frustrating when the thing you need most can’t be found. Beyond shooting at NPC’s there is no interaction in the game other than a single trading outpost with a character that has only one line of dialog and is automated rather than interactive.  Most players prefer multiplayer but that’s also where most of the bugs are. Single player has been pretty stable at least for me. The graphics are pretty good.  Basically it’s kill the NPC’s on an island and harvest resources that you can find by diving while killing an occasional shark and diving to harvest resources that you can find on an island in order to build a base and make food to stay alive.  At first it’s engaging but between finding blueprints and gathering resources it becomes an exercise of rinse and repeat.,1708629761,1708629761,True,1,0,0.508684873580932617,0,True,False,True

Co-op has been fun. Buddies and I usually experience one small crash once every session. Usually a few hours of gaming with the one crash. Some minor bugs that aren't to much of an annoyance. 

The grind to get some of the needed materials is pretty crazy. We have mined almost the entire map of iron and now are stuck getting literally 4 or 5 iron nodes every couple days with the re-spawn rate being so low. 

The enemy raids are bit on the interesting side sometimes, very buggy on occasion. We ended up turning frequency down as we would get raided every single day and couldn't leave the base at the normal raid set. 

Would I recommend this game. Sure its not bad and were its going is promising in the two or three weeks we've played it has gotten two bigger updates and one small patch. Shows promise. Keep it up dev

Let's dive into the world of Sunkenland, a survival game that takes you on an underwater journey. It's not just about staying alive; it's about thriving in an aquatic wonderland with friends. Whether you're a solo explorer or prefer a squad, Sunkenland offers a fresh take on survival gaming, blending the thrill of the unknown with the camaraderie of cooperative play.

I usually don't go for underwater games, but Sunkenland got me hooked. It has Rust vibes and Raft feels. Whether it's island domination, spelunking in underwater ruins, gathering resources, racing friends on jet ski's, or just exploring the map, Sunkenland keeps the gameplay varied and engaging.

But, no game is without its quirks. Sunkenland could really use an ""Unstick Button"" – because who hasn't found themselves frustratingly trapped in a game's landscape? And the game would be even better with a shared server option, allowing friends to join in even when the host is off adventuring IRL. More options for character customization would be the cherry on top, along with options to change the players point of view, and – dare I dream – underwater bases and tunnel building!

What really stands out in Sunkenland is its innovative approach to survival gaming.  I've mostly left the building to a friend – watching their joy in construction is a game in itself – but the experience of collaborating on a base is where Sunkenland truly shines.

In its current form, Sunkenland is a gem with room to grow and evolve. I'm eagerly awaiting the future updates the developers have in store.

Wishlist (as of 2/20/2024):
-An ""Unstick Button"" for those awkward moments.
-Shared server play, please!
-More character customization – we love options!
-Ability to plant trees outside of planters – let's add a shovel.
-Changeable point of view for a better perspective.
-Underwater bases and tunnels? Bring it on!
-To move the darn boat changing color option! I have a talent of going through 5 colors in 1 boat ride..
-The trader having a rotating selection of goodies! 
-Speaking of the trader... Can we please drag and drop the items we're selling? It's a lot of clicking..
-Splitting items from Chests/Dead Bodies/Looted area! It would help!

>> TL;DR <<
-Sunkenland: A unique, underwater survival game.
-Great for team players and solo adventurers alike.
-A few tweaks needed, but it's a sea of fun with lots of potential.
-My wishlist for the game for now is above.
-I'm excited to see where the devs take this!

The reason is this is essentially a zombie game.  There is base building.  There are underwater areas to explore.  These are challenging in their own right.  But you will be attacked every few days.  There is no relief.  

Some people like that.  I personally don't.  

Keep in mind, of course, this is an early access game.  Things will change.  But as of right now, it's really just a zombie survival game.  The graphics are excellent though.  Since I can only give a yes or no recommendation I will say no.

If it had a ""meh"" option, I would pick that.

EDIT after 40+ hours   - February 14, 2024

I still stand by my previous review but felt I should I add a few relevant things that might influence others to decide if they should purchase this game at this time.

The game is first person.  There is no 3rd person view at this time.  That might change in the future, but I saw  no option for 3rd person in any of the key bindings list.  I personally can't stand 3rd person and being 1st person is the main factor that led me to purchase this, but others might prefer 3rd person and to each their own.

I mentioned the base raids every few days but let me be clear about that at this time.  You can change the settings to easy, normal, or hard.  You can also turn the raids off completely if you want.  The enemies still populate their various POI's (points of interest) and will be adjusted according to your difficulty settings.

So, I set on the digital seas of Sunkenland, and let me tell you, it was like ordering instant noodles: quick, easy, and left me craving for more flavor. 🍜

Pros:

* Seru (that’s “fun” in Bahasa Indonesia) for a while. I mean, who doesn’t enjoy a good loot hunt? 🏴‍☠️💰
* The missions? Pfft, they’re easier than finding your lost sock in the laundry. 🧦
* Blink twice, and you’ve already completed half the game. ⏱️

Cons:

* Seriously, Sunkenland, did you skip the “Challenging Mission Design 101” class? 🤨
* I finished missions faster than my grandma can knit a scarf. 🧶
* It’s like the game whispered, “Psst, wanna finish this quest? Just breathe.” 🌬️

Wishlist for Sunkenland:

* More excitement, less predictability. Maybe throw in a kraken or two? 🦑
* Slower missions, please! I want to savor my pixelated victories like a fine cheese. 🧀

So, Sunkenland devs, let’s spice things up! Add some mystery, a dash of chaos, and maybe a side quest involving pirate karaoke. 🎤🏴‍☠️

Like imagine swimming to a bandit raft, an entire structure made of metal and wood, with a giant sail, and a net for fishing, and walking away with a few planks of wood, leaving the sail, the rope, the literal rowboat sitting on the deck, not to mention the wood and metal itself... no, I'll harvest the chair instead and leave the rest.

The day/night cycle is super annoying too. Sure, there are mods to fix that, but you shouldn't have to. Minutes past faster than seconds. It's like someone forgot to move a decimal point or something.

So many different aspects of this game are left wanting. Fun though I guess. Not bad by any means.. If you're looking for a simple game, this is it. If you're looking for a more complex and realistic survival game, there are too many more to bother with this one.

if you like games like rust, raft or even stranded deep, im sure you'll like this one alot too

it has the same base building feeling as stranded deep mixed with rust, n too its mood n feeling regarding the world, n raft with its scavenging n farming 

you can tell its a passion project with a team which enjoys their project, and im honestly all for it, especially with its price tag, id say you're getting alot out of it, n its still the early days of its development n much more is in the works for the game ^^

tho there are a few things which i wish was in the game

the ability to recycle clothes in the recycler, you end up with so many clothing pieces, i hoarded a bunch of it when i saw that the recycler was somethin i could research, n since i was in bad need for cloth i was quite excited, but was met with quite alot of disappointment when i learned that u cant recycle clothes into cloth, would make most sense for us to be able to get cloth out of cloth related clothes, n small bits of leather out of leathery clothes like shoes n what not


id too love the ability to replace structure pieces with another varient of its own type, like being able to replace a wooden foundation with a metal or reinforced n so on, with any of the pieces, since if you wanna upgrade a piece to a stronger one or a prettier one, u gotta tear it down completely, n have to place everything back on it again once you have put down a new foundation which is quite annoying


the game needs some weather effects too, its quite a beautiful game, n would be so much better with some weather effects like rain n storms n such",1707578579,1707581584,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

What does bother me however, in it's current state, is every time we log in something has reset, or moved, or disappeared. It's becoming an irritating chore logging in knowing that we need to destroy an item that's inexplicably not where you left it. Yes you have to destroy it because maddeningly you can't just move an item...I know! 

I'd set up hourly snapshots on a Windows server but that was for backup purposes not to trawl through looking for a copy where the stove wasn't three floors higher than where we built it half way in a wall.

Shotgun is still stupidly overcharged for enemies, shotguns should not have much range but still do. Enemies have been evened out and don't insta kill you anymore which is nice. Collection system for guns gets a bit tedious, takes a really long time to collect the correct blueprints to create the gun you want. They added missions which was nice. Still needs work but will give you a decent amount of playtime. 

Things that could be better would be the trader, there really isn't a point to the trader at this point, barely anything of value there and just a waste of space. The enemies you fight have guns or machetes and you rarely get the bladed weapons and only get broken guns off of people to get blueprints from, downed enemies should drop their weapons instead of them disappearing, they also rarely drop ammo. Everything shouldn't need to be crafted.

{Original Review}Game has potential but at the current state it doesn't deserve support. If they make something more of it then yes but right now it is more broken than working.

Enemies with guns rarely ever miss, doesn't matter what gun, they can snipe you with a shotgun from across the map, full auto burst from far away and you get hit with every shot. Load a game and every enemy disappears. If there are walls it doesn't matter, enemies will teleport through them just to kill you.",1698242503,1707541363,True,0,0,0.534725964069366455,0,True,False,True

*Played on PC and Steam Deck* 

My review is centered around PC, I played for like a half hour on the deck for this review. Those comments will be at the bottom. 

What I liked about this game (and yes i understand this is early access) 
- Post Apocalyptic, 95% water based map. (There are islands, and other features that are not submerged) 
- The crafting and building 
- There is a subtle vision and path that it's evident the game will likely take. 

What I like about the potential- 
- The devs can take this world anywhere, story wise. 
- The bones of it are great, its thought out well 
- there is a lot of room for additions to tech tree, random map interactions, fishing, crafting, it all seems to be there. 

Anything that I could put in ""dislike"", the devs have stated they are working on, or would otherwise be foolish not to. So I dont feel there is a point in listing things out that will be changed. AI balance, AI raids, random sharks, all this will be polished out i'm sure. So i'll add this, in a meta and a lot of very particular instances, the game is *good*. 


Steam Deck Notes; 

Like other games, there is a bit of early key binding and wrangling to get non-deck optimized games playable. But I can't help but realize this game would be near perfect for the deck. 

I did notice I was unable to access my PC save on my steam deck, which was a massive bummer. But considering all the other additions and polishing in the works, I can't actually fault them for this. But I do hope to see it in the future.

In this game, you'll have to build your base on islands. Vehicles just provide mobility and some storage.
So the only thing they have in common is the ""survival on sea"" theme. Gameplay-wise it's more akin to Stranded Deep + Rust.

EDIT for 0.200:

Okay so I've played the 0.200 update for like three days with a friend now.

And I retain my thumbs down.

The most jarring problems which I absolutely can not tolerate is the frequent ""disconnected from host player"" error even when I AM THE HOST PLAYER.

The other problem is the game automatically and constantly adjusts (reduces) your system microphone volume EVEN WITH IN-GAME VOICE CHAT TURNED OFF.

These problems annoys me to no end. Other than that, the game's content is solid. Without those problems I would give it a thumbs up.",1693036855,1707273994,False,29,6,0.521238625049591064,7,True,False,True

I love the premise and the setting, the underwater aspect and locations are great, but the world needs a lot of work - there's not much actual content or variety just yet. Keep in mind, it's early access so presumably things will get better. Right now the game is a grind for resources, and not in a good way. One issue I have is that each update brings new things, but there really isn't any documentation for the changes. You have to try to figure out how to do things as you go along, and some of the new changes are complex and confusing. The whole project would benefit from some documentation to help people learn what to do. At least some better pop-up prompts in the game to guide us. Also, each update or ""patch"" breaks a lot of things. At first it seemed like the devs were quickly addressing issues as they came up, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore. It could be that there just got to be too many problems for a small dev team to handle. Hopefully things will improve with time.

Pros
- Novel concept with a combination of underwater and platform/island interactions.
- Smooth rendering.
- A wide variety of items and decorative features.

Cons
- Ranged weapon hit registry is terribly poor due to mesh collision and potential raycast issues. Game breaker for me.
- Lack of search feature for blueprint cross referencing.
- Limited food recipes.
- Recent update removed ability to place player made structure on hostile ground.
- Open World but very scripted story line and progression flow.

It's a promising game but I'm feeling very frustrated with the current state of it.
I gave thumbs up, then changed to negative, now changed back to positive. 
Also, it's in EA which means is under constant development.

Here are the pros and cons:

Good:

- Interesting world to explore based on diving, sailing, etc.
- It's fun playing in multiplayer.
- Have a relatively beautiful world (not the buildings which are awful)
- Has a lot of potential.

Bad:

- Enemies can attack you through walls.

- Ranged enemies feels too OP. They will likely hit you whatever the scenario.

- For the player is almost impossible to hit an enemy with arrows (crossbow/bow) once they are moving, even if the target is 100% on the enemy body (Something's wrong with the hit boxes!?).

- Building system is very clunky and unpolished. You can build over anything else.

- Trying to focus on an object for interaction (e.g., chest, grill, etc.) when there is something else behind it (even having a wall between them) is very difficult. (Fix your line tracing/ray casting used to pick the focused object :P)

- I could not claim any land that I conquered because the system is broken in the current patch.

- This current patch also broke map features, like showing your teammate, discovered islands, etc.

Suggestions:

- Stop dropping the loot on the ground if the destination is full. Example, trying to store more wood in a chest that it can take, where the excess is just dropped on the ground. Why not keeping the excess in the inventory like any other game? I don't want to do math every time I interact with a recipient.

- Need more ways to defend your base against the AI's raids (e.g., turrets, NPCs, traps, etc).

Be more careful with updates making sure that what is working continues to work after the update.

There are some bugs still to be worked out, as there always are, but the survival concept leaves room for some decent PVP action and with improvement the PVE can be really decent too. My friends and I quickly conquered all islands by idk, hr 30 of game play and were really disappointed to find that this meant the game was pretty much over. Basically once you raid and defeat an enemy base on an island they do not respawn (as far as we could tell.) The only thing we could see that was leaft to do was to keep collecting resources to upgrade everything, however there was no reason for this all enemies had been destroyed and the only thing remaining were randomly occurring raids to defend your base from. 
Being early access we can excuse this for the time being but I seriously hope they give the enemy the ability to reclaim islands to give the game a bit longer life and a reason for us to continue evolving through the tech tree and get better weapons etc.

The game seems to borrow things from Valheim, Stranded Deep, The Forest and a few other survival games and it actually works pretty well. It's fun although in early access, but still being an EA game does not absolve it from being able to be criticised

This review is taking into account the v0.150 and v0.200 updates in which we played mainly saying whats good and needs work and what has been improved on.

Pros: 

Great underwater exploration. You get a good variety of equipment like flippers, sacks, oxygen tanks and structures to explore and scavenge.

PvE combat against different enemies, both animal and human, in and out of the water.

You can choose where you want to go at anytime and explore or craft or build with a lot of potential even with the low amount of things currently in the game.

Trophies and special items like Neon signs to make hunting have a goal even at end game and set your base apart from other peoples.

The v0.200 added 45 degree structures and half walls which is really good for expanding better base designs.
 
A good base amount of things to do with Anvils, Researching, Crafting Tables etc. A good progression route you can follow from early to mid to endgame.

Gun customisation added not just 1 red dot sight.

Character creator has a good base to it.

New huge islands to fight on and explore for blueprints as of v0.200.

Big map with a lot of locations to explore and can freely build anywhere given you control the territory.

Better enemy drops not just 1 cloth or a mushroom you can get gun parts and useful things.

Cool basic use of electricity, would be even better if in future updates you could industrialize and make auto farmers and link chests up to farms or smelters so you can make things while away from base.

Can swap between beta versions so even when old worlds become obsolete due to updates you can revert back and continue to play on them.

Cons:

Hotbar isn't integrated into the inventory and as of v0.200 random items seem to get forced into it.

Can't edit a character when made and pretty limited choice of who you can create.

Despite the building requirements saying you need columns to build upper floors you can just destroy them and have floating builds, not exactly a bad thing but its a big oversight.

Trying to go faster in the start boat makes your character energy decrease which seems odd.

Decoration items can't be picked up once put down so if you misplace it then you lose it.

Some items removed like the Halloween pumpkin are still in the game but have no icon.

Audio issues especially with item pick ups, taking 1 wood makes an invidiual item pick up noise, while taking 50 makes the pick up noise 50 times in one being extremely loud. Another one is the starter boat makes an awful clunky noise that persists even when the game is paused.

Sleeping seems to not sync with actual night time meaning you either have to wait for the water to heat up in the morning or keep busy at base to kill time.

Bit of a minor issue but glass walls are randomly locked behind a discoverable blueprint which I couldn't find so I had to resort to using 45 degree walls, you should get guaranteed access to that from the beginning or on tier 1 of the research table.

The newly implemented missions don't seem to serve any purpose other than a slight guide on the order to target islands, but I'd rather just explore where I want since its an open world. Maybe make the trader give out randomised missions that you can cash in for rewards instead. And give the trader a lot more items to buy and sell that randomise and change every 5 days or so, its always almost the same thing.

Changes to chest and item sizes. A ton of things have been nerfed making looting more tedious, wood and scrap have been slightly increased which is good but the majority of things have been cut back a lot which for some things like glass as 40 was a bit too much but things like basic items needing so many resources, advanced components stack sizes, the basic boat having almost no slots etc is just a hindrance, it doesn't rebalance the game or make it challenging, just irritating when you have to make multiple long trips to cover an island instead of 1 or 2.

The combat has always been very buggy but particularly with the crossbow it just does not hit the target especially when aiming high, it seemed to work as of v0.200 so maybe v0.201 broke it? Bullets stray off especially when you strafe to dodge enemies. The enemy are either blind or insanely punishing to the point where hard is infuriating to play when enemies can shoot through walls or group together to gang up on you.

Since you have no passive health regen for having full hunger and thirst and now algae is seemingly a lot rarer and you need to research to even craft it you have no reliable way early game to heal and because of the glitchy combat and hitboxes and strange enemy AI you need to resort to use other glitches to win fights.

Flags don't seem to claim land and enemies respawned right on the island at midnight and nearly instantly killed me since I was low on health from only just taking over it.

The hitboxes are very dodgy and sometimes extend way past walls, fences so you cant shoot through them but the enemy seemingly can. I just resort to jump stabbing enemies through the floor/walls with a spear quite often since peaking gets you almost instakilled.

Invisible walls particularly on Radio Island. I'm not sure if it was an attempt to make you use the regular route but to get a tactical advantage I went round the rocks on the side and hit a huge invisible wall that seemingly just gets cut off so you can still get round it anyway.

With boats your character hitbox disappears and any raft bases slightly above water you can clip through and kill enemies as long as your boat fits underneath.

Raiding on the higher end is so often your base gets demolished extremely fast and forget about building a big base because enemies just decide to spawn inside your defences and break your stuff.

Underwater combat is essentially just repair your armour and bring herbs/antibiotics because you WILL be hit. A dodge mechanic would be nice, or some way of making shark or hammerhead fights winnable without being hit.

I appreciate this might come off as very negative and I do think the game has a lot of potential, most survival games while fun come off as very generic and this has a unique twist I don't think anything else has capitalised on, at least properly. But the v0.200 update is pretty disappointing and still very buggy. I'd recommend just reverting to v0.150 which felt more balanced and fun even without the newest additions. Since this account has under 2 hours playtime I'm gonna ask for a refund and hopefully the game will be much better in future full release and I might buy it again. If the devs by some chance read this don't get disheartened because your game is good and it has potential to be a VERY good survival type game but it just needs a bit of work before I recommend people pay for it.",1707000746,1707000746,False,4,0,0.519999980926513672,3,True,False,True

While waiting for some other titles to launch, I decided to play the game based on reviews.  I started the game and it seemed very basic, with so/so graphics, etc.  However, and although still in development, it became quite addicting.....until they did a patch/upgrade and I lost all of my save files.  Apparently some new ""upgrade"" versions can't use ""older save files""...like the previous days version of ""older"".  Nowhere do I feel I adequately warned about losing files when I hit a button to volunteer to submit development data.  I am not one to follow games sites nor other sites on them...I just play and either enjoy them or trash them.

Given I was quite few weeks into the game to say I am a little ""pissed"" would be an understatement.  So much so I blew out the game and wish it would disappear...forever.  ""Development"" would be an understatement....who makes a game whereas the upgrades/patches are not compatible with the last days saved files.....who???

I still have it in my library and may bring it out again....after it's completely out of development.....maybe!!

Very few bug fixes from 3+ months of feedback. New systems are broken and don't work right. Amateur devs release an amateur update.

[hr][/hr]
All of Rust's annoying mechanics, plus NPC raids on timers with horrible scaling. Stranded Deep environment, not Raft: there is no central raft or forced movement, it is a static world. You do feel the influence of Raft's crafting system. Building is Ark levels of abhorrent.

These are clearly not experienced devs with extensive knowledge of game design and systems. It is an amateur attempt to recreate and merge some of their favorite games. If they get some attention (read as: money) and hire some industry talent, they may be able to hold a candle to their influences. Mostly, this feels destined to die out slowly in the night while being a fun distraction made better with a group.

[hr][/hr]
Hybrid Sprint ftw! Tap to toggle, hold to...hold. It's great! Been saying for a decade that more games need this. With that said, there should still be an option to force toggle/hold. Options are always better. Hold to sprint is terrible and constantly resets, while held.

Water environments are done well. Had no anxiety or apprehension to jump right in. It is bright and welcoming during the day. The shimmer effect could use some tweaking. Starter amount of air/breath/O2 is perfectly sufficient. Death is not immediate upon running out of air (HP slowly drains), which is nice.

The basic looting loop is probably the chillest ever. However, the ridiculous ""freezing at night"" system means it is nearly impossible to fill your boat's chest and your inventory before you have to retreat for the day - or defend a raid.

Realism is fine, but too often results in annoying mechanics that add nothing to the game. For combat, they leaned too heavily into Rust. For interactions, they leaned too heavily into Raft. More items need a remote inventory, instead of ""ingredient"" slots (e.g. boats, grills, furnace, recycler).

No thought or attention has gone into inventory management, in a building/crafting game - this is inexcusable. The hotbar is ignored when looting, even when returning a grenade from your hand. For example: grenade in slot 5, pick up grenade from the ground and it goes into your inventory, you must manually drop it onto slot 5 to have a stack of 2 grenades in slot 5, hit 5 to equip a grenade and you now have one in slot 5 and one in your hand, hit another slot to unequip the grenade and it is now in your inventory, you must manually drop it back to slot 5 to re-stack it. I can't think of a more annoying inventory system.

Lots of work to go. LOTS! LOTS!! No reason for this to be in EA this early - they don't need feedback, they need to put their heads down and get to work!

[b]Issues:[/b]
[list]
    [*]Options don't do what they say (camera shake, even when paused).
    [*]HUD is terrible at keeping you informed of relevant information.
    [*]Enemy AI is atrocious. Raiding enemies make no noise and are difficult to locate. Melee combat is bottom-of-the-barrel, then throw in stamina.
    [*]Healing over time doesn't mesh well with the horde-style raids. Results in combat that feels too slow, boring, and punishing.
    [*]O2 tank system is implemented in the most player unfriendly way imaginable.
    [*]Needs tech tree, even if only visual, simply to educate the player on what relies on what.
    [*]Movement is restricted (camera doesn't point straight up/down) and sprint doesn't work with swim up/down.
    [*]Lots of jank with the boats, and terrible mounted camera movement.
    [*]Resource re-spawn system doesn't care about your builds.
    [*]Interactions don't care about your builds or terrain (loot through concrete walls).
    [*]Projectiles often don't care about your builds or terrain.
    [*]Audio is a mess. Some effects even have their L/R balance backwards.
    [*]Aside from the bad build system, costs need readjusted across the board - especially for wood.
    [*]Roof tiles are in a near broken state and should never have been presented to players.
    [*]There are multiple build menus for no reason; and, scrolling in them is annoying due to not being allowed to scroll when hovering over an ingredient, which take up over 50% of the vertical space.
    [*]When a menu is open, Tab should close the opened menu and not open the Inventory.
    [*]Deconstructing a window will remove the wall without a confirmation and leave the window floating.
    [*]""Hit-boxes"" are annoying: from walking up purifiers, to axing friendly builds off screen, blocking underground builds by standing above them, and even not being able to interact with opened doors (only their frames).
    [*]Even the art assets are off: iron sights not centered, hands clip through gloves.
    [*]Some translations are missing (Black Powder) and others are wrong (""White"" gloves can be red or black). Energy gains are often omitted from item descriptions. They didn't even rename most of their ""store bought"" clothing assets - pathetic and lazy.
    [*]They lean heavily into overly complex mechanics, like aim-based ladder climbing speed, and over used annoyance mechanics like Bleeding 4x in a single engagement.
    [*]No RNG protection mechanic - end up with tons of useless clothing with no early-game recycling.
    [*]Sleeping needs tweaked. Impossible to fix schedule by sleeping earlier/shorter, have to stay up to fix it. The semi-fixed 10 hour sleep is a bit excessive.
    [*]Fish/food has way too much inventory bloat. Cooked foods should condense to a much smaller pool of generic items. This is not an MMO with trading and specialization. It doesn't need this many items.
    [*]HP buff UI overlaps with armor display; and, it doesn't give you the increased HP - you still have to heal.
    [*]Black Powder becomes useless too fast and Chemical Substances are over-used. A starter fix would be to make ammo always use black powder.
    [*]Secondary interact UI sometimes disappears when not needed (furnace) and other times does not (stove).
    [*]Overflow from inventories when transferring gets thrown on the ground. Devs are assholes for this!
    [*]Splitting a stack is limited to within your own inventory.
    [*]Cannot put a fire out or remove unused wood/fuel.
    [*]Renaming containers should highlight and select the input box so we can start typing immediately, and Enter/Esc should act on the OK/Cancel buttons.
    [*]Destroying an empty box pops out an erroneous empty sack (the old remote inventory) that you can interact with.
    [*]Windows still reports the microphone is being used by Sunkenland when voice chat is disabled.
    [*]Halloween event really needs to end! ;) Hopefully they just want more testing of their event system and this is not an indication of their laziness to implement a loading timer.

- It's in early access, and it looks like utter dogshit, bland, and most stuff is repeated a few times so you don't have too little things at the cost of originality, at the time of writing this it's the V0.2 update, so WAY before any 1.0 update, I'd say it gets a pass at the moment, cause they're talking about reworking it as time goes on anyway.

- It's a little buggy, but that's a given since it's early access, most bugs arent game breaking, and can often be fixed by a simple button press. It's mostly visual bugs too, from my experience. Again, typical with early access, especially THIS early.

- It looks beyond awful and like a unity project, but it's to be expected as it's early access. It's good fun though once you look past it all like a critic, and just put yourself in that mindset of how you used to play beyond awful unity games because you werent aware of Steam when you were little, if you stop comparing this game to modern triple-a titles, it can be genuinely fun. You just gotta look past the flaws, they'll be gone in the full release anyway.

While I do recommend the game, if you're one of those people that can't grasp the concept of ""so bad it's good"", I recommend you wait until it's fully released, rather than bombard the reviews with the obvious.

It's a fun yet terribly put together shitpost of a game best enjoyed privately with friends and I really recommend it if you're a gameplay over visuals kinda guy, even if it's barren.

Somewhat interesting points of interest but they're very simplistic, not challenging and become boring to loot over and over. 

The building system is pretty good but broken sometimes because their  volunteers have no idea how to test things.


The boats are cool and makes the gameplay loop a little better but they're also buggy. 

The studio takes forever to update the game and they always add more bugs. 

Dedicated servers are a joke. You have to rent or play on a server that likely has grown children that will admin abuse or you can rent your own, and that's cool and all but official servers helps games like Sunkenland, that hardly has a player base, from feeling dead. 

Their discord is a joke. The mods are rude (they actually blocked the word update at one point) and the devs live on a different planet. I never see them on the discord and it's soooo unorganized. There is a thousand plus suggestions and bug reports and it's obvious that it's not working too well, since they introduce the same bugs in new updates.

I spent about 20 hours on the first version (version 1) only to read somewhere that the next update (when it arrived, which was yesterday, version 2) would not support saves from version 1 and against my better judgement I went into the beta (about a week or so ago) which was an early release of version 2. I noticed in the beta that a few of the islands had moved which was of no consequence at the time as I had to to a COMPLETELY NEW SAVE (bearing in mind of course that this is a base building game).
And then put about 80 hours into the game since then and after the update yesterday beyond any and all logic the following has happened.
EVERY island has been moved and my base has been moved along with them to be buried in the middle of an island and inaccessible as with the last update. For a base building game this is NOT what I am looking for nor would anyone expect this from a base building game. Clearly the developer has got in over their head and added too much bling (gun customisation etc, which is completely unnecessary) and forgot about this key aspect of the game.
I have checked EVERY island in the game since the update and all but 2 have moved. I would NOT AT ALL recommend this game to anyone (and I purchased 2 copies of this, 1 for me and 1 for my brother). The base I have spent 80 hours on is now buried in the middle of an island and I can not get to it.

It reminds me of Raft but fighting enemies and you don't have to spend countless amounts of time in the water itself you can make a conscious choice to go where you want. It's hard to make a survival game that has something different about it but this definitely has a lot of unique ideas.

The trophies you can find to put up in your base are very fun to find even after having set up a base and the building itself is very simple but effective. A wide variety of different tables for different uses.

The building almost has the structural integrity mechanic like in Valheim where you need pillars/supports to build but you can bypass it by building on your pillars and then removing them. Unsure whether this is intended or a bug, but it allows for a lot of creativity when building even though it can be a little finicky

The sunken buildings are fun to explore but it would be even better if all or more of the floors were accessible even above land as for some players who prefer combat to looting could get bored of the repetition without having varieties of structures to explore.

The combat is fun but a lot of the hitboxes on terrain is off from the actual texture meaning enemies can shoot you through walls sometimes and you can't shoot back, or you shoot through a gap in a fence but the gap is part of a wall so the bullet doesn't pass through. The AI can be a either a bit blind and predictable or a tactical trained sniper that almost instantly kills you with no inbetween.

The difficulty does need a little bit of balancing as well on the high and very high settings raiding becomes 2,3 times a day its hard to leave your base in single player to continue getting supplies while also making sure your base isn't destroyed. The way I got round this was by using steep sloped buildings where the player can jump up but not the AI but even then things built low down were broken very quickly.

Overall a really good game especially for early access with tons of nice ideas, it just needs bug fixing a little and a few tweaks but definitely recommend buying it!

[h3] Overview [/h3]

The idea behind this game is that you are dropped into a world covered in water and spotted with islands. These islands are occupied by clans that differ in difficulty. Your goal is to scavenge and re purpose items found in underwater cities, mansions, factories, and other POI's. With those items you need to build defences  to protect all of your belongings from attacks mounted by the clans - matching your current progress with the difficulty of these attackers. Your main way of gathering materials is under water ruins and raiding clan islands. 

[h3] The Good [/h3]
- GREAT pacing in the way in which you progress preserves the fun and adventure as you build your armory.
- Freedom of placing objects around the world or your base. This allows you to set up custom peeks and find different uses for items that fit your needs.
- Hours of fun. Once you are in and get going, you will not want to take a break for at LEAST 3ish hours.
- Amazing concept. This game is literally Rust meets The Forest meets 7 Days to Die. Although I find this game less repetitive than 7 Days to Die.
- Fun vehicles and fun to follow guided POI's
- THE SOUND OF GATHERING SCRAP IS SO SATISFYING
- Raids are a nice break from gathering materials and taking over other islands.
- Multiplayer is the most fun way to play the game but it doesn't come at the cost of singleplayer.
- Since I have bought the game there has been two updates already.
- great community.

[h3] The Bad [/h3]
- Sound design is AWFUL in many cases especially when recycling old gun parts.
- Enemy hitboxes and movement is so wacky and fast that it is sometimes hard to hit anything with the crossbow or guns.
- Guns are very up in the air - for some reason there are black powder weapons but you can just as easily get to a regular modern pistol so what is the point?
- The way the environment looks on islands is just poor. It's like someone just painted blobs all around and called it ""a mountain"".
- Needs more customization options for game settings - although what it has is pretty good for now.
- Needs variation in how you can play the game. Progression is linear but the trader almost always has the same stuff. This stuff is useless in the beginning, and not worth it in the end as you have to make multiple boxes to store just valuables. 
- Needs better animations (I understand it is early access and I know they will fix it. Just saying the current state of the game).
- Kind of pricey for this EARLY of early access. I mean $20 is in no way bad, but other established and finished games show this price-point when sales are on 4-6 times a year.

The base is completely blocked off there are gates and doors in the way yet they are inside my base. Attacking all my stuff inside a closed system. This is an issue. They should have to come from another base and attack my stuff not just appear near in my base. There is no point in going and taking out enemies near me if they are just going to keep magically appearing inside my base. Also not sure if its possible but if you can make this change with what ever your using as an engine. You might want to look at atlas and try to implement ship building like they have. So you can have a mobile base. i mean it is sunkenland which means its mainly water. Another thing i can say is that if i get attacked by enemies with SMG's and pistols and i some how survive and killed them with a bow. I think yes finally i can have a real weapon. To click onto said enemy and they have food and a rag on them....they just attacked me with guns and spears and all these weapons that are not on the body. I am saying its a okay game. But i will never give a thumbs up for games that break a simple rule as you get what you kill. I really hope in the future you fix this. If you do i will change my thumbs down to a thumbs up.

Explore, build, survive, forage, farm, trade, vanquish NPC enemies, and literally dumpster dive while diving.

Advance through several tiers of tech and eventually eliminate all enemies on the map. Build boats, bases, and even a helicopter. 

Both single player and coop via hosting a server are available. Seriously, this game shines when a few of your friends are all helping get stuff done.  Unlike many other team/coop games, this offers a real sense of community and achievement. 

So yes, its in early release, there are a few bugs, but none without a workaround:
1) If an enemy glitches into a rock, you can flush them dead by tossing grenades to their location.
2) If someone who connects to your server starts rubber-banding, you can save the game, close the server, re-launch it, and have everyone connect again. 
3) Building a base on water in the center of a few enemy islands is a good idea because it allows you to  access those islands easily. On your enhanced foundations, remember to put wall spikes, barbed wire, then reinforced barricades between the waterline and under your base to help keep invaders from going under and glitching through the floor.

And some tips:  
1) The server region selection does not remember your choices. The default is in Asia, Great if you are in Asia. 
2) If you;re hosting a server, password protect it with something complex. Other players will try to connect to grief.
3) Play a bit, get familiar, then start a new game, and don't build your first base on rubber duck island. 
4) Don't build advanced versions of things on top of metal foundations, build them on top of the reinforced foundations. This way you lessen the chance of having to build them twice. 

Strongly strongly recommend for a group of friends to get together and play something that offers more than just beating the snot out of the other team.

Update: Above I said to password protect your server.  Thats not the safest route.  When hosting, you should UN-check viewable to public then send your friends invitations to play from the ESC menu. Bacause if your server can be seen by the public, even if someone doesn't have the password, they can still get your IP address while trying to connect. NEVER a good thing.

- when you click ""select all"" and you dont have enough inventory space.... the items that cant fit in your backpack are spread out on the ground.   Should default that if there is no room for item... it stays in box.

- would triple the meat factor from larger sea creatures... it's disappointing with the amount of meat off sailfish/marlin.

Despite both those games getting several hundred hours of playtime from me, this has lasted just 77 minutes before on easy mode with everything combat set to low, I was killed 15 times time under 5 minutes when 3 naked enemies invaded my base. As commented elsewhere, the combat and respawn mechanics leave SO much to be desired, plenty of room here for the game to grow.

Equally, without a story or tutorial or any guidance, working out what you are supposed to do, what you can do what and how things work is...challenging, and not in a way I enjoy.

Crafting mechanics and default controls not intuitive, wound up spending 15 minutes working those out and turns out on a single player world neither crafting nor controls menu actually pauses the world, hence the epic death loop.

Other people here have commented on the build mechanics, but for me, I built a foundation, chucked a bunch of stuff on top of it intending to fully base plan & segment by room later once I had enough resources aaaaaaaaaaaaaand theres no option to move or destroy placed items or buildings. I didn't find an island other than starter that I could have inhabited in my limited playtime, but explored 2 ""rings"" of sunken things, rafts and islands nearby. This would make moving to a secondary island where I could build a much nicer base impossible.

Final thing - Wood storage and scrap metal storage furniture is not worth building. Neither take a full stack of the item, you are better off creating a chest monster for storage unless you like the aesthetic.

This has something. The idea is still really good and I almost already want to give it another chance and see if maybe I just mucked up because it was first playthrough and I missed a bunch. Realistically, unless its combat issues are resolved, the progression is better worked out and the crafting/building mechanics are also improved a lot, this sits in the ""early access games I feel I probably wasted money on"" category for me. If it drastically improves on its next major update I will update this to reflect, but from Jan 24, it looks like it needs another 2-3 years of dev to get to a place where its worth playing as single player.

Like many survival games, there is not much plot you are dropped into a world with very little and it's up to you to adapt and survive.

--With 0.2.0 the mission tab is more fledged out and is basically a tutorial and a nudge towards locations at your current level to progress.  
--the resources loading in noises have been removed; the loot everything noise from boats seems volume is way too high. 
--Crafting is pretty much the same. Some recipes have been removed from the research table and have to be found in the wild.  Crafting guns has been changed, I just unlocked the table and will update when I have more time with it.

I don't often(or ever really) post reviews but I just had to for this one. I bought this game on sale not expecting much more than a few good hours of gameplay with bugs(sorry, features) and lazying coding all over it, but discovered much more than that, especially for early access. This game has many excuses to be lazy or unfinished at points, but at most looks unpolished, and although the lazy coding may be partially true it honestly makes the game more endearing in a weird way. This game is wide open with plenty of opportunity for exploration and creativity and might, nay, WILL be better than some AAA games coming out this year...

This game is good, and loads of fun with your buddies. One of my favorite games right now. It has great potential. Hopefully the Devs see this review as I hope they take a lot of my advice to make this game awesome and draw more players in. If they made this game great and added DLC I would give them all my monies.

Here is a list of things that needs work as of 01/20/2023

-Helicopter spawns in below constructed floors sometimes (I made a Helipad lol)
-Player spawns in below made floors and foundations sometimes (A bit annoying sometimes lol)
-Enemies need to respawn at islands, otherwise you can kill every enemy in the game and BOOM no more action
-If you take your flag down from a captured Island it needs to default to the original faction and respawn enemies again (I kept finding better islands to build a base on and noticed that even though I took the flag down, Its still my island... and if there was enemy respawn there would be a continuation of action)
-Needs an option in the menu that allows enemy raids but no structure damage (Some of us like being raided but don't want our things destroyed lol I ain't got time for dat)
-Enemy raids need to come in boats that despawn or something when you start getting raided by humans (Humans will start swimming up to your island without boats and adding the boats would just be a nice touch)
-Red dot sight needs to be attached to the gun itself rather than attached to all compatible guns (I like the red dot on my SMG but not my rifle) 
-More everything! More cosmetics, vehicles (ESPECIALLY 4 seater helicopter with 2 chests maybe a little bird wink wink), weapons, attachments (scope or ACOG please), clothes, Iron floor? (can build iron structures but the iron floor is non existent like it was forgotten lol!), Islands (please no recycling the same buildings!!), and underwater places to loot. ALSO BIOMES WOULD BE COOL why is there a random iceberg in the middle of the map lol lets have biomes in different parts of the map!!!
-BTW helicopter controls are great!! JUST NEEDS A FREE LOOK TOGGLE you are locked in just seeing in front of you and cannot look around... maybe L Shift or RMB??
-SLEEPING IS A HUGE PROBLEM... you should only be able to sleep from 20:00 to 03:00 and wake up at 5:00/06:00 EVERYDAY. Right now you can sleep whenever and you wake up 10 hours later and cannot sleep again until you've been awake for 12 hours since you slept. This is very frustrating when you try to sleep but can't because you slept at 02:00 the previous day and you sit there in the dark waiting for the option to sleep and its too dark and cold to do anything else... besides wait by your bed.... LOL
-Option in the menu to change day and night time cycles (I personally think the day goes by too fast)
-No animation when pulling out certain guns, but it makes sounds as if you racked the slide or something
-While playing the game your hands and arms are always skin no matter what you're wearing (not a big issue, but would be a nice touch)
-Option to get rid of the reticle (green dot) super annoying when trying to aim a rifle/option to get rid of green dot retcile when ADS
-Option to get rid of vehicle control menu when in a vehicle (I know how to drive the dam boat)
-You can access items like chests through walls you've built
-BUILDING needs some little work and it would be approximately 91.336% better... Floors should be able to snap to foundations (second story deck), stairs should snap together to make longer stairs, and walls should be able to snap to other walls. 
-Land animals would be the icing on the cake. Wolves, Bears, Deer, Rabbits, whatever. (Gives you hide and you can make leather from it)
-More aquatic animals Whales, killer whales (pack animal), barracuda, etc. (Right now there is only 3)
-Aquatic animals need to roam more (they roam in a small area and are predictable)
-Enemies on islands need to roam more and are usually in one spot of the island instead of spread out
-Underwater diving is very safe (the biggest threat is drowning) just feels like it needs more danger
-Solar panels bro trust me bro. Fuel is annoying to get and goes quickly. Solar panels can have a downside (Maybe they power 1 thing and are expensive to make or only power your things during the day or soak up the sun during the day and powers your things at night automatically like lights)
-Binoculars just zoom your screen in, you don't actually put the binoculars to your face and look through it
-Dismantle Bushes (Some bushes are in the way of building and show up through the floor)
-Items should not respawn if they are touching or close to a built structure like bushes, trees, barrels, dumpsters, etc
-HUGE one right here guys... Be able to build lots of things without having to put it on a foundation. Boom. Would make Building approximately 2037.81% better. I want my garden on the grass not on a metal foundation that's 3 feet above ground haha
-When looking at the spotlight while it's on you cant really tell it's on. There's not a light shining out of it, but rather the area it's looking at is lit up. This feature would just be a nice little touch and add to the realism

Pros: 
1) a lot of areas to explore and more are being added pretty regularly
2) a lot of variety of outfits,armor and weapons
3) crafting is reasonable, not overly tedious
4) plenty of resources (solo mode)
5) updates come regularly with fixes and additions
6) roadmap looks good and it seems they are right on track
7) I haven't experienced any performance issues, a few bugs and glitches but nothing serious
8) option to customize the game play
9) a lot of options for vehicles except for under water

Cons:
1) lacking in character customization, very few options
2) still needs some work on balance, in solo mode, you will get raided by enemies carrying guns and all you have is a sharp stick and you will be out numbered 5 to 1 (at the very least)
3)enemies (animal or human) have really high hit points, took 3 hits with a spear to kill a crab and if you happen to run into a shark while exploring, you can just expect to die, they are way faster than you are and the only underwater weapon you have is a stick with a butter knife attached to it (one bite took half my health)
4) not a lot of options for building, so all your structures will look the same, but there are a lot of decorations you can find or craft
5) there is one trade depot, 1 trader has basic stuff and another has Halloween items (seems kid of foolish to me), the basic items traders inventory never changes, its always the same items, so farther into the game the trader becomes useless.
6) underwater exploring is a great idea although the air tanks don't hold enough to last very long and you can't hold your breath for very long either, so underwater exploring is kind of a pain (it would be really cool if you could build some type of submarine)
7) hunger and thirst progresses to quickly, a normal person only needs to eat 2-3 times per day not every hour, I can understand thirst progressing quickly but not hunger
8) as with every survival game, resource storage is a problem for the amount of resources needed for crafting, it would be nice if they increased the storage capacity of storage containers

I feel like some or most of the cons will be addressed at some point in the future, so in my opinion this game is worth playing.

This is not even a alpha build.
It has a TONE of issues, UI is atrocious and makes no sense, NPC AI is non existent, missing animations, missing sounds, bad level design (as in assets don't line up), missing textures or textures don't load, things interact that should not etc.
Most of the game is cheese-able, most mechanics have a workaround, they destroyed the economy trying to fix the cheese but made it worse, and a worse game play experience overall.
Unfortunately they add content without fixing some of the basic things in the game, like the UI and AI and textures.
Overall is a good idea, it could be great some day, if the devs will prioritize the basic experience before adding new stuff.
The game is a classic case of ""game is in alpha stage, launch it as a Early Access anyway"".

2080690,156321649,76561198400202873,0,2,1864,0,1813,1705701632,"I've played this game for 30 hrs, in offline and with friends. 
The game has a really good foundation for and early release. The gathering has a nice level of hardness that it's difficult enough to keep you busy, but easy enough that you could do it on your own. 
For combat I find a few tweaks could be made. Having a rile and being able to shoot enemies far away is nice, but if you want to shoot through something such as railing it won't let you. The shot gun for enemies is SO OP that it can be frustrating when you come across one in game. I shouldn't be one shot killed with a shotgun from across an island like a sniper rile. I think having a shorter range on the shotgun, or having a range damage control on it would be nice. The father away someone is that you shoot the less damage you do. 
Other than that all the guns feel really good, nice recoil, reload action etc.
Building can use some help. Not being able to place small items like a chest or a bed on the ground without a foundation is irritating. You are miles away from base, it becomes night, you want to build a fire to keep warm, just for the night? Nope you have top place a foundation... but you can't place that cause you don't own the island. You can claim the island, by building a flag, but in reality all you want is to build a fire to get through the night rather then going all the way back to home base. 
It would be nice when building a home base to having a snapping option. They have it for foundation and walls. If you place a painting on the wall or a chest on the floor and want to stack them it's really frustrating getting them aligned nicely. If you have OCD you will go insane in this game. So having an option to bounce between snapping and just placement would be nice as there are some things I would like to place without them snapping to random spot in the room. 
Swimming in game is really nice and smooth though swimming straight up from a dive should be faster then swimming up on a angle. 
It would be really nice to see more details added in the underwater world, which I see the developers have already started in their most recent update. The New Bi-oms look great and I can't wait to see more. I like that you can explore and 100% complete and area for treasure. The 100% slowly goes down as materials come back. This is a really nice feature as you can go back and collect materials needed again. 
Having a story or scavenger hunt for treasure would be nice. Such as finding maps in raiding Mutant or raiders bases that lead you to buried treasure or to the next part of the story line. To give the game more depth as of right now it's just survival and once you play for 10-15 hrs the game starts to die off as there is no real objective. 
Adding a whether system to the game would be amazing. Rain storms, tornadoes, hurricanes that can cause damage to plays not under cover and to the main base. During storms it could be more difficult to swim or drive the boats, use more stamina or gas etc. It would be good to have NPC or enemies affected by the storms as well such as seeking shelter or taking small amount of damage if exposed. 
Overall I really like this game. It is far enough away from Rust, Son of the Forest, 7 Days to die and Raft to really stand on it's own as a game. I can't wait to see where the developers take the game. Just because it's an early release I would give it a 7/10, with more updates and content release it could easily be a 10/10 game.",1705696330,1705696330,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

[h2]Rating: 3/5[/h2]

Embarking on the journey into the Early Access realm, I delved into the promising yet perplexing world of ""Sunkenland,"" a game that blends survival, crafting, and co-op elements. Despite its evident potential, the experience leaves players with a mixed bag of emotions, revealing a game that is still in dire need of refinement.

[h2]Graphics and World Design: 2/5[/h2]
Upon entering the sprawling open world, one cannot help but notice the glaring issues with asset implementation. It becomes apparent that many in-game elements are haphazardly copy-pasted, resulting in a lack of cohesion and immersion. The landscape often feels disjointed, with terrain and structures that seem out of place. However, the potential is there, and with some thoughtful restructuring, the game world could evolve into a visually stunning environment.

[h2]Gameplay Mechanics: 3/5[/h2]
The survival and crafting mechanics in ""SurviveCraft Co-Op"" form the game's core, providing a solid foundation for engaging gameplay. The cooperative aspect adds a layer of complexity and teamwork that, when executed properly, contributes to an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, the current state of the game is plagued by clunky controls and unpolished interactions. Crafting often feels like a chore due to a lack of intuitive interfaces, and combat encounters lack the finesse needed for a truly immersive experience.

[h2]Potential and Concept: 4/5[/h2]
Beneath the surface, ""SurviveCraft Co-Op"" harbors a wealth of potential. The concept of an open-world survival game with a strong emphasis on cooperative play is intriguing and could set the stage for an outstanding gaming experience. If the developers invest time in refining the core mechanics, introducing unique features, and addressing the asset-related issues, the game could undoubtedly transform into a gem within the genre.

[h2]Communication and Developer Engagement: 3/5[/h2]
While the game is still in its Early Access stage, player feedback and developer engagement are crucial for improvement. The development team has shown some commitment to addressing community concerns, but there's room for improvement in terms of transparency and communication. Regular updates and a more interactive approach with the player base would go a long way in fostering a supportive community and ensuring the game's evolution in the right direction.

[h2]Conclusion:[/h2]
""SurviveCraft Co-Op"" is a game with untapped potential, currently obscured by the shadows of unrefined mechanics and hastily implemented assets. The foundation for a captivating co-op survival experience is there, waiting to be unearthed through dedicated development efforts. While it may not be an instant hit in its current state, it's worth keeping an eye on as updates roll out and the game inches closer to its full potential. In the hands of a committed development team, this early access title could eventually shine as a true gem in the open-world survival genre. 

I will continue to check back on the game regularly and see what new updates / fixes that have been implemented, I look forward to seeing what the future brings but for right now I don't believe the price tag matches what is offered when you can pay the same price for a game that is more ''Polished''. Thank you to the development team for giving us all the opportunity to give feedback and hopefully all our suggestions are taken on board.",1705614164,1705614164,False,3,0,0.518248200416564941,0,True,False,True

!. The early game mismatch at times with the raiders having heavy armor and automatic weapons  and endless ammunition when I am armed with a toothpick and a pair of underwear,

3.  I like the way the advancement of the tech has changed.
4. Some things that were hard to find before the last update are even harder now but I'll learn to live with it.
5. WHY ARE THE DAYLIGHT HOURS SO QUICK TO PASS?? It's ridiculous to spend the entire day driving a MOTOR BOAT only to get to my destination and have no recourse but to wait several game hours before I can see to do anything.

The game can be hard even with a duo.
Barbed wire during raids
Bit of a spoiler but the gyro heli controls are just nice man compared to like rust or games like unturned.

At the moment I'm still finding my way around the game, so this review is more  a list of things  I've discovered so far and is  not a well written review.     

Graphics are  not  the latest, but as far as I'm concerned are decent enough to be called reasonable.  However, enemy models are  as yet sub standard, with little definition to them, however, I'm assuming the developer's will update these at some point.  

Initially,   farming for materials felt a little  tedious, however as I discovered more about the game; for example, being able to build  as many storage  boxes as  I needed,  I was able to store all the resources I found.  Once I'd built  the research  table I was then able to discover more items that I could build such as a repair station, weapons,  better  cooking stations etc,   then I was able to upgrade the  research station to level two which opened up a lot more items to research.  Once researched, and assuming  you had the materials it was  a simple matter of  accessing the item and  clicking the build button, then placing it in your camp.

Setting up a  coop server just for friends is easy, just  set a password so that it remains private.  

[b]Some do's and don't when you first start out:[/b]  

1) ... Do collect  food, wood, metal, rubber  and components.  This enables you to build your research station. 
2) ...Do build  walls and  other barriers to protect your camp. Enemies appear to attack these first before attacking   the other components of a camp  such as cooking stations etc. 
3) ... Make a basic weapon using wood.   
4) ... There are eight  slots that you can access using the  number 1 to 8 keys. These will place  whatever you choose into your hands.  
5) ... You can also  carry around 16 items in your backpack.  Any more items will be dropped as boxes that are labelled  with the component you've dropped e.g. wood planks, scrap metal etc.    
6) ... Before you build  your first research station build a fire and a stove so that you can warm yourself if you start to freeze (this will happen quickly at night, especially if you are in the water).  Freezing is indicated as  ice crystals that appear in the periphery of your vision) .
7) ... Build a cooking station  then cook  any food you  pick up.    Once cooked you can then  pick up and eat the food.
9) ... Build a bed as you can recover some health  by sleeping.  
10) ... Don't  Don't eat most food if not cooked as you may poison yourself e.g. raw mushrooms.  
11) ... Don't swim at night as you will freeze very quickly.  
12) ... Don't  visit  sites if they have  enemies on unless you have a weapon. If more than  two or three enemies, only attack when  you fist start to play the game  if you are playing cooperatively with friends.  Once you are able to create better armour and weapons it should be easier to play  solo.
13) ... Press M to access the world map.  Undiscovered sites will show as  question marks.  Once discovered  there is a percentage  discovered indication below each discovered site.
14) ... There are lots of  You Tube videos that   explain the various  things that you will need to know about the game.  Personally I prefer to discover for myself, so didn't access any of these, but I did check while writing this  initial review and found  quite a few that you may find useful before starting the game.

[b]Issues:[/b]  

When playing cooperatively with friends,  if you die; once you re-spawn, you may be invisible to your friends, but you will still be able to play cooperatively.  There are some odd glitches, for example, after attacking a island then leaving,  my friend appeared to remain on the island, but was actually sailing the dinghy we had built.    Once you've killed some enemies they still appear alive, but no longer attack you.  Eventually they do disappear.

[b]Suggestions to the developer:[/b] 

Extend the day as  the day length seemed rather short (IMO).  The storage shelves hold very little scrap compared to  the storage boxes, yet take up  at least  three or four  times the area of your camp.  Enable  the ability to move walls and other  components of the camp  more easily.

It has a very similar feel, but not as much substance yet. I bought the game before the January 12 2024 patch and it was fun, but broken as hell. I had no issues running the game, but there were a lot of ways to dupe items, loot boxes, etc.. The latest patch fixed a lot of issues! 

PROS: 

Easy to learn. Its pretty straight forward. 
Graphically its solid and has calming music.
Melee and gun fights are surprisingly fun.
Lots of places to explore under water and on islands. 
Building system is simple and great!
Weapon crafting was pretty simple, but it appears they changed it and made it more like 7 Days to Die. Still good!


CONS:

Character creator is lacking haha. 

Inventory issues like accidentally hitting ""Get All"" from a loot box without enough room in your inventory, you drop everything you're carrying and collect the loot. Its really annoying. A simple warning would fix this. This was not fixed in Jan 12 patch.

Blueprints hanging on a wall (usually in enemy bases) if you look at the blueprints and accidentally click off, they disappear.

Vehicles are a little buggy. If you jump while coming out of the water while under your boat, the boat flies up in the air and sometimes disappears.

AI is trash for the most part. Just makes killing easier as it is now.

Characters don't have levels or attributes, skills, etc... this may come later.

OVERALL: I have 40+ hours in and I really enjoyed it. Devs seem responsive so this game will get better and better. It's worth early access price IMO.

2080690,149589429,76561198053330330,0,57,2435,0,2435,1699365178,"This game is polarizing but I'll do my best to lay it out for any potential buyers.

tldr; Yes. Buy it. Now read below.

So first and foremost I think Sunkenland is worth it's 20$ price tag. I played with two others and got 33 hours at the time of writing this but there is little left to do other than resource hoard for future updates.
33hrs to me justifies 20$ especially because those 30 hours were not plagued with bugs or crashes like many early access titles are. 


The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly:

Sunkenland is almost like raft but more combat heavy and less cutesy on the graphics. Oh yeah and you have a stationary base/s. I enjoyed this concept more than raft. The looks of things having a heavily decay-from-water feel to it set a good tone for whatever the story may be  in the future though some of the textures were still ugly, Intentional or not.

The combat is decent. The gunplay can be fun under the right circumstances but there are a good bunch of guns with little difference between them. Shooting feels a little lifeless and unintuitive as the only attachment you are given is a ""red dot"" (which is pale green) has a huge circle which covers up any would-be target not to mention the ever present single dot reticle is also there but offset which obfuscates the shooting mechanic. My biggest gripe with combat besides whats mentioned above is that enemies frequently drop items of a much lower tier than they fought you with. Why are 9 dudes able to shoot with 7.62 but only drop slingshots? Enemy type and quantity is very limited and AI is bad. Running is also useless as you move slightly faster than a hobble. Maybe running shoes as an accessory/food should be added.

The map is large enough that you have a good amount to do and a bit to explore. The means of traveling is primarily handled with boats and their handling isn't too bad. The biggest problems with them are that when you upgrade from one tier of boat to the next it is a large amount of expensive materials for very little gain. +20kph and no storage upgrade. Yuck. If you do eventually find the gyrocopter, DO NOT USE IT. The controls are some of the worst i've ever seen for helicopters. This needs improved. It is worthless in its current state.

The UI is a little clunky and some things need a touch of love. Renaming a box can't be completed with [enter] and instead has to be clicked with mouse, drag and drop feature doesn't work with the merchant, frequent double clicking which messes up inventory management etc. Small things. Not game breaking. 

Buildables are not very good and like many other items have large invisible walls that extend past the item. Great for providing extra cover from fire, not so nice when you think you shot the enemy but somehow you missed even though your shot was a foot or two over their barrier. The snapping works well as does the item retrieval system.

Stability is good with no major framerate drops and only 2 disconnects during our 30hr sessions which is a strong plus. This added a lot of playability and is worth noting as optimization is usually something devs do last so kudos to Sunkenland here.

Music is boring and uninspired. There are only 2 or 3 tracks that get repetitive fast but you can turn them off.

I think there should be other things to do than just hoard resources and sandbox around. I'm thinking minigames, animals, etc. You know, those little things that distract you from the stuff you were supposed to get done. Yeah, those things.

Lastly, The merchant's barter system is okay. I don't love it but I don't hate it. It makes sense however their goods become woefully irrelevant after a few hours in. This seems to be an oversight. I'd like to see more valuable things locked behind her store's paywall. I also think the .50 should have been able to be boat mounted. That would really add some excitement. The electricity system is also very primitive. I am hoping it will be updated. Every wire run to power an appliance must be fed directly to the generator instead of using connectors or relays that can't be reconnected to. 

I hope the devs will continue to work on Sunkenland. I think they really have a good blueprint here for something special and it is in its most rough form now but it could be huge with some more love.",1699193403,1705322823,True,40,0,0.752547562122344971,0,True,False,True

The game is super janky and use horrible sound effet.
Your base get attacks from time to time and difficulty increase over time, but slower than 7d2d.
The economy in the game need a major overhaul. Start by displaying the value for all item at the trader, and give traders more options.

Enemy AI is not the greatest, but I've seen worse. The main problem is that they can see through foliage and can gun through some obstacle such as bus wreck. NPC with shotgun are scary since they can snipe you with it.
It would be fun to have enemy boat vs boat fight.

The crafting is pretty balanced with some exception such as an overproduction of charcoal,
Grill need to cook more than 1 item at the time.
Bigger boat should have bigger storage.
Smelting iron from scrap would be nice.

Exploration is pretty fun, and finding blueprint make it pretty rewarding.
Air tank need to last much longer.
A game like that without a harpoon gun? Seriously?

The recycler can't recycle like 80% of the items in the game and felt pretty useless considering how much power(fuel) that thing consume.

The biofuel lab should use biological item such as veggy, fish, wood... Not chemical mix.

The game, as it is, does that pretty well. It's not awesome, but it's pretty good. Upon opening, the devs have placed a screen with a list of what is available in-game and what will eventually become available. That all sounds cool, but they need to take a serious look under the hood before they make more additions. 
The base game is far from polished. While it hasn't crashed yet, I've had my share of glitches. Tonight, when I relogged after a glitch, my entire base, including all the materials I'd collected, was just gone. There was an explanation on the screen, but I'm not a coder ... something about something being outside a parameter. 
Glitches like this usually make many of us rage quit, but I rebuilt again.
Then, after another hour, I kept getting a warning that my base was being attacked. But, I had 3 bases claimed, and it wouldn't tell me which base was being attacked. And, since I had half a day away from all three bases, I knew I wouldn't get back before the base was demolished. But, it kept warning me that my base was being attacked ... until I found which base was being attacked and killed the attackers. 
Stuff like that makes me wonder if any of these devs have even played their own game. If my base is being attacked, and I have more than one, PLEASE TELL ME WHICH ONE IS BEING ATTACKED.
So, then I had to rebuild everything a second time tonight.
All that being said, I only recommend the game if you get it on sale and if you can tolerate some glitches for a pretty cool concept.",1705215258,1705215377,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I enjoy landscapes that allow a high degree of building and tech development as survival strategies within the logic of the game. Only one glitch so far , ( a combat jacket didn't materialise after I had gathered the raw material to make it) The Sunken exploitable sites are well made and the tools provided are great. The  audio quality in Sunkenland is excellent and clearly there is room to expand the work as development progresses.
Would like to see a ""save as"" function.  The number and types of elements required to access higher tech on The Research Desk is a little too high. Maybe reduce just a tad. Are other characters apart from the Trade Depot Gals anywhere in this game? Havent found a soul, apart from them and random raider grunts.
I have played 128 hours of this and so far very few anomalies/missing content etc. So good job. Glad I spent a few buck to help development of a game I think has huge potential.  Love the nod to climate change and rising sea levels.
Way cooler than Subnautica,   Sunkenland definitely has is own identity so far.
I hope you can finish the project girls and boys, (and all other non binary, non gendered  souls  in between them, they we us etc) Lovin Sunkenland

It will probably be even better once it's finished and ready to be fully released... provided Vector3 doesn't do what a lot of games are doing these days and letting the game sit in ""Early Access"" status for years on end.

One thing I would like to see them do is give a better explanation of what some of the items actually do. I may have overlooked it, but I didn't really see a tutorial system, which would be nice for players just getting into the game. However, for anyone that's played any other survival crafting games, it should have a reasonably low learning curve.

Sunkenland, in its early release, offers a tantalizing glimpse into a post-apocalyptic world submerged beneath the waves, where survival demands exploration, base building, and strategic defense. While the current feature set may still be in the developmental stages, it's evident that Sunkenland is on the path to becoming an exceptional game.

Exciting Exploration:
Dive into the depths of Sunkenland's underwater world, exploring sunken skyscrapers, nuclear power plants, and mysterious subway tunnels. The game introduces a captivating diving mechanic, encouraging players to gather resources, discover lost technologies, and collect rare pre-apocalypse items. As the developers expand on this concept, the potential for immersive exploration seems boundless.

Dynamic Base Building:
Sunkenland empowers players to build their bases in diverse locations, be it a water stronghold, a repurposed ship, or an island penthouse. The modular building system allows for creative freedom in designing enclaves, which, as the game evolves, promises to add depth and personalization to the player's survival experience.

Challenging Base Defense:
Defending against pirates and mutants adds a layer of strategic complexity. The current inclusion of high walls, barbed wire, traps, surveillance systems, and artillery showcases the potential for evolving base defense mechanics, promising exciting challenges for players as they strive to protect their territories.

Crafting and Survival:
Sunkenland introduces a crafting system that allows players to build a variety of items, from tools and weapons to vehicles like jetskis and helicopters. Gathering food, hunting sharks, growing plants, and managing supplies contribute to the game's survival aspect, encouraging players to make their bases sustainable in the resource-scarce environment.

Versatile Vehicles and Combat:
The inclusion of vehicles such as sailboats, jetskis, and gyrocopters amplifies the exploration experience. The promise of vehicle upgrades hints at an evolving transportation system. The game's combat, whether against mutants, pirates, or enemy atolls, showcases a diverse range of weapons and strategies, paving the way for thrilling confrontations on both sea and land.

Innovative Trading and Cooperative Play:
Sunkenland embraces a unique trading system, relying on item exchange rather than a universal currency. The cooperative multiplayer feature allows players to team up with friends, building bases, diving, exploring, and fighting pirates together. The potential for collaborative survival in this oceanic apocalypse hints at a promising cooperative experience.

While Sunkenland's current features are in the early stages, it's clear that the game holds immense potential. As the developers continue to refine and expand upon its unique mechanics, Sunkenland has the makings of a standout title in the survival and exploration genre, offering a thrilling underwater adventure for players seeking a blend of creativity, strategy, and cooperative play.",1705021794,1705021794,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's one of my most favorite genres out there. I've gone through Stranded Deep, Rust, Don't Starve, Raft and everything in between. I could go on and on about why I like these particular types of games, but I'm leaving this review for one reason.

This game has promise. Is it flawless in it's early access state? Well, no. That's obvious, but if these developers know what to do with this game, it could be big. How big determines how much they want think outside of the box. The basic premise is great. Stranded on an island, build a base, harvest resources, the same old same old, but that's where any early access games aims for.

First, the pros:
-Resource gathering not only above water, but below is really refreshing.
-Random AI attacks can break up the mundanity of building, collect, building, collect, building, collect. 
-Factions in the game, although barebonesy at the moment, are a great platform for future ideas the developers might have with it.
-Researching items feels fulfilling when you finally unlock the broken gun you found at the bottom of the ocean because you were searching for that one resource for the past 5 islands.
-Firefights are as good as you would expect from a early access game.
-Naked women neon lights you can find at the bottom of the ocean in a collapsed building. 'Nuff said. 

And, of course, the cons:
-Crashes. I've only been playing for 14 hours and got 3 of them.
-The building aspect leaves MUCH to be desired. Half the of the time your crafting benches clip through the walls and other items equally.
-Melee combat is unrefined and the enemy can get some easy cheap shots on you.
-When you die, you don't lose all your clothing/items. You spawn with all your hotbar items and clothes you died with. Not sure if this is a full con, but my Rust experience made me so confused when I found that out.
-Sharks. Fucking sharks.

In conclusion, I know I could've gone into more, but hopefully this will be good enough for you to determine if your 20 bucks will be well spent. I'm having a great time so far. Sure, I'll probably hit the wall where I have everything researched and I have all the resources I could possibly want, but for the time being, this was definitely worth my money. Also, I would feel like a dick if I didn't mention, I only played this on single player. So, to anyone courageous enough to do multiplayer, I don't have any information for you.

- building a base is fast paced, no crafting time, no weight (only limited by inventory slots)
- storage is varied, there are ammo box, fridge, food container, metal chest, wooden chest, safebox, shelf, etc, etc. So that alone works as a decor.
- storage can be put on top on other storage so we can use vertical space and organize better, it also has naming that's directly seen when facing it. 
- light source has decent range and it does not need maintenance, it's lit forever.


Things that I hate :
- time is too fast,
- not only time is too fast but it is also limiting sea exploration with cold because diving at night will catch cold, 
- the game has so many decors with many many different 3d objects and furnitures, but when an item is dropped it shows a BOX. Imo dropped items should show its original 3d model with added text for how many of it was dropped, not boxes.
- can't sleep on boat to skip night, so I have to prepare to go in the morning to get full time exploring the sea getting stuffs. 
(These 3 problems are related to the point it's annoying to go explore at random time.)
- open/close door is sometimes hard when there are other interactable items nearby such as storage.
- night time is too dark, I always hate darkness in a game if it does not have any game mechanic ties to it, ppl usually combat this with gamma or monitor brightness, WHY should players be tortured with that, just use a different style to portray night, like bluish tint or smth. No matter how a game tries to be realistic, it is still a game, we still need to see to play the game. The game has decent light source though, it gives enough illumination for the surrounding but NOT when at sea where I will spend most of the game time. I dont mind darkness as long as the game has good lighting, which the game has, but partially, dunno if later I can have light source at sea, but why not make it available early.
- sleeping 10h is too long, and the 14h delay for the next sleep sounds like it will mess up the sleep cycle. Imo we should be allowed to sleep at any time with custom duration.
- the game can be played without sleeping if I have tons of food (maybe at endgame), so maybe add penalty starting for 3days without sleep, decrease maxhp and maxstamina, add more penalty if not sleep for 7 days. That should force sleep.

Sometimes I need to do stuffs at base, cooking food, filling water, defending base, etc, then when I want to go to explore the sea, it's already noon or evening so I dont have full time for exploring the sea. Maybe :
- Remove the cold, it does nothing and blocking gameplay exploring the sea
- let me customize the day length
- add sleep on boat to skip time.",1704240654,1704933608,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

My only serious complaint is the building. Its wonky, broken, and extremely frustrating. Probably the WORST building of any survival game I have ever played. You never know which way a wall is facing, because it looks the same, and seems to automatically orient itself the wrong way. Its also very difficult to remove placed items, especially early on, making construction an absolute nightmare. Also the snapping will just randomly not work, leaving you with pieces of roofing missing, since the game will not allow you to snap random pieces into place.

I wouldn't mind the building being this broken and unpleasant if it weren't such a fundamental part of Sunkenland. Construction is an extremely important part of the game, as it is necessary to survive, but it feels as if it is just a necessity to get through in order to enjoy the rest of the game. I usually enjoy building, but in this game, expanding/modifying bases is basically hell. Otherwise, it is a very interesting game, and has A LOT of potential. If they fix this crucial piece of gameplay, then this title could be a major success. It is early access, and I understand that, but I cannot give it a good review until they fix this.

Theres a lot of small things such as:
-Seeing different loot in an enemy storage chest than your friends, 
-Traders always have the same thing for sale every day
-Swimming faster than sharks you can run laps around them stabbing them theres no real aquatic threats. 
-When I unlocked items reliant on power, at least for me it was not very clear how to power them.

Then there are two bigger issues
Inventory Management
- Trying to bind E to ""Use"" instead of the default F causes you to dump everything inside a chest when you press E to close the chest because rather then close an open Chest, E is also bound to ""Take everything from chest"" instead of something more common like ""R"" or just a take all button. Me and my friend were constantly pressing E to open a chest, placing a few things into  it, then instinctively pressing E to close it and the entire contents of the chest would fill our inventory and the remainer spill onto the floor. 
- Theres a lot of storage/inventory QOL improvements to be made. I want to be able to split items inside a chest, or take only 1/2 of a stack from a chest. It would be nice to have the ability to send similar loot to a chest, or in proximity be able to send your loot to nearby chests that contain that loot like in Necesse. Its great that theres tons of different items in this game, but i often find myself placing the same thing in different chests either because the storage space is too small, or the stack size is way too small, or i didnt realize it was in another chest because I have 10 chests im  trying to keep organized. Having automatic storage sorting QOL improvements would help manage the loot. 

Enemy AI
-My biggest complaint is the Enemy AI. Oh my god if they fixed only one thing it should be the AI. They See you through everything, snap to your position and fire with precision, dont reload, say anything or try anything creative. They generally dont react to their buddies getting into fire fights. But once they do know you are there they aim at your direction pacing left and right waiting for you to pop your head out so they can shoot before you can flinch. 

Why am I going out to loot places to the goods back to my base if bringing the stuff back is a nightmare? Why raid bases, build base defenses to be raided, If enemy AI is either brain dead with fists/spears or insufferably over powered with rapid fire guns? This game is fun, I am still having fun. I dont think in its current state its worth 20 bucks.. I know its early access but I think there needs to be a good amount of focus on AI/Storage UI. The coop was good, something people don't always get right and is often buggy. So Kudos on that. I look forward to updates as the game progresses through early access and would be happy to revisit.",1704802820,1704802820,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

There are also serious issues such as spawning in a thousand meters from your base even though you just saved there. A lot of the UI and build system is clunky. The AI is brain dead but also spawns in with guns so they can easily overpower you...but they spawn in the water and have to swim to your base so it's really more of a chore to deal with...and you'll have to deal with it because raids come in regularly and are both underwhelming and overly annoying to deal with. You don't get anything really for beating them and they destroy your base so you have to repair it---which is also a janky mechanic right now because things can get in the way of repairing what you actually want to repair. Let's see...what else...the underwater exploration to find salvage was incredibly simple and under developed. If that doesn't get an overhaul then don't buy this game. It's a game about the world being covered in water and you have less space to explore then Seven Day s and less variety somehow. Kick it up a notch,1704790164,1704790164,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Examples:
- Iron sights and ""red dot sights"" are incredibly inaccurate, you actually have to rely on a tiny green dot above your gun to aim and it is even slightly off.
- as addressed above, boats tend to glitch out and either get stuck on debris or glitch out and launch themselves.
- enemies are clueless when raiding their island until they spot you and light you up through walls that should be impossible to shoot through.
- a lot of useless research for a single item that only has one use
- extremely low oxygen when diving and requires multiple scuba tanks.
- only one generator size that can only power a battery station rather than multiple items
- hunger and dehydration when waking up and most food and water don't even hydrate or feed the player that much so you're constantly looking for food.
-healing items aren't all that easy to come by and even the trader only has 10 pill bottles that go rather quick

In the hour we played, we had three different times where someone would join and grief us. One joined, grabbed a bunch of wood and built random walls around. One took all of our scrap and wood from our containers and left. The last straw was someone joining while we were in the water, emptied our chests as much as they could and took our boat away from our island somewhere and left.

Definitely a fun game however the combat is atrocious. The game as a whole feels quite outdated, surprisingly even the graphics. The vehicle options are quite good and I'm sure it will just keep getting better. 

Sunkenland is for sure one of the mid tier early access games I've played. In order for this to be top tier the combat needs a heavy overhaul, melee and ranged both. There needs to be more sea life, majority of this game is scavenging the sea for materials and rare items. As of right now, the only sea life that you can interact with is Marlin, Sea Turtles and two different sharks. The other fish are caught with a fishing rod and/or traps.

The game improves as you progress. Adjusting server settings to decrease the number of enemies during island battles and disabling persistent raids on your base enhances the experience. This customization allows for more exploration, leading to the discovery of additional materials like gun parts and iron. Iron becomes crucial for upgrading craft tables, armor, and weapons. Eventually, producing steel becomes a game-changer. Building a solid base and having fun is possible, but after around 30 hours, it may feel like you've exhausted most content. Although you can still collect materials and enhance your base, claiming islands with a flag seems to halt enemy respawns. In summary, the game becomes more enjoyable over time, especially when playing with friends, providing approximately 25-30 hours of gameplay.


INITIAL REVIEW AFTER 3 hours
The game shows promise initially, but after investing 6 hours, I found it to be somewhat frustrating. There's a considerable amount of grinding with minimal rewards. Upgrading the crafting station to the next level triggers relentless attacks on your bases, making it challenging since you repeatedly spawn back in the base. Sharks pose a significant threat, causing you to lose all your belongings, and they appear to navigate through walls in structures. Wood, a crucial resource, is surprisingly scarce compared to other materials. Weapons feel underpowered, and multiplayer experiences glitches, with players getting stuck within walls. While crafting has potential, the enjoyment diminishes after upgrading the crafting station, turning into a monotonous grind for minimal gains. The lack of customization options for difficulty levels, FPS settings, and character features is a downside. In conclusion, I would advise against purchasing the game at this time. It's better to wait and see if the developers address and fix these issues in the future. If not for the 6-hour gameplay limit on refund requests, I would have considered seeking a refund.",1703816110,1704566932,True,0,0,0.540192961692810059,0,True,False,True

The survival is pretty easy, to the point where I haven't bothered upgrading my food or water supply, and if I'm being honest, there is nothing particularly spectacular about the combat or the rest of the gameplay, and that's no fault of the game, as these days nothing is original. However, all of these elements come together to create something that's unique, and I love that. The enemy factions help you not feel so alone, and it can help put some pressure on you too, but not as much pressure as more hardcore survival games.
Even if all of that sounds too easy or too hard, you can tailor the difficulty to create a comfortably challenging experience just for you. 

The only complaint I really have is the sound design, and it's not the use of stock sounds that bothers me. It's the fact that the sound engine is just, god awful. Traders voices will overlap, an enemy on the other side of the island will sound like he's 5 feet away, you hear the same 3 splashes on a loop when sailing across the seas.

No story or creative mode but I believe that is coming. 

Mainstream game studios NEED to take a LOOK and learn lessons.

The guns feel powerful and the excitement of raiding and being raided reminds me of alpha rust which I haven't been able to experience since then.

There's a few bugs like boats transporting to other places when you get out of them and if you're a passenger in a boat it glitches a bit. You can also shoot sharks and marlins underwater as long as you aren't underwater as well which seems quite unrealistic. The addition of a harpoon for underwater combat would be really cool.

It gives off 7 Days to Die, Rust, and Raft vibes, however 7DTD came out 10 years ago and STILL hasnt really improved... But if Sunkenland proves itself in the next year or so, it would be a great contender.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some insights and feedback regarding the gameplay experience in your recent release. While I thoroughly enjoyed the initial days of gameplay, I've observed some areas that could benefit from improvement.

Firstly, the combat dynamics need attention. At long range, the bots exhibit inadequate combat skills, often failing to engage effectively. Conversely, at close range, there appears to be an issue with the bots using aimbot capabilities through obstacles such as trees and bushes, resulting in a lack of visibility for the player. Additionally, I've encountered instances where bots attempted to shoot through walls, undermining the overall gaming experience.

Furthermore, there is a notable absence of diverse traps within the game. As a player who enjoys constructing bases for self-defense, I believe the inclusion of more trap options would enhance the strategic aspects of the gameplay, especially in anticipation of potential player versus player (PvP) elements.

On a related note, I would like to express some concerns about the helicopter controls. The current setup seems unconventional and challenging to navigate. I suggest a more intuitive control scheme, such as assigning roll to AWSD, left and right direction control to mouse movement, and using left and right clicks for ascend and descend functions. Alternatively, providing customizable keybinds for helicopter controls would offer players the flexibility to tailor the controls to their preferences.

I appreciate your dedication to delivering an exceptional gaming experience, and I believe addressing these concerns would contribute significantly to enhancing overall player satisfaction. Thank you for your attention to these matters, and I look forward to witnessing further improvements in future updates.

Best regards, SLoPAH.

Needs work such as a good deal more content
Some glitches like boat jummping when you get out of them
Ai's arent too easy as they do a lot of damage despite not great complexity but helped by there defending nature most of the time but they should attack on boats as swimming doesn't even make sence but that is probably coming in the future
The map is not bad and would be great if a lot larger and more diverse
Optermisations needed as fps drop with two moderate sized bases was not good on high end hardware albeit at 4k but 120 fps to about 80-90 is not good (had 6 boats as well) and not far from the fps of raytracing games although i believe it was probably with bad multithreading support at a guess.
Building is better than in a lot of released games i have played as it can be awkward but not even close to the worst i have seen.

We gamers are spoiled. We get the most awesome products for the cheapest prices. Therefor it becomes extra clear when you have a product, clearly unfinished, and clearly in a very rough playable state with no mechanics, graphics or content that warrants the current price for it. 

Thats what Sunkenland is at its current state. Rough, very buggy, unfriendly UI and dito mechanics and very little, very quickly repetitive content that warrants no further appeal to play. the gameworld, while graphics look more than okay, is bland, janky and repeats itself with assets that do not invite me to look further than I already have.

I also cannot see how the developers are going to ""fix"" this within a decent timeframe. This seems to be made by a team of 7, while there are plenty of other examples of smaller teams delivering a more finished product which costs a whole lot less, with loads more content and/or mechanics to enjoy.

the load time to even get to the main main menu of this game takes a while, but after a while after i loaded in, i noticed the character selection doesnt really have much yet, and also hair 2 is floating from the character's head btw. the gameplay is your average survival game, chop trees, chop rocks, loot things or scavenge for things, and die to things. there is no background music and only the sound of waves moving. (please add background music, like music that changes for certain situations you are in or where you are at)
the gameplay is boring and its hard to find a reason to really try and play this game, i looked at someone elses base on a community post and i wanted to build something like that, and i decided to try and load up a world to build something like it, and i got bored within 10 minutes of collecting resources to try and build it. also the combat is really fustrating and bad. you will likely die if you dont have more than 5 bandages on you because you will constantly get hit by bullets, spears, arrows, and a ton of other crap and will always bleed. this game NEEDS to improve their combat system. i cannot fucking stand always constantly bleeding out and dying to a single jab in the arm with a spear. PLEASE make it so that you can bleed out for a bit and not until you die. i DONT want to keep making bandages as they are very expensive early game because it is hard to find cloth. the concept of sunkenland is a good concept, and i think it is being executed pretty good so far, but i dont really know if the developers are still updating this game because i still see the shopkeepers or traders selling halloween related stuff to me. i also think the trading system should just be converted into coins or into a currency rather than trading objects as it can make your inventory very messy and full. also, game settings dont save, when you exit the game and re launch the game,  you can check the game settings again but this time it doesnt show what you previously selected. example, i selected very high graphic settings, but when i relaunched the game later, it showed as low graphic settings. i am also pretty sure the FOV settings dont save too. i havent gotten far in this game yet but so far the only enemies raiding my base are naked skinny men or women, and i can easily kill them all with a bow. are there any other enemies in this game that can raid your bases? because i think if there was a progression system for raiding that would be great. if you obtained a gun and ammo, then it progresses the enemies that raid your base from using spears or their fists to using guns and wearing clothes maybe??? 

sunkenland isnt really worth $19.99 or $15.99 at this current stage of the game's development because it doesnt have enough to offer.

also if the devs are reading this, please lower the onsale price or general price of sunkenland a bit.

That aside, there are some flaws with the current iteration of the game:
1. the combat isn't smooth, mainly with the handling of the guns and the way the red dot sight is implemented. There are two dots on my screen when I aim down sight and only one of them is accurate, this resulted in so many missed bullets.
2. The fact that I have to spend 5 minutes after a raid going around my base repairing every piece of structure is not fun. Repairing is too tiresome and tedious as it is right now, especially when enemies seem to have infinite ammo.
3. Though this isn't strictly a flaw, the game could benefit from more AFK resource farms that could gather stuff like scrap metal, wood, cloth etc.

The game is in a good state now, and it seems that the developers are continuing to push fixes and new features.

I'd consider it to be most similar to Stranded Deep, with less focus on overall survival mechanisms and more combat.  The coop was pretty solid with only a few minor hiccups. I use a private server to avoid unwanted guests.  The combat is decent but I'm interested to see the next release which promises some updates in that area. Guns are cool and feel solid, but the enemies will often stand around until engaged. Once engaged they will take cover and move around, so the AI is not too bad. They are also not aim-bots which is nice; just don't get surrounded. I also like the base attacks. This is missing or badly done in most games. 7 days to die is one of the few survival games with decent tower defense. This game certainly doesn't compete with 7 days in that regards but overall I like the random attacks and they add a challenge/threat without the enemy easily ripping your base to pieces. Overall crafting system is good and there's a decent amount of content. I got this on the holiday sale and it was well worth the money, but I would still have been satisfied if I'd paid full price.

Things I'd like to see (I know a big update is on the way, so maybe it will address some of these):
1) Underwater play needs some tweaks. There's isn't enough underwater threat, as there are only a few sharks and they really aren't hard to take out if you have the appropriate level spear - you can also cheese kill them from the surface.
  - I'd slow swimming speed down (maybe 30%)
  - Reduce lighting in the deeper areas
  - Increase overall oxygen slightly to compensate (maybe 20%
  - Quadruple the time a headlight lasts on a single battery; headlamp is completely useless as is - flares are way better.
  - Double or triple the time the underwater scooter lasts on a battery, although unlike the headlamp its still quite useful as is.
  - Add more aggressive marine life and more ways to defend yourself from them. Sharks are relatively easy to kill but fighting them is just trading blows as you don't appear to be able to dodge them or interrupt their attacks by timing your hit.
  - The idea is to make deep water dives dangerous and scary, but not tedious if you have the proper gear. Rewards should also be greater for deeper dives to make it worth the effort. The swim food is great and I like that it makes such a difference you want to make it and use it.

2) Storage improvements. Overall storage isn't bad and in general survival games range from tedious to unplayable at default storage settings, which is why all the top survival games support mods - so no-one has to use the developer's settings. Comparably Sunkenland is pretty good but still needs some improvements.
  - Scrap metal should be stackable to 50. You need to keep enough around to expand or move to a new base, so you can't dump it, but it takes way too much space.
  - Return half as much coal from furnaces and cooking. The stack size if fine, but you just don't need the amount returned. It's dump-able at least, but that just tedious.
  - Special decoration items should be found at 1/2 to 1/3 the rate. I have 5 of all the common decorations in a single play-through with absolutely no looting areas more than once. I sold so many items I have an entire chest of silver coins and nothing to spend them on, but at least ""sell"" items are stackable.
  - In general I'd say double the stack size of items like cloth, glass, ore, rubber, ...
  - Vehicles need to have upgradable storage and larger boats should have 2 storage containers. The helicopter should really have 2, as it's otherwise useless given that the time it takes to land negates any speed advantage, so why would you use it. You could also make it easier to fly, but generally I can control the helicopter even through controlling the tilt with a mouse is really not ideal.

3) Random map generation: 
  - Implement a socket system, like Stranded Deep, where there are only so many areas predefined and you simply plug them into a socketable grid. POIs would need to be flagged with a difficulty rating and underwater vs land so the socket algorithm could place them suitably, but the process is otherwise pretty straight forward. It doesn't really generate anything, but rather places POIs differently and can choose a preset amount from a list 2 or 3 times the size so the end result may have different POIs from a previous and all in different positions.

4) Floating driveable base:
  - I love games where you can build and expand a base and move it with you as you explore. This really isn't done anywhere except in Raft, but its the entire promise of the game, and Ark.
  - Obviously a big ask, but would be a great feature.

Overall I think the developers have done a great job. Developing a game is not easy, but what they have is already worthy of being on the shortlist of good survival games and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.",1704329939,1704329939,True,1,0,0.520958065986633301,0,True,False,True

This game is really great. I have a great time playing this with my family. It is my favorite game so far. I wish you guys could expand it more. I hope there will be much more animals on the land, like chicken, duck, pig, or maybe cow or sheep, and also hostile animal like wolf, tiger, hyena or else. It will make so much exciting to play this game. And also I wish you could add other sea animal like whale, dolphin, squid or octopus, and other hostile sea creatures, and other fish like clown fish etc that we could catch them and put them in the aquarium. I hope you could expand the buiding so there will be a stone building or concrete, and you could add more accesoris for the home decor.

Con: As with many other Unity based survival games, once you build a half-decent base (i.e. with more than a few models/items) the frames per second drops a lot. It went from over 100 fps to 40-59fps very quickly on my 3080, regardless of graphic settings. It is only alpha early access though so hopefully this can be addressed in future updates but it does worry me, as so many unity games suffer the same issue.

First, Negative

1. I swear bots have some kind of advantage because they can shoot through trees

2. Movement underwater is so unbalanced. I made a guide that shows you how to be faster than all boats with items the game intended for you to use.

3. The Price is a little big for the state it is in now, maybe it can be cheaper while in early access?

Now, Positive

1. The Crafting/Research System, while short is very fun to grind for, except steel ingots, which are a pain with one furnace but otherwise is not that bad.

2. The combat is fun and a little broken, but the game is in early access so I give that a pass

3. Trading is pretty cool and fun.

Overall, could become i nice rust raft mix that could do great for years to come when released.

Extra Notes:
If you're wondering why I didn't mention servers, well I will here. First, as long as you aren't looking for random people to play with, you should be fine setting the max players to the amount you are planning on playing with. (Ex. I wanna play with my friend so i set it to 2 so only we play.) I've never seen hackers get in my worlds when doing this, so I'm sure you won't have any issues when doing this. Also, THIS GAME IS NOT A RIPOFF OF RAFT OR RUST IT JUST TAKES SOME FEATURES FROM THE TWO TO MAKE AN UNIQUE EXPERIENCE! Whew, sorry, I just had to let that out.

I'd recommend you play with at least 1 friend but single player is still pretty fun.
Choose wisely but I would recommend getting it if you have the money.
Have Fun!

That said, here's what I got after finishing this in about 15 hours --

- Lack of any real substance after 10-15 hours of play time. Once you wipe out the islands of AI enemies there's nothing left to do but sit around and watch the ocean and just survive.

- Interesting water world concept and potential to add some really cool things in the future such as subs, naval combat, piracy, etc.

- Has good bones to build on for the future and make really awesome improvements if it doesn't get abandoned.

- UI needs work as well as sorting options to be more fleshed out with QoL adjustments such as simple things like transfer of items that match from your inventory to a container you have open.

- Too many useless items like clothes that don't do anything for your stamina or ability to not freeze.

- Map is too small and has no procedural generation to keep things fresh for future runs.

- No weather, nor seasons. No ability to warm outside of a fire, as previously mentioned the clothes are pointless beyond armor.

- Missed opportunity to take advantage of this world concept and have subs, better scuba tanks, wet suits, underwater base building or secrets under the water beyond the POI ones.

- AI is clumsy and makes firefights a complete mess. AI also raids your base in a really uninspired way, as they simply just appear on your island with nothing to make it even seem remotely realistic. 

- Guns need a lot of work for not only recoil but scopes and just better combat in general.

- Building is lackluster and needs more flexibility on build options. Though there is a good amount of cosmetic items, a lot of them are oddly just Halloween inspired, unsure why this is..

There is a lot of work to do and right now feels a lot like a side project a group of buddies put together. Hoping and optimistic in the future this changes. For now if you just want something short lived and casual then it's worth about $10-15 during a sale. The price tag currently doesn't justify my personal rule of dollars to hours spent finishing the game. If the hours spent are less than how much I bought it, it's not worth the cost.

[b] Final review score - 6/10 [/b]
If you want a short lived casual survival game then this is for you. If you want something you can sink a lot of time into and enjoy returning to this world for future adventures with friends, you will be very disappointed.

Knowing that they are actually continuing with improving and expanding is great.

There are certainly several things I'd like to see in the future, such as more friendly NPCs and, the ability to build on outposts/settlements you clear and claim (not just build on platforms you create).
Expanding the building to include some form of solar/biogas creation, and the ability to 'name' beds (dying and have 4 different 'simple beds' becomes a roulette of 'guess which is a satellite base and which is your home base that is on the other side of the map from where you are)

1. It's an old unimaginative trope.
2. Very much a work in progress.
3. The NPCs that attack your base will always have better gear and never drop anything. 
Reason three is the reason is why I recommended this game. Normally NPCs are a joke, easily handled by the player. But Sunkenlands devs must have known this and their NPCs will always have better guns , armor, and come in large numbers. I don't consider myself a pro-gamer. I'm just a grampa that likes to play games. So I'm average in my age group, below average against younger gamers. The NPCs will destroy your base, even my reinforced metal walls didn't hold up.

There's a lot of room for different play styles and I really like the overall feeling of the game. I'm particularly enjoying the raiding and pillaging of mutant and marauder bases. Feels kind of like Sea of Thieves meets 7D2D. I also feel like the learning curve to this game isn't as steep as some others, which is in some ways refreshing. It's a little more forgiving and you're not thrown to the wolves right off the bat.

As for bugs and other issues, this game seems to be really solid. I haven't had any crashes or issues with kicking or latency in multiplayer. The only issue that I have seen (when I'm hosting a game) is that when my friend is using a boat (sailboat in this case) he cannot exit the boat while I'm in my inventory or a chest, otherwise it will teleport him all the way back to wherever he was when I opened my inventory or the chest. Not a big issue, since he'll just check to make sure I'm not in my inventory or chest when he tries to exit the boat.

One last item I'd like to see improved in a future release would be for the cursor on the map to move in real time when you are a passenger on a boat. This would make navigation quite a bit easier when you are trying to guide your teammate to a specific location.

At first, I was thrilled to dive into this supposedly epic adventure. The promise of exploring islands, discovering hidden treasures, and sailing the vast ocean had me hooked. But alas, my dreams were shattered faster than a shipwreck hitting a coral reef.

The moment I set sail, I noticed something was off. The islands seemed to be floating in some sort of distorted space-time continuum. I mean, come on, I'm all for a little creative liberty, but this was just too much. It felt like I was navigating through a twisted Salvador Dali painting rather than a coherent game world.

And then the arguments began. The community was divided into factions, each passionately defending their theories about the spatial anomalies. It was like a never-ending debate club, but with less logic and more frustration. I found myself caught in the crossfire, trying to make sense of it all.

Eventually, the developers decided to throw in the towel and issued refunds to everyone. I guess they realized that arguing about space in an ocean game was a lost cause. But hey, at least they admitted their mistake and tried to make things right.

In the end, this game left me feeling seasick, not from the rolling waves, but from the endless arguments and disappointment. If you're looking for a smooth sailing experience, I suggest you steer clear of this one. Save your sanity and find a game where the only thing you argue about is who gets the last slice of virtual pizza.

Please just know that it is in early access, and for only being out a few months, It's definitely worth waiting to see what the devs have to offer. Crafting, raids, exploring, building, It's all here! I have been hooked on this game, waiting for the opportunity to actually play it for myself, as well as support the devs in doing so ;) 

A few things I would like to point out are the heap amount of bugs with the water and boats, all of them seem to love flying across the map if you jump out and end up under them, its super odd and happens very very rarely. Another thing is when you have buildings in the water, the boats (mainly sail boat) will glitch under the foundations and will never sail again :'( When it comes to exploring, the sharks do not care about physics and go right through buildings, so be careful when exploring the school because I about died in there.

Trading; I would like to see more items being offered by the trader instead of what is offered. Maybe it does that, but I have about 20 in game days passed and the trader has the same stuff and the Halloween stuff still being there I find a little lazy considering its New Years day at the time of this review.

Enemies(NPC); The movements i'd say are pretty damn good, however the shooting aspect of it, its almost as if the ones with guns have literal aimbot(even on easy mode) It's not impossible, but you need to stay constantly moving until they need to reload before pushing at them. The NPC's with crossbow's and early game pistols are easy to go against. Another thing is it seems that some of the enemies respawn after killing all of them. The mutants like to respawn on Small Rock Island and not any of the other places. I'm not sure if they are meant to respawn or not respawn at all. 

Overall the game I see has a ton of potential, and I am very eager to see what there is in store.

The game, despite being in early access has been smooth running and rather enjoyable. The customisation and mods currently available set sight to unlimited (in a way) of imagination. 

Couple points 

- If you're loading multiplayer then make sure the host / players are on the correct server network as this impacts the ping majorly. I have noticed a few times where the server location has tried to set it to Asia over Europe though it is easily changeable. 

- Set passwords on the game servers if you do not wish other players to join. This will stop random people joining obviously.

- There is a ""Friendly Fire"" in the modify section and difficulty / raid intensity can be adjusted which is a very nice touch depending  on your play style or what you want to do.

Gather resources, build your base, grow crops, research tech, grow stronger and venture forth to explore a world dominated by clans that will kill you on sight. Epic gunfights where the enemy will take cover when shot at, will charge you with axes or spears and hide in wait for you to enter a room before blasting you with a shotgun. 
There are some bugs though where after a huge gunfight there will be a bot still standing watch over the ocean waiting for someone to attack metres from the gunfight, your boat may glitch when entering causing you to be thrown out and the boat respawn from the sky, when facing the front of the boat and exiting you'll be spun 180, beware where you go as you may be able to pass through a gap one way but not the other causing you to be trapped inside.

You'll harvest trees and if you leave some saplings they'll grow to be full trees and seed new trees, which will sometimes grow through the floor of your buildings but it doesn't damage them so that's a positive.

Many clans have solar panels but you don't which is frustrating.

* It's still Early Access; I know the developers have some plans posted when the game loads up, but there doesn't seem to be anything about game play other than adding quests (talk more about this later). That's a little disappointing, as there is so much that can be done sooner rather than later to improve the game.

1. Enemies do not reliably respawn on islands after you've killed them. My trio has conquered a few islands (but hasn't claimed them as our own) hoping enemies would respawn for more PVP later on, but that's not the case. As there are a limited number of islands, it'll eventually just be us with no PVP save for the 'raids' every few days. Very 7-days-to-die, once the islands are gone.

2. It is not open world; it might be a bit more enjoyable if it was, or if there were more options for your server (limit of 16 players) to start different factions, build on separate islands, etc. That way, you could compete / be working against friends instead of having to be on the same team. There IS friendly fire (if you enable it), but you would all have to start on the same island as a group before taking over others to have that working-against-each-other kind of game play. That takes away all the PVP from NPC's, however.

3. Still quite a few glitches. The biggest two I've had is the boat glitching back to base, leaving you stranded in the ocean. Another is - when placing things in your base against a wall - you can access it from the other side of the wall. This means if you have storage boxes on either side of a wall, you really have to move around to find the right angle to hit the one you want. This can get frustrating.

4. Hackers are a big problem. I've tried password-protected lobbies as well as private lobbies (not shown as public) and have had hackers join both. They use God mode (unable to be killed) and spawn in insane amounts of loot we haven't even unlocked yet, then use it to try and kill us and/or demolish our base. Server hosts are able to kick people, but we don't get an alert when a hacker joins our server, so it's based on us finding them before they demolish our progress.

5. The map definitely needs to be bigger and contain more islands, as you can get through most of the game in a couple of days. This is where quests will come in handy; there is currently no point in the game other than to build a base, defend it from raids, and kill the NPC's on other islands. Again, you're left with a 7-days-to-die style game once you build a base and kill the NPC's on other islands.


Overall, I really do love the concept of the game. I love that you have to dive for loot, fight sharks, fight other factions, sail the seas to visit other islands, etc. I really hope the devs put more work into a story-line and quest-line, and that we see the devs either region-locking servers, or finding another way to keep hackers out, as this will kill the game before it even takes off.",1704137366,1704137366,True,1,0,0.516666650772094727,0,True,False,True

- Make base raids more interactive and more challenging.
* Let us make traps that can kill the enemies, barbed wire to slow them down
* Improve the spawn places of the enemies in raids, when we get raided sometimes the enemies are inside rocks or a whole different place than near our base and they never come near.

- Make automation systems
* conveyors, pumps, sorting system, etc.
* Oil rigs and ore rigs that pump up ores from the bottom of the ocean

- Building
* Make it cheaper to build or let us upgrade the already built things with the hammer
* Fix the stair placement, when i try to place stairs they go everywhere except where i want them,

- Npcs/Enemies
* Let us be able to make alliances with certain factions
* Add more variety to the trading outpost, make it to where some items get swapped every 3 - 7 ingame days
* Add more underwater monsters and let us fish with spears or harpoon guns

- Productivity
* Furnaces: only letting us put one ore into a furnace at once should be criminal which is why you should either make automation systems or let us put 2 in at once or just make the time to smelt shorter.
* Grill: Make it to where the improved grill lets you grill 2 - 3 items instead of one on the simple grill.

* Additions that would be cool (maybe)
- Let us extract blood or something from mutants which we can use to change our DNA to get gills or iron body or something like that, to change our lung time and that
- Make a vehicle workshop where we can make our own custom vehicles in a simple way but expensive, this would be that there would be indicators where we can place stuff so we dont make broken stuff but we can still make things that are good.
- Schematics: Make it to where we can find base schematics so people that arent that good at building can use those to make a cool house.

Final conclusion and review:
This game being in early access is insane for the amount of content there is, there is a bright future for this game and I believe that the developers are doing the right thing listening to feedback and taking actions on the bugs and new additions.

After just a few hours into gameplay, regardless of the Early Access State of Development,  i gifted out 5 copies to friends, and we can all agree ... exploring below the water, on the land, fighting factions, defending our outpost, claiming new lands, conquering faction lands and raiding their outposts, surviving together is amazing fun times in Sunkenland! The Sunkenland world looks amazing, and does not require a expensive Computer or Graphix Card to play and enjoy.
- CO-OP -
The performance is very stable, even in Co-Op Mode with 7 Friends playing together. Having the ability to customize the world settings  Research Blueprints [Shared/Not Shared], Survival Mode ""Food and Water"" [Low/High] , Friendly Fire [on/off], Shared MAP [on/off], Shared Bed [on/off] Can determine PVP Server or PVE Server Experience. Depending on your Style of Gameplay the ability to customize to your style is there! Base Building, Decorative Props, Blueprints, WorkStations, crafting system, blueprint research fits into both styles of PVP or PVE.

EARLY ACCESS: [Future Ideas]
I personally hope to see some additions in future updates.
- Claim system limited to 1 island or area that blocks others from building on your claimed area.
- Bigger islands and underwater base building
- Pin Coded Doors/Storage [lock/unlock] for security or that PVP like experience.
- More Animals [rabbits, coyote, boar, snakes, jelly fish, giant clam]  
- Mini Boss like Creatures [Mutant Mermaids, Killer Whale, Giant Octopus, Mutant Leaders, Faction Generals]
- Mini Submarine , pontoon party barge with gun mounts :)
- Dedicated Servers :) - looking forward to JAN 2024 updates!

** Highly Recommended** try out Sunkenland !! while its half priced 15$ I think your gonna like it too

The graphics aren't the prettiest, but somehow they add to the worn, post-apocalyptic feel of the game. If Kevin Costner would make a game about a post-apocalyptic waterworld, Sunkenland would be it.

SunkenLand is one of the most fun Open world Survival Craft games I have ever played. 
It mixes the building style of Rust (sort of) + Stranded Deep gameplay + 7 days to die inventory system 

Pros 
1. Easy to learn and get started 
2. Fun and engaging building system 
3. Interesting loot system and beautiful environments (for a Early Access game) 
4. Crafting at its finest, not too hard or grindy to get items or too fast to get to more advanced items
5. Auto save during crashes or when ALT-F4ing the game (or at least that's my experience)
6. Building system is spectacular and leaves a TON of room to customize and add modularity to your base
7. Progressing is fluid and slows down a bit in some places but overall good!
8. Progressing AI during raids! they start with nothing and evolve over time eventually carrying heavier weapons!
Cons
1. AI is a bit dumb or Esports players pixel peaking angles that dont make sense or shoot through geometry
2. Armor durability is very low and feels almost useless till you get 55+ armor (all together)
3. Animations are a bit jank in some areas as well as alot of textures tend to be muddy even on highest settings
4. Laggy (stuttering)  even on beefier systems (mine: R7 5700X / RTX 4070 / 32gb 3600mhz) avg Fps on High: 80-90 @1440p 144hz while running a server 
5. Object loading tends to make the game stutter 
6. Audio is bugged in some cases with clicks and pops happening when you break items or loading into areas.
7. AI is VERY dumb during raids and tend to stand in place or walk into a wall or straight up ignore you if you have barb wire next to you 


Overall 7/10
very good game for a Early Access game! it def has issues here and there but im sure it will get fleshed out and fixed but I would wait till this game is on sale for 15$ 
Pick it up for 20 if its exactly what you are looking for but this game is a really decent game for open world Survival craft game!

With that info in the back of your mind, here's my review of this asset flip: No health regen. TINY inventory space. Enemies kill you in 2 shots, but you have to shoot them 8 times before they die. Loot drops on death and there's nothing you can do about it. Can't turn off hunger/thirst/energy drain. No tutorial. The building is terrible and stuff doesn't even 'snap' correctly, plus enemies still spawn on a location that you've claimed as your own, so you constantly have to fight off enemies on your home base. Terrible regional pricing and game is for sale in ruzzia. This is a $5 game, not a $20 game.

I was going to give this game a positive review until today. Unfortunately every time you log-in you have to ""create your server,"" which is not an issue, except for one thing:

The game never remembers what your previous settings were, so it always defaults to creating a Public server, where anyone can join.

Turns out that someone joined our server and destroyed everything we had built within a matter of minutes, because anyone who joins has access to all your structures. There is no way around it currently, no factions, no clan that they need to join, etc. So if you ever forget to set your ""server"" as private, anyone can join and grief.",1693859394,1704049193,False,370,37,0.845421075820922852,26,True,False,True

Gun play is okay. Recoil system needs some work.

Here's the real issue. This game is full of security flaws.  Don't listen to reviews that state any of this is fixed by password protecting your game.

Passwords on servers can be bypassed. 
There is no banning option. 
You IP is easily exposed. Attackers can then gain access to your system via unity exploits.
Zero cheat protection. Anyone can run hacks on your server there is no way to disable this.

However, I would like to see a heavy focus on bug fixes such as the enemies not respawning, as it makes the game unplayable. I’ve had to restart a couple time because of this, so I hope it’s fixed somewhat soon. Another thing is there NEEDS to be a ban system. Kicking a player is simply not enough.

Things I would love to see changed.
Add a clan/tribe/guild system, whatever you want to call it. That way I/we/Server admins, can allow strangers, for lack of a better word, play on the server. 
You can have Friendly fire off or on, so it can be a PvE or PvP server, giving the game more reason to be played. As is I can't play with my friends AND let people in since we would all share, and griefers would be an issue.So as of now I strictly keep it to 1 or 2 friends no more. 

The game needs longevity, atm it is seriously lacking that. Half the mods on nexus should be added as standard for the game.
Admin panel
Compass
Ability to control use speed of air, water, food, stamina, fuel etc.

 You can frustratingly interact with crafting stations through walls, and other stations. A lot of things dont respect walls, like sharks. This is a key flaw in a base building/fortress game. The rules for construction are not respected by the game and you can end up with rooms with no roof because the build system wont let you. 
There is an extensive gun building system, but its lazy as you need a key ingredient for each ""broken X gun"". You dont craft so much as repair.
The gunplay is ok, but a little janky. There are a lot of clothes for something with minimal stats, almost like dress ups were a core feature.

Ignoring the obvious early access typical stuff.  

Pros: Good concept and some good lighting.  Very 7 days to die feel(thought potentially a better game for sure).  Crafting system has a good start as long as they continue to develop it.  

Cons Fixable: Enemy pathing and combat awareness needs attention.  Factions don't alert friendlies to danger.  So picking them off one or two at a time is easy.  The aiming of firearms is a little off.   I can clearly see them and for fast moving bullets, should connect.   I can understand for bows and crossbows but the combat system needs a rework in this area.  Also, unless I am really unlucky with bullet spread, bullet paths should not be blocked by invisible barriers.  Chain link fences shouldn't block bullets for the most part anyways. 


Maybe fixable?:  Maybe its the game engine they are using, I don't really know enough but fps should be much more streamlined by now.  We have been playing these games for years!  Clunky FPS is not acceptable.  Also repairing base blocks can be difficult due to the requirement for the hammer to hit the block.  If another block gets in the way or the swing path isn't connecting with the intended block, repair doesn't happen.  

The underwater portion of the game seems to be the best part so that is good.  However everything above ground seems a little clunky for today's technology.   

So I am on the fence about this one.  There are some things that are easily fixable but some other things that seem to be built into the game that I don't like.

There are many areas the game team have yet to develop further and I'm excited to see what come from that.  I'm really enjoying the open world element and building from scavenged materials, researching more advanced ones etc and the mutant attacks are a nice little element so you don't get too comfortable.

I've only tried the game single player to this point but it's still a load of fun battling with the AI players over resources.

Poor quality graphics, lack of content, coupled with terrible controls makes this a title to steer clear from. It's not anywhere near the fun as Raft or Rust despite the positive reviews would have you thinking otherwise. I will caveat the quality of the water is quite ok but the rest of it is trash. The controls are clunky with sensitivity a struggle to find the right amount, and it's missing simple functionality such as when building. There's no easy way to navigate the UI intuitively such as tabbing across pages or using right click to close the interface. The combat is bizarre at best, but mostly reduced to a lot of being unsure where the hitbox is and where the end of your weapon is waving around at... once you realise you are being attacked that is. The crafting and tiers are simplistic and don't make a huge amount of sense either.

This looks and plays like one of those abandonedware type survival games that are a dime a dozen on Steam.

HOWEVER there is clearly a desire by players for this kind of game and what was probably suppose to be a release and forget game has gained a decent number of players and buyers. Lets hope that either the developer decides to put some proper effort into this game and uses some of the money to invest in some talented developers and it COULD have a good future.

As someone who doesn't play very many games anymore, I am pleased with Sunkenland despite the needed polish the game requires to contend with  AAA studios who have hundred-million dollar budgets.

The only aspects I would change are
-improving the graphic quality because the poly count is at the same level as Bethesda
-adding third-person POV
-adding more options for resource automation so you aren't plagued with needing to travel far and wide to collect scrap metal or ores (for mass-building constructs aka your base), OR, having a slider for resource density to control how many resources get spawned
-adding dialogue to friendly NPCs to expand the lore and improving human body animations to make them a little less simplistic. Also, it would be really nice to have snippets of lore dispersed throughout the sunken world, maybe in sealed containers written by the people who lived on the surface
-improving the animations and behaviour of non-human entities like turtles, sharks, etc to have more than their current minimalist idle behaviour that will make them feel more alive than a resource

And don't get me started on the ""Base Defense"".  It sounds like a neat idea, but each attack is stronger than the next, forcing you to struggle to create a larger and larger base JUST to keep up with the growing hordes of enemies (a bit Like a Rogue-lite tower defense game).  That pressure actually makes this game STRESSFUL to play.

And since the enemies can attack your base while you are away, you WILL get interrupted in the middle of a dive and be forced to sail home (however far that is) and IF you are LUCKY the dozen enemies or more will have left a few scraps of your base intact for you to ""protect"" by the time you arrive.

But you won't be that lucky.  You'll get back just in time to see everything you just spent hours scraping together torn to pieces.

I'm not into the whole builder genre usually, but they put a different twist on this. First time playing the game I was mesmerized for two whole hours. What I like about it is it's not too realistic. For instance, your initial tool, a crude, stone ax, doesn't wear down after you use it a few times. I'm not sure if this will change as the game goes on. Some of these games, where you scavenge for items to craft with, get on my nerves a little, when the things you craft breakdown after three uses. Not on this game, so far.
     Only gripe I have with it is after you build something, you can't disassemble it and put the materials to use somewhere else, if you happen to change your mind. Right along with that, you can't replace or fix something that you've built; so be extra careful when you're building to place your foundations exactly where you want them. I had to start a new game because my yet-to-be-diagnosed OCD couldn't handle one of my placements.

Pros. Lots of space, Beautiful Waters, Natural Water Movements, Swimming feels good, Beautiful Night Sky, Great Graphics, Beautiful music, good sound effects, Easy to understand controls, and good amount of clothing options.

Cons. near nothing in character customisation & some items cannot be gathered despite saying gather-able (most likely a bug but that is to be expected in a early access game)

The game feels like what the world would end up like if we dont take better care of our world.

I have not found any bugs, glitches or run problems. It is early access from a small dev and not much story right now (story update coming) other then surviving a world of water. With that said, the daily life is not that bad of a grind, like a lot of games. A few fishing nets out and a water purifier and you are good to go. Building is good, a lot of options and more coming in update. Fighting is a little clunky right now, but not bad. Some character options, Face, hair and such. Salvaging, raiding, crafting, building, boats, diving, exploring and a lot more. I could see this being a great open world game, As long as the Devs do not abandon. They have announced updates coming. Hey Devs, Don't forget The Mariner's (Costner's) boat!!!

This is one of them janky but fun with a few friends type game. This game to me feels like if rust had a child with stranded deep this would be that child. Don't go into this expecting to have a content filled game because this is still in early access so even though there is enough content to keep you invested for a while it still needs more stuff added to it, but i am sure in time it will get there. As i stated above this is a janky game so you may find things like swimming in the water actually just feels like you are still running on land, But so far there has not been any seriously broken jank that i have encountered. I will say this game hits the mark pretty well for a water world type game. Graphically it's not great but it's not the worst i have seen. Performance for the most part is pretty solid, but when you get in a boat it does get slightly choppy but it's not to bad. If you have a friend or 2 to play this game with and you do not mind a janky type game then hell for 15.99$ when the game is on sale why not. But if you do not like janky type games then i would stay away from this.

Update: just a few small details i forgot to add, The map seems like it is pretty big at first glance but once you start to travel around you start to notice it is really not as big as it seems, and sadly a lot of the map feels a bit empty when it comes to wild life, there is literately only 2 types of sharks and then some marlins and crabs along with smaller fish that you can catch when fishing, i guess there is suppose to be gators too but i have not seen one at all. I noticed that the sharks and marlins also only seem to ever be in the same locations, meaning they do not actually travel out of the locations that you find them at and all they do it swim in a circle, i feel like this is a big reason why the wild life feels very limited since there is set locations that these fish stay at, they do not roam around the ocean freely. I think if this game was actually a pvp/pve multiplayer (not just co op) it would bring a lot more of an enjoyment to it, i say this because once you take out all the factions there is not really anything left to do other than to just keep farming for loot but at some point you will have so much that you wont need anymore.",1703748942,1703820704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Several seemingly important mechanics are best cheesed, theres no way to get unstuck if you find yourself hovering ten feet above sea level, and progression can be unfortunately tied to scavenging drop RNG. The combat is suprisingly enjoyable given enemies aren't very smart. A couple of areas that seem like they should be full of loot are suprisingly barren. 

If you think you and your friends would enjoy a janky but solid experience, I would give Sunkenland a try. If not, I would keep an eye on this game - it has the bones of a great experience, and with just a bit more content and some polish, Sunkenland is a serious contender to be an all-time great.",1703791148,1703791148,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The most negative points you need to consider before bying now (end of 12-2023):

- Bad network implentation (some delays/mini teleports when coop)
- Clunky  controls, clunky hitboxes, its just a super clunky game
- Buggy buildings and things you craft (get stuck, wont work e.g.)
- Enemy A.I either wallhack/aimbot or braindead af.

- QoL missing things.

But I cannot recommend it now.

I think the general progression of the game and things you can craft/get and use is OK. But the acquisition of the materials and parts is lacking. 

Getting the material / exploration part of the game is very different on land and in the sea. The exploration part is primarily in the sea. You can explore different landmarks with varying “difficulty” to get the material from, the difficulty being your lack of oxygen. I do like that some of the landmarks serve as a dungeon of some sort. Some of the landmarks have only one entry point or a long way to better loot that might make you take a risk with your remaining oxygen. I noticed some of the landmarks have a guardian shark, but they can be easily avoided. But this is for SOME of the dungeons, the others are open areas where your only annoyance is constantly getting back up for air.

The islands serve as arenas. Every island has set number of enemies that you can kill. The difficulty here is the number of enemies that can quickly overwhelm you and of course kill you with better weapons than you have. But you can cheese them with going slow, that is if you have a ranged weapon. Depending on the island the reward for clearing the arena might be a box with better loot, other than that you can get things from the enemies you defeat or from the resources of the island.

This becomes very repetitious after some time with a puff of fresh air being a new landmark with a new way you maybe need to approach it and of course new workshops and guns you can use. I cant pinpoint it, but it just lacks something.

1. Make your server private you silly geese, no one is coming to destroy my private world.
2. There is around 15-30 hours of solid gameplay assuming you spend time basebuilding and farming resources(which you NEED to do if you want the high level gear).
To say there is 5-10 hours of content here is crazy.

in its current state its actually a great game and with the following QoL changes I think the game would be perfect:

-dismantling buildings and especially decorations is rough, I hate that I lose materials when I put something in the right spot. let me move stuff so I don't lose mats or permanently lose decor

-clothing is basically pointless as it provides no armor and is outshined by the camo which has 3 armor, maybe let us use regular clothes on top so we can make aesthetic choices and not be forced to look like we're in the USSR  

-flags, they're nice because you can claim territory but I don't want to see every single flag I've raised nearby. Please let me opt top turn those icons off and just keep the one more homebase.

-raiding is finicky at best, spawns are really weird and the defensive structures you can build can range from OP for some enemy spawns and others will end up being completely useless until maybe the next raid

-i love that theres gunplay but holy hell the hit reg is really bad. Headshots feel really inconsistent.

-similarly, enemies seem to range from totally clueless to elite sniper gang faze clan pump shotgun gods.
I appreciate that they are formidable but sometimes it feels like there's no way to react to being shot at. The animations are wonky and it can be hard to tell when an enemy is taking aim or taking cover.
random voice lines would be cool to help locate enemies as well(dm me I make an excellent generic mercenary)

-another hotbar would be nice, sometimes at home I like to have the hammer, bucket, etc. but I don't want to take the time to remove all my weapons and other tools. 

-I don't really like when games have a sleep timer, I think it would be much nicer if we could sleep when and only when its night time and wake up in the morning, Sometimes it can be frustrating when its night but i have to wait halfway till morning to sleep.

-there should be a crab trap. its one of the few sea creatures you can't consistently farm, at least in my experience.

This is 100% meant to be constructive criticism. I enjoyed this game a lot more than I expected to and I want to see it succeed!

Biggest thing for replayability:

-Randomly generated map / faction power.
-Bigger map
-Better tuning of difficulties

QoL:
-In multiplayer, we have to restart the server every time someone logs off or we can't go to bed.
-Smarter inventory (Taking everything out of a box when your inventory is full should just produce a system message, not send all the inventory everywhere).
-Some things like batteries run out way too fast.

This one...there's just something about it, it's simple yet effective if that makes sense. Graphically not AMAZING but it's not ugly either. The textures work for what is there already, the animations aren't AAA but they work as well. Knowing I don't have to worry about other players killing me and it's just AI(i have server but with a password on it) it's nice. So the game can be relaxing, all the materials are within reach, it's very easy to get up and running on a basic base within your first 30 minutes. I can imagine later in game it gets harder because guns come into play but for the place I am at now in the game, I am excited to pursue this further. Frame rate, textures not bad, WE HAVE ALL PLAYED WORSE and this is nice knowing the game ....well it just freaking works! Great job especially for the price of the game. IT's my go to game to relax now. Thanks and great work so far devs.

On loading in everything was fine for at least thirty minutes, then we encountered our first bug, chests were labeled ""Occupied"" yet nobody was in the chest.  This was when we had our base set up on land, so the logical idea was to restart the match and we did.... Upon loading back in our bottom half of our base was missing, so we went out and found another place to build,  After doing so a person randomly joined our game and flew over and shot us.  They destroyed our base aswell -_-.  So with a heavy heart I strongly advise people to wait until these issues are solved.

The mix of underwater/above is fantastic.

Obviously not quite finished but still worth a play as is. It's a huge undertaking building something this huge and they have done a great job keeping it fun.

As a lover of open world crafting survival games, this one had gotten my attention about 5 months ago and I had been waiting for it to bake long enough to feel safe to throw $16 at it during its first Winter Sale.

I was pleasantly surprised.  I have not made it past 30 hours yet and I'm enjoying it, but there's some issues regarding enemy AI, as well as other features regarding the limited building UI and difficulty settings.   That being said, it has a solid base of what you'd expect from an indie game of its variety.   I am very much looking forward to the roadmap of its development for the next year or so.

On the Movie Night scale its worth it for the reduced cost:  That is to say you'll spend less than a movie night and likely get more time out of it.  If you agree, thumbs up!   I will likely update this review over time.

Like many other positive\negative reviews, I found the concept of this game to be very intriguing. As a huge fan of the movie Waterworld, I like how this game's ""story"" is set. For me, however, everything was a little too simple and quick, and I feel like more work is needed for this game to be great.

In my hour of game play, I spent 95% of my game time diving in the water for resources. I really like the concept of breaking down objects like a fridge or washer\dryer to get metal and components or even having to chop down a wooden shelf for plants. This was okay and all, but got very boring very quick. 

For the time I was on land, there were a few things to break down, plants to gather, and trees to chop as well as birds to shoot for food; and this reminded me of most normal games of it's type (which I don't mind at all). One thing that got me though was the pick-ax. I got one made but could never figure out what to use it on. I couldn't bust rocks, you couldn't use it on objects to break them down (at least none that I could find), and I found it useless. 

The base-building concept is very neat, and I really liked that you could build a foundation in the ocean that automatically added the necessary support. There were a LOT of things you could build but there seemed to me like there were a lot of things I would consider a high tier object that I could build early on. That to me turned me away a bit because I'm not a huge fan of going from basic to advanced in a short period of time. I'm that person that turns down the experience gain on purpose to prevent burnout.

For combat, I did get to experience this with shooting down a seagull, to killing a fish, to even fighting mutants at my base. This, like several other reviews, was very clunky and I felt like I landed several hits that did absolutely nothing. It didn't matter if I was using a bow\arrow, spear, or even a hatchet. As for the mutants themselves, they need a lot of graphical work as they looked very blah as their eyes looked like pyramids after I did eventually get them killed.

As for the overall experience, scenery, and ambiance; it was very pleasant and enjoyable. This is one of those games where I would simply login just to listen to environment (I do this in Ark: Survival Evolved\Ascended in the Redwood Forest). I did enjoy diving in the water to see all of the buildings, bridges, etc. that were underwater. It helped to relive that scene in Waterworld where Kevin Costner's character does a dive underwater. As for my vitals, I only had to worry about my food\water meters a few times but nothing that screamed ""I NEED TO EAT OR DRINK EVERY 5 MINUTES"" which allowed me more time to play and explore.

I think that once it's improved, I'll happily purchase this one again. I couldn't give this game a negative review though b/c it is in a playable state and there are probably a lot of players that are looking for something that's not so heavily involved like other survival games. I look forward to seeing how this one progresses.",1703615647,1703615647,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

This digital atrocity stands as a testament to the depths of incompetence and disregard for players, a festering wound that mocks the very essence of gaming.

Let's embark on the torturous journey through the game's user interface – a labyrinth of despair concocted by what I can only assume were sadistic developers hell-bent on making players suffer. Navigating through this convoluted mess is like attempting to unravel a Gordian knot with blunt scissors. Sunkenland, your UI design is not just bad; it's a slap in the face to anyone who believed they were investing in a playable experience.

The graphics, or lack thereof, are an assault on the senses. Did the developers unearth a dusty old relic from the annals of gaming history and decide it was adequate for release? The visuals are so outdated that I've seen more cutting-edge graphics on my grandmother's flip phone. Sunkenland, you're not just behind the times; you're a disgrace to the art of visual storytelling in gaming.

And now, let's delve into the labyrinth of bugs infesting this digital nightmare. Quests are more broken than a mirror in a house of horrors, and the frequency of crashes rivals a demolition derby. It's as if the developers unleashed an army of glitches upon unsuspecting players, gleefully watching as their gaming experience crumbled like a house of cards. Sunkenland, your bug-ridden existence is a stain on the very concept of playable software.

Updates? Don't make me laugh. The last time this game saw a meaningful update, dinosaurs still roamed the Earth. It's apparent that the developers have washed their hands of this catastrophe, leaving players to wallow in the mire of their own regret. Sunkenland, your neglectful approach to maintaining a playable game is a slap in the face to everyone who believed in your potential.

The in-game economy is an insult to the dedication of players who hoped for a rewarding experience. Grinding feels like a Sisyphean task, with rewards so paltry that even a scavenger would turn up its nose. Sunkenland, your economic model is not just unbalanced; it's a mockery of the time and effort players invest.

In conclusion, Sunkenland is not just a game; it's a betrayal of trust, a heinous crime against the very community it purports to serve. The developers should hang their heads in shame and issue a public apology for subjecting players to this digital purgatory. Sunkenland, you're not just a blight on gaming; you're a disgrace to the entire industry, and I wouldn't wish the agony of playing you on my worst enemy.",1703485770,1703485770,False,4,3,0.359512269496917725,0,True,False,True

It's actually done very very well but you can tell everything is using it down to the movements and animations and crafting systems. I'm just saying if you liked 7 days you will probably love this given how similar it is. And it has a whole whole lot more content than 7 days does. The guns the upgrades, the whole systems is just more than that game but the gameplay itself is basically the same except it's just in the water. 

Every so often a group of mutants or whatever will attack your base so you gotta put defenses up. Kinda the same gameplay loop as 7 days. 

Will it get boring? I dunno yet I haven't explored everything. My only real negative is the map size seems kinda unrealistically cramped for ocean water based exploring. You should feel like your in an endless sea and you don't. Everything is pretty close together. Now the game is actually still pretty challenging and the systems all work together given this still. 

The AI is pretty stupid but groups of them will still challenge you. 

 The crafting systems has a ton of stuff. Like a metric ton of just upgradable things and tons of things to work towards. 

The trading system is one Ive always wanted in an apocalyptic game where there isn't some stupid type of currency but it's just a trading system where you give me this for that or that many things for this I absolutely love it and I wish more games like this would do it that way. 

Overall Ive always wanted an open world waterworld game because the movie is prime for a good one and this one has a solid right direction.",1703431463,1703431463,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Actually, the imagery is wonderfully alluring, as is the idea of the game, but this does not even remotely reach any level of quality that would be expected of a game that has earned likely much more than a million bucks. I am waiting on my refund to process as I am writing this.

First, it is an early access game, but using an unfitting font(looks like unity standard font), horrible UI (everywhere), arrows that ricochet off of everything(including hit targets), etc. is totally unacceptable, as is the whole state of the game.
There is 0% polished applied in any aspect. Building does not work as expected. Crafting is boring. Fighting and farming are already unrewarding. Loot tables are bad. Calling the AI any for of intenlligence is an insult to anything intelligent. Combat is therefore bleh. And game pacing is already not doing quite so well. And maybe spawn players on an actual island, not mid air above water. And for gods sake, please at some sort of tutorials, newer PC gamers will be stuck quickly otherwise.

For the developers, I suggest you hire some indie developer that polished up their UI and menus well. Literally most people in the scene will have done it better than you. The idea is nice, but put more time into actually developing your game, than you do styling up the steam store page to trick people into buying something completely different than they expect.
And maybe adjust the standard settings for controlls and sensitivities, so that most people can play without going into settings and tweaking stuff. Or just do it as a form of tutorial during boot up.

Keep on learning how to make games, and hopefully whatever this is supposed to be, comes true in a couple years. See ya maybe 2026.",1703364103,1703364103,False,5,2,0.543640077114105225,0,True,False,True

2080690,154055767,76561197985928888,0,48,99,0,99,1703156561,"Pretty game with some of the worst combat I've ever experienced. I hate that games can look this good and still have such bad mechanics. The character models look good but the uncanny valley is strong here. NPCs feel like mannequins. No movement, no life. There are games like this that feel better to play. More rewarding. 

Pressing 'F' to salvage things or cut trees down needs to feel like more than pressing F. You only have an arm when you're wielding an item. You have no legs. You are just a disembodied restless soul roaming around pressing 'F' to salvage entire sunken cars. 

Speaking of using items, why can I only wield one item at a time? Did my character lose one of his arms when he spawned into the world? I tried to equip my ax in one hand and the torch in another and it was not happening. If you can, it is not readily available. Seeing as you don't need sleep and the ""Simple Bed"" costs more materials than i ever had on me I just found myself waiting in the dark until the sun came back up so I could jump back in the water and dig around in trash. 

As for survival mechanics, You get hungry and thirsty and will die if you run out of air. You don't need to sleep as far as I could tell though I never actually slept, I just played for several in-game days straight. Hopefully it passes time or at the very least restores your health bar but I can't say it does either of those. When you're injured you can make bandages for immediate use but the cost in cloth is too expensive. You got a stamina bar. It works as intended. 

Cooking is fine. Nothing to it, just throw the food on the grill and forget about it. It doesn't burn and once its done it becomes lootable. Not rewarding. 

Researching things requires specific materials, once you have them you can immediately research a new item. Doesn't feel rewarding. 

Base building has the basic snapping square grid system seen in other games like this. The exception is that you cannot flatten the land to build, their attempt at working around this was to create foundations that work fine but again, this is done better in other games. Most rewarding aspect. 

I requested a refund after I farmed up materials to make a row boat thing. I get on it and start rowing and this giant ugly interface pops up as an overlay and shows me the controls for operation. Suddenly, my screen is cluttered just to tell me to press 'WSAD' to move directions. It doesn't go away its just there and to make matters worse, the sound effects used to row are grating. In a game about being a survivor in Waterworld you would think the boat driving mechanics would feel responsive. Valheim does this far better. 

So, I row my boat up to the little trader lady's floating shop and make a few trades in their pleasing trading and bartering system. I buy what I need and sell some trash and I'm ready to bounce back to the cribbo. I hustle back to my parked rowboat and hop back in. I parked it facing the trader's shop but far enough away to just turn around...or so I thought. 

However, as I turned left and began to row the boat was suddenly caught by the undertow riptide of a glitch that pulled me and my rowboat under the shop and permanently stuck looking at the trader's massive mommy milker's upside down through the clipped floor she was standing on. That's when I checked the time on how long I had been playing and it read 99 minutes. 

I really like that there are vendors and NPCs and enemies. But it all feels so skeletal. Like 25% of a great idea realized. It's a shame too because it has a lot of great ideas. Cut down the price and refine the gameplay a lot. Combat sucks so bad. Tasks are boring to do. Sea is empty very little life. Or just try again with a sequel if that's too much to do.",1703160273,1703160273,False,29,4,0.600289583206176758,0,True,False,True

 However I would suggest a few minor improvements, such as a longer lasting headlight. It barely lasts a few moments, let alone if you're attempting a night raid! Went through 2 entire batteries within minutes, if that.

 The boat tends to do odd things now and then, like disappearing and reappearing, as well as flipping over randomly when you disembark or enter it, though more of the former.

 Enemy raids while on solo play and you're away from base should NOT be a thing. It's like coming home to find your house robbed and burned down after a long days work. Not fun lol

Pros: 
Good theme for the overall game. Plenty to explore, build, enemies to conquer, collecting, you name it. Graphics are decent though not ground breaking. Seems like 7 Days to Die plus Raft games. 

Cons: 
There is no plot. Other than two paragraph blurb that says you have no memory, better make the best of it. Clipping is an issue in many places. Your character will pop up or through buildings, floors, walls, etc. Your base will randomly get attacked, this can happen at any point. Including when you're on the other side of the map. Having a strong defenses is a must to buy you time to drop everything and rush back to defend your home. At times you won't make it back quick enough, and find large chunks of your bases wiped out, crafting tables destroyed, and so on. NPC's have a bad habit of finding a very slight gap in a building's floor or wall to shoot through. Somehow being able to hit you, and collisions prevent you from exploiting the same gap. Big pet peeve of mine is when confronting a group of NPC's all equipped with handguns, shotguns, and rifles, you defeat them and get... a strawberry, or 4 gun parts, a piece of cloth, a can of soda. If I take down a group of NPC's all armed to the teeth I expect to be able to at least get something they were using. Last issue at least for me. The NPC's programing knows when you're aiming at them. They will be standing still, doing nothing but enjoying the great water view. Put your cross hairs on them from afar and watch them run around like it's been one hour after eating at Taco Bell.
Also what's up with the Halloween Theme at the only trader, at the time of this review its mid December.

More fish whether they are catchable or not would be a nice enhancement for the environment.

There is nothing to do other than building bases, which you don't even need since the enemy AI is very basic and does not work often. The game often crashed on my friends' computers. The enemy islands don't respawn so after raiding every island (if you cant be bothered since its basically the same thing over and over) there is literally nothing else to do. There is no point doing it over because the map will be the exact same. Sound design is pretty bad.

I feel like this game may have some potential. But it is simply not worth the amount it is listed for, not even close. The game is far from complete, even for an early access title. You may have some fun when you play it with friends, but this would apply to almost every other game. Even with friends, there is nothing to do.

Base building is also very bland, buggy and unbalanced. There is no stability mechanic, so you can just have a floating base and no enemy will ever reach you (they won't reach you half of the time regardless).

All the mechanics around swimming in the early game are smooth which is cool because in most games, swimming is the most annoying part.  You can reasonably hold your breath but then you get your first set of flippers and an oxygen tank and now you're the freaking boss.  

You start out on this little castaway island with POI's tantalizingly visible in the distance.  You start by scrounging around the island (in and out of water) to get a basic base up and running.  Before long there is a sense of urgency because it seems some of these POI's are sending raiders over to see what you're up to.  They're pretty dumb at first but can do a lot of damage if they catch you unprepared.

I built my first paddleboat pretty quick and marveled at the rusty sound of the pedals as I frantically accelerated to 60kpmh (wtf?).  This boat had an onboard chest and now I could head out and pay my neighbors back in kind, hauling their loot back to my base.  Also, I fought Jaws with a spear and survived to tell the tale... achievement unlocked.

All that said, this game is a bit jank in a very lovable way.  Some might say it lacks polish.  Here is a short list of dumb things that probably won't get fixed until long after I'm finished with the game :)

1) Stack size is hilariously stingy (scrap metal 15, ore 5, wood 20, etc. etc.)  Doesn't take long for serious ""chest-spam"" to occur
2) Cooking/Smelting - I was literally laughing out loud when I realized you could only cook 1 food item and 1 ore at a time.  I mean, I could build 10 smelters and 10 grills but should I really have to?
3) You can access stuff through walls.  Doesn't sound annoying?  Try drinking your water accidentally instead of opening the front door

-Building bases feels like assembling furniture with missing instructions. The potential is there, but I'm left with extra pieces and a wobbly structure.

-Defending against pirates and mutants should be thrilling, but their AI is about as sharp as a bag of wet mice. They're more of an annoyance than a challenge.

-The crafting system makes me feel like I'm constantly on a fetch quest. Just when I think I've gathered enough, it's back to square one. It's a repetitive loop that tests my patience more than my survival skills.

-The day-night cycle is so brief it feels like I'm living in a world where the sun has commitment issues. It's hard to get anything done when night falls faster than my last date bailing on dinner plans.

Playing with friends could've been the game's saving grace, but it's more like solo play with extra steps. We're together, but everyone's on their own survival soap opera.

The lack of substantial updates makes me feel like I'm on a deserted island sending SOS signals. We need more content, better AI, and fixes that go beyond cosmetic touch-ups.

Pros:
-Nice visuals especially underwater, overall really interesting and unique setting
-Good performance even on outdated hardware
-Movement, combat and looting feels great and satisfying
-Ranged combat with guns has a satisfying weight to it
-As for now a solid pool of stuff and progression, but has to be built onto
-Cool base building which is easily done without much hassle
-Many amazing work stations, storing options and alike
-Clear menues that are easy to understand and navigate around 
-Good sounds and tracks alike, very fitting and creating a relaxed atmosphere
-Coop is easily setup and works flawless and bugfree overall 
-Interesting POIs with different enemy factions and a decent map layout


Cons:
-Horde attacks on bases are mind bogglingly annoying and you have to disable it to enjoy the game
-Looting cars and scrap piles with your bear hands (doesnt really annoy me or anything its just so unrealistic)
-All the pois are so close to each other and if you imagine the water away it wouldnt make much sense landscape wise
 (But i guess its beneficial for gameplay purposes especially for slower starter boats)
-Building onto already existing POI bases can be very difficult and sometimes annoying
-Total lack of base character customization
-A very stupid enemie ai that also walks through walls sometimes
-Definitely need bigger item stacks for some stuff (Ore for example), just in general 
-Enemy respawn on island outpost is ABSOLUTELY frustrasting
-Attacking outposts in the night is super annoying as well because you cant see sht but the enemy ai has perfect aimbot

All in all a very enjoyable experience, especially in coop. The game is super polished and kinda content rich for such a short release state which is honestly impressive. Its fun to explore underwater and decent to explore POIs on the surface and theres a solid gear and loot progression that definitely motivates at first.

In the current state of the game, I can't recommend it.  While the base game isn't bad for what it is, it feels rather empty.  Multiple areas in the game feel like the base layout was slapped down and the fleshing out process was started but never revisited after that first pass.  Ore nodes are sometimes under the ground or stacked 2-3 deep on one another.  Exiting the boats randomly launches you into the air.  While swapping seats seems to fix this, it shouldn't be necessary.

A patch is supposed to drop in early '24 to address some of the above issues.  While I can see this as a game that I may play from time to time, I don't feel that draw that makes me want to make a new character or start new world as it currently lacks any real reason to play the game past collecting all of the blueprints and completing all the research.

Enemies, once they have found you, always know where you are. Their friends know where you are. And their main tactic when it comes to fighting you is to find cover, run into cover until their gun clips through cover, and shoot you in the face with laser like accuracy from across the island with a shotgun. Also, this game very much has the feel of a game that is meant to be multiplayer focused, but playable single player. Meaning, not a single battle feels winnable with just 1 person, but rather that you and your friends are supposed to raiding places. This is a severe hindrance to the experience for me.

PROS - -
- Simple hud.
- Easy to figure out the dynamics of things.
- Can change the game difficulty to your preference.
- Can change enemy difficulty to your preference. 
- Can turn off raids of your land by AI.
- Very smooth gameplay.
- Easy to navigate.
- [Multiplayer] It seems very well sync'd, seamlessly easy to join and invite friends. Very smooth gameplay.
- Game has enough in it as of this moment to keep you occupied for a while [I hope there is more features soon]

CONS - -
- There are a small amount of bugs, scattered here and there. But NOTHING i have personally seen that is game-breaking. 
- [Multiplayer] While driving a boat, whether the host is passenger or driver. If they use the map, the boat/vehicle stops for everyone else until the host exits the map. I would like to see that fixed, so the vehicle stays in motion.
- [Personal preference] No real story, as far as I have seen, i would personally like to see some form of backstory/history, as i am one that likes to know how a survival/apocalyptic event happened in movies & games that lead to the current situation [""why did everything flood?"" type of questions].

SUMMERY - -
The game is very enjoyable, quite peaceful depending on your play-style. I loot when needed, I conquer land when in desperate need. You can take your time with almost everything, besides food and water. But thats normal, you're playing on the games time frame, maintain your needs at ALL times.

For context: Having played video games for some 40+ years I am no stranger to early alpha games and my opinion is on only 100hrs in this game.
This one has potential. Does it have glitches, quirks and WTF moments, of course! It's early alpha!
Much will depend on how the team addresses current quirks and streamlines game play.
Single player I feel I'll get my money's worth. 
Co-op it is NOT ready, go into it knowing that.

The main issue with the game is it's very finite. I've collected nearly all the blueprints and stacks of needed resources in about 15 hours. There's not much else to do now other then collect stuff i neither want or need to ""100%"" each location. there is no fail state and the cost of death is you need to go back to pickup your backpack (everything worn/on your hotbar stays with you), progression is item based so you when you start at your island you're suppose to spiral away with the further islands/sunken area giving better items. i feel the game could use larger underwater exploration sections with options to refill your air. i liked how easy it was to keep your head above water to get air, i didn't like that scuba tanks worked passively which meant you had to take them off if you were just quickly dipping down to grab something so you don't end up daining it before you need them, if they reversed the use that you drain your breath followed by the scuba, it'd be much better. also the weapons feel bad and there's very little you know about it before crafting, so firerate, capacity, and recoil are only found out after crafting and most are known only by feel. there's only a reddot as an attachment, and it's worse then some iron sights.

Sharks can swim through walls. hard to find the salvage spot on some vehicles/items. Rolls of barbed wire do not injure player or the enemy. Jumping off high places also does not hurt the player. no matter where you shoot the enemy, it does the same damage. The enemy is not intelligent at all.

Good future potential 
Lots of clothing options
Nice music
Co-op 
Build a base nearly anywhere

Con's

Poor building options
Unbalanced enemies
Bugs everywhere
Potential gamebreaking bugs
Limited playability right now
Sea diving is limited right now
Lacking many QOL options
Day progresses too fast, needs options to slow time down
No mouse scrolling for hotbar
Current gameplay loop is very repetitive 
Poor inventory system that keeps dropping items when a stack is full

Make no mistake, this review will be most likely change to a positive at a future date because the clear sign is that eventually Sunkenland will be a great immersive survival crafting game, it just isn't remotely close yet but so close within early accesss are you surprised?   Right now,  anyone potentially interested in jumping into the game, beware that the game is very buggy, unbalanced and lacks a significant amount of content with a repetitive game loop.

The problems with Sunkenland right now are extensive,  once you have reached stage 4 in crafting there really isn't much else to do except raid islands, rinse and repeat.   Combat is buggy, sharks can attack through walls, enemies can shoot through walls and the damage they do is unbalanced and 9 out of 10 times  you'll be facing enemies with firearms, and naturally they have unlimited ammo and reload exceptionally fast and without decent armor, you'll get shredded fast.

The average gameplay loop is raid island or swim underwater for loot, find a POI and raid it for its unique blueprints whilst trying not to die,  slowly upgrade gear find a new island to raid rinse and repeat.   Underwater aspect is a neat idea, the issue is that you can never stay underwater for very long even with basic scuba gear - and once you've explored some of the areas it becomes more lucrative to raid islands, which makes you run into balance issues especially with highly accurate, fast shooting/fast reloading enemies. 

Tons of bugs all across the board from building roofs which will either not slot together at all, or simply very limited options.   Character options is limited, although plenty of clothing options are available..the issue is 99% of them suck,  this game values armor level above everything and most clothing options have an AC value of 1, soon as you find some military fatigues which usually have a value of 3 you'll never use any of the other clothing options.   

Crafting better weapons/armor is a chore because it requires you to find a broken item as a crafting resource, and soon as you craft some half decent items that game starts to become much easier...far too fast.    Swimming for resources also becomes redundant pretty quickly as raiding islands becomes a better option,   and having some options like raids enabled quickly become more annoying than fun especially on single player as it becomes fairly unbalanced.   Crafting better and faster boats makes it easier but still the scope right now is limited - needs more of everything and I'm sure with time, it will grow. 

Right now,  for survival crafting fans I'd keep an eye on developments for this game.  Once many of the bugs are fixed,  much more content is added and balanced then this game will definitely start to rival some of the other classics in this genre,  it just isn't anywhere close at the moment and naturally - this will be years in the making for a small indie team,  keep an eye on this title as I do expect big things eventually - right now, I'd hesitantly say its not for everyone, but it will keep growing with time.",1701593107,1701593914,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

4: come out with solar panels and battery/electric storage system. this kind of items are common nowadays. 
5: chemicals substances to make gasoline is pretty weird.  algae is a good source of bio-fuel....

For example there is a green crosshair dot in ur ui that u cant remove and that delutes weapon scopes which makes it harder to aim because u dont rlly know what point u should aim with. mutant can get into rocks and shoot you with arrows without u being able to do anything. But i do hope that more weapon modification in form of scopes will be added.

I like the graphics a lot, they have a simplistic charm to them and it matches the theme of the game very nicely. Very good firearm combat, recoil when you shoot, maybe too high but the kick you get when you get shot is nice. Really nice vehicle system. Maybe slow down the diving speed with fins because I feel like I'm on crack after eating a soup. That said there are things I would like to see added.

I write this review after ""finishing"" the game on insane difficulty AI setting and highest difficulty raid frequency and garrison amount.

1.) Replayability. The enemies in island outposts don't respawn, once you clear it that's it, you can only ever come back for scrap piles and lootboxes, I would like them to respawn together with the loot for the replayability factor.



2.) Questionale stacks sizes. You can stack 20 pieces of large planks but only 5 pieces of iron ore, my chests start overflowing with stuff such as charcoal and components in the mid-game and I have no way to use them.

3.) Common bugs i found. When i leave my boat it makes a dolphin trick-flip and sometimes sends me flying meters away. Im a big enjoyer of grenades but when I use throwables they teleport into my inventory. 

4.) Lack of traders. There is only one trader and while I love the barter economy, it would be nice if there were more traders you have to unlock by liberating captured trading outposts or something, that would sell better exclusive loot appropriate to difficulty of the outpost.

5.) Raiders. I would make the raiders more of a challenge as they are incredibly primitive and do not pose a threat in any stage of the game, for an experienced player of shooter games and survival games in general they are a piece of cake.

Suggestions:
1. Adding Achievements
2. Adding Quests with unique rewards that are otherwise unobtainable through scavenging
3. Adding more traps perhaps a hole covered with leaves, which enemies fall into upon stepping
4. More variety of loot such as more weapon types, tool types
5. More animals as im tired of eating mostly fish :(

BUT, the devs are addressing them exceedingly quickly.  I helped play test one of the last updates that addressed a few issues and devs were making changes and uploading them as fast as we were reporting them well into the night.  That said, here is my review:

With 75 hours into the game (a modest amount as I am balancing a ton of things and gametime is a rarity for me) I whole heartily would recommend this game to everyone.  Especially if you have an itch that survival/crafting games scratch, but need a little something extra or slightly different.

Pros:
Its freaking waterworld meets a ton of other things
Looting is divided between underwater and on land
Enemies hold not only land locations, but periodic raids on your base
Graphics are nice.  Crisp and clean with correct ragdoll physics.
Slight struggle for resources in the beginning, but evens out in the mid-late game.
Lots of upgrades for not only firepower, but also transportation and underwater exploration.

Cons:
Enemy raids ramp in difficulty quickly, can be overwhelming right now (WIP)
You will be staring at butts when you kill enemies in the water
Character models a little gangly, but not horribly so, and should smooth out as time goes by

This is definitely a worthwhile investment in the age of early access, and make sure to join the devs discord where there is a very active and helpful community.

As I described to a friend of mine, it is like Rust for cosplayers and people who dont want constant pvp. Game has amazing graphics for being early access and love the underwater potential of the game. 

However, this brings me to my first point: diving
Diving speed in this game is ridiculous. Especially when you have diving fins and fish stew, you are faster than most boats in the game which does not make much sense. Furthermore, a lot of diving sites are just too deep for normal diving and after you run out of oxygen tanks the diving is way too slow as you have to spend most of your time diving down or rushing back up for air. The holes (such as windows and cracks) are not big/small enough to determine whether you can fit through or not, wasting your precious air underwater)

Second point: PVE
The AI in the game is pretty good when clearing outposts of enemies, however as soon as you get your hands on gunpowder weapons, you can clear almost all outposts of enemies, even though your gear does not fit the difficulty of the outpost, so more difficulty differences would be greatly appreciated

Last point: Raids

I understand the game is for newcomers just as seasoned veterans, but in my opinion waiting 25 days until first properly armed raiders appear is just too long. In my gameplay I have walled in pretty much the entire island and left space just for docks. Raiders which damage the walls have to stand right outside of the walls in order to damage them, making you get ourside of your compound to kill them. To fix this, raiders on boats and some sort of a raiding tool (such as rocket launcher, granade launcher etc.) would be welcomed to make the raids more challenging as the time goes by.

Despite all my reservations the game is awesome and instantly drew me in (i play both raft and rust, which this game is a combination of) and enjoy playing it. I am aware of the game being in open beta and the devs are tirelessly working on improving this game but there are some QOL changes which bother me a little bit (such as me not being able to switch items in hotbar with mouse wheel). Other than that I strongly recommend this game and if the devs keep up the good work, this game has the potential to become one of the greats.

Apologies for the long review but I hope the devs read this and hopefully implement changes I have suggested in this review.

At the moment this game is in a late alpha stage, with some issues and jank that would definitely tip this into a no, if this was fully released. Fortunately the developers update and make improvements regularly. This is more of an overview for Early Access, I'll be updating the review in the future.

This game basically plays like Fallout 4 (without the storyline aspects or radiation mechanics), there's co-op and some light survival elements. Definitely some inspiration from Rust and Raft, as well as other survival games, the concept is pretty cool. But there's not really anything new here to set it apart from any other game in this genre. There's nothing inherently wrong with that! Iteration and improvements on a proven formula can result in an amazing game, but there's a lot of work to be done here before it gets to that stage.
With the TLDR out of the way, let's get into the nitty gritty.

GRAPHICS:
I would say Sunkenland's strength with graphics mainly lies in it's concept. It feels very reminiscent of Waterworld, art direction can often rescue games that would otherwise look pretty bad or dated and make them timeless. Unfortunately Sunkenland looks pretty pedestrian, most of the textures and models look fine, but they don't look great. It reminds me of very early days Rust, or 7 Days to Die. Everything in the game is basically a point of interest and even boats are static locations. There's no boats floating around or patrolling and the game can feel a bit empty im-between islands.

GAMEPLAY & PROGRESSION:
Sunkenland's core gameplay loop is; go gather things to progress into better tools and better weaponry, so that you can tackle bigger challenges and gather resources more efficiently. You can build buildings (Think Rust, or Fallout 4 style building). You generally achieve this goal by swimming underwater to explore abandoned ruins and cars. There's various different ores that you can gather with a pickaxe. The problems I have with progressing in this game is that things can be very tedious. You have to build a research table to learn new recipes, which require you to spend resources that you also will use to build the thing. Quite often this means you simply get bottlenecked on specific resources like rubber, forcing you to explore multiple POIs to get enough for a single furnace. I personally really enjoy this part of the gameplay loop, but there's no unique items that I could see hidden away or alternative reasons to explore. Blueprints occasionally pop up in chests or lootable containers (You don't have to pay resources to learn these recipes, phew!). Once you've progressed a little bit, you can make a crossbow and take on the hostile POIs, which leads me to the next section...

GUNPLAY:
I'm not gonna sugar coat this, combat in this game is currently very janky. You have a wide array of weaponry at your disposal to craft and find, but the vast majority of them early on are so bad, that you basically just cheese the horrible AI with crossbows, until you unlock something that doesn't suck.

This game has ballistics, so projectiles over a longer range will drop slowly, you will have to adjust your aim. This isn't really a bad thing, the problem comes when you try to aim down sights. Very often the iron sights for weapons do not line up correctly with the crosshair marker in the middle of the screen, so aiming feels really janky and weird for a lot of weapons. Another example of this is when you have the red dot sight. You get a red dot from the model, a big ugly green dot that appears when you ADS and the green crosshair marker. It's just confusing and messy, this is something that will be obviously worked on, but as it is right now, gunplay is pretty bad and doesn't feel satisfying.

The other issue I have is gun balance. There's not really good progression, you are often given a lot of bad choices for weapons to craft and the odd good one. An example of this is the bow and crossbow. The bow is so rubbish you are better off trying to melee, but it should in reality be pretty competitive with the crossbow. Both should be good options for different things. There's a lot of work to be done here for guns, but there's another huge issue.

AI:
Some people have said the AI is really good in this game, via some of the other reviews. I disagree. It only seems to function if the enemy can figure out how to pathfind to you, or otherwise is able to shoot you (in which you need to be within a certain distance). They don't appear to be able to react to other entities being attacked nearby. You can have two dudebros chilling out in a room and blast one in the face with a bolt action rifle. His buddy won't react 90% of the time, unless you are really close and they arbitrarily notice you. When the AI decides to stop sniffing glue and actually do something, melee enemies will simply charge you, POIs aren't really designed well enough that the AI can realistically flank you, or otherwise reach you most of the time, you can simply jump onto a higher ledge and the AI will often start running around randomly in front of you, not really knowing what to do. Enemies with guns and crossbows fare a little bit better, but often they will attempt to shoot at you through walls, which they are unable to pierce and will only attempt to shoot if you are close enough, it's very easy to outrange enemies and if you aren't in range for them to shoot, they start running around randomly. A good way to see this in action is to just rock up to a POI in a boat and start sniping at enemies from far away. There's no taking cover or running away if they can't attack you, they just start doing a weird patrol, there's just no real situational awareness... These sort of strategies work way too well. The AI is probably the worst thing about this game.

On a side note, occasionally mutants or raiders will attack your base, they seem... kind of competent at breaking your stuff. Definitely keep your things protected. If they break things, you won't be refunded the crafting materials, so keep furnaces and stuff locked up! These enemies will just spawn at your base island while you're out doing your thing.

VEHICLES:
The vehicles in this game are solid, there's tons of different tiered boats and a gyrocopter. The progression for vehicles seems solid so far, they all have storage and get you and some friends to where you need to go. There's no submarines though... Hopefully in a future update. Also hopefully NPCs will use boats in the future.

BUILDING:
It's pretty good, there's the usual options like in Rust, where you have tiered building materials. You can fortify your walls with traps and barbed wire fences to keep out invaders, there's some weird implementation for storage where you have progressively more expensive options that... have the exact same storage space.
There's also a lot of nice decorations, you can definitely make yourself a pretty cool base. There's a lot of different tables for crafting as well, so you will need a decent sized shack, or it's gonna get cluttered.

There's also electricity, generators and several tools that require the use of such, you can get pretty cool neon lights and lots of other cool things.

Probably my biggest nitpick is that you aren't given many options to choose for example, the height of your foundations.

OVERALL:
Sunkenland currently sits in the same category as 7 Days to Die (Or any similar alpha game), a ton of potential, promise and bugs, it's just not there yet. Maybe with a few more years, it'll be compared favourably to a feature rich game like Rust, but it's a long road ahead. There's definitely fun to be had here.

This game has really good bones. Strong survival elements without it being super tedious, progression research system that makes you feel like you improved as you finish it. The Faction system is cool and the PvE raids really keep you on your toes so you don't get complacent. Diving for scavenging feels like you are in a whole new world every time you go down, it's honestly a beautiful site even if it is a drowned civilization you're spotting. Those are all the pros. 

Cons:
Now for the cons of the game because an honest review should always have them. Combat with enemies feels a little imbalanced. They are able to see and shot you point blank from nearly any position once they notice you. The block system is a little clunky, diving takes a long time to get to the point where you don't feel like you are panicking to the surface all the time. Some of the research feels a little bit out of place. For instance, you can research things that need a generator but you can't unlock the generator until the next phase of research which makes it feel like it's not worth it to invest in them but you also feel like you need those things. Last but certainly not least the time between day and night feels off and sleeping progresses you the same amount of time no matter when you sleep but sometimes you get raided and can't sleep so you're forced to stay awake for day but you can't dive because freezing water isn't safe at least at the point where I am in the game.",1701120830,1701120830,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

It's an early access game and it shows, but, that's reflected fairly in the price. 

Early gathering of resources is simple and not overly explained, none of the tutorial style hints are in your face and any sort of progression block. IE; you don't have to ""Get 6 Wood"" before you can jump in the Ocean and have a look around.

The build mechanics are similar to Rust, but without to build wheel, once you've selected what piece you want to build you can build as many of those pieces as you want. Then just pop into the craft menu and change the next relevant piece, rinse, repeat. One thing I have noticed is that the hit box for opening doors requires a certain amount of accuracy and items behind the door can be opened through a door if you don't hit the right spot. 

Playing solo survival was really fun. Exploring the Ocean first, then onto the various different islands around, the game doesn't hold up in showing you ""there's more to do here"". 

Progressions with weapons, allowing further progression through the islands can be set at a relative pace by adjusting your settings. 

Survival doesn't take up the whole of your daytime hours in game. I've played a couple of survival games where the only opportunity to gather food/water takes up the majority of your daylight hours. Sunkenland has a really nice way of balancing that with deployable's or general exploration.

Trading outpost gives you something to aim for if you don't want to start hitting up the NPC enemy islands too soon.

I would recommend getting some progress under your belt, get some weapons, get used to those, then restart on a slightly harder bunch of settings. It's worth it.

The game looks great. It needs work, but that's the point of an early access release, to get feedback from people and make adjustments. 

If the game goes the same way as Rust in terms or quality and updates, it's worth getting the game now before the price inevitably goes up.

Pros: - 
Easy to jump in and get exploring and surviving
Surviving can be easy
Self Pacing is easy to make adjustments to
Fun exploration on and under the sea
Gun play is fun
Pretty game

Cons: - 
Hit boxes of deployable's need work
Personally; I'd put less clothes in boxes, certainly less L1 clothes
Easy to think that the game lost its edge if you forget to up your settings",1701113795,1701113795,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Create a server, but don't give the creator an admin... The result is that there are hackers and nothing can be done about it.

You can't use mousewheel in hotbar... Especially in a game like this that would be important.

Foundations can't be adjusted in height... (if they can, it's not explained), which makes it difficult to build from top to bottom. But the engine can do that... the programmer can't...

Stairs do not work on stairs.
Getting damage from picking up sticks.
Difficulty settings have no influence (at least on the raids)
German translation is often too long and can't be read e.g. at the research table... Hover the mouse over it doesn't make the text pop up... but on items it does...
You can't attach traps to some foundations (not on all sides)
Ores that have been placed twice on top of each other.

I would like to have a better option of moving things around, however. As is, if you build a structure (wall, floor, etc.) or crafting station, you have to completely demolish it and build another from scratch--which costs valuable resources. Likewise, it would be nice to have a one-click option of moving inventory and items instead of having to craft a moving box, place the item in the box, then place it in a quick-access box, and THEN move it. Speaking of, one last suggestion would be to label the quick-inventory boxes with numbers 1 through 8 so players know which item is in which box. As it is, when you try to quickly equip an item, you have to count boxes or just make a guess--which is very inconvenient in the middle of combat. Pulling out a bandage,  drink of water, or a fishing pole during a melee round instead  of a weapon is quite frustrating--and almost laughable.

It is very playable and addictive as it is now. Sunkenland has all the hallmarks of 7D2D in its early years, and it is evident that there is a talented crew behind the game, which makes it exciting to see where this game will go over the next few years.

Some small buggy things need attention, but this is to be expected at this early stage and should not deter you from buying the game at all.
1) Opening and closing doors - this needs to be a lot easier and not take specific/careful targeting to get the prompt on the screen.
2) Wall heath: NPC raids hit the walls, and there is seemingly no way to see the current health of the wall after a raid. I upgraded the walls with Armored panels and the NPC's broke in the very next raid - wtf?
3) The current trader loot is just ok. There is nothing consistently exciting here to get the player farming/engaged.
4) Raiding a nearby mutant base in (offline) PVE and clearing them out should hold off the frequency of attacks as they regroup.
5) Some of the item descriptions are lacking informative information.
6) If the player is crafting an item that takes another lower crafted item, say rope, then the crafting system should auto-craft lower their items. (See Empyrion as an example)
7) ** The action bar needs to allow scrolling with the mouse wheel ** URGENT The number of times I consumed food or drink after fat-fingering the keyboard.
8) Indicated full buckets placed in a chest are no longer full after a save and reload. Even though they indicate, they are full.

Game Suggestions:
1) There needs to be more NPC danger in looting key areas underwater further into the game. A player searching around needs to have a more significant risk vs reward the further away from their base. Any underwater NPCs need to drop more key loot. Even key/s to a nearby locked door or loot chest. A dropped key can open a nearby and/or another POI for solid rewards. The NPC could be a mini-boss.
2) Raiding NPC need to drop damaged gear. It should be suitable for a quick upgrade but has limited repairability due to its hand-me-down past. These drops should have a tiny chance of dropping limited repair/durability high-tier gear/snorkelling gear. This gear could allow access at a deeper diving depth, not ordinarily accessible with crafted gear (Mutant Accidental Technology?) This could be a location for rare blueprints and not craftable gear.
3) Have upgrade slots in the boats, improved sail trim, improved wind indicator, or improved gas usage. Build protections/defence and offences on boats as upgrades. Each slot is a rare find or craftable blueprint.
4) Incorporate a talent tree (see vanilla World of Warcraft)
5) Upgrading something like the Spear should yield better drop outcomes, more so with food kills.
6) Auto stack picked up items.
7) There needs to be a Destroy option on the inventory interface. Or have items despawn if they have been dropped.",1700984740,1700995346,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I don't spend time planning and building a base to have to figure out what got destroyed and or fixing things every dang time .. then go get all the material again to re-build what I built already .. all the while staying fed and watered and trying to build a cool base, and then getting attacked over and over again ...

Although, I did purchase it. I don't like PVP games. I like the survival, and building aspects of games.  It's easy to build your base in this game. So, if you like that. This is a good game. Ironically, if you have arachnophobia, don't get this game. I know what you're thinking. There can't be any giant spiders in a game about diving, islands, and nothing but water. Well, you should be right. But there's a trading post. I decided to revisit this game after Thanksgiving. But apparently, there was a Halloween event. No, my single-player games, don't generally have events, but this one did. And the developers thought it would be great to hang an ENORMOUS bigger than the player spider from the wall. Nothing says Happy Thanksgiving/Merry Christmas like a giant black spider hanging from the wall behind the cashier. I guess they brought it in with the last update. When is the next update? Who knows? Potentially in a couple of months. I wish there was a way to turn off the events. Other than that, it's a decent game. Do I recommend it? No. I don't like giant surprise spiders in my water world games. When they remove the giant spider, I'll change it to a recommendation, if I can.

And I'm well aware that the wonderful developers are working around the clock to make sure things are getting taken care of so that they can make the best game possible for those of us that are enjoying it and will continue to recommend it to people.

The game has it's flaws, like any game in development does. But what needs to be kept in mind is that it is a survival game. You're going to grind. You're going to do the same kinds of things over and over again. That's what basic survival games do. You grid, build, grind, get better stuff, build more, grind again, etc... Just remember that as you progress further, the game does get a little more difficult. Want more of a challenge? Take up the survival difficulty in the opening menu. 

Now, as for the things that could be fixed or that I would like to see come in the future, not just as a player but as a streamer.

-Weather. Fighting against the elements takes up survival interest.
-Wild life? I understand that this game is water based, but there is a point where you pick up a roasted pig. Where did they get that? I've never seen a pig running around.
-More crops/Better farming. It would be nice to be able to have more than just the 4 crops I've come across thus far. As well as being able to possibly expand on how farming works.
-Better/bigger air tanks. Having to carry so many air tanks because you have to dive so deep gets a little tiring because of having to take up inventory space and having to switch out so frequently.
-Another trader. The possibility of a better trader further out would be nice. One that might have those better air tanks even.
-Boat fixes. I've come across an issue with my boats, regardless of the game I'm in. I'm not sure what has caused this, but the only way I can seem to get out of a boat is by getting into the passenger seat and then getting out. Otherwise the boat will flip, for whatever unknown reason.

I'm sure there are more things that I could add to this, but as of right now this is all that comes to mind. I, personally, will continue to play and stream this game. I love it!",1700934651,1700934651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I'll start with my gripe about this game....the decay is shocking, the main character must have worms or something because they are constantly thirsty or hungry, to a point where its annoying and detracting from the building, exploring element of the game. 
The plus points, its still being developed, it looks decent and has a lot to do.  I like that you can also get raided by the npc's and that they are not just random push overs. I don't play multiplayer on anything because generally people are just shitty for the sake of it so I haven't explored that side of this game. 
worth checking out , just to explore under water and see what you can find.  well worth the money.

Pros:
- Different concept than other survival games, as you are on a small island and travel to other islands or under them to find materials
- Neat building concept
- Cool Weapons
- Great boats, okay helicopter

Cons:
- Way too mundane to farm. Have to constantly add fuel (wood) to machines to make them run, they can only hold a small amount at a time
- Have to sit around and smelt as you can only put 5 or less at a time making it more of a sitting around and waiting sim
- repetitive and boring islands

For $17, I don't even care about the cons, not that I've encountered many so far in play.

Developers, things I'd love to see:
Deeper cities, huge sky scrapers
Underwater base building
Submersibles (unless I just haven't hit those in the tech tree yet)
Procedurally generated map
Coral reefs
Sunken ships
Bit more aquatic life for spice

From the immense amount of potential I see in this game, to loads of fun it currently stands as is, as well. 

(Previous Review)
Sunkenland is a gripping and addicting game. You are constantly in motion to loot, build and invade enemy territory. I have had immense amount of fun playing this game in co-op. Sure, this isn't perfect, it is in early access, but this is 100% worth trying where it stands currently. There is a few glitches, that can be slightly annoying but nothing to ruin your fun. Sunkenland is all about exploring. From the water to the land, collecting blueprints, decorations, scavenging for recourses and building a strong and fortified base to withstand raids. I always find myself about to log off. When I realize there is more I need to do, and a crap ton of charcoal in my inventory that I can exchange for that oh so precious chemical substance that I can never seen to find enough of. I am more than excited to see where this game continues to go, and hope for the very best success for Sunkenland.",1698650676,1700708699,True,1,1,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

 This is a survival game that allows you to create worlds or join existing worlds. You can create a solo world, or public world.

 I will focus on the solo mode in this short review:

  The server settings allow you to decide enemy presence, and other factors which will change the game experience for the world.

  In world, You must eat food to fight hunger, and drink water to fight thirst, you must also keep your energy up, when that runs out you lose consciousness, you can sleep to regain energy. You also have a health meter to keep up, food and medicines will refill health.

  You need to find or craft clothing if you wish to wear any outfit or armor(you start in your undies)

  You can craft boats for long sea travels, there are motor boats as well as sail boats, and even peddle boats.

  You can explore sunken cities while deep sea diving.

  Crafting and upgrading, scales up as you progress in the game - as an example you can upgrade your main crafting table to unlock other specific crafting options as you progress. Another form of upgrade is: forged iron bars can be refined into steel, and wood planks can be milled into refined wood, allowing the crafting of special items. 

  This game has far more content than what appears on the surface, as should be evident in the title of the game, I have mentioned very little.

Over all, I love this game for what it is, regardless of what it isn't. If you like survival and base building, I say give it a try. It is still being actively developed, so expect to see it grow and change. As it is now, I consider it a masterpiece. 

I have not played public servers so I offer no information or opinion on multiplayer/co-op.

Personally i feel this game is a good canidate for labor of love for the steam awards. Why? Well let me tell you it is well thought of.
You can place Chests UNDER Crafting stations! It is something minor still not many early access games have it after years of development! It has a lot of utility and it feels like someone thought about that. The building system is nice with the snapping aspect. The decoration system is just rad! Not to mention the signs you can place is has a lot of humor in it and i love it. 


Combat is intense and it feels like the enemy is looking for cover and flanking. Also headshots feel rewarding with a nice feedback and the enemy is not so bullet spongy same as you with the armor.

All and all i can hearthly recommand this game and i hope this gets famous as other survival games, it has a lot of potential!",1695925540,1700657201,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The Good:
Loved the start, so tranquil doing the entire explore thing underwater, nice soothing sound track. Pretty easy to find stuff you need and food. build a base, lots of fun

The not so good:
Very quickly started turning into a bandit shooter. once i started to wage war on the bandits, i no longer needed to explore underwater as i got all the loot, guns and ammo i needed to raid more bandits from the previous lot of bandits. 

I think the balance between tranquil exploring the serene underwater landscape is out of balance with the bandit side of the game and it was a bit of a let down (for me).
BUT if you like murdering helpless bandits just going about their daily plundering with a bit of adventuring on the side, then this game is for you
I did like it, i just need to start the game with a shooter mindset and less of a ""raft style"" adventure look at the pretty stuff mind set.",1700512082,1700512082,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

 It would be great if you could have a dog companion that you catch and keep or something like that.
 
A few things I noticed: There needs to be a way to get/ make level 3 clothes or they should spawn more often. Also, the iron knee pants you make in your inventory would be nice if they had black cloth that covered your legs. They look funny on guys. LOL 

One big issues is not being able to pick things up and move them. Once it's set down if you pick it up it will destroy it.  So you lose couches, bed, grill etc.. you have to real build it or hope you pick it up again raiding. So this is an issues, you should be able to move things around your house.

other than these few things the game is fine, of course its buggy because its just released. but the devs seem responsive to feedback (and are also really quick with the changes)

edit: I should make this known so it doesn't look weird, but im going to keep editing and adding problems i find and take away ones that get fixed. and im just gonna toss suggestions below and do the same.

-add cow
-add dolphin
-upgradeable boat storage
-before getting the diving tank add a re breather or a snorkel that gives you extra time underwater without pills
-add a value number for shops so we're not just guessing how many ropes this lady wants for a metal detector

Eventually it just becomes ""craft boats, craft weapons, kill dudes""; so I hope to return in the future to a version that has a stronger identity. I felt the same about Raft so my compliments - I had almost as much fun with this as I had with Raft. I also liked the AI, it's pretty good. The base defense is fun at first.

I want to be positive so I'll focus on what I'd like instead of complaining:

I'd love to see:
- more wildlife beyond the basic sharks.
- deeper dives that you can't even do until... *spoilers*
- more dive gear blueprints/etc.
- Much clearer building mechanics; specifically:
-- less penalty for taking down scrap metal. (it's scrap!)
-- rotation, better placement, etc.
-- More pieces, especially roof.
-- set depth when placing things like paintings so they don't end up half in a wall.
-- destructable decorations; that way you are protecting the fancy vase you found.
- The machines must take more than one piece. It's such a grind to cook one piece of meat at a time on a 3D rendered grill that could clearly take more. Maybe early game you just get a little yakitori grill that takes 1 piece and the nicer grill could take more...
- A reason to take specific islands/factions.
- More neutral / friendly NPCs.
- Reworked menus where item descriptions are whole and you get important storage info for containers.
- instead of requiring rubber for wiring, construct wire from rubber/copper.
- Barge / Move the larger floatillas / Towing?
- If you can't own an build on a conquered base - fine. Then let me destroy it all.

I look forward to switching this to a 'recommend'; but right now you'll run into broken descriptions, grindy game loops (food, ingots), and a too fast spiral from fun survival base defense exploration into a basic shooter.

I hope the devs keep at it; so much promise here!

The cost of the recipes scale well and do not feel grindy at all.  The current highest-tier ingredient, Advanced Components, are the most difficult to get and even those are fairly findable since they always spawn in red tool chests.

Pros:
- Excellent Base building
- Variety of weapons
- Relatively unique setting
- Multiplayer
- Variety of POIs

Cons:
- No Dedicated servers
- Bugs, a lot of bugs
- Plenty of weapons, but you'll only use 3 of them. (Or at least I do)
- The usual painful inventory management.
- Lack of useful base defenses
- Terrible gun aiming and sighting (Or I'm just getting old)
- No random resources, everything is POI based, no point in exploring the deep blue water.

- Game offers an alarm as a late game warning for when raiders approach, but you don't need it because the music changes when raiders are within X range.  The music is your radar.

I went pretty crazy with building and made a couple of nice huge bases. One of our favorite things about the game is how simple the building and crafting is. Its not trying to be so realistic that you have too much on your plate to look for and unlocking new things to craft isn't so complex that it becomes a chore. Everything is pretty straightforward and easy to figure out, but there is a lot to make and find and build already even this early in development. I hope they don't end up over-complicating things to the point that its not so fun anymore, but i sure welcome lots of new things to make and discover. 

Primary things we hope to see from this game: 
Actual animations for things you do would be great, so players with you can see where you are looking and what you are doing. I should be able to see that my wife is scanning around with her binoculars as I drive the boat. When she is crafting something or eating, I should be able to see that too. 
A 3rd person camera option would be great. 
I'd love to be able to at least hold a button to locate other friendly players without going to my map. 
There needs to be an option to strap 2 or 3 air tanks together or build better ones because the tanks don't last long enough IMO. 
Racks made to hold metal scrap should hold a LOT more than they do, otherwise they are pretty pointless and we might as well only build boxes to store metal scrap. 
When you die there is no clear indicator what bed you are choosing to respawn at and it's not consistently any of the options. Hard to get back to the fight when you respawned at a base miles away. Maybe allowing players to fast travel between beds/bases would help with this if the bed spawn locations aren't made more clear. 
Some sea-life variety would go a long way to making the ocean feel more alive and scary, especially things like huge whales in the deeper areas or pods of dolphins swimming and breaching the surface as you boat around. 
Being able to actually sit in chairs and sofas you make or find would be nice too. 

Biggest problem I have with gun combat is how many times I should have been hitting an enemy but the gaps in bushes or trees and holes in fences and walls were not really openings at all, so I waste a lot of ammo shooting invisible walls when I was trying to fire through a big obvious gap in a wood fence.

Pros
+Interesting idea
+Underwater graphics (especially the hammer heads) are nice looking

Cons
-Replayability is close to 0

- allowing access to all slots in your hotbar with scroll wheel
- items automatically filling your hotbar when your backpack is full
- add the ability to confirm consuming items (e.g., right click to confirm consumption so i stop incorrectly hot keying to the wrong slots and accidentally consuming items)

Some of the downsides are:
- Anything underwater feels like a chore because oxygen runs out very fast, even with an oxygen tank and the battery powered scooter thing.
- There's a lack of reliable sources for some items like leather (hide)
- AI is a bit overpowered if you get too close. The rifle with scope could counter this but it's too short-ranged and the enemies are often too obstructed by flora to be sniped

The biggest downside of all:
This game LOVES to crash, more than any other game I've ever played. It'll just freeze for 2 seconds and close. It does have a default autosave for what it feels like 5 minute intervals, but you won't be thrilled to lose 5 minutes of crafting and building.

I have been dreaming of a Waterworld Film inspired game for decades now, and if you have been too this is the closest we have to it. This title has so much potential!

Loving it so far. Rust on water with enemy NPCs.
Very rough as it is in Alpha, but the game loop and construction mechanics work great so far. 

Plenty of interesting clothing choices that benefit your survival chances right off the bat which is a nice addition. Day night cycle, good map with plenty of unique places you can locate. Would be cool to see different weather cycles, which could affect how rough the water is. Another idea is fantasy/apocalyptic weathers even such as Tornados, which could target OP players dominating servers, Acid Rain showers, which could melt wood and rust metal, etc. 

Build boats, drive a Jet-Ski, kill mutants and survivors armed with spears, axes, crossbows, and various guns. Dive underwater to loot all your building materials, furniture and vanity items which you can place on your player built homes and rafts, or scouted locations on your map. Islands have trees to cut down, all well implemented and functions properly. 

It would be cool to see a boat building method similar to Garry's Mods sandbox mechanics (The game mode Naval Play/Warfare and Sledbuild comes to mind). More fish is the other biggest lacking thing at the moment. Making the sea feel more populated and dangerous is a a big plus. With this could come some better fishing mechanics such as minigames similar to Dredge. 

Any form of XP shown and earned towards combat, fishing, swimming, would bring other audiances in too (Runescape leveling and Animal Crossing communities with this game would be next level). Another idea could be fetch quests for the traders to encourage returning to existing places. 

While the current music is fair, the sound design is lacking. Looping sounds and effects reminiscent of old Source games. Offer people voice roles to make the NPC raids more effective. They succeed in creating panic for sure, but something like 3 goons on Jet-Skis screaming obscenities would be more memorable. 

This base foundation of this game for the price is well worth it. Support small developers, could be the next Rust. However, the potential lies in properly implemented multiplayer which at this point we have on average 3 player max servers between dozens of peer to peer players. I understand the server costs but even half a dozen global 64 player servers with a queue would be perfect. 

If you liked Naval Warfare, the Waterworld Fallout 3 mod, Rust, farming simulators, survival games, Waterworld, Subnautica... this is something to support. This game is a massive task and i applaud the game we've got so far. Support small developers, support the potential this has.

Now for the game - I played 1-2 hours on normal diff and everything was good for me. Then I switched to Insane/ max diff settings. Everything is good until you meet GUNS and the game changes for BAD. Your only option is to abuse the Old Bolt Rifle and shoot the enemies from far, far away. You go around the POI with your boat and you shoot and shoot until you hope there are no more than 2-3 enemies in the base. And then you go and they 1 shot you most of the time and you go back and hope they will spawn outside so you can kill them and get the POI. On higher diff the armor doesn't matter with or without you will be 1-2 shot from the enemies even with medium/long range shotgun enemies. 
And all this becomes even worse when they raid you. If you don't build you base with big enough distance between your second floor and them, they will swim under you and start shooting through the walls with shotguns and you will die instantly.
Then you have the resources - I feel there are TOO many resources from some kinds that you don't know what to do. So you use the trader to dump all this resources to buy chemicals, electronics. The only important resource that I can see in the long run are chemicals as you need them to produce gasoline. Also traders underwater scooter is just TOO GOOD. Little battery usage and major speed boost - they should maybe swap with the headlight usage which is limited for 1 minute probably :).

A few loves; inventory system is very fluid and easy to get a hang of, big fan. The military backpack *chefs kiss* and the chest storage space, amazing for hoarders like me. 

I love the graphics so far, it is super immersive and I absolutely love diving into the depths of the ocean to scavenge anything and everything from each location. 

Combat is incredibly hard and rewarding, and the guns are very familiar of a Rust-Skyrim style system that I cannot wait to see improved with each update. 

Raids are so hard, and make things very difficult depending on your settings. You just gather enough resources for that grill and all of a sudden a bunch of bast*rds come and tear it up, as well as the very foundations beneath your feet. 

Base-building is super customisable with many different decorations and furniture already, which is super impressive. Hard to get going but once you grind a little bit and depending on your respawn settings for the loot, also super rewarding. 

A few comments; charcoal needs another purpose. Once you move past the homemade weapons, and no longer need black-powder, it is useless. Please, let us use this instead of wood in the machines that require burning fuel. It would make sense, as at first it is hard to come by and once you get going, wood is incredibly scarce but charcoal plentiful. 

I hope there are some plans to add additional wildlife to the islands and specifically the ocean. The odd small fish, group of 2-3 Marlin, sea turtles and 2 different types of sharks that all swim in a circle becomes no challenge. Make the sharks spawn randomly and let them move all around the locations at different depths please. And once there is more to look at beneath the water *wildlife*, it will be super immersive. 

And the ability to talk to NPC's like the trader featured in the trailer is so exciting. For the love of god though, pretty-please add some triangular foundations and floors. <3  This game has so much potential, please keep up the hard work as it is VERY much appreciated.",1698801795,1698801795,True,30,2,0.744399785995483398,0,True,False,True

There are to many MMO spawn and shoot games which don't interest me so when i saw this i thought i would give it a go. REALLY glad i did, I love it!! It is a unique game as most of it takes place under water and the aim is to survive. You start with nothing and scavenge for parts and resources to help build a base and increase the depths and time you can stay under water. 
Most other games today where you can build a base are limited so your base ends up being just a square empty box, why bother building it. This game is different, as you build and expand you can add items such as beds, chairs rugs stoves and all manor of other things not only to assist you in survival but also make the place your own. There is some conflict with other factions to keep you on your toes but the main focus is survival which is something i really enjoy. You can start your own single player game and then also invite your friends in to either assist in your base or build one of their own.
I love the concept I think that the major developers could really learn something from this, We don't all want to Spawn shoot and die, some of us still want build and survive as the main focus, very creative idea. So if you are in the same mind as me then i really recommend you give this a go.

The blueprint furniture items are out of place. Nice furniture next to rusty floors and walls. The workstation models look like blobs of rust with very little detail. The speedboat vanished after spending hours gathering the needed materials. The AI is really bad. Shoot one guy and the guy next to him is not alerted. They then proceed to walk the same route back and forth. Base attacks are even worse. Enemies able to shoot through walls, but you can't. Enemies glitching through foundations. First they're in the water and then they're in front of you fighting. Had one actually glitch through a wall and get inside my base. You can also grab and access items through walls. The water and underwater exploration is nice, but the only threat is running out of air. As you progress through the game, much of the items are no longer needed. Attacking AI bases is simple.

It desperately needs more locations and a bigger play area in my opinion, I don't mind a loading screen but I can't travel for 5 minutes and reach the end of a map, it just feels empty. The content however is under the water, and I have to remind myself to explore the real areas of focus.

Pro's-
Game looks stunning.
Movement and game play mechanics are fantastic, very much like Rust.
No steep learning curve, if you've played any survival game you'll pick this up in 10 mins.
So much to explore, NPC gunfights are challenging until you have top tier weapons/armour ,keeps it interesting.
Base building is easy and there's a big focus on decoration with some cool looking items. 

Cons-
Game crashes are a thing, maybe 1 or 2 per hour which isn't a deal breaker as it's early access
Game rolls back loot which is a HUGE pain in the ass, you can spend 10-15 mins looting and if it rolls back you lose the hard work, and NPC which you have killed the bodies despawn ,devs need to sort this.

Annoyances- Mainly loot and inventory.
Lack of customisation for inventory management, no scroll wheel option for hotbar , this needs added.
Shift loot needs added rather than clicking one item per time from inventory into storage.

More content needs added, duo playing 15 hrs each and we have almost maxed out the skill tree and crafted pretty much everything, once that's done more exploration can be done, however nothing more to be gained in terms of progression.

Would i recommend this game - 100% yes even in it's current state , the slight annoyances don't deter from a stunning looking game that's great fun to play.",1698613118,1698613118,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

The combat is.. interesting. The enemies are pretty unresponsive and just stare off in the distance until you shoot at them and actually hit.  You can shoot an enemy directly next to another and only the one you shoot at will turn and start firing back.

The building aspect is fun, like a bell curve as far as difficulty to acquire parts. Farm runs are pretty standard.  Underwater has a lot to offer, but I will say I was a bit let down when I found out how weak sharks were to fight. I thought it would be a lot more difficult.

One thing that drives me insane is how the foliage will grow back IN YOUR HOUSE.  It's such a small thing but damn it gets to you after awhile.  You'll go to chop it back down and end up halving the hp of your wall instead lol.

Flying boats is another cool bug.  Pretty spectacular when dropped loot is such a huge obstacle that the logic is for your boat to fly over the top of it.  Like 50 feet in the air.",1698565932,1698565996,True,103,22,0.868485450744628906,0,True,False,True

Sunkenland fills a void for many Subnautica / Rust fans. The game is entertaining, don't get me wrong. I just don't feel the need to play much more than an hour to see where all of this goes. 

Sure, I could spend the next 40 hours killing AI mutants of various factions... build a base to my liking and all.

for as young as the game is it has an amazing diversity.
Mant pre release games are low on content and you are at end game (as far as the release goes to that point anyways) withing a week.
So much content and the attacks make it just challenging enough without being ludicrously hard.

But there should be a level that games like this add reasonable traits to the game that make it workable and it seems like there isn't that much in this game as it stands now, it seems very barebones. 

Game is good and Im definitely hopeful of a better future - it might not be now. 

Problems I have center mainly on combat and current simplistic design choices - Alot of the mechanics are incompatible and not balanced thoroughly enough in my opinion, note that I mean that it isn't balanced *for a early access game ie it's almost not balanced at all* raids and tech advancements need to scale, hitboxes should be better for aiming - combat mechanics should in general try to avoid skyrim mechanics etc 

Anyway idk it's frustrating to play and doesn't seem achievable to play unless you have friends and intense understanding of game battle strategy - It gets boring in the logistics and resource collection and idk maybe needs more tuning to make it challenging while also being more freeing, there should be more to it, and more stuff to get.

Played for a little bit and it gave me a head ache.

There is no easy way to drag an item out of your inventory, you have to drag one by one and what happens when you drag it out? They just stack and stay threre, If you drop a lot of items you might not even be able to see what's in front of you.

Building system is stupid bad, let me explain you how bad it is with an example. When RUST came out in 2013 it had a better building system than this and that was back in 2013 with same game engine. I'm ok with no grid snapping etc. but we are talking about a stupidly cumbersome build menu here.

Collisions almost doesn't work, just killed 3 zombies behind a wall with starting axe.

There are so many bugs that you do sometimes need to kill yourself or re-spawn etc. but no there isn't a game console or anything like that there is a whole ass admin panel mod made already but game developers couldn't include such basic feature in a game I had to install bloatware and a mod just to get out of a bug. 

Idea is very good, RUST is the only game in it's genre right now and this can be later be an alternative Rust but everything else sucks so bad it's unbelieveable.

Lack of Fun: While I initially expected to have an enjoyable gaming experience, I found that Sunkenland failed to provide any meaningful entertainment or fun factor. The gameplay felt tedious and unengaging.

Poor Optimization: The game suffered from severe optimization issues, leading to performance problems on my system. This negatively impacted my ability to play and enjoy the game to its fullest potential.

The game run smoothly overall (no big frame dip, no bad bug on my side).

Base building is a bit clunky at time when placing block but works OK otherwise (rotation and depth tend to change quickly as you move but standing still before building make it a non-issue).

There is some progression (bow => crossbow => some meh gun but cheap => better guns for more costly, along some melee upgrade and very small tool upgrade).

You can craft more ""efficient"" (cost less wood to run them) station rather quickly, farm some ressources at home (cotton/cloth, wood, food).

Cooking is quickly irrelevant because you find a lot of food/water especially later and it's fster and more easy to simply replant ready-to-eat things like strawberry, lemon, lettuce rather than than bother cook stuff one by one with a delay between each dish you make (cooking station cost a fair bit so you can't really spam them to take less time).

You need to dive a fair bit, can equip fins to swim faster and use pills or equip reusable air tank (you can swap underwater to extend the timer) to stay for a long period of time.

Some place can be looted stress-free (no enemies) while some other require killing basic mutans (melee, crossbow), or mercenary/slaver/etc with different kind of guns.

You do get attacked now and then; They do destroy building rather quickly if they stack against a single spot, so it can be a bit hard later to deal with them in solo.

The AI doesn't ""refresh"" it's state very often; They do react quickly if they spot you, move around somewhat randomly, have good aim so you will get killed quickly if you try to attack from the front (armor break down fast and you don't have a lot of hp).
On the other hand, the IA doesn't ""turn"" : if they spot you from ... say the south, you can swim around and attack them on their back and it take a fair bit before they decide to (all) turn around and shoot at you.
So it's best to simply circle around them and take a shot when you can. Or swim bellow them and melee (can't shoot in the water so it's safe), or walk under the floor they stand and melee them trough the floor.
Or use grenades (very effective way to kill).

To me, that's enough ""gunplay"" for this type of game to be fine, but it could use more reactive AI (you can kill at long range one by one, they don't react unless close enough or if they take damage) and maybe have them heal if you leave them for too long.

Electricity sucks though cost too much and do very little. It'sa waste of ressources, making the last tech tier quite useless beside boat/armor upgrade.

The setting is basically like the movie from 1995 Waterworld, if you have seen this movie and liked it, you will love this game!
Ofcourse there are many things still to be improved as its an early access, but you can already play the game, experience the world and build a nice base. 
The following improvements i hope the developers will implement:
1. Basebuilding in the water needs floaters instead of poles which do not reach the bottom.
2. It is not so realistic that if you have a water base without a proper path from land, that the swimming enemies will still shoot a crossbow or make headshots with their guns. To load a crossbow while swimming in deep water is extremely difficult. 
3. The enemies also need to get boats which we can take over after a fight
4. We need to be able to sneak attack or at least get dmg bonusses for a sneak attack
5. We need to be able to flatten all buildings on an island and in the water to get even more materials. This could be an end game drill or something.
6. We need to have a electric water purifier with a hose which can reach the sea water so you dont have to do the bucket walk / pumping all the time.
7. We need to be able in our base to utilize all materials in the storage units.
8. We need a harpoon to shoot the fishes or at least a ranged weapon which can function under water. There are some conventional weapons which can be used. 
9. It would be cool to make alliances with some groups and be able to trade and make trade or real wars with others. 
10. We need an underwater submarine with a grabber
11. We need to be able to build an underwater base! especially end game this could be cool that you get divers which will attack your base.
12. We need naval mines.  
13. A chainsaw for cutting the trees

Looking forward for the next updates. It would be cool if the dev team can release every two or three weeks a small update same like Sons of the Forest does so you are always hooked.

Progression? Starting up is tough, but once the ball is rolling, it's fantastic.

Gameplay Settings Adjustment? Decent. I wish there was a bit more options here, but what is offered has made my few hours of playtime a day well spent and challenging enough to be fun, but not frustrating.

Story? Nonexistent, and that's fine.

Survival Crafting? Fun, rewarding, build mode doesn't try changing the mold. I do wish I could manually adjust the height of foundations, but it's not a deal breaker. I can pickup crafting stations I've already built without dismantling them into it's parts

1. **Concept and Potential:**
   - Begin with the premise of your strong affinity for Sunkenland and the potential for it to be the next day's gone if guided correctly.

2. **Gameplay Refinements:**
   - Discuss areas that require improvement for a smoother gaming experience.
     - Implement shortcuts for accessing the enemy menu quickly.
     - Add enemy elimination announcements, especially for headshots.
     - Allow players to toggle the display of the enemy's life bar.
     - Offer the option to select or deselect flags on islands, or boat signs. 
     - allow dragging an entire stack of Items or just click it for selling stuff. 

3. **Enhancing Gameplay:**
   - Suggest gameplay enhancements to make it more engaging.
     - Incorporate a mouse middle button function for inventory weapon switching.
     - Introduce an underwater hospital with it a new item. for healing, which can also be crafted. An aid kit.
     - Introduce the possibility of players to get infections that can be treated with antibiotics.
     - Include larger aquatic creatures like whales and squids.
     - more mutants underwater.( What was actually all about in the beginning) 

4. **Economic System:**
   - Discuss the introduction of an in-game economy.
     - Assign silver coin values to every in-game item to create a pricing system. Those can be bought and sold using coins. 

5. **Narrative and Immersion:**
   - Emphasize the importance of a compelling storyline and immersion.
     - Discuss the potential of combining elements of Sunkenland with Days Gone, for example.
     - Suggest more underwater activities, weapons, and scuba diving equipment etc. Like the day's gone had the motorcycle to be updated, introduce the boat or something like that, constantly being updated; storage, armour, speed, fuel capacity, arm your boat with weapons, etc. 
     - Introduce communities or one community that offer missions, blueprints, and bandanas as rewards. Bandanas can be dropped from raiders colour coded depending on the clan. Each is worth more silver coins. 
     - Highlight the significance of missions and their impact on the game.

6. **Extended Gameplay:**
   - Conclude with the idea of extending the gameplay experience.
    - Suggest adding 5 new missions to the game with each update. Something like do this and you get that.
     - Propose starting with the first mission at the trade shop.
     - Describe how players could encounter various characters within communities, each offering unique missions and knowledge.
Like a doctor will have the blueprints for an antibiotic recipes, or first aid kit recipe. 
A mechanic can unluck your boat blueprints and boat update blueprints.
A cook with unluck you food recipes. 
A gunman can unlucky you guns and bullets blueprints. 
A carpenter unlocks you all those furniture and all those crafting Tables you are using in the game. 
Imagine instead of dealing yourself with the raiders you can make guns and give them to people from your community. 
Costume your own Bandana that you were on your arm. 

All those missions having a level that can be updated with each mission. Each unlocking the new item you can craft.

     - Discuss the idea of underwater combat and its role in the game. After all it's called sunkenland and most of the action happens on land. 


7. **Final Thoughts:**
   - Mention that while Sunkenland is enjoyable, it tends to lose its appeal after approximately 20 hours, underscoring the potential for these enhancements to reinvigorate the gaming experience.

Adding a story line and a goal to the game will change it for sure. Motivating the player to play further adding achievements and missions will totally give it justice. 

When I started playing the game and those mutants came at me for the first time, I really thought this can be the next day's gone, but it kinda started to be more normalized after taking them down.

I kind of call it ""advanced minecraft"" , which may not be fair to the game or Minecraft, but you do farm resources and build, and then fend off raids of enemies. But this is NOT a bad thing at all.
It's still in active development, so lots of things still to come, and of course some bugs, but overall I would highly recommend this game!
There still needs to be some balancing of what resources you get from what items, as well as crafting ""costs"" of some things need better balancing, but again it's still in development.

Pros:
- Factions
- Co-op
- Base building
- Base raids (yours and theirs) :)
- Sailing (motorboat, raft)
- NPCs duck and crouch when trying to shoot them
- Merchants
- Island claiming
- Crafting

Cons:
- Melee combat needs improvement
- Some character animations
- base building (no snaping, hard to line up things like stairs)
- Gettng water (it's doable, just tedious) 
- Mutants coloring (at night they blend in with the shadows and you cannot even see their eyes)

This game so far is actually a lot of fun to play. Right now I've got two games going on, one with me and my girl, another with some of the homies. I'll tell you what I told them, it's basically Raft on Crack without the annoying voyage and shark constantly destroying your ship. 

As far as Early Access games go this has a lot of potential to expand on, people have already made mods to help smooth over some of the edges that currently exist. I really think the Devs should add some of them to the game. Like 3rd person views, better utility, increased stack sizes, no building restrictions after clearing, key modifier to quick drop items, and a few minor things to really get this game at a place where I could say I could spend 100+ hours on it.

Haven't gotten super far into the game yet but I can see where it's going. We had our raiding group constantly attack a heavily guarded barge naked with spears and lemme tell ya, we died, A LOT. In the end, we had a sense of accomplishment and hella good loot even though we were eradicated a few times lol. (shotguns op vs no armor kek)

To anyone who wants to casually game with some homies, this is a good one that I don't mind supporting to see further development. Devs are active and doing good work, this game is gonna go places if they stay on it.

You sson learn it's not a good idea to face AR Rifles on a peddle boat. it's strange you can wipe a faction out and take the island for this sort of game but makes me feel there's progression. It also makes me want to sneak. 

Would be great for the ability for stealth kills... I trying and get just behind them but they know lol not good when its a knife in a gun fight. Also a was to dodge especially in the water against sharks as they as sharp turners and 100% accuracy. Got one though lol. Would be great to see raider come in boat or raft some quite other factions noisy for fear. 
All round great game so far so early on. Love it look forward to seeing what comes in the future.",1697484901,1697484901,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I have no experience with co-op or multiplayer. Just to save some people from further reading.

The game is ""early Access"" so it's still in development and being tweaked by the people making it and they appear to be monitoring feedback and acting on it either by replying to comments or actually making changes in updates. Good stuff!

I have 41 hours of game play over the last couple of months and personally have never had a technical problem in my solo games. I have never seen issues others have come across thankfully.

Best tip I can give people new to the game is that AI  raids can be controlled in the settings from a low to high level and can also be turned off  until you turn them on again.
I mention this as  raids on your base by the Ai can be pretty brutal and can be a game breaker for some.
Either setting them to low or pausing them until you can catch up on resourced and building will help if you get overwhelmed by the brutality of the attacks.

The game looks fantastic and plays smoothly on my PC (2080 gpu).

Crafting menus are easy to manage and it's fun to build and exploration is fun on islands and especially under water.
It's fun to go and raid the AI camps and it's great seeing them dodge and move when I attack.

The game is very playable now and I personally think it is already worth the money and I am very excited to see this progress into something bigger and better. Fingers crossed.

Have fun!

First off, an amazing game, its a lot like a mix of games in a sense (Subsistence, Stranded Deep, Subnautica, some Raft and Rust like vibes, plus the Water World movie concept too) despite their similarity to others they definitely have created a game that truly is one of a kind and no others have come close to making anything like this game. The mechanics, graphics, and quality of life of the game have all been beyond amazing for me tbh. Its early access so understand there are things being fixed, added, changed and updates, lots of them down the line, so plz don't bash an EA game, if you don't like EA games then wish list and wait for updates, full release or whatnot, trust me this game will be beyond amazing when their finished with it for sure, but if you do pick up, be patient with the progression of game, support the devs and join their discord to provide feedback and stay updated the best. Highly recommend to all for real and the devs seem so active, they communicate a lot, it's been a lot of fun, so worth the base price by far.

The latest overhaul update, patches, fixes have been great, plus some nice additions to the game have been a great start to the progress of the game. The devs def communicate, and listen to their feedback, cannot stress that enough, which is why i love the game and appreciate the dev team so much.

I bought it without watching any gameplay of it first. I was expecting a buggy mess due to the early access, and I was almost planning to refund it and wait until it's fully released to possibly try again, but I ended up immediately loving it. In the 10 hours I've played I've maybe encountered 2 bugs, both of which were minor and insignificant. 

I've had lots of fun, building a fancy little base, unlocked several pages of the research bench, and built many machines. I've discovered lots of islands and underwater monuments, and explored multiple. I've enjoyed every moment of it. It's still got some ways to go, and there's functions I wish it had that it doesn't yet, but considering it's early access it's only to be expected. I assume there's lots to come.

I would recommend it today and in the future. If you can wait then it's probably better to wait, as I assume we may lose progress with huge updates etc, or get bugs with ""old"" worlds. But it is a nice experience being able to take part in the early access, to be there from before release, and see how it grows into a better game over time. So whether you want it today or want to wait is up to you. Playing today will still be lots of fun, and a great experience - but waiting could make the experience better, as it'll have more functions and less bugs (though there's barely any in the first place).

In the shadows, where secrets reside,
A world concealed, where the lost souls hide.
Deep in the dark, where no sunlight gleams,
The underworld awakens from its dreams.
The underworld is rising, like a tide so slow,
Over the world, it begins to flow.
A force unseen, from depths below,
In its somber embrace, mysteries grow.
Like an ocean's swell, it takes its flight,
Breaking through the barriers of the night.
From the abyss, secrets start to churn,
In the underworld's grasp, there's much to learn.
The underworld is rising, like the waters' rise,
Over the world, it's a dark surprise.
Slowly but surely, its power swells,
In the underworld's domain, ancient stories tell.
As it ascends, voices call,
Whispers of the lost, a siren's thrall.
A world submerged in tales untold,
The underworld's secrets begin to unfold.
The underworld is rising, with each passing day,
Over the world, it finds its way.
Unveiling its secrets, like the ocean's might,
In its rising depths, there's no end in sight.
In the depths of night, its presence grows,
Where mysteries and legends interpose.
It's a silent force, with stories arising,
The underworld's tide, ever so surprising.
The underworld is rising, like the ocean's might,
Over the world, it takes flight.
Slowly but surely, it begins to unveil,
In the underworld's depths, secrets prevail.
As the world keeps turning, and the darkness keeps surprising,
The underworld is rising, with stories ever-sizing.
In its quiet ascent, where mysteries keep advising,
Remember this tale of the underworld's uprising.

[list]
[*]Get rid of someone is “occupying the chest”. Please allow multiple people into one chest at the same time.
[*]Increase the duration of batteries. They would be alot more viable if they lasted at least two days instead of 5 minutes. 
[*]Add an upgraded chest or increase the storage of certain chests at least triple the amount.
[*]Add a speargun or some type of underwater weapon that has a range attack.
[*]Add a scope for rifles crafted. 
[*]Increase the attack range of enemies with rifles (don't make them too accurate, or this would be bad).
[*]Add a captain/boss to each island that is different depending on the faction. These bosses should have a unique attack/dodge mechanic to make things a lot more interesting. Maybe add a unique drop for them like a special gun part that can only be obtained by taking out said boss.

-Graphics are bad for a 2023 game
-Building, placement of modules is bad, you can place multiple walls into the same wall
-Enemy AI is atrocious, they teleport inside base, their movement is complete crap, they jump like 5 meters for no reason, also the animations are stupid as hell.
-The whole world interaction is weird, glitchy, you get stuck inside walls, terrain etc.
-Multiple random disconnects with the message ""no internet connection available, which is not true. 
-And most annoying of all: IT DOESN'T HAVE CLOUD SAVES. IT LITERALLY CREATES A LOCAL SAVE GAME AND IF YOU CHANGE THE PC, BYE BYE WORLD & CHARACTER.

Yeah, maybe in 1-2 years this game is worth playing, but right now it feels like a ""fast cashgrab + abandon in 1 year""

In my defense, there have been a LOT of indy games on steam that get 'early access' release then abandoned, so I still think being suspicious was justified. But, again, I was wrong.

Sunkenland had a rough early access launch, IMO. But the dev has made a lot of progress in the past 6 weeks weeks and seeing that progress made, I'm changing this to a positive review and I'm having a lot of fun playing. There's still rough spots, nothing game breaking that I've found and, IMO, the map needs to be larger and/or some sort of resource respawn (possibly tied in with enemies retaking islands). But it's a fun game and worth spending 20 bucks.




Original review:
It has potential but in it's current state it's not playable. The game is NOT ready for beta testing, much less early access. I'm all about supporting smaller game companies but Vector3 is being very dishonest calling this early access. This is a Alpha play test that they scammed players into paying for. 

I hope I'm wrong but my gut is telling me this is another scam 'game' to grab attention and early access money and in a few months it'll be forgotten.


In 5 minutes, I found the following problems.
Poor graphics quality. Set to high on a RTX 3090
Can't remap keys.
Too much motion blur  and mouse movement is not smooth.
Excessive amounts of head bobbing when trying to cut down a tree or simply walk. 
Screen shaking for no apparent reason. 
Swim controls are buggy. You hit down once and continue to sink. No button to swim up, you have to keep hitting the jump button. 

In less then 5 minutes i had to quit because the screen was a bobbing blurry mess.

Edit: And no options to change fov, or turn off motion blur and/or head bobbing",1693024606,1696771696,True,2,0,0.564516127109527588,5,True,False,True

The game's premise includes modular base building on islands scattered throughout the ocean, sunken city scavenging, and confrontations with NPC clans for resources and territory. These elements come together to create a compelling survival experience in a waterworld setting.

The modular base building system on these islands is a notable highlight, allowing players to construct their shelters with ease. Nonetheless, there is room for expansion and added diversity in the available building options.""

Exploring sunken cities provides a sense of adventure, although the storytelling aspect could be enhanced to make it more engaging.

While the crafting system serves its purpose, it might benefit from more complexity and variety to make it more engaging and rewarding.

Base defense and NPC clan invasions are meant to add excitement to the gameplay, but currently, they may not instill the sense of urgency or threat that one might expect. The AI adversaries lack the depth and challenge needed to make these encounters truly engaging.

In summary, Sunkenland is a survival game with potential. It offers a unique take on the waterworld theme through its modular base building, sunken city exploration, and resource-driven confrontations with NPC clans. With further development and adjustments, particularly in gameplay balance and storytelling, Sunkenland could become a more compelling entry in the survival game genre. Keep an eye on its progress; there's hope for its growth in the future.

Let me start by saying it's a fun concept a PVE Rust game but the current content is just so lacking, unbalanced and aimless. I can't recommend it for 20 bucks.

This game is just filled with time wasters to make you think you're actually having a lot of content but most of the time it's you emptying your boat and sorting it. Which damn is BAD.

You literally can press take all and it will BOOT EVERYTHING OUT OF YOUR CHEST if your inventory is full and just scatter everywhere. There is no quick stack. Some stacks are insanely small where others have so many.

This is a survival game but even with the highest survival settings we never struggled to stay alive with food and drinks except for the start! In the beginning you struggle with water and food but once you get a couple easily crafted guns you start finding so much soda and canned food you'll never have to cook or collect water again. This happens quite fast and basically takes away the survival aspect of the game.

Now progression is also an absolute disgrace. You start the PVE by making a bow and some arrows. You clear an island and continue to a crossbow and from here you can simply go to a higher island and play dirty with dying and respawning and just rushing back to finish island. ( Which if you pick random respawn u have a guarantee close spawn to the island. )

From that raid you get broken guns Deagle, rifles or shotguns and armor it's random you work for like 1-2h at most to fully get everyone a gun and some armor and it's literally over from there progression wise. You can clear almost every island easily and nothing really too look forward too besides some armor upgrades which are useless due to the respawn mechanic.

Most you got to look forward too after you get to that stage is to get the helicopter blueprint. Once you get that you spend 30m grinding iron and smelting it all to make a heli and the game is basically over..

The underwater exploration is just as fun as ransacking NPC islands.

Unfortunately in its current state its kinda shit. The building was really bad and it kept snapping to things I wasn't even looking at. Gathering from trees and scrap piles feels so soulless I kinda wish there was more variety in terms of looks and resources gathered. The islands feel like they are way to close together or maybe there is just to many of them (default settings) Out of the different enemies to run into I ran into the mutants. They kinda just move around randomly until one of them spots you then they all charge towards you even following you into the water.

The reinforced structures are lacking: reinforced floor, roof, pillar, stairs, etc.
No method to upgrade walls/structures without removing them and building the next tier in its place, IF, you can even place it.(Personally I have a 3rd floor structure but even with pillar supports everywhere I cannot place any new walls where pre-existing walls are)
Tier 3 stuff is pretty much the last one you need as tier 4 unlocks very few useful items like the Heavy MG 'structure' or Raid Alarm(If you play with raids enabled)
Wood consumption on everything is fast and the same(No difference of the small grill to the improved grill--still burning the same amount of wood, just like for everything else with wood consumption)
Wood storage holds the same amount as ALL the other storage boxes, only difference is the LxWxH and HP by 100 or 200.
Battery drain for everything is fast.
O2 consumption from tanks is fast, even carrying around two full tanks is horrible.
Hunger/Thirst/Energy drain is fast.
Stack sizes are small.
Headlight doesn't have a bound-key to turn off/on making it rather useless to carry around.
The item descriptions are HORRIBLE. Even the Marine Fast Boat says it is ""A wooden sailboat that can accommodate 4"".

However, the game itself is stunning and seems to be a mix of Rust x Stranded Deep, would recommend it later when more is added and fixed to be playable AND enjoyable, but until then it's a pass.",1696559956,1696612959,False,3,1,0.506363034248352051,0,True,False,True

Right now I have 12hrs in, I have explored much if not most of the map. There is a lot to see and do. Different enemy at different difficulty. Learn this before attacking. Mutants for example use primitive weapons spears, ax, crossbow. Slavers have firearms. So early on you would attack Mutants but stay away from Slavers. 

I hope the information above can help people to decide if this game is worth it. So many hate on EA games because they do not understand what you buy into.

No mod support.  (I can think of no good reason for that other than someone who is a control freak heading up something.  While I personally do not mod I very much appreciate people who do so that we can customize the game.  Even modern MMO's allow a certain amount of modding and my guess is most will do this as a single player since there doesn't seem to be enough content to keep a group busy for long.  So, control freak.)

This is a game that screams for both of these things.  That and add a random world generator to be able to increase game time.  

Controls are fully re-bindable which is good but the game feels wildly unfinished.  I'm still working on playing it but for even a brief time in the game I'd say ""Give this one a year or two to get 30% better before trying it.""  If they add the ability for people to easily mod it, it might get better than that.  

Unfortunately it is another of the 'early access' plague of partially finished games unleashed upon the world and games take so long to make that we, the consumer, are desperate for new content - even if it is only partially done.

A solid 'base' of a game. At 20 bucks you will get more than your monies worth in time/energy/effort. All the major functionalities are here. Base building. Looting. Crafting. Combat. Another year of polish on this and this could be 'THE' game for the genre/setting to beat. 

It has the Waterworld meets Raft vibe down in spades. 

Pros - Ambiance (The world is enjoyable to explore). Crafting (Generic, but solid here in scope and application). Survival Mechanics (Food/Drink and health are balanced decently so your not spending 90% of your time looking for food/drink). Loot (varied enough for what is available now).

Cons - AI/NPC Combat (It really is just as bad as all the vids make it out to be). Very Limited Vendor/NPC interactions. Lack of anything resembling a story line. 

Does this game need polish, bug fixes, QoL improvements, etc.? You bet it does, but what it offers in Early Access is a solid entry into the genre with its own unique take. I mean, if you liked Raft, Scum and/or the movie Waterworld...then this is the game to play and support going into the future. The roadmap is ROBUST, to say the least (No way they are getting to ALL of it...more like 60% of it would be considered a 'Home Run' in development terms) and SO FAR, the Dev team is responsive, active and willing to listen.

Big things, like every single POI being a custom designed map. Many needing a different strategy and pace. There's no CoD way of blowing thru these mobs, lol. 
Also that the key resources are not flowing into your pockets like rain. Makes you think, plan, pace, and work for the rewards. 
Cool little things like, the water level showing in the distiller, the analog dial gauge on the air pump, the subtle way each of the boats handles differently similar to irl.  
It's all really cool forethought, they've done a great job!

- more recipes for cooking
- change the colour of discovered places once you've taken 100% of the resources
- make trophy objects moveable!
- make structures upgradable instead of dismantling everything and starting over
- make walls/barricades ""snap"" to each other

5out of all the things that I like about the game, my favourite thing has to be how the sprint works.
If you tap the sprint button it acts like a toggle to sprint, but if you hold the sprint button it's like a hold to sprint.
I think this is (in my opinion) the best way to implement the sprint action.
And maybe the crouch as well now I think about it.

The only issue I have is the ""loot all"" key not being it's own thing, I've accidentally clicked E to exit a container only to have everything spill onto the floor, maybe have it so you cannot take any more items if your inventory is full?

One thing I can think of is I'd like a more granular key binding menu.
Maybe as a sub menu of the already existing one?
I.E. In ""Primary interaction"" the overall key could be whatever the default is, but you can click a dropdown menu for all the actions it relates to and change specific ones to something else.

Me and my girlfriend played the game for 15 hours in total, and I do have to mention that we didn't rush anything, just a casual, slow play. After the whole 15 hours of playing, we already finished up with the 4th stage of research table. We are kinda disappointed with how only 2 useful things unlocked at the very last part, and since it's the end game stage, we though we will unlock something much greater. I think we shouldn't be able to unlock the last stage so quickly.

After that, everything kinda fell off. We both didn't feel the need of playing the game anymore, since we knew there is nothing else to unlock, so why go further? We already had pretty much everything. 

Now to be a bit positive on the game. We loved the experience this game provides, raiding bases, collecting loot, trading, and the whole concept of having 50/50 land and underwater ruins to explore is such a great idea. We love this game, and we will return. I know it's early access, and that's the reason I will give positive review but there should be a lot of improvement, and I hope that devs will not quit on this game. 

The game is lacking content, even tho you have a lot to explore, you can end the game quickly. Guns are fine but enemies weapons are always stronger, and for some reason I need 3 headshot hits to kill Marauders, with the strongest sniper riffle! That didn't feel good at all but again, it's challenging. 

Loot respawn (more often) wouldn't hurt, or at least to have it as an option when you're creating the game. 
Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone that loves crafting, base building, exploring, guns, and looting. It's really a great game experience. Just don't expect much content inside, and after some time, you will ask yourself ""What's the point?"" and eventually, quit. 

Hopefully this helps! and to the developers, nice job, keep it up, i'll be watching for some new upcoming updates. Looking forward for more content.",1696364612,1696364612,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,1,True,False,True

1. being able to decorate pre-existing buildings. i don't like how there are so many beautiful buildings and outposts that you can't really use because you can only build on player-made foundations and floors

2. reduce the enemy accuracy during the night or in the dark. whenever it gets dark i cannot see them at all, yet they can hit every single shot at me with no issues which bothers me.

3. i would love more decorations and stuff for the buildings in general, like wider windows. because as of writing this review there are only windows that are small bathroom-like windows, and a whole wall of glass. so more window variations would be lovely

4. seeing as there's a thing called ""fine wood"" as opposed to normal wood in the game. i feel like it would be cool if you could make fine wood foundations, floors, walls, etc. so that advanced players can have a bit more class in their base. 

5. speaking of base materials, i think concrete or cement walls, floors, etc would be the next logical step to base building and defense

6. there is no such thing as reinforced metal floors yet in the game, only foundations so far.

Pros: 
-Good concept, i love the waterworld idea, it's something different than the other survival games out.
-A.I. isn't the same every ranged or melee attacker you come across. Varying from hands to clubs, from crossbows to rifles.
-Resource management is nice, not eating 20 food items just to get hunger back up.
-Crafting is pretty straightforward and not difficult to grasp.
-Most materials are common enough, and more rare materials aren't that hard to find.
-Some of the more necessary things such as paddle boat aren't that hard to get materials and make.
-For the most part structures snap together pretty well.
-Graphics look pretty well considering.

Cons:
-Diving up and down(although i'm sure this is for early game) for resources gets redundant pretty quick.
-Food, so you don't need 20 foodstuffs for hunger, but for healing you need quite a bit as heal items seem pretty scarce.
-A.I. raids IMMEDIATELY destroy anything and everything in seemingly record time, and you MUST have walls and ALWAYS go to defend, no matter how far you are, period.
-Research then build, mats to unlock, mats to make, LOT of materials required.
-Building is off on a few things, i.e. roofing somehow doesn't match up correctly to build? ladders/stairs are one size, that's it.
-Building health, definitely too low considering most of the time even if I was at the base from start of A.I. raid, they go DIRECTLY to destroying my stuff, why?
-Cannot upgrade from wood to metal, nor reinforce or upgrade existing wood or metal, considering A.I. 75% of the time drawn to structures, why not have this?
-Hitboxes(both for yourself and A.I.) seems wonky, best I can describe it, sometimes hit nearby objects, sometimes i don't, sometimes getting hit from pretty far (not a varying attack pattern issue), sometimes not.

 The best I can say for this game at the moment. So the overall game isn't that bad and compared to a lot of early access games price for what you get. If you want a new take on a survival game for relatively cheap, not a bad way to go, this is pretty good. However, its got some issues. Found dealing with A.I. early game is quite a nuisance.

Side note: not sure if its my TV or settings, but definitely had some screen tearing issues in the middle of my screen horizontally, just seemed to be a constant thing, don't know why. PC has good specs, more than enough for this.",1696285230,1696285288,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Honestly the looks as a whole arn't bad for this game being young the graphics are nice some moments when the sun sets or rises really shows that.
cooking food mid/late game is okay simple enough to understand yet hard enough to gather whats needed,
 I found around the 8hr of game play time you'll be at a stage of most things either unlocked or gather with little motivation to go further. 

the combat is alright needs a few adjustments in the manner of AI movement being static and not really moving at all in some cases and the way they track and target the player/players seems cluncky for now.

i enjoy the base building and capture of islands very nice idea,
 needs a little work on the base building but for now its okay.

the amount of traders and the items/loot they sell isn't great needs work for sure.
and upgrading boats is kinda meh. Yes they go faster and hold more people and look better, However the storage does not change its the same size across all boats making them useless vs the amount of time and items needed to make them.

being a game thats mostly ocean styled youd think a weapon to use other than melee would be given however that is not the case ive seen so far only melee is used making it difficult at times when more then 1 enemy goes for you under the waves.

Overall, the game itself is a cool concept. It boasts a broad concept and a real good crack at it at that.
Open world esk, sea-survival with elements of factions and PVE action, along side wildlife. Free-style building with little to no restrictions on where you can build and hold up against the enemies as you progress.

Progression is a slow but manageable pace, loot pools being a mix of good and basic items allows for some really good pulls early on if you are lucky. Overall the simplicity is what makes it fun, it doesn't require a vast extensive knowledge to get the hang of the game in a short time.

I hope the infinite generation comes to fruition, at the time of writing this 10/1/23 still Isn't a thing just yet.
But with loot respawns and stuff it makes exploring worth and even if its fully explored you have a chance to re-get loot.

Controller support is huge, not a controller player, but I have some homies who are, and its nice to have a game that supports both.

The Cons:
Well as with any early access game there is going to be cons, at the moment its mostly weird bugs for me, but overall the rest of the game is pretty smooth with a few weird hitches here and there.

Most noteable bugs being, some buildable objects act as ladders on the corner allowing you to climb up it, including NPCs. 

Demolition hitboxes for objects and where your actually looking is abit skewed and doesnt exactly demo what you want. 

Some of the defense objects don't damage npcs, wall-spikes not always working.

But honestly other than that its been a pretty nice time, id give it an 8/10 overall. Worth the 20$ if you have some time and money to spare.",1696223918,1696223918,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I recently had the opportunity to play Sunkenland, and I must say it's a truly exceptional game that left me thoroughly impressed. From the moment I started playing, I was captivated by its immersive world and engaging gameplay. Here are some of the reasons why I would give Sunkenland a positive review:

Stunning Graphics and Artwork: Sunkenland boasts breathtaking visuals and artwork. The attention to detail in the game's design, from the lush landscapes to the intricately crafted characters, is simply outstanding. It creates a visually immersive experience that draws you into the game's world.

Immersive Storyline: The game's storyline is both intriguing and captivating. It offers a unique and imaginative narrative that kept me hooked throughout my playtime. The lore and backstory of Sunkenland are rich and well-developed, making me feel like I was part of an epic adventure.

Diverse Gameplay: Sunkenland offers a variety of gameplay elements that keep things fresh and exciting. From exploration and puzzle-solving to intense battles and strategic decision-making, there's always something new to discover. The game's mechanics are well-balanced and intuitive, making it accessible to both casual and hardcore gamers.

Character Development: The characters in Sunkenland are well-crafted with distinct personalities and motivations. As you progress through the game, you'll become emotionally invested in their stories and relationships, adding an extra layer of depth to the overall experience.

Spectacular Soundtrack: The game's soundtrack is a masterpiece in itself. The music perfectly complements the atmosphere and enhances the emotional impact of the game. It's evident that a lot of care went into selecting the right music for each scene.

Innovative World-building: Sunkenland introduces players to a world that is both familiar and uniquely different. The concept of a sunken land inhabited by diverse civilizations is both fascinating and thought-provoking. Exploring this world and uncovering its secrets was a true pleasure.

Community Engagement: The developers of Sunkenland have shown a commitment to engaging with their player community. They actively listen to feedback and release regular updates and patches to improve the game. This dedication to the player base enhances the overall experience.

Replayability: Sunkenland offers multiple paths, choices, and outcomes, which encourages replayability. It's exciting to see how different decisions can lead to varied consequences, making each playthrough a unique adventure.

In conclusion, Sunkenland is a must-play game for anyone who appreciates top-notch storytelling, stunning visuals, and immersive gameplay. It's evident that the developers poured their hearts and souls into creating this masterpiece, and the result is a gaming experience that stands out in the industry. I can't wait to see what the future holds for Sunkenland and eagerly anticipate any expansions or sequels that may come our way.

All saves are overwritten and you cannot create separate saves.  What this means effectively is that you cannot save your game and ""experiment"" to see if something works.  There are no tutorials and many aspects of the game are not intuitive... so you end up wasting a lot of time and resources.  Base building is especially frustrating in this regard.   ---> ...after reading some other comments, this game is meant to be co-op, so single players beware.

First thoughts, just under two hours... I have not run into any game ending bugs yet.

The game seems to run well enough, and I'm looking forward to experiencing more of what the game has to offer.  If the developers continue to improve the game, I'm sure I'll be able to sink many hours into the game.  There are a lot of superficial changes that need to be implemented (for example, the way one creates a new game or loads into an existing one is not clear, quite confusing actually.)  The development path and base construction is not explained, so if you're like me you will want to ""explore"" the mechanics a bit before creating a new, ""serious"" play through. 

Overall, I'd say it's well worth the price based on my experience so far.  If the game continues to develop and expand, I'm sure it will be a fan favorite.  After I have a decent grasp on the game play arc, I'll update my review.

SAVED GAME NOTE: I purposefully exited and re-entered (save testing) a couple different games, because the ""negative"" reviews thus far seemed to indicate a problem with losing items/loot.  Initially, I attempted to use the two, loot-able containers at the spawn point.  I lost a number of items (I think it was mainly ""special/rare"" items and not basic construction materials) upon reentering the game after I save/exited.  I retried this process on a new game (different specific items looted) and this time built my storage and allowed the two, loot-able containers to destruct by taking all items out of them.

Game is basically 7 days, raft and stranded deep

1) The waves which come sometimes are turbo weak
2) AI is super boring to fight against 
3) some Bugs (for example: when you have full inventory and craft an item its duplicated)
4) we legit spend 95 percent on the surface. There is no point in exploring under the surface since there is no useful loot or anything

The map is HUGE with a lot of varied locations. I very much enjoy raiding and taking over those locations, then finding different ways to take advantage of the existing base / location to build my own base. 

Hey, this game is FUN! The building mechanics are great, and you can get a base going very quickly. I like how the enemies will raid on occasion, and that they get tougher to defeat as you build your base up and play longer. 

The crafting tree is very deep, with a good variety of building materials, parts, weapons, armor, food, appliances, workbenches, etc. 

Only issue I have had is respawning under my bed a couple times. I had to either wait to starve and die or break the structure that the bed was placed on. 

Some areas where there is room for improvement - though keep in mind, this game is in early access: 

- Enemies can seem a bit repetitive
- I do think enemies should either drop full weapons OR have them stored in a safe after you clear a base/island
- I am looking forward to the addition of missions / tasks other than kill / loot only 
- I would love to see magnified scopes for the rifles at some point :)

Needs Improvement:
-- Enemy AI!!!! This is probably the most broken part of the game currently. With enemies set to Hard difficulty, I have experienced enemies phasing through walls to deliver a shotgun blast to the face or gain super-speed out of nowhere.
ALSO: Enemies are way too deaf when it comes to gunshots. Please add more enemy awareness when shots are being fired around them.

-- Hitboxes: There are hitboxes all over the map that are completely, infuriatingly screwed up. There seem to be random, invisible hitboxes all over enemy islands/fortresses that intercept my bullets which should have hit the enemy square in the head. To add to the frustration, the enemies seem to be aware of where these invisible walls are, giving them a distinct advantage.

-- Add another trader with better stuff on the outskirts of the map PLEASE

-- Cross-hair alignment on some guns is very wonky

-- Allow more than one piece of ore to be put into a furnace at once

The good:
-- A decent amount of progression is available to unlock higher tier workbenches, allowing better items and weapons to be crafted. Raiding islands on the outskirts of the map is essential for getting end-game tier loot.

-- Enemy AI actually has a few positives: 1) Taking cover when you are sniping them from a distance and forcing you to push them. 2) Rotating positions after killing you so you have no idea where the same enemies are going to be hiding

-- High tier weapons feel very rewarding when you are able to craft them

-- The map is interesting and fun to explore and the raid-able islands/rafts have a ton of variety

-- Lots of options of craft-able boats for traveling long distances with extra storage",1696189470,1696189569,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Pros: 
[*]The customizing is excellent.  Having the ability to rotate, overlay, and all the different decorative and useful items keeps the possibilities very open regarding making your fort feel like your own.  
[*]I've been playing for 11 hours and haven't broken a single tool so that's seriously helpful considering how much materials everything eats up
[*]The graphics and sound are really realistic right up to the rocking of your boat and the stomping of your feet on metal or wood
[*]I don't lose my tools when I die either, sure my crap I'm carrying gets dropped but it's in a nice neat baggie waiting for me to come get it even if I turn tail and run for a couple hours, but my tools never abandon me and that's very comforting
[*] The hunger / thirst bars don't feel very time consuming or draining and are easy to fill back up when my character is finally starving to death
[*] Claiming islands so I know where it's safe to tree farm
[*] Freaking adorable decorations
[*]Being able to play alone; always a huge positive in any game I play

Cons: 
[*] Sometimes my swing action and my jump action don't work.  I have to close out of the tool I'm trying to use and re-grab it again for the swinging to work again.  The jumping is random I just keep hitting the space bar until my character decides to jump again
[*] Sharks being able to swim through walls/ceilings/floors and bite my ass..not cool
[*] The villains with the guns are pretty sweaty and kill me in two shots.  I'm patient though and will keep coming back until I've beaten them into a pulp 
[*] There's no way to just move things without breaking them.  I just want to move the rubber duck..I don't want to break him I just want him in my tool room.

Pro/Con? 
[*] Being able to get loot through walls, super helpful and makes me feel sneaky
[*] Random Respawn, I get it's random but do I really have to be chucked 10 miles from where I was?  Sometimes helpful mostly time consuming
[*]The stupid lady at the Trading Floating Island..Trading Island is awesome, Trading Lady is super greedy.  I'm pretty sure my diamond ring is worth more then your paint blueprint MARTHA!

I think the concept is great and it has amazing potential.  It is VERY rough right now.  It has things to build that the ingredients do not actually exist in the game. I fully expect that to change because the developers appear to be  really working and addressing the problems that come up.  It does needs an incredible amount of polish and development.  And to be honest I do not think at this point it is worth more than the $15 I paid.  However if they keep up with the potential this game has I think it would be worth a lot more. (I could see it at $45 + one day).  On the other side I have seen lots of games end up in ea development hell so the commitment by the makers is going to be the deciding factor.  I think that I own almost all of the survival/craft games that Steam offers and I think this has some of the best potential of them all.  Right now it's so rough that it could go ether way.

[ The graphical side of this game actually is very surprising, I enjoyed the look of it and it was appealing. However very demanding on the system requirements obviously to have a more enjoyable experience with a 1080p or below I would suggest lower settings. Building structures are missing the 'wow' factor, there's no true desire to capturing one of the raider islands. No vibrancy, nothing drawing you to build your camp on that island. Very lack luster. ]

☑ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboard's
☐ Isnt necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You‘ll need a second life for grinding

[ The game in it's current state is very easy to complete in the sense of taking over all islands, 
the feeling for more is always at rise. Unfortunately with that being said more islands, larger maps or map pools and dedicated servers are needed for this game to actually pop. 
Currently you need to Host a server to play with your friends, your game saves aren't transferable or shared with your friends. 
So you have to host for anyone to advance, servers really need to be implemented into the game to make a better experience.

(Obviously this is subject due to currently being in BETA there is always room for a much larger pool of spawns or islands)

☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☑ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
☐ Fallout 76


[ You can loot through walls, buildings and more.. Multi different ways to duplicate items and more.. game is currently broken in that aspect as it can be very easily abused, this needs to be fixed ASAP. (Developers please contact me if you want to take action, we know you read reviews) ]

[ Loot crates need to be re-coded and or designed better. When looking at a crate we should not be able to view the crate behind, below or above only the one selected. Maybe an outline tool that overlays the box you are hovering over that works more efficiently to the box you're selecting instead of an outline?. Personally I don't think the code that is implemented for it currently is selecting the correct route due to seeing more of the same variable on the one square? making stacked boxes virtually unable to be used correctly within small space. Can we have this one fixed as soon as possible, a slice of life thing for sure but for the players out there that really like to design their worlds this would really let down the appeal of it. ]

🥂---{Overall}---🥂
☐ It's so bad 😢
☐ Ehh 🥱
☐ Oh yeah 🙂
☑ Not too shabby 😎
☐ Yes baby Jesus 🥳


BETA:

Currently there is no real 'server' to join and meet other players, you will need to join off your hosted friends or create your own and or host. 

This game has many features at it's base, it is very enjoyable to grind but you are left feeling like more is needed. 

I think this game has a lot of potential to be greater with some fixes and expansion. 

I think it is worth while playing currently to see what sort of evolution this game will have, however this will also heavily depend on the team making sure things are fixed and sourced. 

If you really enjoy a survival game this can be for you, it's different and I hope that aspect is kept of the game. 

Look, Honestly with friends this game is a blast. It's very pleasant, I would suggest this game given the issues at hand but its in beta and that's to be expected :)

Update: I have found this game plays quite well on Steam Deck too!

I must say I am quite pleased with this game so far, sure it is not perfect, but it has a decent amount of content for the current price and I am enjoying it.

Pro`s:
-Decent amount of content
-Appears to be a decent amount of blueprints to learn
-Combat is simple but fun
-Good base building 
-Small boats to bigger faster boats in game to learn and craft
-Good variety of weapons
-Attacking neighbouring islands is fun and sometimes challenging (yet rewarding).
-Graphics are pretty decent (remind me of rust)
-Good focus on PVE

Cons:
-Mobs randomly spawn on your island around your base (it would be better if they could be seen swimming/boating across to you)
-AI is a bit dumb (gunners will move around to make for harder targets, but not smartly)
-Melee combat is a bit clunky
-Bed time is confusing, I really can not work out how the game determines when you can go to bed (often says not bedtime even when your character is exhausted)
-You kill decent armed enemy's but rarely get weapons from them even though you can see them (should be in their inventory even if broken)
-Map size seems limited (my guess not proceduraly generated)
-Enemy's can cause a lot more damage to you than you do to them (even with scrap armour on)
-I would love to see sea combat

The game runs well on my gaming latop with RTX 3080, Ryzen 5900HS, 32GB Ram at 1440p, even for long periods into the hours. Considering its an initial release into Early Access, they have gotten off to a strong start, more work to be done regarding content, balancing and some graphic tweaking, but well done so far.

I look forward to further updates and will update my review accordingly. Right now I give it a thumbs up. Also there are always people who jump into any survival game then immediately jump on the make it PVP wagon, personally I don't do online or PVP, so I would prefer them to focus more on PVE and add PVP when they are fleshed out on content.",1693086847,1696068704,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

However in its current state the game is rather raw. The key points that from my perspective should be developed, fine-tuned or completely overhauled are:

1. Game progression and difficulty. Once you get your hands on a decent ammo gun (Deagle in my case), which happens quite early and easily, you can just steamroll through whatever content this game has to offer. You just exploit poor enemy AI and underworked level designs to acquire best gear and blueprints. So as it happens rather soon, there is no actual point in grinding further (unless you want to wipe clean every monument)

2. Rock climbing supreme. Right now you can literally climb up vertical surfaces with no issues or penalties. In some cases its fine, but in other it kills the joy. For example, it seems that the Twin Rock monument was designed to slowly climb up the structures, killing enemies from disadvantageous positions to acquire best gear at the very top. In reality you just dock your boat from either side and hit spacebar 3-5 times to reach the very peak.

3. As developers chose this particular scavenging/engineering context, there should be way more encounters and events that make this aspect fun and engaging. On the one hand, partial loot respawn at the monuments is great. On the other hand, there should be way more things to do in this context. Rust or Mechagon Island@World of Warcraft could be used as a reference in some way. Dynamic sea fights, NPC raids on player's base are only a tiny morsel of what could be introduced.

4. Level and map logistics. So far the Sunkenland world feels quite small. Even the Tier 1 sailboat can bring you to the opposite side of the map in a matter of minutes, not to mention faster upgrades. For a sea-themed game it is a disadvantage as you don't get to engage in combatting acts of nature or simply encounter so many things that could happen to player in the open water. The current content could amount for maybe 1/16 of potential that the game carriers. One solution could be to introduce procedural generation which immensely enriches gameplay, but this agains gravitates towards Rustlike-context. Another solution is to introduce new and more mechanics inside monuments (long diving session inside a pipe @ Unknown Ruins is both exciting, challenging (at early stage) and rewarding as it gives you top-tier components). Additionally, it might be advisable to go for partial procedural generation of sea bottom that, depending on game session could uncover or hide different parts of the same monument. It would reward returning players with new experiences and loot in the same setting.

5. A lil bit of everything.
- At certain points object animation reminds of the Sims 1 (water level @ advanced water purifier, every lever, oxygen level indicator, water scooter screen, recycler, timber workshop etc etc)
- Shooting is fine and fun (works well for me)
- Crafting is great, but it needs more tuning in terms of blueprint progression (etc you might want to introduce add-on upgrades for weapons, armor, utility objects), quantity of useful BPs (not decorative ones) and it maybe should be more aligned with game progression (I found it hard to upgrade to T4 as it required gears which I haven't encountered while being able to upgrade to T3 with no problem)
- Enemy AI is somewhere in mid-2000s
- Electricity is rudimentary
- Recycling could be more useful than in its current state. Why not allow recycling decorative items, for instance?
- Building needs upgrade options in case you want to finally strengthen your wooden foundation. Additionally, various building blocks should automatically match each other just as foundations do. If you ever tried to attach a half of stairway to the wall, you know how disappointing it feels.
- Replayability. I played 20ish hours in a single world, so am not sure about this, but random spawn on a random entry-level island could help the game with replayability. Starting off at the same place, only to commute to the same handful of monuments of the same design in the same vicinity won't help to retain players.

Anyway, I'm thrilled to see how Sunkenland develops further. Developers surely put their hearts in what they do, and that's priceless. Best of luck!",1696014333,1696014598,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

I love the game. i haven't even explored 60% of the map and I've got all research learned and a pretty good weapon/armor setup.

But from what I've seen mobs don't respawn so once gone , they're gone. aside from the ones that occasionally attack your base. I would like to see a mob respawn.

Here's some idea's to improve the game:
- Make enemies more aware and challenging 
- Create an endgame that is repayable
- Allow the enemies to retake their islands over time
- More items in general
- Increase enemy difficulty scaled to how many players are on the server
- Fix the bullet drop off and bullet registration on modern guns (I shoot directly where the sight is aimed but shots miss at close to medium range)
- More ways to create bio fuel instead of only using chemicals (maybe let us use plants too)
- Reduce grenade damage (grenades are extremely OP and allowed me to clear whole islands effortlessly)

At least underwater when i get stuck i can drown, but when i get stuck on land i have to wait forever to die of starvation and thirst.
Until they either make sure getting stuck is not a thing, they give a command to ""unstuck"" yourself or unless login/logout will make sure you are not stuck.
I advise anyone else to avoid this game , its just going to drive you crazy with the amount of times you need to sit around to die because the developers are NOT addressing this issue.

my suggestion that would bring this game next level. 

think grand theft auto san andreas and the gang territory system. we already have to put flags down to build on places/islands we conquer. raids already happen at said places (granted, so far only places the player is located). why not have them fight eachother even? conquer the map? i guess mount & blade would be a good example too. each faction has a main staple that can respawn enemies maybe? or they just simply respawn in a time frame inside territory. whatever it may be. we need respawning enemies and a end goal to continue playing. at the moment your about 10-12 bases/islands from building everything. may not have all blueprint, but your basically done. max armor. best weapons. tons of ammo, health, bandages, etc..",1695914979,1695914979,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

I write this review at:
- explored 60% of map
- thanks to little exploit we have 100% of tech progress (in real we would be in +- 50% i explain later)

My rating:
- 10/10 overall feeling, joy and fun 
- 8/10 with bugs (its in develpoment, keep in mind)
- 7/10 with imbalance (its in develpoment, keep in mind)


For compare i would rate simmilar games
- RAFT -> 10/10
- Green Hell -> 9/10
- Rust -> 7/10 

About game:
A) graphics -> I love it but this is very personal, better check some screens / videos
B) game mechanics -> overall very good
C) game breaking bugs-> I found none, just some minor problems
D) minibugs -> its 1 month old game, in active develpoment so, yes there are many minor bugs, but nothing serious.
E) Discord community: Mostly mature and friendly, you can ask in game-questions chat and you will get answer in matter of seconds. 
F) game is mix of raft and rust and multiple other games, in a good way.

Some problems:
1. Lot of items are useless
2. Lot of items are overpowered
3. Graphic glitches, invisible walls non and destroyable objects marked as destroyable
4. Grind Lock tech progress. Advanced gears are needed for last tech progress and for best boats. However its very rare loot and i had feeling that till i will have enough materials it will be end of the game exploration, which i do not like :D Therfore there is a current known exploit, where you can open loot box and pick all but 1 item and than save server and run it again all items in not fully looted boxes will respawn. (Prolly work on coop only). Its basicaly single player so you will cheat only yourself.

Advice to begining:
A. Go for coop server and use password so you can play solo and enjoy some nice exploits :D
B. Go for hard enemies and put population on high too, no point go for easy.
C. Disable raids till you understand basics. Many bad reviews are because of something you can diasble on begining, you can enable it later when you are ready.",1695841941,1695909939,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

The game runs smoothly and I had no major issue with it. The only possible bug I found was that the rubber duck (and possibly other items) I found in the castaway island got lost after I dropped it to save inventory space for another quick dive into the ocean (maybe it clipped?). Also, even thought I did not change any key mapping, the game instructs me to press the ""F"" key to add wood in the bonfire when the correct key is actually ""C"".
At this stage, it is noticeable that the game is still struggling to balance the multiplayer and single player experiences - as a single player gamer, I found the starting menu confusing at times (it is odd that I have to press ""create game"" when resuming a saved game) and see no point in having a re-spawn timer when I am the only player.
This said, the remaining comments are written strictly from a single player perspective.
I know that the developers are now working on expanding the in-game lore, which would greatly improve immersion into this world. However, some other things might also help in this respect. I personally found the map to be densely packed. Given that this seems to be a post-apocalyptic world, it is odd to see so many islands, outposts, boats, rafts, etc, just by scanning the horizon. I know that in a game of this nature it is hard to find the right balance between a lived world (that the players could explore) and a desolate scenario (with the risk that the player feels bored); but at this stage, I would welcome a little bit more of the latter: maybe by spacing the islands and surface points of interest a bit more and having more sunken structures in-between (keeping those parts of the ruins that rise above water - those are great and really effective in enticing the player).
One other thing that would greatly improve immersion would be to let players explore the map by themselves, without providing from the beginning any clues as to where things are - currently, we are given a map with all the points of interest already marked, which makes the exploration part less enjoyable and something more akin to having a checklist of to-do stuff. Having a compass (even if it is something we must find, like the binoculars) would also add to the exploration side of the game.
In terms of interaction with the world, I would love to feel more diverse threats. Currently, and apart from the occasional mutant raids and the sharks, the world offers little challenges - it would be cool to have random weather events (rain, fog, storms, etc) and maybe some aquatic monsters here and there (like morays, whales and giant squids and/or even some new species which evolved/mutated in this water world).
Finally, I would appreciate some options for having some kind of mobile bases - for example, slightly bigger boats with space for customisation (building small structures and assets like simple grills and storage boxes).

Sunkenland is all about combat (and not just with sharks and crabs). Maps are populated by several enemy factions, each of which control several islands with resources you will need to progress, and who will occasionally raid your base (assuming you leave raids enabled in the settings). Very quickly you will progress from melee weapons to crossbows, to single-shot black powder firearms, and then fairly quickly onto modern firearms.

Multiplayer is (to me) very important for this game, as most of the boats (and the helicopter) are meant for more than one person, and having one or more gunners to fire at enemies as you maneuver around an island or outpost is a *massive* advantage.

Sunkenland is not light on the survival elements, but it is also not fighting you like some other games in this genre are *cough* Stranded Deep *cough* (which, to be clear, is also an amazing game). The game wants you to live... long enough for some mutated remnant of a person to kill you with a club. You can't just *ignore* food and water needs, but you won't be eating a 10-pound salmon every 5 minutes just to break even with hunger loss like many over-the-top survival games have you doing.

All in all, an excellent and unique addition to the genre!

Good graphics. Not boring - lots of underwater variety. 
I wish Subnautica had as many as 1% of these weapons. must kill!
Surprisingly good loot tables.
AI players are not too overpowered and one-shotting you like some games.
Sharks, but not too many.
combination between loot and craftable items seems well thought-out.
Food and water needs have good balance.
death poses when enemies die in water are funny.
each region shows a % on the map to show how much has been looted.

cons:
-Wish there were a minimap so you can see your friends and enemies on bottom-right mini map.
-hitboxes and swinging feedback don't seem finished yet - ie.) you swing and aren't sure if it's a hit.
It's definitely not a deal breaker, but probably something still being worked on.
-i kinda wish you got 100% of your resources back when you break structures down, but it's a typical mechanic. There might be an option later on for reducing  when starting a map.

Progression level so far:
6 hours in on a multiplayer map.
Up to crossbows so far.
Have not found a trader yet.
On level 2 out of 4 research progression.

We as always are very skeptical on our games and normally have a hard time finding one that we both like and can stand together. While this game is still early access and not finished, we both rather enjoy our time playing. I am deathly afraid of the water and yet still find myself wanting nothing more than to venture the sunken houses and sail the vast open ocean looting. I'm sure there are many ideas and plans for this game and I can't wait to watch it unfold. I hope to see more of a raft house in the future if possible or the bigger boats in game to have mass storage as that is the only problem we face right now. I think having a small raft house would be ideal especially as the game mostly revolves around looting the sunken houses and monuments. I would also love to have more items added to the house for looting. They have decent loot for a solo player, but I feel that with as open and  spaced out everything is we could use a tad loot increase or items in the house to loot... overall I am very pleased with this game even for what little is out, I can see this game hopefully taking off the more its added onto!

Obviously, this is a very early alpha. There's a lot to be added and even more to be refined. But what's there already has entertained me for ~30 hours so it's already excellent value for money.  I expect to be playing it for ~20 more hours and then putting it aside to wait for updates. Maybe fiddling with my base or my garden sometimes between updates.

Sunkenland is a PvE survival and base building game with some AI enemies in some POIs and an optional tower defence component. It's a bit rough so far, especially in base building. Base building is functional, but relatively limited in building pieces and a bit cumbersome in some aspects. But it works and it's better than might be expected from a very early alpha. There's farming, fishing, decorating, cooking...the usual stuff. A bit rough so far, but it is a very early alpha. There isn't any lore or story yet. It's a very early alpha. I can't stress that enough. 

What sets it apart from other games of the same genre that I've played is the aquatic element. There's been catastrophic flooding in the gameworld and the remaining land is small islands that used to be hilltops. So a large proportion of scavenging involves diving and swimming. That part is implemented very well. That part is pretty much in a release state despite the game as a whole being a very early alpha. It makes scavving distinctly different to most games of this genre. There's a well made sense of buoyancy and freedom of movement in 3 dimensions and it adds in the factor of air supply. Initially you're limited to freediving. As you progress you can make crude SCUBA gear and an air tank refilling station, so you can dive deeper and for longer.

The core's there and the game is definitely very playable despite being such an early alpha. The dev is currently very active, focusing on bugfixes but also adding some stuff. The intention is to increase the pace of adding new stuff as bugs are ironed out. 

Overall, I'd recommend the game even though it's currently very early alpha, v0.1.40. Just be aware that it is a very early alpha. Many things are incomplete or don't yet exist at all. Things will change. There will be bugs (particularly in multiplayer).  Performance is not what it could be. But the core is there and it's in a playable state already and it has some novel aspects that distinguish it from other games in the genre.

I play this in single player mode and its enjoyable. Plenty to explore, do things at your own pace. Combat is a bit tricky at first, particuarly in singleplayer as normally any bases you attack you are on your own; and more difficult when yours is attacked. You have to get very creative in how you build your base to stop being looted.

There isn't a story as yet that I can see, its more about survival, exploring, upgrading and basically having fun. Its not too challenging a game but quite addictive. 

Shootouts/combat can be quite difficult, particularly if you are attacking from a boat and your enemy is constantly moving. 

Its in a very playable condition now, so be interesting to see what happens in the future. If they decide to improve on some of the graphics, that would be good.

Sunkenland has the potential to stand out and do something different and unique. Im 45 hours in and have completed and unlocked almost everything the current early access version has to offer. 

This list below is a mix of suggestions, bugs and items from my time so far playing.

- The concept of NPC raids is fun and a good idea that needs a lot of expanding upon. Its very basic and can be ""cheesed"" with clever base building at the moment. Maybe adding inter tribe raids not just NPC raids against the players. It would be fun to stumble upon 2 factions having a huge island battle against each other. NPC using boats? 
- Once you kill all the NPCs the game suddenly becomes empty, yet you can keep re-looting with no risk. 
- There is minimal incentive to go underwater unless its absolutely necessary. Maybe adding some kind of story elements to discover as well as maybe adding some extra crafting materials that can only come from underwater for high end items. 
- Theme the under water zones with unique animals/fish for a better scale of zone difficulty. Right now you can just swim everywhere at any time and a knife will defeat anything that even sniffs you.
- Deeper and more floral diverse under water zones, 
- If you drop a currently equipped bag with gear in it, it vanishes and along everything that was in it.
- Better NPC item threat prioritising. Right now you can cheese them into shooting a wall and ignoring more critical player items.
- NPC's stealing player boats? (for the lols)
- Better food, water and oxygen balancing. Right now it feels a little too fast at depleting even if you are standing still.
- Character clothing/armour be shown on select screen. Currently you are just in underwear. (My wife gave me a concerned look)
- Larger crop planters. 
- Weather. Icurus levels of weather would make this game insane! Thunderstorms, rain and dynamic sea conditions etc.",1695799282,1695799282,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Firstly I have never seen a survival game reward a player's time so little. I have seen many people say they don't want the game balance to be too easy to gather resources, but there also needs to be a better economy for resources to move up to the next tech level. From what I have seen the devs appear to be working on hopefully adding respawnable loot which would definitely help, but a good example of a current issue is cotton which is supposed to be a way to farm and craft cloth. However, the seeds are apparently either extremely rare and/or unable to be gained from farming it on the farm plots which defeats the purpose of farming and having a renewable source of cloth on/in your base like wood and food.

Hopefully new music gets added to the game because hearing the same 2 music tracks for hours on end gets understandably old. I assume this is a product of early access and will be updated in time, but for now it is annoying.

Enemies balancing and ai really needs to be looked at. Maybe I've just stepped a little too far outside of where I should be difficulty-wise, but enemies with guns are way too strong for such bad ai. The enemies can see through walls and no with pinpoint accuracy where you are, so, even with armor, you get destroyed in seconds. Plus it seems like every hit causes bleeding which needs a bandage to fix which, in turn, requires cloth to craft leading to the cloth problem I mentioned earlier. Enemies that use guns either need limited ammo or they need some sort of miss chance mechanic. Otherwise, players essentially have to zerg-rush the base over and over to clear it if they happen to be running solo. It's just not a fun experience. 

To summarize, I think there are some definite balance issues that need to be ironed out before I would recommend this to any prospective players. If you want a better experience just play 7 days to die or another survival game as this one needs more time in the oven. Maybe I am just bad at the game currently, so if I somehow find the magic skills, loot, or gear then I may update this later.

Edit 1: As of the latest update, the devs added in cotton seeds dropping from farmed cotton plants which addresses the issue I had with it. However, one addition I wouldn't mind seeing is either a higher drop rate of seeds from the applicable farmable plants or a skill/system that allows the player the ability to up the drop rate of seeds from farms. I also would add that the building system is interesting, but also frustrating at times. Roofs in particular are annoying since I could not figure out how to rotate them to match the other roof tiles I had already placed even with on-screen prompts. I would still say that you should give this game more time to develop before committing to it. It has potential, but it definitely needs more time.",1694120506,1695721814,False,1,0,0.510664999485015869,0,True,False,True

I can now pack up my equipment and move base if I wish. I think something I'd like is for there to be some indication of what level each island is. I've turned off the raiding as I leveled up too quickly and I'm getting smashed with some high level raids. No raids is also less stressful. 

I've cleared all the lower levels (I believe) and would like to go up a tier. I decided to make my base at the trading post as it seems to be the central point. But I'm also making mini bases in different places. 
Someone else said that they had people/mutants take back a post but I haven't seen that happen yet. 

Because I've built my base on the Trading Post, the foundations aren't the same level as the trading post which made things a bit challenging. 

I've also restarted this game several times because I had a better idea and wanted to start from scratch instead of redesigning my entire current setup. Which is why I have 112 hours in but still haven't hit the higher level islands. I'm also playing solo so that has it's own challenges but I prefer playing solo. 

I liked Raft where we went to each island and had to figure out puzzles (all except the last one. Utopia was a pain in the neck and not worth it imo.) 

Sunkenland is more like you're a pirate and need to take over islands and settlements. 

I think the only thing that bugs me about Sunkenland is the daylight/nighttime designation. I want my character to get up early and go to bed early but I still end up sleeping until mid morning in the game and waste daylight. And you can't raid or scavenge at night as your character will freeze to death. And because the day cycles are so short, it's hard to get in a decent amount of scavenging since I have to travel some distance. 
It's a small gripe and there is a work around (scattering mini bases around)

Some of the bugs we have run into within the last 13 hours:

• Duplicating Batteries, one player cannot pick it up because the host and player are not sync'd; the game thinks there is a battery in the charger when the visiting player takes it, duping a battery. We started with 4 batteries, and now have 17.
• Boats like to fly, sometimes, they don't like when you stand on them.
• If a host and visiting player, open a chest at a POI, the loot is different and both players get different loot (maybe intentional?) as long as no one breaks the chest, until all players have looted it.
• Repairing is FREE, F F F F, full armor.
• Red dot / cross hair / iron sights like to bug out, they don't really conform to each other all the time.
• In my opinion, I feel like some weapons are too expensive, 5 iron ingots makes a steel ingot, you need 6 steel ingots to make an ak47.
• Helicopter is worth it and fun, I wish the controls were a little more responsive or sensitive on mouse control. 
• Hive mind AI sucks, the ability to stealth more would be interesting. 
• Items in hot-bar are reserved on death, I abuse this, my friend abuses it. If you die, your gun and ammo are in your inventory, respawn close and go at it again.
• Going completely invisible to visiting players
• Some islands being completely gone for visiting players while being there for me
• You can place most items through walls or through/in other items. (my bed and grill are hanging outside the wall, but I like having my anvil under my work bench)
• ""Enemy Took 32 Damage EHH"" on the top left of screen for hours

Suggestions I have:

Change AI so it's not Hive Mind
• Fix Boats / Helicopter passenger laggy view
• Repairing should come at a cost
• Bosses / Boss Fights to give the GOOD armor a reason
• Fix Red Dot/Iron Sight/Crosshair alignment 
• Less Recoil maybe? 
• More frequent / more challenging raiding from enemies when you're at your base 
• Fix certain keybinds not working (example Light toggle)
• Allow seeds like strawberry, trees, lemon, and cotton to be planted on ground instead of in a planter
• Add support for different sensitives in vehicles, helicopter, boat, scooter
• I WANT A ZIPLINE <3
• A wider variety of aquatic life / More sharks, instead of 3 sharks at a couple of POI's
• Have the trader cycle their shop items / maybe more than 1 trader in the future? (AND LET ME SHOOT HER)
• More uses for charcoal?
• Player name viability through walls or at a distance without looking at map 
• Quests? :o
• Underwater cave systems (I saw something like that in the trailer but have not witnessed first hand)
• Change the way that doors prompt you to close, having to stand in the middle of them close up is annoying but not the end of the world
• Increase grenade throwing distance, they throw like wimps

I do enjoy the game, as does my friend. If more is added I can 100% see myself playing this again after completing it. There is a limit to how much you can explore, how many enemies you can kill, territories you can claim etc, it would be nice to have the world randomly generate for you.

Balance needs work, resource economy could use some balancing, a few minor bugs with object placement and, as regularly mentioned, placed objects need to be repositionable.
Combat is, functional, but currently lacks any weight or oomph, AI is still very basic, incoming damage is a little too high for comfort, but this early on, still working on finding the right balance is expected, and likely won't be settled till after most equipment has been largely implemented.
The few world option settings are basic, but cover the most impact-full and essential aspects.
The gameplay rotation feels unique for reasons I can't quite put my finger on. Obviously it has to do with the emphases on diving, yet it feels more, pleasant, then in, say, Subnautica or Raft for reasons I can't put my finger on.

I love where the developer's heads are at, but my god this game needs expanded and polished.

I wanted this game to be like Subnautica, because Subnautica is one of my absolute favourite games, but this game is not Subnautica. That's fine, neither was Planet Crafter and it turned out great despite the handicap.
That said, from what I understand Subnautica also started out as a buggy, broken mess with very little to do but build and harvest, and that I found it after it had been out for years, had all the rough edges worked off by thousands of gamers just grinding away. This game is not there yet, but it will be at some point, especially if people more interested in grinding then me play. I would love to come back in like 5 years and play a single-player campaign with an interesting story, set in an open world filled with secrets, history, beautiful and terrifying sights, and all ran on a polished game engine with useful mechanics. Please, PLEASE let there be submarines. 
Hopefully that, but I'd also be interested in some kind of Mount & Blade style geopolitical/grand-warfare/logistics-is-what-wins-wars shit, but in Waterworld. Start out as a survivor, figure out how to keep your character fed, get some guns and a boat, start building bases and fleets, and by the end of the game going into battle on a jetski, moving around the battlefield and assigning targets for my Balloon Bombers and fire support Heavy Gunboats, waiting to see if the Demolition Jetboat makes it to the front gate so I know what to with that first squadron of Heavy Jetski Riders.

I've only played for a few hours, but so far, I genuinely enjoy what this game has to offer. Something about it, to me, gives a fresh breath of survival gaming. It has the typical survival elements as most, but I do enjoy the easy grabs underwater, and the challenging loot being on enemy territories. I really enjoy the models used for weapons (I fancy the standard bow using the nail as the sight), items, vehicles, etc. They are super neat in my opinion. The crafting system challenges you to always be exploring into enemy territory to try to find better loot, and more loot than you'd find only small amounts of underwater. Of course, underwater can only give you so much, but there are also some resources you can only find underwater, as well. I love the lore implications of the sunken locations, and can't wait to find out what actually happened in this Sunkenland. 

I don't want to spoil, or make someone feel as if I'm giving tips or tricks, because that's not the case, this is just my personal overview thus far, and I'm far from a pro, or anywhere close to being a good gamer...

 There's obviously some funky jams, being a newer game, i.e sometimes the packing box indicator that lights up when you highlight an item to pack stays on until you relog; or, when you use a flare, another goes into your inventory (or drops if it's full), and it disappears when you put it back on the hotbar;the total number corrects itself when you use the next, but places a 'nonexistent' one back in the inventory. That's no big deal though. I enjoy the enemy AI's tendency to take cover, being constantly moving, and they can pack a punch if you aren't prepared enough. Gotta make those crafting tables to make armor. Although, they can be a little...dumb, for lack of better term, as they tend to focus on the last general area their attention was placed it seems (if they're far away enough), allowing you to move around and get a counter in, barring you don't have others waiting in the shadows to surprise you while doing so. The musical cues are a nice touch, as you aren't always in danger, but the music lets you know you are close to an enemy and may be. I also believe some can respawn, or maybe another takes it's place, if you move far enough away, until an area is 'cleared'. Not a huge fan of their ability to sometimes seemingly be able to see/shoot through objects that you cannot, but that's a small gripe. Although some terrain hit boxes are a little wild, some moments have flustered me as my arrows/bullets are hitting/bouncing off a road piece that I feel like I'm aiming feet above. Again, small gripe. I will continue playing this game as I am having a great time, and I can't wait to see what comes next. The only thing I wish to see, are more threats underwater. Sharks are dangerous, if you let them be. They are easy to deal with, and there's a specific cheese I like to do that allows me to get the shark skin without ever taking a hit, and they could care less. Just kite them out of aggro range, and as they swim back to their patrol location, swim up and bing bang boom, they don't care, and they're dead. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough for sharks to be a problem, but so far, I miss the danger. 

All in all, I love the game so far, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here. I'm sure there are things I've missed, or haven't encountered, but, great game so far.

Edit: I failed to mention the base raids and enemies themselves. I enjoy the ever increasing difficulty of the raids on your base. On top of enemy threats during exploration, having random raids gives you a heightened sense of danger. Do the raids happen whilst your away, or only when you're nearby? Who knows! As the raid enemies can destroy your buildings, this leaves a constant hint of dread, as you traverse the waters. Although most enemies in this game seem to share similar models, from what I've really looked at (being either irradiated beyond repair, or burnt to a crisp from being stuck on open water all the time), it's hard to tell who's who besides seeing the indicator of the location you're raiding yourself. As for the ones that raid your camp, who knows what or why they do it...possibly for the same reason you, yourself, are raiding theirs. It's neat, and I like it a lot.

Also, the trader is a selfish person and I'm not a fan of their attitude when I bring them multiple valuables and they only want to give me 4 electronics...but that's just me being selfish in return :P",1695605954,1695607034,True,1,0,0.509090900421142578,0,True,False,True

Game is currently jank but I have high hopes for it. 
Example: The ""Grab all"" button on chests. It does not check if you have enough space in your inventory, so if your inventory gets filled by an accidental E press, all your shit is going on the floor.
The looting system is ok but I don't want to spend 3 hours getting components just to get a diving mask or something. Literally everything is underwater, I can't have at least a snorkel? So half the gameplay early game is literally gathering one object underwater, resurfacing, then doing it again.

1) I will acknowledge this is Early Access and it has promise.
2) I had no idea until the first raid that I was also dealing with another Zombie Apocalypse trope. *sigh* I was thinking it was more like ""Waterworld"", getting raided by bands of ""Smokers"". Please reconsider the plot and raid mechanics. One Apocalypse is bad enough. It doesn't have to be a Roland Emmerich ""kitchen sink"" disaster movie. *eyeroll*
3) More back story to your Sunkenland would be helpful.
4) There are definitely some clipping graphics issues. Like the quite apparent hole in the sea floor near the starting island where you can swim under the sea bed without any trouble. LOL
5) Please fix sleeping to circadian sleep system with a day/night cycle.
6) I can't put my finger on it, but the building / crafting system seems a little clunky in comparison to other survival games. Something about the two different build menu's.
7) Only 6 Action Keys? Really? Not sure why other survival games limit to 8 when there are 10 number keys, but 6 is definitely not enough.
8) Speaking of Action Keys, what about Key Bindings / Hotkeys? Like the ability to bind F to E instead.

[b]Pro's[/b]
* Good sense of weapon progression similar to rust. You start off with just a handaxe and spear then move up into a crossbow then early primitive firearms until you unlock modern military weapons. The crossbow can still kill even late game enemies, but using a bolt action rifle, and getting headshots is satisfying.
* The gunplay is good. The weapon sounds, hit registration, etc. all feel on point. You have to play tactical because you can't take a lot of hits.
* The tech progression is good, especially from T1-T3. You start off with a small inventory size and limited underwater breathing capacity, but later upgrades allow you to stay underwater longer. Also, each tier of tech adds something new and interesting to the gameplay.
* Exploring the world feels interesting and rewarding. Many of the endgame weapon pieces, crafting components, and blueprints randomly drop across the map. Also, there's a good change in variety between areas so you're never feeling like you're just repeating the same content.
* Base building is good and there's a ton of customizations and decorations you can find in the world or craft yourself. You can really RP out your base.
* Raids are interesting and fun. I have it set to mid difficulty and I get raided pretty infrequently.
* I ran into 0 bugs or crashes.

[b]Con's[/b]
* Building a base can be incredibly time consuming due to how expensive in materials everything is. You can collect a full inventory of wood and scrap and burn through it all just building half your base. It just requires a massive amount of resources to build a small-to-mid sized base.
* Gameplay loop just involves grinding scrap and components that basically gate your endgame progression. To unlock  T4 workbench requires gearing advanced gears and you only get 1-2 of them out of each of the harder areas. The entire endgame is just grinding out advanced gears to finish the rest of your tech.
* AI is primitive, but they said in the roadmap they're working on it.
* I made a female character and I'm getting corsets, high heels, and undergarment drops. That seems so out of place for a survival sim with mutants in a water flooded world.",1695537697,1695537974,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Games great in what it sets out to do, sure its a bit basic, dive-explore-expand-kill-die-respawn-die with you respawning and going to a nearby island just to get shot in the face and sent back to the shadow realm.
Overall love the exploration part of the game despite the world gen being kinda predictable, would love to see more world settings such as loot/enemy/bp/time manipulations and types of enemies(faction control)
I can see the potential of the game going down, even right now id say its well worth the price, future features i could see a dynamic factions world with all the diff facs trying to overtake each other in territory control, more foods more fauna more types of enemies and more types of weaponry(for the love of god pls get grenades for any faction that aint marauders) maybe possibly a world expansion/ inf gen or an upgrade to the trading system with currency, more random events with enemies such as random wandering war parties on a boat that i can lob a grenade into, maybe aerial enemies like a helicopter or a more advance faction that controls military supplies, id love to see a faction defending with mounted lmgs.

I am 31.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.
After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Some suggestions:
I think you should make it so if you complete a base/island raid, however you dont mark the territory with a flag, it respawns everyone in a certain amount of days. This makes the game more replayable without having to start over as you can do the raid again later.
Add a tow rope so you can pull a jet ski or other boat
Fix the loot duplicating issue.. if you leave one item in your dead body bag, you can save and exit and all the stuff that was in there duplicates. This is great for cheesing the system, but it makes it too easy to get ammo etc..
Need to be able to put ceiling in house. The bottom of the roof is ugly.
Need to be able to paint doors.
I would like it if once you installed a rubber wire to the generator, it became invisible... It just looks ugly.

I will start with that it is really annoying that people still put up bad reviews for this game just because THEY STILL THINK YOU CAN'T SAVE THE GAME. Instead of wasting time crying here about not saving they just needed to try CLICK ""CREATE GAME"", if they would do that they would see that your saved server-game is still there even if in lobby your character looks naked. Last time i played on 4th september and already then this worked. In some way this is understandable because somehow developers still didn't fix that after you save a game and log in after that your character displayed naked and you see button ""create game"", i would just rename it to ""load game"" or something like that. Don't get me wrong i know the feel when you can't continue progress on next day, i had similar feeling when i didn't find button ""load game"" on next day, but as my character anyway looked naked i tried to click ""create game"" and it worked.

Unfortunately i played game not that much, because right now i don't really have time to play because of IRL. But i think i made ingame far enough to have some opinion:

After spending a lot of hours at Escape from Tarkov half a year ago, combat in this game feels very primitive, but i don't say it is bad thing, because game is focusing on dynamic fights, looting, exploring, crafting, using vehicles, co-op fights. Though i felt ingame that developers made some stoppage on weapons for a reload, which feels close to real life, also i think some recoil exists too. Melee fight experience was pretty bad and felt like in any other cheap surival game, enemy were dropping through the ground, their movement and hits felt little clumsy, but some of AI is there as enemy try to get to you if you are on a higher ground etc. But as game progress is pretty fast, then once you get to ranged weapons you don't really need melee weapons as even in combat you can run away from enemy strafing and start again fighting with ranged weapons.

OVERALL ABOUT GAME: So it in some way is similar to Valheim. Server for up to 10 players. You can play with friends too as co-op against AI or just against each other. You start at one of the islands where you can make your first homebase. There is not so much grind as in other games, so you progress pretty fast. From the start you already can dive around your island or swim further to other islands or underwater locations. Map in the server is pretty big, so it would be probably fun to play co-op 2v2, 5v5 and similar or FFA. Before creating a map (server) you can use options to set enemy bot difficulty, garrisons, raiding frequency on your base, you can even set that enemy don't raid your base. I don't remember what kind of frequency i did set but enemy raids were every ~3rd day so i had to defend my base. Also enemy quantity was more and more with each raid and also they became stronger and better geared, i think it has something to do with your research table tier upgrades. Worst thing about enemy raid is that they can come at night and if your base don't have good lighting then you have to fight in the dark. I might add that  first time zombie-like enemies came to my base at night, at that point i didn't know that enemies can raid your base. I was doing regular stuff in my ""house"" and i heard strange zombie angry men noises from outside, so i went to check it, it was very dark and i couldn't see a thing because my base at that point had no lighting built. So when i walked out and at some point i noticed silhoutte in front of me it didn't look friendly because it was swinging at me. I almost shit my pants at that point because before this i was chill for 3 days farming around base, thinking i am safe because i am on ISLAND! And now someone is here trying to kill me, the music turned from chill to scary, so as i notice my hp gets lower i run away from him to understand against how many i am dealing, i run to a cliff and watch from above i spotted they are 3 bad guys hitting my house, trying to destroy everything i have built. So i decided to go and kill them. I was crafting a lot for base so i didn't really have any gear, just weapon and high-heel woman boots (that's all i found till then). With all my fear and rage i took in a hand torch to see where is my closest enemy then i switch to melee weapon and kill him, then i took another zombie out, and on last one i remembered that i have campfire next to my base i run to fill it with planks so there's some light,then i finished him off and music turned back to chill. Loot from them was full garbage. Also it is not cool that you don't see health of your base structure items like: walls, doors, building base etc, unless you hold in your hand building hammer. So after the raid you go with it and look on every wall with hamer to see if something needs repair. I think it would be much cooler if you could see HP of wall etc just pointing with your crosshair at it. As soon as you understand how underwater looting works you can pretty fast grind for your first boat or catamaran both of which don't need any gas or fuel. So you can swim around faster to new locations and loot there underwater. Building feels easy but sometimes you have no idea where to farm some of the items, but if you keep exploring and looting eventually you can find it. 
Underwater experience and looting feels amazing, combined with the ingame music. It feels pretty real and ofcourse you need to follow how much oxygen you have left before you swim up to breathe. Expect that you can stuck in the buildings windows underwater and never get free and die when your oxygen is out. 

Compared to other surival games it feels more dynamic as there is not so much hard grind, easier to farm for specific items, easier to build, therefor you can faster start searching for your enemy and start a fights. Not so much thinking about eating and drinking. +there are a lot of items (bottle to drink) to buff yourself like swim longer underwater for a period of time, and also slots for items that buff your character like foot flippers to add permanent speed under water and other similar items.

It still feels a little empty not finished game, but i am sure if you have some friends who can play together for 3-5 hours you can get much fun playing it together co-op vs AI or just against each other.

Too bad price somehow went from 15$ to 20$ in just a few weeks. I mean if your game is at the top in allkeyshop and probably in many other places it's not cool to use it to raise the price.

EDIT 2: I'm happy to see the updated key binding. They are pretty prompt and responsive devs. They listen to what their playerbase wants. Very nice.",1693020870,1695486995,True,0,0,0.452967315912246704,0,True,False,True

in summer weather ... fans blowing away It played well
really enjoyed the game and feel this game will get better with regular FAST updates
new content thats fun bugs fixed fast , a good community that's friendly and plenty of people
playing a game that you can sink hours into 
hunting for salvage under the sea is a great idea a play on water worlds themes 
as salvage is the key ...also killing everyone as you guessed it there's only one friend on the 
the map and she rips you off price wise...the merchant but shes really got high prices for her wares ....
the map is so well crafted lots of locals to move to take over a base and eliminate the scum lol
the game has a lot of grinding but again...its so chill and no more difficult than dayz except this game is more addictive to  play
I would recommend this game to  anyone who likes survival games with decent enemies that are actually a challenge but you can turn down the raids make the enemy camps populace smaller so its cool.. playing on line too is fun but not my thing as they can take your stuff..but you can kick em... 
TIPS
few tips while playing
build with metal
make a water purifier 
build pots for plants
craft a fishing net
better weapons
trade with the trader 
police Station is a haven for good loot....and Sharks :(
enemies are a tad OP
sharks have Hulk Hogan style Aggro
looks great in handheld mode plays well 
addictive fun one hour becomes  four hours just cool to play
raids are annoying  combat is janky at times and the enemies are accurate 
playing solo is pretty much a chore when your base is destroyed ....but just  graft build better bases ...sometimes a dozen will attack and u have just a spear and a bow ...so craft guns asap
make a advanced  water purifier asap
build growers for plants
craft a fishing net
better weapons
trade with the trader 
police Station is a haven for good loot....and Sharks :(

the perfect base location honestly the island is a waste of time unless you build a square water based ..base

Devs are constantly updating and bug fixing, got a good ear in the community. The graphics, and sound is quite immersive. Would be nice to see a few changes coming along, such as:
More interactive npcs (one trader currently). A way to pit enemy factions against each other, recruit or band together would be great. Also some kind of gameplay story woven into the loot they have or tied to an improvement in loot respawn, for more replayability.
Seasons or new weather effects as a challenge for survivability.
Ability to name beds please, I often use these as a chosen respawn.
Signs or markers on storage containers, to help with inventory management.
Some cost penalty to doing structure repairs, maybe needs a battery and fuel.
Upgrades to wood tools, potentially a chainsaw with low dps in combat too.
More ocean mobs and ability for enemies to make use of boats or vehicles.
More intelligent pathfinding and AIs from enemies, they don't react as a group when raiding their island.

Combat just isn't there. You can fight sharks just by spearing them from the side and you will never get hit. For enemies, just run behind the melee ones and stab them, they can't hit you. For ranged ones, get them to shoot at you and then hide behind a rock. They will run right up to you so you can kill them too. You move faster than every enemy in this game so just side step everything and yawn from boredom.

The Ai in replace of real players is very much appreciated too, allows for a more casual feel/play-style of this game. 
The Ai could use some improvements but that is to be expected with Ai enemies haha.

The Ai raids are not worth it though unfortunately :( The loot you get back from the raiders makes it almost pointless to have the raids on, at all. Whilst it does add some spice to the game, I don't want to waste bullets for Tuna, Bandages and some flares.

So, in Sunkenland, you're not scavenging on dry land, but underwater, which is a really unique take on survival gaming. You've got to swim around to gather your resources, which is both cool and challenging.

Now, the game has these island factions, and each one has different kinds of enemies, ranging from weak to pretty darn strong. That faction system adds a layer of strategy that's pretty interesting. You've got to think about how to tackle each faction and what resources you need to take them down.

Unfortunately Sunkenland really drops the ball when it comes to explaining stuff. The item descriptions sometimes just cut off, leaving you clueless about what you're making until it's done.

And then there's the whole issue with your base getting attacked. Sunkenland warns you when an attack is coming, but here's the twist – those warnings aren't always reliable. It's happened to me and my buddies several times. We'd get these messages about our base being under attack, but when we rushed back, there was nothing happening.

What saved us, though, was the game's music. When your base is truly under siege, the music shifts, giving you a real heads-up. But honestly, it's not the most intuitive way to communicate an attack.

Now, here's the part that really got to me and my friends. We were all confident that the base attack notifications were just bugs, because it had happened before. So, we ignored them and carried on with our underwater adventures. But when we returned, all of our hard work was gone – our base had been wiped out. One of my buddies even got shot and killed, and get this, he wasn't anywhere near the enemies. He was on a completely different island that had no enemies whatsoever. That's when we decided to take a break from Sunkenland.

So, yeah, Sunkenland is a game with a lot of potential, and the underwater survival concept is awesome. If they iron out these issues, it could be a fantastic game, but for now, it's a bit of a mixed dive.",1695360452,1695360452,False,5,4,0.49226456880569458,0,True,False,True

Combat is horrible and nigh on insufferable in its current state, even on easy it turns into a vicious slog where enemies will kill you in two impeccably placed shots whereas it takes roughly two whole magazines of yours to drop one or two of them. 

Be prepared from early game onward to be killed dozens of times and constantly respawned out in the middle of the water after dropping all of your gear in the enemy base and then trying to reclaim your kit that will also undoubtedly end up in you being killed dozens of times moreover. 

Enemy accuracy is absurd and just like any other game, they NEVER run out of ammunition, so be prepared for that.. Only weapons any enemies will EVER drop is an occasional melee weapon OR a BROKEN firearm that CANNOT be used until you've obtained a means of reassembled/repairing it. 

Look, I get it, its an early access title that is undergoing constant work but I absolutely CANNOT recommend buying it or playing it at this time. Good luck finding a server of other players who will allow you to join their game without getting immediately kicked thanks to everyone being paranoid about hackers. 

I like the general concept, the Rust meets Waterworld kind of aesthetic scratches a certain type of itch but at this stage, I'd suggest you avoid this title. The frustration factor here is just too high at the moment.

Sunkenland is an absolute gem in the survival and exploration genre, and I can't get enough of it in its current state. If you're a fan of this genre, do yourself a favor and dive right in!

One of the standout features for me has been the absence of tool deterioration. It's such a relief not having to constantly worry about the state of my tools while I'm out exploring this breathtakingly submerged world. This means more time for adventure and less time for maintenance, and I'm all for it!

Speaking of adventure, there is an absolute wealth of things to craft and explore in Sunkenland. From building your dream base in unique locations to crafting various tools, weapons, and even vehicles, the possibilities seem endless. It's a crafting enthusiast's dream come true!

But what truly gets my heart racing is the thrilling base defense against the menacing mutants. The adrenaline rush as they raid your base is an absolute blast. It keeps you on your toes and adds a level of excitement to each game session that's hard to match. Sunkenland truly knows how to keep you entertained.

In summary, Sunkenland is a must-play for anyone who enjoys post-apocalyptic survival and exploration games. With tool durability out of the picture, a world of crafting and exploration at your fingertips, and the constant excitement of mutant raids, it's an experience you won't want to miss.

only encountered 2 bugs

1. storing your bag inside inventory making you loose that one line of slots will make it disapear but its acctualy there,
go to the trader and drop it and it wil reapear and you can put it back on

2, walking trough a door works only one way if it clips with the ground.

other than that ive found it pleasing and acctualy fun to play so far.
there is enough here to do already for its early build, and its improvements will prob make it better and bigger

I have already explored every part of the map and have crafted alot and it seems like it will be an even better game with more updates! The only really tough bug is when you have spent hours gathering resources and then you save the game and come back in and all of your resources are gone from your chests other than that great job developers on an amazing game. I'll list some pros and cons below so other players know what to expect from this game...

Pros:
-Graphics are really good
-Very easy game to learn
-Menus are easily navigated
-Crafting is super easy
-Aim and Shoot mechanism is on point
-Driving/Flying mechanic is very easy and smooth
-All around a fun game to play with friends

Cons:
-Resources become scarce and hard to find once you have crafted so much....(Iron Ore and Copper Ore) I feel like there should be more resources available in the world and on the different islands that you travel to
-Resources gathered sometimes disappear from chests after you save the game and load back in (PLEASE FIX!)
-The sharks can kiss my A$$ for sure
-Not alot to explore after about 20 hours into the game but that will definitely change with future updates I'm sure
-Chests, Vehicles, Backpack and Shelves should hold more items it feels like there is not alot of room in any of them and I have about 25 metal shelves, 15 wooden shelves, 10 chests, and the largest backpack you can craft and I feel like I'm constantly running out of room and I craft alot
-The recoil on the guns in the game definitely needs to be tweaked and reduced a bit especially on the AK... It kicks like a mf

i think enemies re-spawning would be a huge plus along with some loot, ie scrap, and cars on the ocean floor.

Survival crafting games are my favorite genre and Sunken Deep and Raft are two of my favorite games of all time so this one is right up my alley when it comes to games. It is definitely early access though but the developer communicates their planned road map right at the beginning of the game and seems to have a plan. Highly playable and enjoyable in it's current state. Edit: Devs are definitely doing Early Access right. They listen to their playerbase and address issues and bugs quickly with frequent updates. As of this edit (9/16/23) we are still in very early access so expect that you'll have to restart relatively often as updates break old saves though you can always use Steam's beta function to play older versions if you're particularly attached to a save.

My wishlist for the Devs.

1. Please, oh please, let us hold down the left click to harvest resources rather than clicking multiple times. It just saves wear and tear on the mouse button and not to mention avoiding repetitive stress injures. 

2. There needs to be a way of picking up building pieces and furniture after they've been set down, even if it means destroying them and only getting a fraction of the materials back. Some sort of blueprint system like in The Forest or an upgrade system like in 7D2D would be ideal. 

3. Having containers in the world remain so they can be reused for storage rather than breaking apart would be nice.

Otherwise, this is a very solid start and I'm excited to see where this game goes. I feel a lot like when I first picked up 7D2D back in early 2014. I knew it was something special back then and I have that same feeling for Sunkenland.",1693420771,1694898653,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Rating: 8.5/10

Quick PSA to players looking for the gear/cog item:
I can't remember the name I read this ""fix"" from (sorry in advance), however if you leave one item in the red toolboxes you get the gear/cog item from then they will re spawn all the loot in them. Helps a ton until we get a balance fix for them.

So far I haven't seen any of the negative claims anyone in reviews/discussions have mentioned other than a few minor bugs. I don't believe this studio are scammers and I haven't experienced any hackers getting into a closed game.

Bugs encountered so far (Will try to update as things get fixed and destroyed):
- 1 lost Heli after landing it on water.
- Getting stuck in roofs/poles while diving.

Some advice to the studio:
Please see the gold mine of a game you're sitting on at the moment. You have the makings of what could be a pretty great title, don't let it go into the abyss like a lot of other small E.A. title go. Work hard, take time off for yourself when needed but always keep your community updated. Communication goes a very long way with games like yours.

Communication is key.

You won't be able to make everyone happy unfortunately. So keep making this game in your vision but never hesitate to seek out ideas/advice from your community. A lot of people seem to really want this game to do well, myself included.

Best of luck to your studio and I hope to see this become something remarkable. :praisesun:",1694880734,1694880734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Where is the marine life?. sharks, Marlins a few fish. How bout Corals and more fish whales giant squid etc. Submarines are better than boats or gyro-copters this thing sucks cannot fly it. A diving suit resistant to cold with tanks, could be very nice and is very common in today's world. Guns with no attachments, only one useless dotted scope. Long range scopes flash lights simple things.  Can i get a boat with a mounted machine gun?.  Most blue prints suck the fast speed boat is very good.  the repair hammer is acceptable early game but late game with a large base you got to be kidding. Hammering every panel is tedious, time consuming and very very annoying. How bout a Force field thru a machine in the base that slowly repairs the panels thru electricity etc.  I killed all NPC on their Islands, now what?.  The loot re-spawns slowly underwater some not at all.  The only thing to do is go out for more loot and wait for the raids.  The construction of the base is very very simple and ugly.  Snap snap helps.  Can we get automated turrets?.  large Boat with guns? recruit NPC to our base?. The trader sucks, same items all the time.  How bout a trader that sells weapons, ammo, armor etc. Another that sells food, medicine, drinks, seeds. Another one that deals with blue prints, rare items or just items like a grill, boat whatever.  In game currency were I can sell my items and buy new items.  Just a few ideas that will make this game stay alive for a while and be enjoyable. More Islands, more bad guys around more fish, more weapons better transportation.

Getting an early access game, people always need to remember it’s not the final product but it takes gamers like us to play it for the devs to see what bugs need to be fixed and what ideas the community can spark for the devs.

The game is not that optimized for every chipset, my game was perfectly fine playing. My buddies that was on my server didn’t have the same experience. His game would constantly blue screen his computer and shut his PC off just unplayable for him. I updated my driver for my cpu and graphics then started getting funky when I was turning or when it went to night time. 

The game has amazing potential if the devs keep with updates consistent and give sneak peaks, community announcements etc to keep their player based fans interested. 

I played Rust back when it was in Alpha and seeing it today is day and night difference almost an entirely different game. Will probably be the same for this game but for right now I’m going to wait it out until I can actually play with friends. Devs if you read this please look into:

Each factions should have a 'King"" base where its like a boss fight.
Also Mob Boss fights like a crazy squid, king shark, large snake, etc.
A few join-able factions maybe?

The further you get in the more you notice how rough it is around the edges but you accept it as its still fun, I think many people expect something super polished with some of these early access games.
In my opinion the game needs lots of work to make it more enjoyable.  Content is a little lacking and most outposts despite differences you start to notice are the same.  

Npc's can be formidable and sometimes land some crazy shots on you, shooting can literal hit and miss.  I feel that some of the guns need work in the way they shoot or recoil and hit shots.  Graphics are typical unity engine stuff, with the game looking very much like Rust.

Loot system is quite decent, you seem to find what you need eventually without much effort.  The crafting system I like as its simple to understand and learn as is the user interface for this.  Inventory system is quite nice, could do with a little polishing but its fine to interact with.

Base building and snapping of some items needs work.  There is so much scope for the possibilities of what could be achieved with this with patches and of course community input for what is desired/needed.

Map feels on the small side once you get to the faster transport vehicles.  You find yourself quickly destroying enemies at outposts and doing super quick loot runs.
More references to the movie waterworld would be nice lol.

Of course I have plenty of gripes with the game but so far so good, the biggest one for me was the ability for individuals to randomly enter your game world despite passwords, kicking them works fine though.  I have experienced some issues with ingame storage but I'm confident bugs and glitches like this will be addressed by the game devs.  
I do feel that some things could be done now quickly to make the game better, dedicated servers would be a big one and maybe adding pvp as an option.  
Well I look forward to seeing what content will be added in the future and how the game will progress.  It certainly feels worthy of its current price tag and to spend time on and importantly the devs seem very active in developing the game in to something great.",1694797751,1694797751,True,19,0,0.685653507709503174,0,True,False,True

A few honest observations:

The humanoids with military-grade ranged weapons are extremely difficult with their bottomless supply of ammo and you have zero chance to sneak past these freaks or evade their spray and pray gun fire.

The food and water consumption is set a little too high as you will spend all your early game time purifying water and cooking food just to sustain yourself. This is extremely boring and very unrealistic. A human can fill up their stomach and live perfectly fine for days, so why does this game require that I eat and drink every 20 minutes or face sudden demise? (*Update-This got much better as I wore insulated clothing, suffering less cold effects, and this requiring less water/food.)

Crafting stations, forges, and plant Potters need to allow multiple stacks of items to be placed in them at a time and there needs to be a queing system. Currently you can ONLY place one resource item or seed at a time and are forced to endure a lengthy amount of time before they can be harvested. This is extremely tedious and unproductive. I would prefer to drop a stack in them and let them craft/cook while I continue to travel and gather additional resources.

While sailing, you are forced into a first person perspective and the ship's giant sail blocks almost all of your view, making navigating the map extremely cumbersome and unenjoyable. Please either remove the sail from our view or set the orbiting camera view farther out so that players can better navigation.

This game requires a feature that allows players the ability to annotate their map and a feature to rename our beds. Having several beds, located around the map is impossible to tell which one and from where on the map to spawn from whenever you die. This is extremely frustrating.

So far, this game requires an extraordinary amount of time and effort looting but I suppose later game will become easier in this regard as I acquire more advanced technology blueprints.

At the same time, giving it a thumbs down seemed a bit harsh. So betting on the future of the game, i'll give it a [b]thumbs up[/b]. For now, grab it on a sale or wait for the devs to improve the game. So far the devs made a good impression, as they are constantly working on the game and releasing rapid fixes. I will focus the rest of my review on constructive feedback for the devs, which can also serve to give the average reader insight on the weaknesses of the game.

For context, we played the game as a 2-player coop on hard difficulty.

[b]Exploration:[/b]
We tried to get 100% exploration on all the islands. While i wont deny that it's possible we missed some items, we are used to combing areas like that very thoroughly, even multiple times. Some islands we couldnt get above 95-98% and the starting island is stuck at a pathetic 86%. We are pretty sure that there is some bug preventing 100%ing most locations, like items being invisible / unreachable. We found at least one such unreachable item (a locker) in one of the city center towers, where you could not get to it.
The exploration itself was fun, except that you (we) basically completed the game after 40% of islands or so. While there was like 2 meaningful blueprints to be found on the remaining islands, these felt overwhelmingly pointless. 
I wish there was a way to highlight what you are missing after reaching like 95% completion, as well as something unique to each island which served as a motivation to go out and explore after completing the tech tree. The distribution of items is also horrible. We had about 20 barrels full of scrap at the end, and nothing to do with it, yet after looting literally the entire game, we did not have enough advanced components for a second helicopter after ours simply vanished. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
Getting as close to 100% as humanly possible, the game took us under 30 hours to complete. That said, only maybe 10 - 15 hours of those were fun. That was when we were through the part of the game which felt meaningful and then continues to grind completion, for the sake of it, which felt unrewarding and at times frustrating. 
There is some balancing issues with items too. Battey based items feel underwhelming, like all of them. At some point we crafted the headlamp, i put it on, and in the 5 seconds it took me to try and turn it off ('L' did nothing, by the way), it already lost 10% charge or so. We put it into a chest and never bothered with it again afterwards. 
It is a bit stressful how much your gameplay is dictated by ingame (day) time. Most of the exploration is underwater, and you simply wont be able to thoroughly search the area unless it's daytime. So basically you plan everything around getting out of base at sunrise, which did not feel very good. This is not helped by the bed having a, what feels like, 24 hour timer, so each time you use it your sleeping time shifts backwards. It would also be great if you woke up in the morning, not after a fixed duration. As is, the bed felt basically useless for the majority of days, either because we couldnt sleep when we needed to, or because we would wake up at a useless time. 
The waves that attack you scale to become waaay too strong. Sure, we played on the harder difficulties, but you get raided by 20 or so people with guns, which can kill you in just a few shots with the best equipment in the game. To add insult to injury, we got spawncamped at two points in the game, literally being oneshot directly after leaving the bed. The new armor system, where armor breaks and leaves you effectively naked (armor wise), didnt really help with that. We had to reload the game, which as of now despawns the attackers. This is likely a bug, but before you fix it, keep in mind that our only other solution would have been to start from scratch, and leave a negative review. 
There is also this insanely annoying bug where ranged weapons simply cant hit enemies anymore. This can happen to both hosts and clients independantly or at the same time and we are not sure what causes it. As melee combat becomes useless lategame, you have to restart.

[b]Repairing:[/b]
This feature is so bad, it deserved its own category. Im not even kidding. A wall has 2500 to 4000 HP. You repair 100 HP per hit, so have fun hitting a broken wall up to 40 times. Per wall. If you can hit it, at all, given the range of the hammer being half an arms length or so. Forget about repairing stuff you cant directly stand in front of. If you want to repair something you stand on, better crouch down lol. Have fun even figuring out what took damage in the first place, since you can only see HP values in a slightly larger range than you can hit stuff. The whole system is ridiculous and felt so bad we stopped repairing stuff and just lived with everything slowly breaking apart. 
Gameplay over realism. Give us a green-to-red HP overlay for build items. Give the hammer like 5 meters of range. Make it (out of combat) repair 1000 HP a hit. Nobody likes to repair their base. Make it as painless as possible, not as frustrating as possible.

[b]Clothes:[/b]
The game offers a large amount of clothes. Which would usually be a good thing. But since you care about armor only, all players will look pretty much the same in endgame. Nobody will wear an anime t-shirt, if something else warms them in the night or gives them more armor. Separate armor from looks. Let us wear vanity over the armor items.
The amount of clothes and trophy items is also increadibly overwhelming, especially considering the inventory problems. Even just looting and then throwing the stuff away (directly in place) is annoying, as there is no hotkey. The clothes and trophy items should simply be unlocked, never ending up in your inventory, to then be placeable indefinitely, or be equippable without consuming them, from some wardrobe. Something like that. 

[b]UI & Interaction:[/b]
Needs improvements. The main menu to host a previously saved session has such a bad user experience, it feels bugged. While attempting to host an existing map, it does not highlight the map name, and the ""New World"" button has to be selected. I mean.. why? First time i relaunched the game i wasnt sure if i was just about to overwrite our existing save, or start a new game. Horrible design. 
The ingame UI is a bit better, but some of the interactions are horrid. To split an item you need to drag it into a specific ""inventory splot"" and then use a slider to split the stack. And you cant even do this while it's in a chest. A horrible experience, which is not helped by how often you will do this. 
Inventory management itself is a bit annoying, especially considering we had to regularly visit locations at least 2 times, in 2-player coop to loot them approximately 100%. This means you'd have to go there 3-4x in singleplayer. And vehicles are kinda.. slow. 
The helicopter controls are nightmare-inducing. No, really. In over 20 years of gaming i have never seen such a horrible control concept. As a fellow software engineer and hobby game dev, i dont think i could make up worse controls, even if i tried. Since the mouse controls the stick which leans the helicopter in some direction for steering, you cant move the camera. This means you simply stare directly ahead.. so most of the time you have no idea if you are level in the air, or leaned in some direction. Not to mention you cant see where you land. Even if that was not the case, the mouse-to-stick controls dont feel fun. Just horrible. Rework ASAP.

[b]Other Suggestions:[/b]
After the dust settles and the core gameplay is fixed and fun, id love to be able to customize the gameplay a bit. Some sort of skill tree would be great. Also, backpacks that specialize in certain roles, by being able to store tons of low-volume low-weight items like cloth, or miner-backpacks that allows to have way larger ore stacks.",1694776189,1694776189,True,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Even before the bug fixes etc I was loving the progression and the pace of the game. The only complaint I really have is that the end game requires so much Iron it gets super grindy. Also because Iron is sort of scarce you end up never making a base of iron as you need 5 iron to make 1 steel and most end game items need steel. This game definitely has potential. After 31 hrs I have cleared all the islands on the map and can't wait to see some major updates and start a fresh save.

But with some perseverance, maybe I will get over my fear of water, could really do with a harpoon gun for those sharks though.

The chance of also getting killed whilst trying to sneak onto an island causes some anxiety which is good fun, so I have played mainly above the water.

Not being able to transfer everything to storage in one go is frustrating, I bet i'm not the only one who keeps getting caught out by thinking the take all on the storage container means take from the pack which is of a much smaller size than the storage unit.

I have never ever wanted or needed to take everything out of storage, but from the start when my back pack was tiny, have wanted to take everything from my pack and put it all into storage.
What I need is a store all on my pack.

I really liked the ability to turn off raids so you can enjoy working on your base at leisure and learn at your own pace, and then decide whether you want to challenge yourself more. Hunting sharks was a bit tricky at first but once ya get the hang of it they're easy peasy. I don't particularly have any real complaints since it's early access and the devs seem to be very responsive and quick to improve the gameplay, I'd love to see things like whales and dolphins added as well as other creatures. Maybe dolphins get curious and play around you as you scavenge, or whales look really imposing but generally do their own thing. Seeing their waterspouts or tale flukes would be a spectacular addition. I'd love to see differing weather conditions, which would give tremendous immersion.

Of course, there are bugs, it's very early access, but it's still fun and immersive already.

I'm 4 hours in, I haven't bugged once, but I know it will come because I never played a game that didn't bug and I like helping to test and make things better.

Buy the game and help the devs by reporting bugs, sending save files, copying error messages, and explaining exactly what happened before the problem started. Use video and screenshots. The game will be better for it. 

Looking forward to seeing what new updates bring. Hoping for open sea clan warfare like the Waterworld movie, huge seabase raids, and cruising around on a catamaran with a kite sail that I can shoot from a harpoon for extra speed to get away from the smokers on jetskis...

- Chests : At one point one chest bugged out and became unusable until broken. Cause : someone is occupying this storage.

- Motor Boat (2 seater) : Friends joining server experienced getting stuck in boat driver seat unable to hop out. Fix : Have them log out and in.
We also both got stuck at one point in the same seat. Not sure if this was the cause but when we both saved and logged out and started again. The boats had ""dissapeared"" and EVERY I mean ALL items in any form of storage was completely wiped even though all our recent progression was there. A LOAD of items I'm not sure how they got beside the base in a ring shape.  lots of iron, vests not sure if related to disappearance of all our items and maybe it was trying to render ours in, I am really not sure but i have footage of the struggle. Went for a swim to find our boats near the edge of the map with also my fish net?. Very unusual experience haha but had fun nonetheless! (can go into more detail if required).

- Server bugs possibly : Friends claimed they could see my server on the public list the first time they ever joined. But when they left they had to be invited. Not a major issue.

- Enemies : I didn't witness this myself, One of my friends said apparently one of the mobs ran through a tree.

- Swimming : Friend stated was swimming up under house, somehow popped through and spawned in roof and drowned.

SUGGESTIONS
|
- Claiming Land
- Recycling clothes to get like cloth maybe
- Skin from enemies to make leather
- Grills fit more food maybe since they are so big. or create a cheaper smaller option.
- Tribes\Guilds\Factions of our own, So that only friends can use your stuff. even a trust system. would also fix false alarm home raids.
- Servers that we can buy and host if the company doesnt have its own servers yet. some people are willing to pay to host their own.
- Mic visual in game when other people talk with name beside (proximity?)
- A couple of extra enemies under water or just more sea life. good suggestion. some bigger models like whales and mantarays to save on having too many things.
- Upgradeable Buildings so yoou dont have to destroy. Being able to move things in general or just pick them back up. Bigger storage?

Seriously though, what new title doesn't have bugs?  Its why we are in early access, to find them en mass.  We buy the game at a reduced cost with the understanding that it is far from finished, and we are here to help the development of what will eventually become a polished game.

This isn't my 1st rodeo with these types of early access, but why I am choosing an early endorsement of this game specifically?  The reactions of the dev team as we grind through early game growing pains together compel my up-votes.  They are paying attention.  They are active.  They are responsive.  You may not like a response, but that is never part of the deal. 

This game is entertaining.  It is enjoyable... and most of all it has a lot of potential.  Considering how badly Snail Games has screwed the customer base lately, this is a refreshing option for new builder possibilities.  

Devs: PLEASE consider allowing open modding in the steam workshop once this game comes to a satisfactorily stable condition in your eyes, as this title could easily overtake take the place of Rust or Raft.  The ideas and opportunities you could open up for this game and your studio by allowing the minds of the players to contribute is invaluable to both the enjoyment of the game and its resell value in the future.  I love what I see so far and I want to see this title last for a long time.

it doesnt seem like enemies or resources other than trees replenish which means once you hit all the islands and finish all the PvE theres nothing left to do.

there is no real story line yet but that is said to come in later updates.

this game has great potential, it is very fun with the limited amount of content it has, im excited to see what happens with it next.


EDIT: 

a few things i can think of adding 

1. better night/day cycles. a lot of the time its too dark to do anything or it is too cold if you can do anything the daytime isn't long enough to actually be able to do full tasks. but i still have to wait a while before i can skip the night.

2.renewable resources

It makes me think of Stranded Deep, Rust, Subnautica, all top notch games and this belongs along side them I'dd say!",1694472028,1694472028,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I would avoid the discord server though as it is yet another discord server with toxic mods that turn people away from their discord when you try to make the game safe for all but calling out nudity in-game via ingame neon art signs, and get told to drop it, or timed out by childish chat mods trying to delete that chat and sweep it under the rug and try to say I'm making claims about adding nudity or some garbage when I am only asking for it to be either removed or made appropriate for all ages. I had to quit the discord to escape the toxicity there from some hostile mods.

The game outside of the discord server is 5/5 stars and it gets new updates all the time. 
I am looking forward to what comes next.

It's early access so it does have its quirks, hopefully ironed out over time.
My only issue is the combat. Although not tragic it alone is a bit under-done. The AI will shoot you through things/anything but you cannot do the same to them. Hit registration does not always proc. It's not a game breaking issue, more frustrating really.
That aside, I'd give the game 6 out of 10 at this stage. I am keen to see what they can implement in the future in regards to DLC, quests, building, exploration, etc.
The other gripe I have is that I have to physically remove my save files out of the game file to play co-op & vice versa to again play solo. The game doesn't support multi-saves or multiple game worlds.

Rating: 3.5 Stars

Sunkenlands is a game that holds immense promise, offering an exciting concept that sets it apart in the gaming world. However, while it shines in certain aspects, it faces some challenges when it comes to scaling up for multiple players.

The game truly comes to life when played in a small group setting. During my initial 17 hours of gameplay with a single friend, I found Sunkenlands to be an absolute blast. The cooperative experience of exploring a submerged world, gathering resources, and overcoming challenges together was nothing short of exhilarating. This experience prompted me to invite two more friends to join in, as I envisioned creating a new world from scratch with a larger team.

However, my excitement was somewhat short-lived. Within a mere 5 hours of gameplay with the expanded group of four, we had completed all that the game's first world had to offer. This was a stark contrast to the initial 17 hours it had taken my friend and me to achieve the same milestones. It appears that the ease of progress may be attributed to the abundance of resources available to a larger group, although I am uncertain about what could be done to balance the game for larger parties. Despite this scaling issue, it's important to note that Sunkenlands still manages to deliver an enjoyable gaming experience.

One standout feature of Sunkenlands is its portrayal of territorial sharks, which adds a layer of realism and immersion that many other games in the genre lack. This attention to detail is commendable and enhances the overall gameplay.

As an early access title, Sunkenlands distinguishes itself from the myriad of underwhelming games in the same genre. For a modest investment of $20, I found myself engrossed in the game for 20-30 hours. The potential for continued content updates further sweetens the deal. It's entirely possible that Sunkenlands will evolve and grow over time, making it an enticing prospect to return to in a few months.

In conclusion, Sunkenlands is a game with a unique concept and solid foundations. It excels in small group play, providing hours of entertainment. However, it does face challenges in scaling up for larger parties, and this aspect could benefit from further attention from the developers. Nevertheless, as an early access title, it already offers good value for money and holds the promise of even greater things to come. Dive into Sunkenlands now and watch as it continues to develop into something truly remarkable.

It is challenging but fun at the same time. It is early access but the positives outweigh the negatives.
When you're chillin in your base making stuff and messing around all of a sudden you get invaded by enemies which is fun for me. 
It would be nice if the devs made some kind of rebreather or scuba tank that lets you stay under water for longer instead of switching out tanks. Some parts you need to go pretty deep. But maybe they meant for that as a feature of urgency.  

I have played for around 12 hours and still have more to explore. The map size is big but not unnecessarily spread out to where its annoying and pointless. 

I've played on normal and the enemies are challenging when they have guns. Although there isn't much of a story yet i wont spoil what happens on the various islands. And they are abundant and hopefully they add more. 

All in all, I recommend this game. It is entertaining, and you need to prioritize in order to be successful.

It is v relaxing to play and frankly easy (on default settings), but I  dont mine that.  The learning curve is not punishing and if you have played these sorts of survival games before you will not struggle.  It does not take long at all to build a home with a bed, some storage and a grill and purifier so you can shut the door at night and cook!

Sure there are issues here and there but it's early access  so they will get worked on but only thing i personally find a bit annoying is when you are using a spear to attack enemies on land and the enemy walks through a bush they sometimes don't get damaged as the bush protects them. This caused me to die a few times against mutants but it's more just annoying than  anything. Tho the fishing is difficult  as  it's hard to time  trying to reel in  most if the time.

So far my experience with this game has been pretty good. There are a few glitches here and there but the devs have been very good about getting on it when it comes to fixing them. The game is beautiful and the mechanics work well. You may have to turn up mouse sensitivity and turn down controller sensitivity depending on what you are used to and if you do co-op a closed lobby is recommended.
It's not often I find a game like this that runs this well and has requirements that are as low as this to run it, and I am having a lot of fun exploring the world and building in it. All in all definitely recommend giving it a chance.
This review may be adjusted later on to better represent my experience when things have had a chance to develop.

Things I hope we will see in the near future are, having the option to change use button to E it can automatically trade uses with f button. (My reason for this is I am a stroke victim, I using my right hand for the keyboard and my left hand for the mouse. I was right handed before my stroke 14 years ago.
I have been barley able to control my character, but have gotten used to having the use button as E since in is next to W.)

I've played 23h so far and I think that gonna be just that for now, the progression curve doesn't really exist... you craft the cheapest weapon/armor at the beginning and the next one you craft is the best one... You never craft any in between because everything is alreally unlocked... so I've seen it all really fast..

There is no big bug for me, except I had to reload because somehow I was 100% bulletproof without that there is just some annoying glitch here and there but nothing outside the ''early access'' spectrum, its fine.

They fixed the save file issue that might still be reported all over the review section and as such this early acess has been quite fun to play with a friend and even got plenty hours out of it. The biggest issue however, something I spotted within the first 2 hours of play: You are playing a game about exploration, gathering and base defense where the world is given finite resources. This is bad. Doubly so when you spend some resources inefficiently or decide to rebuild your base elsewhere or a second base or anything like it. You will now be consistently facing enemy raids on your home spawning over time whilst eventually all the resources for building and crafting will be used up. Food and drink has a multitude of ways to acess infinite replenishes, but building parts for bases, vehicles and equipment you only got what the world will drop ONCE. 

Not only that but it also means due to previous finite amount of places to visit and loot the ""exploration and gathering"" will dry up. No idea how some people get more than 30 hours out of the current game as by then you should have looted everything and all that is left is afking in your base or collecting Ore (one of the only respawing resouces).

I love the concept of this game,  reminds me of rust/stranded deep/7d2d with a little subsistence thrown in.    I don't think island and underwater areas is enough to be a multiplayer game as of right now,   not enough area to explore or loot for up to 15 players.   For multiplayer you'd honestly need an entire world or a map 5 times the size.  This is a great size for a single player or maybe dual player game as it sits.  Vector3 studios has done a wonderful job building this world and adding things that people like.  I think everyone should play this game or at least buy it and come along for the ride.  I hope to see many many new maps pop up and maybe the ability to make our own islands and our own maps in creative to share in a workshop for us to use for a play through in the future.   Single player the ability to pause the game instead of saving and logging out.   I do like that it was a fully functioning game to start and the Devs have plans to make this game much much more than it is.   Lots of help on their discord as well.   2 thumbs up so far.

The progression is well paced and underwater diving isn't at all slow. In fact, diving exploration is what you'll engage most in early game. Many islands are dangerous and filled with factions to face. The guns are pack a punch and feel good to use, gun play is smooth so far though I didn't opt into black powder guns so I can't speak on those. The red dot sight doesn't make the normal reticle go away and makes aiming with some weapons difficult. The devs seem involved and have dropped a road map, hopefully they add public timelines to that to hold themselves accountable. 

I bought the game on sale and felt it was worth the sale price. If this game continues to update it'll be worth the 20 dollar asking price. Also time for some cons. Some textures such as the washing machine are just awful, other textures are amazing. Weird divide. The enemy AI isn't very reactive. Enemies won't rush you with melee weapons instead opting to stand still waiting to be shot most times. They also won't react to when their buddy right next to them is head shot, in fact they don't really react to missed shots either. The trader is lacking as well. I hope to see either more traders with different inventories or the trader cycling their inventory instead of it always being the same. Sharks are also static and weak. I feel they should spawn randomly near the player while diving and have higher health pools. Sharks can also swim through walls to bite you and most times will miss their attacks on you. Several times now I've become stuck underwater and had to wait to just die. Smelting ores also takes years upon years and should not feel like a chore. The woodworking bench sound when turned on makes me want to turn the audio off and is painful to listen to.",1694035800,1694201899,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

Best combination of Raft/Stranded Deep taking place in Water World.

A good level of complexity and tiered crafting/skills.
I like the multiple enemy factions, and progress complete markers for each island.
(Enemy AI is simplistic, but it's early, and if you aren't paying attention or armored up they can be punishing).

The diving to loot & swim speed vs oxygen needs/burn rate is pretty good for tiered craft/leveling.
Flippers for speed
meds/herbs for oxygen time
multiple tiered foods with different buffs (for oxygen and swim speed)
Craftable air tanks with a craftable hand crank air pump.

Food/Water aren't onerous (well no more than on Raft/Stranded... once you have the systems setup it's manageable.  With advanced systems they require much less maintenance)

Building/Structures still need some polish, but are quite functional enough to base and defense build.

Decorations are plentiful, would love an easier pickup method, but there is a packing box to pickup placed things, and a grinder/recycler for some items.

Not much island wildlife yet, but I suspect more will come with time.  (the last patch has most creatures swimming upside down, lol.)

haven't used all the ships, but they are quite useful.
Would love to see more customization in the future and/or more storage.

All in all enjoying it in its early stages, and look forward to much entertainment in a group/co-op setting.

Also hoping for map randomization and a few other things, but I'm good waiting for good features.


If you're a ""serious"" or ""realism"" survival game player, skip for now.  If you enjoyed raft or stranded deep (or even Subnautica)  you might give this a swing.

Ennemy NPC can head shot you from very far giving you little to no chance.
Some islands are way more difficult than others and there is no real indication on the difficulty.
I don't like the way we get raided, i planned a base design forcing a path for ennemies to follow, they just spawn in the water and float around my base shooting my walls down, until i get visible then they all aim for me at the same time.
Way too much loot/junk. Inventory management is painfull.
When you drop stuff on the groud because you are full, it just stay there until you decide to finally pick it up.. i like to 100% my POI, so there is a lot of junk all over my map.

For an Early Access, this one has an AMAZING level of content. Exploration is very fun, and base defence is just the right amount of thrill.

Pros 
The adventure with the different factions adds another style of game play i really have never seen before and depending on the faction They don't really act like NPC.(alot of random movements)
Also unlike alot of games when they apply water and food into the game play this actually feel balanced with how much it replenishes and diminishes also with how it can be found but not to much where it feels pointless. 
The travelling unlike in most games feels really nice and speedy without feeling to crazy. 
Easily laid out so no matter what new things you don't need 3rd party information
Quick at fixing bugs and updating. 

Cons 
When raids happen it just becomes a shoot off because the raiders wont try to get close.
The world generation is repetitive and does not have a new generation when you create a new world.
Once you make everything it doesn't feel like there are to many fun side projects
Repetitive trader that does not feel like it has much use.

But overall I found this game very enjoyable and has a lot of potential and i highly recommend for a nice game to play on a Friday night.

When using 5 buckets at once on hot keys to fill them up and carry them to the purifier. One of the buckets stayed full of sea water and wouldn't allow me to dump into the purifier. Another bug was when using the crossbow, while true aiming. The camera would zoom throught the player body and only show into the arms of the player after each shot. This is a on going issue.I hope there will be hanging traps like in forest to catch mutants attacking the bases. Also, bone armor would be awesome to add and burning the of enemys/animals would be a nice add to it. Throwing knives  would be a nice add on. Maybe first level would be throwing knives with stone/melted scarp and second level. The knives are made of stainless steel mind from nodes and smelted. Cannons would be a nice touch for to be able to add to a raft or base for defense. Cannon balls forged with smelter and ore from nodes.

1. Larger storage containers/Higher tier storage
 -The backpacks are great but the storage space could at least match the backpack storage size. Maybe a higher tier option 
 in the future.

2. Ability to move placed items/decorations.
  -It's frustrating to expand the base and the only option is to scrap, rebuild, and waste more materials to re-locate a 
 workbench or any other item.

3. All keybind change options. 
 -Cannot change the ""Scavenge"" ( F key).

4/ Scroll wheel option for tool belt items
 -Personal preference, but would be a nice feature to have.

5. Ability to upgrade existing structures with the building hammer
 -Same comment as #2

6. Trader restock times

7. Larger item stacks

8. Compass indicator for direction

9. Health bar for enemies 

Overall, I really enjoy the game and think it's fairly decent for an early access game. Looking forward to future updates!

Combat:
feels a bit janky, NPC's font seem to react much to you sniping them from distance, also raids should be more predictable to allow you to venture and explore the world more early on in the game. 
Wood & Coal:   
also the inability to use coal for fueling to me seems a bit weird as everything requires wood to produce power and you are left with a staggering amount of coal, perhaps have coal become a fuel source for the later tech items as once you get past the basic guns coal is pretty much just a trading commodity with the shop keeper.

And to the person who decided lets put that in the game, A big thank you as it made my day and shall be my hat for the rest of my time playing this.

If you got $15 or whatever it is right now, it is worth it.

However, the motion blur you have feels like I just got out of a car after driving for 12 hours straight and the world is still moving around you.
You cannot turn this off. 
There is some other bugs throughout the game, including fish flying through under water objects, inventory bugs with chests, ""Chest is occupied"" but the only person near is you, choppy frame rate as passenger on the boat, AI just isn't ""smart enough"" aka feels like sloppy AI mechanics, needs a frame rate lock for main screen, etc.
I'm sure i'm missing a few major bugs, but tbh its been alright. Being someone who bought 2042 on launch, I will say this aint anywhere near that.

Some suggestions:
Get rid of motion blur completely.
Fix frame rate/maybe some memory leaks?
Add smarter AI mechanics. Add more AI models. Add AI bosses/human or not.
Add weather mechanics like rain, heavy weather the damages the bases, lighting etc
Add more music throughout the day/night cycle.
Add AI that raid bases on boats.
Add darker night cycles/change the moon phase.
-----
Add more crafting items. It's pretty basic. but there is alot to digest at first. Maybe stuff thats interactive more with the player. Radios that call other AI ships, civilians?  
Add more quests. Needs to be an objective thats more clear. If there is one, it wasn't apparent to anyone
Need objectives to do or it will just get repetitive 
Air drops? Random emergency flare that you can find/buy (expensive) and calls airdrops??
Armour doesn't make sense. Make it break, or show values as hud or something.
Needs a better healing system thats more in depth, sickness maybe? Swimming underwater and coming up too quick???
Would like to see this world we get randomly generated, instead of copy paste. Maybe multiple versions of the same map so you never know?
Add iron more under water in the deeper parts.
Add more underwater objects and things to explore 
Increase the air tank time
--------------

Sum it up, buy this game, play it in 6 months.
But if you're bored, with a bunch of friends, it is a blast, until it bugs out or someone gets sick IRL. 
7/10 (9/6/23)
Would buy.

This game will probably excel as a co-op game. It's in a decent stage, given its in alpha, definitely playable co-op. I'm interested to see where the developers go with it. It's good enough that I bought it as a gift for someone else.

FYI, 
Character json file: %AppData%\LocalLow\Vector3 Studio\Sunkenland\Characters\
- The character json file is your character. You can tweak it there
- The file with the uuid (the filename with a bunch of crazy numbers and letters), save and look at date modified that will tell you the correct one. I think there is one for each world you've played on. If you copy that text into the file that appears when you change worlds you can bring over your characters loadout, inventory, quick bar, and gear items. Also, it will bring what you've explored and what you have researched.

World json file: %AppData%\LocalLow\Vector3 Studio\Sunkenland\Worlds\
- Haven't played with this much.


If something happens json is easily editable, at least in single player mode. I haven't tested it in multiplayer, I assume it will work just fine given the way the worlds seem to work. Just save and quit, Then from the menu screen you can make your changes, remember to save the file. I've started tracking items ids however my list is short. If it gets more conclusive maybe I'll add it to the wiki. I personally like viewing json in Visual Studio Code, it's free, just give it a google. Also, you're not the best with computers you may be more comfortable simply pressig alt + f4 immediately if something terrible happens.

Feedback: I hope that in the future they increase the time when you hook a fish, you have to react almost instatly as far as I can tell. I haven't caught one yet.

This game stands as a testament to the ingenuity of the survival genre and has rapidly become one of the best survival games I've had the pleasure of playing. Having tested my mettle in numerous survival titles, Sunkenland's unique blend of immersive gameplay and its relentless pursuit of realism make it a true standout.

From the moment I stepped foot in this sunken world, I was immediately drawn into its breathtaking landscapes and atmospheric soundscape. The visual design is nothing short of stunning, with vibrant flora and fauna, intricate underwater caverns, and an ever-present sense of desolation that keeps you on edge. It's as if the game world is a character in itself, constantly evolving and adapting to challenge and captivate players.

But it's not just the aesthetics that make Sunkenland exceptional. The gameplay mechanics are masterfully crafted, offering a level of depth that keeps you engaged for hours on end. Survival in this sunken realm is no easy feat; you must master underwater exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat, all while contending with the unpredictable elements of the ocean. The progression system is equally well-designed, rewarding players for their ingenuity and perseverance.

However, like all great games, there's always room for improvement, and Sunkenland is no exception. While it already offers an incredible experience, I can't help but imagine the potential for even greater depths of immersion. Here are a few ideas for future updates that could elevate Sunkenland to even greater heights:

Expanded Lore and Storyline: Develop a rich narrative that unveils the mysteries of the sunken world, giving players a more profound connection to their surroundings and objectives.

Underwater Ecosystem: Introduce a dynamic ecosystem where players can witness the interactions between marine life, making the ocean feel more alive.

Random Events: Add random events, such as underwater storms or rare aquatic creatures, to keep players on their toes and create even more immersive experiences.

In conclusion, Sunkenland is a true gem in the world of survival gaming, offering an unmatched level of immersion and challenge. Its breathtaking visuals, engaging gameplay, and attention to detail set it apart from the competition. While already a fantastic game, the potential for future expansions and improvements is immense, promising even greater adventures in the sunken world. Dive in and experience the depths of Sunkenland for yourself; you won't be disappointed.",1693947378,1693947378,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Content issue:
The merchant doesnt provide anything substantial, no unique weapon, skin to firearm, idk man anything cool, stuff to make the diving experiance much easier, end game stuff.
The enemies on pretty much all the islands are pretty much always the same end game. There is no bosses, no cool underwater research facility to explore, 
I dont think you can build underwater base.
Some ressources seems to be finite as they come mainly from chest and lootable(that doesnt seem to respawn...unsure...) making it an issue if you would want to play long term, even if there is no long term goal.
The fighting strategy is pretty much always the same, you hear the music change, look around...find enemy, shoot once in the head the homanoid enemy, he dies and his loot provides ammo for the next enemy...its pretty meh...


Trolls in PVE:
Some trolls moved into our server and basically destroyed all our walls, our crafting gear, etc. There is no way to basically protect yourself vs this. no differents tribes in pve, every1 can move into your server, build a repair hammer and begin destroying the stuff you spent a few days to make. It makes effectivelly building on a sand castle. You can't create a substantial base and it makes playing with unknown players a problem.

Issue with the game:
The humanoid enemies do not shoot where their gun are pointed at. (visually, they can point their gun 90 degree away from ya, and still shoot straight in your face, this makes sneaking on enemies virtually impossible with melee weapon or w/e.)
When you die, the ""close"" respawn is sometimes closer to another island rather than the island you are at.
Sometimes, enemies are protected by invisible walls...especially true for handrail and see through fences.
Grenades and such will not damage yourself if the ""friendly fire is off""
You can swim faster than some boats, making some boats feels rather irrelevant.

No real PVP content:
There is basically no end game content in sunkenland.


In short: 
The lack of end game content/ goals and repeatability of mobs from island to island makes the game a very short term game. 
The social aspect of the game is pretty much killed by trolls that threaten to destroy all your stuff.
The building of a base is pointless as enemy waves are easilly dispatched and no pvp is optimize base building. Lack of useful defensible construction stuff.
The underwater exploration is pretty moot, as you farm once or twice then need to go back up to the surface for air. 
The little content there is fine, but it lacks a lot of it in order to have a long term goals/gaming experience with the game.

Things they should add. 
  
   (these are all ideas, some of them could probably make the game worse for all I know)

   Maybe Sliding. 

   Maybe some sort of Climbing like parkour mechanic that could also be implemented into the game for 
   more complex above water structures. 

   The NPC AI is pretty bad, fix that.

   A combat system with some sort of blocking/parrying/dodging. 

   Be able to make your own faction

   Be able to claim, and take over islands/plots that enemy factions could create.

This game is very well done considering the number of people working on it and how long they've been developing it (7 people for less that one year). It's like Rust™  meets 'Waterworld'. 
You're dropped in near a deserted island and have to survive. Mats and items can be found on the various islands, floating structures, and underwater areas. Much of the equipment/weapons/armor that you'll need can be found, but a lot can be crafted as well (either by raw materials or by finding broken items and repairing/upgrading them). There are elemental, natural, and humanistic aspects to overcome.
The progression of the game hits the sweet spot; you don't start as a fully helpless babe in the woods, but you also have to work for the good stuff. 
Overall, a fun game to play, well developed for an Early Access, and with so much more to come (per their discord).",1693909987,1693909987,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Review as of 4 Sept 2023, game version 0.1.20.

It's time to overanalise yet another early access survival game!

I've seen this game being described as a middleground between Raft and Rust, which is somewhat true. Graphically the game looks nice, not jaw dropping but nice. UI/HUD isn't the nicest looking to say the least, but it mostly works. The game runs okay-ish, but it's missing a lot of graphical settings (including an FOV slider).

Exploration:
- Underwater locations may initially seem very tempting and intriguing, but as the time goes on you'll be mostly looking at the same assets, looting the same items from the same containters. Then again, it's a small indie team, don't expect dog knows what.
- Non-flooded parts of the map consist mostly of what remains of cities and makeshift structures made out of thin metal.
- Most of exploration is done via boat to quickly move around the waters and ""on foot"" by diving to get the loot.
- Aforementioned above water level outposts are controlled by factions. Factions mostly serve a function of a gear check. The further down you go on the list, the better equipped the NPCs are and require better gear to take them out. Other than that, despite having some lore attached to them, they're just dudes with weapons. There's no karma system where if you fight faction X, faction Y likes you more and/or faction Z likes you less. Not right now at least.
- The world map that you have access to right from the start marks unexplored points of interest with question marks. Every visited POI will show your scavenging progress, in %. The game doesn't tell you what counts towards this precentage, so enjoy finding that on your own.
- There's also a trader (only one on the entire map, kinda weird but okay) that you actually have to trade with. Majority of items don't have a set value, so keep adding items to the trade menu until the Trader lady is satisfied with the offer.
- There are lootable blueprints that unlock unique vehicles, weapons or decor items.
- There's no compass.
- Once you visit an enemy outpost, the game displays on the HUD who owns that outpost, but the map doesn't keep track of that. This is rather important as progression is tied to who you can raid with your current gear.
- POIs have no visible borders on the map, so if you wanna clear something in 100%, you may end up wondering where do you even have to look.

Surviving:
- There's hunger, thirst and energy meters. Compared to other games in the genre they seem to deplete at a reasonable pace. Food sources are plentiful and as long as you keep visiting new places, it's very hard to run out of food.
- Energy can be replenished by sleeping, eating or overdosing on energy drinks.
- You can start growing/farming your own food and water rather quickly.
- Food doesn't spoil and stacks.
- There's also an oxygen bar. As you progress through the game you'll craft fins that increase swimming speed and an oxygen tank of questionable usefulness (once you drain it, you have to manually refill it via a dedicated refilling station.
- Cooked dishes offer various bonuses.

Crafting/base building:
- Crafting recipes are simple. There's very few items that you make just to use them in a different crafting recipe. Most recipes use 2-3 items in varying quantities. Later in the game item requirements can get a bit grindy.
- To progress down (or up?) the tech tree, you're gonna need items that might be rare and can't be crafted from simple resources.
- For some reason all buidable containers (wooden chests, metal chests, barrels, etc.) can store the same amount of items despite having more complex crafting recipes. The only reason you'd build something else than a wood chest is to make sure they don't pop too soon when raiders start stripping your base down, or because you like how this particular container looks.
- As others mentioned before, base building aspect is missing some rather obvious pieces, like stairs or ramps. To go up or down, you'll need ladders.
- Food and ore related crafting stations only take one item at a time, so if you have a stack of fish to cook or a stack of ores to smelt, you'll have to babysit these crafting stations. I'd really like to see devs either rethink these stations or add in-between tier alternatives that let you cook/smelt more items at a time or add more items to a ""queue"".
- All buildables can be repaired for free with a hammer.
- Tearing down already built base pieces will give you 50% of the items back. Crafting stations and other buildables can be ""packed up"" using a cheap item, so you can place them somewhere else or just move your entire base.
- There's a big focus on decorating your base, so you'll find decor items very often. In large quantities. The problem here is that these decor items take inventory space. I'd like to see these items turned into blueprints that you can later build with simple resources. Have a separate tab in the building menu for them, why not?

Combat:
- Weapons range from crude axes, bows, primite pistols to modern-day military grade rifles and armors.
- There's 3 types of enemies: humans with melee, humans with guns/ranged weapons and sharks.
- If you're good at getting consistent headshots, don't bother with anything else than the deagle and the bolt action rifle. Both seem to have the highest headshot damage multipliers and will either one headshot kill or heavily damage most NPCs, until you hit the late late game.
- More powerful weapons cannot be crafted without finding a ""broken"" version of them beforehand, so keep exploring and raiding NPC outposts.
- As I've mentioned before, NPCs of all factions will raid your base as the time goes on. The difficulty of raids seems to depend on how many in-game days have passed and not on how well equipped you are. You may find yourself in a situation where you're overrun by NPCs that use primitive guns while you're still mostly swinging axes or bats like a caveman. This is one of the areas of the game that developers are actively adjusting as the game gets patched.
- There's barely any warning before a raid takes place. You can be chilling at your base, crafting or doing whatever, suddenly the combat music stars playing and you hear screams and gunshots. This is something that devs definitely should change and give players some prep time to prepare for the fight. If you're near your base, you'll get a notification that your stuff is under attack, but again, zero prep time.
- Gun wielding NPCs are very, very aimboty and have no issues tracking you through walls, during night time or when they're being fully covered by foliage. This makes gunfights mostly boil down to sniping enemies from a safe distance to avoid cheap deaths. Especially since if you're facing equal tech level enemies, you're not gonna be tanking too many shots.
- Humanoid enemies don't respawn, so once you clear an outpost, you can use it as a base or something.

Other jank/bugs/quirks:
- If your inventory/container is full and you try adding more stuff to it, instead of the game not letting you do that, you'll just drop it on the ground. It's especially annoying if you accidentally press ""loot all"" button on the inventory UI.
- AI can sometimes shoot through solid objects or swim in the ground.
- There's bits of invisible walls here and there, sometimes you can swim through windows, other times you can't. Wonders of early access I suppose.
- Some generator powered machines have broken audio and make noises somewhere else, not where they're actually located.
- Containers that aren't fully looted will be restocked once you reload the game :^) (this one will be fixed at some point I'm sure)",1693871038,1693871171,True,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0,True,False,True

When you buy an Early Access Game you expect that, and you know it will eventually be all nice and shiny. 

My husband and I have really enjoyed the game, there is a ton of stuff to do, the ocean is fun to explore. The PVE aspect of the game make's it fun and challenging. The game feels like if Atlas and Rust had a baby, you would get Sunkenland. I would recommend this game only to people who are frequent players to Early Access games, and like games like Atlas, Ark Rust, Small Land, and can have a sense of humor with some of these glitches.

I do believe they plan to keep the game PVE, but you can host a server and turn friendly fire on, and get the feel for PVP. Although you can open it up for up to 15 people I here it's not a good idea at this time, 5 or 6 people is good. The way the game is set up is so it doesn't become toxic like so many other games like this have become, which is why they probably wont be opening up server's for large amounts of people.

At the moment i found this game to get pretty stale really quick, it is enjoyable kind of smooth to play don't get me wrong and it could be great but i shall say reasons why i'm not engaged that much in it,

At the start the game is nice you are exploring getting the basics and building your base ect.
but i found myself just going out looking at island's and come across one with a lot of gun men, it was good fun and i took them out with my cross bow by keeping nice long distance. but after that i got a nice hunting rifle and did another island and that went really easy. all this would be great but once you clear an island, thats it mobs don't respawn, loot don't respawn (unless you leave a single item in the crate and reload your game it refresh's the loot ;) ) and thats when i got kind of board, i would of prefered mobs to respawn and loot so it gives you a reason to progress at a nice slow easy pace rather than force you out further for components (you are forever searching for these btw lol) making you go to harder areas quicker.
The AI needs a good polish, the movement on them is kind of janky
and they could be a bit more tactical about coming at your base.

The exploration of the underwater world to me is just magic. I love the sunken cities and freeways. It's eerily beautiful. The water is nicely done,  I love the random decorations, especially neon kitty <3.

The controls work fine, no issues once i set the mouse sensitivity to max and set my mouse to max dpi as well. 

Maybe I don't see it, but I do wish items could be destroyed instead of just dropped. They don't seem to despawn ever. It would be nice to use charcoal as well as wood in forges or grills maybe. The metal walls I think could use a retexture maybe, they seem to look a bit like thin tissue paper with holes, so I went with wood.

I love that you can turn raids off or on. Since I'm playing single player and just wanted to explore, build, and fight what I ran across vs having to stop and run back to base to stop a raid, I'm allowed to do that.

There is so many neat aspects of this game. I really wanted to keep playing. BUT the server settings did not save so we were unaware that it was open to people. So some jerk logged on, and wiped our base, destroyed both our boats and left us stranded across the map. There was no fail safes to help us. There was no notification to let us know someone was in the server. It just really sucks. This game has potential but it's LACKING SO MUCH.

Pros:
crafting
exploration
new places
new things to find
surprisingly large amount of blue prints to find

cons
glitchy
hit boxes are really only for you. the NPCs can hit you thru a wall from a mile away.
zero server safety
only notification are for npcs attacking your base ( not randos)
no way to lock homes to non clan members. (like ark)

Game durchgespielt. 

Bugs : 
- Gegner schießen durch Wände und haben den aimbot ihres Lebens. 
- Multiplayer macht probleme. Öffnet ein nicht Host eine Kiste kann der Host sie unter Umständen nicht mehr öffnen obwohl der Spieler die Kiste schon lange geschlossen hat
- keine Karten Begrenzung. Bei -7000 ist unser Heli stecken geblieben ohne Sprit 
- Hitboxen verhalten sich merkwürdig
- Drag von Munition falsch/ Fadenkreuz auch falsch 
- Etagen bauen unmöglich da keine einrast funktion da ist und sich auch kein Boden platzieren lässt 

Positiv ist es macht Laune. 
Negativ es hat sich mit dem kontent relativ schnell ausgelebt. 
Nach dem alle Inseln ausgeräuchert wurden und alles gebaut wurde gab's nichts mehr zu tun. 

Ich hätte mir gewünscht das man mehr Möglichkeiten beim Bauen hat. 
Mehr Möglichkeiten seine Waffen zu modifizieren.
Skill Level. Random loot und spawns. Mehr Gegner Vielfalt. Unter Wasser gäbe es viele Möglichkeiten. Zb ein U Boot, Harpunen mit denen man Haie fertig machen kann. 
Da gibt's noch sehr viel Luft nach oben.

Your typical survival crafting game with horde and raiding elements. Pretty easy to figure out, nothing really complicated. Extensive building and crafting recipes. As its early access you can expect a bit of jankieness and some bugs but they're not too bothersome. Hunger and thirst are easy to manage. Finding lots of wood is hard after you've picked your island clean, because now you have to venture off to other islands with overpowered enemies. You can scavenge wood from bellow the water but its simply not enough.

My biggest complaint is the combat: Enemies are wayy too overpowered, swinging weapons much faster that you can, sometimes they have aim-bot, killing you way too easily. Your character is slow and sluggish. The combat seriously needs to be balanced better! Its a very good thing it doesn't take too long to respawn and you don't permanently loose everything upon death, unless you truly can't reach it; I don't know if there is a despawn timer on dropped loot from your corpse.

Overall, I would say an 8/10 at this moment. However, at this version(update 1.20) I would have few comments from the point of view of a single player.
1. The NPCs seems to be too aggressive. Started with day 3 they attacked me every day. if I hadn't seen some walktrough before I wouldn't make it. Seems the NPCs don't spend time to gather food and stuff. All they want is me and my little island! Maybe a camouflage of the camp will help. And why they want so much my little island , there are no viable resources here! I know, the game know everything about you and want to kill you!
2. The company changed the food and water gathering geometry. IMHO takes too long to do that and let you too less time to gather resources, even if you don't sleep(need to use those medicine from mushroom and strawberry).
3. I visited few inhabited islands but nowhere found potable water and I didn't find some water purifier(BTW, there are other few methods to obtain potable water, other than purifier!). It's hard to believe they drink only Coke! (why not Pepsi or Schweppes too ?! xD)
4. Even if the NPCs are very good swimmer, I didn't encounter them gather resources underwater. How they lives, what they eat? And most important, why I can't sneak and steal their food and resources? xD
5. Why all factions are hostile? And why they don't fight each other? Aha, they waiting for me to kill me and everybody will be happy!
6. The trader is not part of a faction and I don't know how she survive alone and without defense. And please make her stop to rob me in the trade!
7. I think will be nice to have a friend (like Victoria in Son of the forest) to give some task to do when you are busy. Even some dialogues will be nice too!
8. In this version I have some experience with the paddle boat. It started to shaking and fly away few times but I manage to recover it after press F-drive. BTW, can I change this key please? I'm not a fan of the WSAD sequence, sorry for that.

I had fun playing it, I had more fun playing it than Raft. Even though it's early access there's actually a lot to do, if you're not sweating - I can see this game taking a good 60 hours to research and unlock everything. There's plenty of items right now, hopefully they will add more. 

With that said, this game is rough around the edges. The UI needs a big makeover, everything is a button, I.e ""split"", ""drop"". Simply dragging the item out of the inventory UI should drop it. Another big thing that bugs me (that may just be me)the loot inventory vs your inventory, usually your inventory is on the left, while what you're looking at is on the right. I don't know why but that just bugs the shit out of me.

The AI are a bit too good, should probably give them a bloom effect so they can actually miss their shots. 
Base building is decent, the decorations are pretty nice. Hopefully we'll see more.

Nevertheless, my excitement is fueled by the recently unveiled development roadmap, promising exciting updates on the horizon.

It's essential to keep in mind that Sunkenland remains in its early access phase, which means encountering occasional bugs is par for the course. Despite this, if given the chance, I would unquestionably purchase it again.

In the vast sea of survival games, Sunkenland stands out as a promising title that offers players a unique and immersive experience. As a dedicated player of survival games with over 2200 games in my library, I was intrigued by Sunkenland's premise and decided to take the plunge into its post-apocalyptic underwater world.

Gameplay (⭐⭐⭐⭐): A Multifaceted Adventure

The gameplay in Sunkenland is a mix of crafting, exploration, and survival mechanics, creating a multifaceted adventure that keeps players engaged. Gathering resources, crafting tools, and constructing underwater bases are just a few activities that contribute to the game's dynamic gameplay.

One commendable feature is the progression system. Starting with basic tools and advancing through tiers of technology adds a satisfying sense of accomplishment. This progression structure enables players to adapt and overcome the challenges posed by the submerged landscape.

One aspect that distinguishes Sunkenland's gameplay is the presence of AI enemies. From traditional zombies to more complex adversaries like slavers and cultists, these enemies inject a level of danger and excitement into the gameplay. What particularly caught my attention was the fact that these NPCs aren't mere background elements. Instead, they actively raid your base, growing progressively more formidable as you advance through the game. This unique dynamic adds an element of tension and strategy to base-building efforts, pushing players to strategize and reinforce their defenses to fend off relentless invasions.

Enemy AI (⭐⭐⭐⭐): A Dynamic Challenge

In a world ravaged by apocalyptic events, AI enemies are a constant threat in Sunkenland. The game introduces a variety of enemies, each requiring different tactics for successful combat. From close-quarters engagements with zombies to more intricate interactions with slavers and cultists, the diversity of AI adversaries adds depth to the game's narrative and challenges.

One intriguing aspect of enemy AI is their raiding behavior. While currently, NPCs swim to your base for raids, this might not be the developers' long-term intention. It's possible that this mechanic is a temporary solution until more advanced raiding tactics, like NPC boats, are implemented—a future feature that holds the promise of even more engaging gameplay dynamics.

While the current array of enemies might not pose a significant challenge to experienced survival gamers, the developers' plans to introduce new enemy types and combat mechanics are exciting prospects. These additions could potentially elevate the game's combat dynamics and introduce fresh excitement to encounters with hostile factions.

Character Customization (⭐⭐⭐): Crafting Your Avatar

Character customization is a feature that allows players to personalize their avatars, albeit with some limitations. At present, the available options are somewhat constrained, and the character models may appear dated. However, it's important to remember that Sunkenland is still in early access, and character customization is an area that will likely see improvement over time.

The developers have expressed intentions to expand and enhance the customization features in the future. This includes the addition of more outfit options and refinements to visual aspects. As the game progresses, players can anticipate a broader array of choices to create avatars that truly resonate with them.

Server Selection (⭐⭐⭐): A Work in Progress

Sunkenland's current server selection is modest, mainly comprising player-created games with a limited number of slots. However, the developers have indicated plans to enrich the multiplayer experience with increased customization and control options. This suggests that the server selection will become more varied and expansive as the game evolves.

Exploration and Map (⭐⭐⭐⭐): Diving into the Unknown

Sunkenland's map beckons with the promise of exploration, presenting a world with diverse islands to discover. Yet, the standout aspect is the underwater setting—a departure from many other survival games that prioritize above-water activities. This unique approach adds a layer of mystery and excitement, encouraging players to dive into the depths of a post-apocalyptic universe.

However, there's potential to elevate the experience further by expanding the map. With a water-based gameplay focus, introducing a larger map could provide even more opportunities for exploration. The addition of larger boats or ships would enhance immersion, encouraging players to embrace the vastness of the underwater expanse. Future plans to introduce raidable islands and atolls with varying challenges and rewards indicate exciting prospects for exploration.

Performance (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐): A Smooth Submersion

Performance is a strong point for Sunkenland, particularly considering its early access status. Running the game on a high-end gaming PC with Windows 11 Pro, an Intel Core i9-12900K CPU, 32 GB DDR5-4800 RAM, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti GPU, and stored on an NVMe drive, the game remains smooth on maximum settings. Frame rates remain stable during intense moments, ensuring an immersive and enjoyable gameplay experience.

Sunkenland: A Rising Tide of Potential

In conclusion, Sunkenland is an early access game with immense promise. Its blend of crafting, exploration, and survival mechanics, coupled with its distinctive underwater setting, makes for an engaging and memorable experience. While some aspects like character customization and enemy AI are still evolving, the developers' roadmap and commitment to continuous improvement signal a bright future for the game. With further refinements and additions, Sunkenland has the potential to rise above the waves and become a true standout in the survival genre.",1693779661,1693809536,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

As is it is already almost at the amount of time I spent or is due to previous sale to match the time. But with the future updates I will be playing it much more. 

Long as the random generation with the re-spawn loot gets implemented I will play it a lot more. Get peps though to help, it goes fast a fair bit but slows down some for MUCH needed certain resources. Get fun guns though to deal with the factions while doing so. Makes the slightly tedious stuff more fun to do and shoot. 

Expect a fair bit of bugs though. Can be normally fixed with simple in and out but little annoying after in-game for a good while, then it's back to being fun again. Being especially at version 0.1 for what it has now. Roadmap been shown to, not 100% obviously due to possible events and what not as mentioned depending on peps yet if so this will be even more incredible.

But so many annoying bug and design decisions.

Enemy AI are stupid, They just keep shooting your base and nothing much.
But combat is so hard and not fun on high difficulty because many reasons.
1The game was so dark night raid feel like guessing game, You can barely saw enemy even with light around your base.
2Enemy are bullet sprong if you play alone it so annoying to shoot them all down in gun fight.
3Enemy are so buggy they just can shoot me from behind even if they aiming at my friends from other siode.
3Enemy shot you from behind wall.
4Weapons balance are stupid, Late game raid I the gun was so useless I keep spamming Granade.

Your base building was so lame too only 2 trap that so useless since enemy barely walk to them, they just shot you from a far.
Farming parts to build your base is not fun, the node for each ore or part NEVER respawn when it depleted.
So it came down to cheesing by collecting them without let them depleted, Save and exit and collect them again.
So stupid .
and many many more problem.

So let wait and see them patch.
At current stage it fun because co op only.

I've not unlocked everything yet but I feel like the amount of time I've put in vs the amount of progress ive made is just about right. 
Its scratching that harvest/gather and loot/build itch that I used to get from ARK but in a new setting that I really enjoy. The waterworld theme has always been something I really liked and thought would make for a pretty cool survival game. I would say my only big criticism so far is the random NPC raids on your base ramped up in difficulty pretty quick and they are able to just shred my base to pieces way too easy. I lose so much progress just from a single raid that I spend most of my time trying to rebuild instead of being able to progress the crafting tree's.

It’s in early access, so I don’t hold any of the following criticisms against the dev team, these are just some subjective observations.  I’m hoping these observations are improved in the future.  I don’t have a lot of time in this game.  I haven’t played multiplayer, I haven’t taken over enemy islands, so take this with a grain of salt.

Most of the issues I’ve run into are UI/UX issues.  The game looks and plays great but the UI/UX and inventory management feels very tacked on.  There’s a lot of general interface issues that are expected in these types of games that are just not there. A lot of pros to this game, but I’m only listing the cons for visibility as I think these issues being fixed will massively improve the experience of this game.

Even if this list seems “negative”, I’m still giving this a positive review.  As a fellow game dev, I understand these issues are easily remedied and the devs rely on feedback to improve their game.

The aesthetics vs. form/fit/function seem way unbalanced.  There is such a focus on aesthetics/decorations that the other core parts of the game are suffering.

Settings:
- My monitor refresh/v-sync settings are not correct.  I get an obnoxious sync issue with my monitor.  I need all monitor options,(it only gives me the 50Hz options, but I need 59Hz).  The vertical sync is very distracting.
- Mouse speed, even set to max (which I think is 6.0) is still pretty slow for the maximum mouse speed.  This range needs to be increased.

Storage / Item Management
- There’s no incentive to build resource specific storage containers unless you are going for an aesthetic only feature.  They hold magnitudes less resources than just building a basic wooden chest and take up more footprint.  Why build a wood/scrap metal storage when they hold less storage than two full stacks of a basic chest?
- Why can’t I take all from a resource storage (wood/scrap)?  I have to take one unit at a time?  This is very obnoxious as the audio just spams as I click to take one unit at a time.  Please add a “take all” from the resource storage.
- Same goes with building refrigerators, etc.  There’s no item spoil time so why build these except for aesthetics?  They are way more expensive than just building a basic wooden chest.
- Why do I have to drop the item on a button to “split” or drop?  Why is there no split-in-half shortcut (like shift click?  Why can’t I drag an item into “nothing” on the UI to drop it?
- [bug] Adding a water bucket filled with seawater to a storage container and retrieving it doesn’t count as being filled with water even though the “fill bar” is full?  I have to fill it again.  Probably a bug.
- Grabbing loot from a container after your inventory fills up just drops it on the ground.  I’m not watching my inventory slots as I try to take items.  Just stop trying to take items when full?  Why pull it out and drop it on the ground?  Now I have to managed dropped items on the ground.
- If my backpack is full by my belt is not, why not fill up the belt?  Instead I have to move stuff to the belt to save some slots.

Map
- What is the percentage next to locations on a map?  Is this % looted?  I’m assuming so but there’s no information on what this value means.
- The maps are static.  I was a little disappointed by this but this isn’t a game breaking mechanic.  A lot of games do static maps but I was hoping for a procedurally generated world on every world creation.  There are still random elements when looting.

Game Save/Load
- I had to restart 3 times.  My machine crashed when saving when exiting.  This corrupted my save.  Then after replaying the world again, I couldn’t save over it again for apparently the same corruption issue?  Why not just overwrite?  Why not backup the save file before the exit/save in case of corruption as a fallback?
- Loading back into a saved game is janky.  I’ve had logs just laying around for no reason, etc.  I start at the original starting position then the game moves me to the saved character positions and just starts popping stuff in.  This doesn’t look clean.  Early access though, I get it!

There are more notes I would like to add but I think this is a good start.  I hope the devs treat this as a labor of love because there’s so much potential here.  I think this can prove to be a great game if they improve the quality of life/user experience.  Again, it’s early access so it is what it is.  Hopefully I will get to remove this review in praise of the game they are wanting to make.

not clunky
good graphics
fun mechanics
interesting concept
would be awesome with friends, i have none
you can now move your crafted stuff with packing box
fish nets now make fish
you can stack your inventory crates on top of each other now

IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED not cons.
still need bigger item stacks of 50 would be great
maybe add a crate that can hold up to 50 items
need resources to respawn, right now i get to respawn by saving, leaving, quitting, and restarting, and it will respawn some stuff, randomly depends.
when farming items in grow boxes, needs to yeild seeds too to make it self sustaining. 
need more iron nodes, or turning scrap into iron...so much of it.

I love how you can build anywhere, raids get harder, and it's a thought out game for being early access. Great game for any seasoned survival player.. or newbie. Not too much of a grind, but there is a sense of accomplishment. 12 hrs deep and I have all the research tables upgraded, and my main base done. You could easily speedrun this and do it all under 4 hrs. Expect to take about 8-12 hrs to have end game progression. Lots of fun to still be had in the endgame with helis, base optimization, and better materials. Very very excited to see where this game goes.

#1 - LOOT RESPAWN. ( does not respawn at the moment, so im not sure where that takes the game for the long run, but im new to game)

#2- SERVER OPTIONS FOR HOST. ( unless you put a password, HACKERS, TROLLS, GRIEFERS etc can randomly spawn in and destroy everything in a few seconds. the host at minimum needs the sole option to kick people. otherwise you have to put a password and no one can join unless of course you know them.

At first I was drawn right in and really enjoyed the game.  Started building an inventory of wood and scrap metal.  Began building up my base, made a (bugged) fish trap that caught fish, but never gave them to me.  Made a crate to store all of my overflow items.  Things were going great!  I started to unlock more items via the crafting table, made everything you would need (and some) to survive.  Then the NPC raiders came.  I was able to fight them off, would die a few time, but managed to defend my base.  However, I haven't been able to upgrade my weapons as quickly as these guys can.  I'm defending my base with a single shot flint lock and crossbow, while these f***ers come in with automatic weapons and what sounds like a 50cal rifle.  8-10 at a time making short work of my reinforced walls.  Then the domino effect of destruction to my furnaces, weapons craft table, armor craft table, all of my barrels, etc.  16 hours of building up this base, trying to find the appropriate resources to make better weapons and traps, but after a raid I'm busy repairing.  Next thing i know, it's nightfall and there's not much that you can do (gathering-wise) at night, because you get frosty (I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt, pants, gloves, but doesn't matter).  So I go out in the morning and gather.  It's always wood, scrap metal, glass, rubber, circuit board (if I'm lucky, usually not), a few components, and cloth.  I've heard there's leather, but I've only found like 8 in 16 hours of game play.  I'm currently typing up this ""review"", because I'm not sure if I want to continue playing after my base was annihilated during the last NPC raid on my base.  My current question is, ""why should I continue playing?"".  So I can spend another 16 hours collecting enough items to maybe make something to defend off 8 guys at a time that ALWAYS know where you're at.  You can't sneak them, they know you're hiding behind that rock, wall, whatever.  They're waiting to one shot you.  Just avoid them?  All of my ammo is with my dead body and have no way of getting it without confronting them.  I would sneak them, but alas I've already stated how that goes.  So yeah, that's where I am with this game.  I will probably go back in and see if I can't re-fortify my demolished base.  The game has been fun up until having everything destroyed.  
Also, I feel like if murder everyone on an enemy occupied base, then that base is mine.  I've built markers on them afterwards, was even able to build a structure on them, but it still showed that it was occupied by an enemy faction.  Seems like it should be mine.  
I've clicked yes for the ""Would you recommend this game to other players?"" question, because as I said I've really enjoyed the game up until this point.  I probably just suck at the game and others are finding it to be ridiculously easy.  Therefore, you should try it if you're looking for a survival game and form your own opinion.

Somewhat Upsetting ""bugs"": The game at the moment is REALLY rough around the edges, building is kind of a pain because placement snapping is a little goofy and is really picky about where you're standing and where you are looking. You also cannot as of the moment pick up things you built, only demolish, and demolishing an object/structure is sometimes with diminishing returns. An example would be a wall costs 3 wood, sometimes you get 3 wood back, sometimes 2, sometimes 1. Any collectible items/furnishings you find are completely destroyed when ""demolished"". So better be happy where you place them. So far, all objects HAVE to have a foundation under them to place them unless it's very specific things like defenses and such. Can't have a planter box on the dirt, can't have a pump, smelter, or cooker on the dirt. (Some might argue the game somewhat ""implores"" you to build on the water itself to make up for most of these issues. More building room, more choices etc. etc. Trees respawn when relogging which is a HUGE mess to clean up if your base was built where trees spawn. They break and fly all over the place. A fun ""bug"" in my opinion though is the ability to sit on a boat and push it, allowing you to almost hit mach 1, especially if friends are pushing it too, in the same direction of course. (Honestly I hope they keep this as a toggle-able option when starting a game.)

Missing things you'd expect: Stairs, ramps, slopes, half-walls. The roadmap says they are coming but I'm writing this as review of the game of my play so far so it may change.

Balancing: I feel personally the game lacks when it comes to storage/stacking as stacks of wood go only to 20, and scrap metal to 10. You can see the issue here as these two materials are primary crafting ingredients and will fill slots very very quickly. The dedicated wood/scrap storage containers only hold three stacks of their respective items. A barrel can hold a 5x5 grid? I could be a little off but you get the picture, basically you can have 1 barrel in the place of three or more scrap/wood storage racks. And they are considerably cheaper to make too. Personally I'd say to make stacks a much larger quantity, get rid of the dedicated scrap/wood storages or make them hold an far more than any other container in the game to make use of it more often.

Good thoughts: The Co-op is incredibly seamless and built into steam server integration which makes it super easy for friends to get together and play. The crew on the discord page is highly interactive and always looking through bug reports as well as suggestions. Half of my complaints are already written down as well as many more I didn't cover in this review. So they seem to be constantly improving and taking notes from the community which is always a plus in my book, customers who feel heard feel well taken care of. Even more so if these complaints are actually encountered and made right. Buy this game if you want to be part of the early seeds sown and of a growing community.

Bad thoughts: This could just be another grab-n-go where the dev makes a half decent game, seems super involved and just leaves the game in a horrible state and disappears with all the cash. Don't buy this game yet if you are worried about this. Wait a while.

TL:DR - Game has a lot a of bugs, can look really pretty, has base building and resource management and can be a lot of fun with friends. It's basically Rust/Raft/Fallout 4 all mashed up. No dedicated server is required to play with friends. Buy it if you're willing to toss 20 dollars away, don't if you're worried the dev won't continue to take care of it.

One has already been patched. A bug where when pausing the game in a sail boat the speed will continue to climb and when coming out of the pause menu the boat would get launched at mach 1 (exaggeration) into the closest island. The second being a random wood spawning bug where in you save and log out then log back in quickly and around 8 full logs and 15 branches randomly appear on my island base. lastly, the collision boxes for things like ladders, cars, trucks, and barricades are enormous and prove to be a fat pain in the ass when fighting.

Base building is extremely basic, if you try to build anywhere other than in the middle of the ocean you will have problems with building vertically and snapping elements with each other. Storage options are outright stupid, somehow a small box can store more scrap metal than a fucking shelve.

I am having a blast playing it. 
I wish I could have had this one in my line up a long time ago.
From the start, you can set the difficulty settings. Best part is you can modify them later.
Let's review.

Pro's-
1. It has genuine co-op.
2. Co-op and Worlds couldn't be simpler to join or create.
3. The Graphics and Music are spot on.
4. The concept itself is fantastic. - Dive and loot!
5. So much to do. Never gets boring.
6. Want to build a base or a Mega stricture? Feel free.
7. Want to hunt Marlin or Sharks? It's here.
8. Want build a boat and go exploring? Sure thing.
9. Want to grow your own plants? Yep
10. Want some AI combat? Gear up and go to battle.
11. Want to visit a trader and swap your items for theirs? She is always open.
12. Want to go visit the Nudist colony? Nope- Sorry not in the game.

Cons-
Only 1 that sticks out. Once you place anything, you can't move it or destroy it.

This game is getting a lot of updates.
For an early access, I am super impressed. This game is very polished.
When you first go to log on, there is a list of current content and also a list of future content.
The dev's are on top of the bugs and are actively working on content. A+++
If you are even thinking about a super fun game, this is it. 
Pull the trigger and get it. You won't be sorry.

The scrap roof piece shape is ok but there should be normal roof pieces as well. One of the most important things to me is being able to pick stuff back up and move it. MAJOR drawback that you cannot do that. Even breaking something down takes a bit too much. The batteries and air tanks go down waaaay too fast. Rotating pieces does not work.

With more islands this game will be one of the best survival games. <3 and there is an active team. and hopefully they make a weather feature too",1693675399,1693675475,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Firstly 
Yes there is bugs but its early access and there is a section in the discord to report bugs and tbh they aint game breaking.
Secondly the devs are super active and constantly fixing the bugs and improving the game!
