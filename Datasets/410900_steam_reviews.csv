Upsides:
1. Very unique and interesting concept, there are barely any games like this
2. The multiplayer is very fun to play
3. The campains (especially high seas) are interesting
4. Very high skill ceiling
5. The community isn't toxic at all, and you can have some nice conversations in the in-game chat.
6. The game is being constantly supported, and they release dlcs regularly
7. The developers listen to player feedback, for example, after the community expressed desire for ship battles, they came up with an entire new dlc which adds just that (please do note, high seas is a wonderful dlc, and if you ever want do buy this game you should also buy high seas)
8. 4v4 maps are a whole lot of fun, as they're a lot less stressful than 1v1 or 2v2 (the game also has 3v3 but there's only a couple of maps for that)
9. Extensive modding and mapping community
Some things I don't like about this game:
1. Most gamemodes aside from normal 4v4  battles (for example that capture point thing that Moonshot introduced) are kind of unrefinded, and aren't very fun to play
2. Some campaigns have large flaws and there are large difficulty spikes in all of them. 
3. Overall, the campaign for the base game could get an upgrade. It doesn't include the tons of guns free expansion, which makes for a very lackluster variety of weapons (like there are only 10 or so weapons INCLUDING UPGRADES) and the level designs get somewhat boring at some point
4. Despite the weapon balance being great, some weapons are a bit too weak and aren't used that often (for example I never see shotguns actually get used that often, same with 20mm cannons which deal pitiful damage)
5. Anti-air is sometimes a chore, and missiles can be frustrating to counter
6. The game can be really stressful
7. The moonshot dlc, despite adding some more depth to the game, was kinda dissapointing in its lack of content and boring campaign
8. Winning multiplayer battles relies a lot on the player being able to follow certain early-game schemes to build up their forts and on gaining better weapons as fast as possible, 
Despite all the flaws, the game is great and you should definitely buy it.",1708539450,1708539450,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

There are so many bugs in this game. The game isent even that good to begin with. If the game was good i would leave a positive review.

I'd also say that the game is very well balanced. The vanilla forts experience tends to be difficult to predict, but you'd also know if you're outmatched; that doesn't mean you can't win. 
Good luck finding a vanilla server, or one with balanced modifications. Some mods are simply designed to be unbalanced, for the fun of a far more chaotic game. Even though these mods take from the vanilla aspects, many of the best often add their own interesting quirks.

Unfortunately it's not really made to play solo, without real humans. Yes, there is a campaign, but its more like a tutorial on how the game works. And in the online lobbies, you mostly find tryhards or people who are just really good at the game - which is not a fun experience for beginners. 
Can still recommend it, but maybe wait for a sale, if you're not sure.

I can't play this due to a handicap, because it's realtime, not necessary for single player. Also the controls are too hard, it's impossible for me to repair for instance.

I am 27.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.",1703471650,1703701324,True,0,0,0.496192902326583862,0,True,False,False

My son found this game at my house, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 276 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his work buddies or just watching tutorial videos. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

It's also pretty unique when it comes to RTS games, as most of them, especially ones with roots in the 90's, are top-down or isometric view games where you control units to move around maps while expanding your base for resource locations and simultaneously build up an army. Instead, Forts is a stationary one, which although conceptually may seem quite a bit more boring, it strangely isn't. Maybe it's the physics element to it that makes it satisfying to hit a weak spot and see as your enemy's base crumbles, or maybe it's something else, I'm not sure. Some things I would complain about though is that unit/weapon selection, especially when it comes to control grouping, isn't as intuitive as in other games (such as in StarCraft) which could be improved on, and the fact that the auto Anti-Air AI is kind of stupid, but other than that, its a great game, and I probably would recommend to people who generally enjoy RTS games, its just good fun ig.",1647836968,1701355496,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

In the vast landscape of indie gaming, Forts 2017, developed by EarthWork Games, emerges as a beacon of strategic ingenuity and explosive combat. As players delve into the dynamic fusion of base-building and real-time battles, they find themselves navigating a virtual battlefield where the height of their fortress mirrors the depth of their tactical prowess. This review embarks on an in-depth exploration of Forts, dissecting its gameplay dynamics, visual aesthetics, room for improvement, community engagement, and the enduring appeal that positions it as a noteworthy entry in the strategy gaming realm.

Gameplay Dynamics:
At its core, Forts presents players with a unique challenge: construct an impregnable fortress armed with an arsenal of weapons, each more devastating than the last. The game's construction mechanics seamlessly blend intuition with intricacy, allowing players to craft fortresses that are both aesthetically impressive and strategically sound. The inclusion of a physics engine adds a layer of realism, forcing players to consider structural stability in the midst of explosive chaos. This balance of creativity and strategy serves as the game's cornerstone, setting it apart from traditional strategy titles.

In the single-player campaign, Forts leads players through a series of progressively challenging scenarios, introducing them to an array of weapons and tactics. However, the true brilliance of Forts manifests in its multiplayer mode. Engaging in battles of wits and firepower with friends or online opponents transforms the experience into a dynamic, unpredictable symphony of destruction. Coordinating attacks, adapting to enemy strategies, and witnessing meticulously crafted fortresses crumble under relentless assaults create moments of sheer satisfaction and adrenaline-pumping excitement.

Visual Appeal and Atmosphere:
Visually, Forts embraces a charming and cartoonish aesthetic that complements its lighthearted and approachable nature. While the game doesn't strive for photorealism, it effectively conveys the chaos of battle and the destructive power of its diverse arsenal. The soundtrack, though not particularly groundbreaking, provides a fitting backdrop to the gameplay, enhancing the overall experience without overshadowing the on-screen action.

Room for Improvement:
While Forts excels in many aspects, there is room for improvement. The game's mission objectives and environments, while entertaining, can exhibit a degree of repetitiveness over extended play sessions. More variety in challenges and landscapes could have injected additional depth into the gameplay and prolonged overall engagement. However, it's crucial to note that the core mechanics and the sheer joy of watching carefully constructed fortresses crumble under the weight of battle mitigate this drawback to a considerable extent.

Community Engagement:
Forts has earned commendable support from its developers, evident in regular updates and additional content that enrich the gaming experience. The modding community has played a pivotal role in extending the game's lifespan and replayability. This collaborative effort between developers and players ensures that Forts remains a dynamic and evolving entity in the gaming landscape.

The multiplayer community, in particular, adds a vibrant layer to Forts' longevity. Engaging with fellow players in a thriving online ecosystem, sharing strategies, and witnessing the creative approaches others bring to the battlefield contribute significantly to the game's enduring appeal.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, Forts 2017 offers a delightful and distinctive gaming experience that successfully marries strategic depth with explosive real-time action. Its innovative take on base-building, coupled with the thrill of demolishing opponents' fortresses, positions it as a standout choice for strategy gaming enthusiasts. While the potential for more variety in missions exists, the engaging multiplayer dynamics and the creative construction elements make Forts a compelling addition to any gamer's library.

As the indie gaming scene continues to evolve, Forts remains a shining example of how creativity and innovation can thrive in the gaming world. Its enduring appeal serves as a testament to the game's ability to capture the imagination of players, inviting them into a world where architectural prowess meets strategic brilliance. Forts 2017 isn't just a game; it's an ever-expanding battlefield where creativity takes center stage, ensuring its place in the pantheon of indie gaming classics.",1670903780,1700102115,True,4,1,0.556616663932800293,0,True,False,False

☐ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☑ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS
The graphics convey the current state of the game well and are not distractingly good or bad.

---{ Gameplay }---
☑ Very good
☐ Good
☐ It's just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't
You first build up your economy and defenses, then attack and repair. However, this is not a set rule and you can do whatever you want at any time. All activities are engaging.

---{ Audio }---
☐ Eargasm
☐ Very good
☑ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad
☐ I'm now deaf
Music is well suited to the game and changes with gameplay.

---{ Audience }---
☐ Kids
☑ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ Grandma
Some gameplay elements/strategy may be unsuited for short attention spans.

---{ PC Requirements }---
☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☑ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer
Starts a little slow, but never lags unless you’ve got a nuke mod or something.

---{ Difficulty }---
☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Significant brain usage
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls
The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, but different strategies and tactics can be difficult to learn or invent. The campaign is more difficult than others, but not exceedingly so.

---{ Grind }---
☐ Nothing to grind
☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☐ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You'll need a second life for grinding
Progress is on a game by game basis, but there is a leaderboard/ranked mode.

---{ Story }---
☐ No Story
☑ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☐ It'll replace your life
The campaign has some dialogue and a very minor, basic story.

---{ Game Time }---
☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond
Games can take anywhere from 5 to upwards of 20 minutes depending on many factors, like the map and your skill relative to your opponent.

---{ Price }---
☐ It's free!
☐ Worth the price
☑ If it's on sale
☐ If you have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money
If the price included all the DLC, it would be more than worth it. However, I think the current price is about $5 too much for the included content. I got the game on sale for ~$7. The DLC are not well priced.

---{ Bugs }---
☑ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
The only bugs encountered were due to 3rd part mods, and even then, they were very minor. This suggests a robust modding framework.

Overall, a well put-together game with lots of replayability and community content.

- regular ladder seasons and active development
- three campaigns (with all current DLCs) that i quite enjoyed. but beware, in high seas on hard there is one mission that kicks your ass

The game is a very unique take on RTS and has tons of potential, however, there's no skill-based matchmaking, so it's very hard to learn the game as chances are you're going to die by very experienced players running the same meta loadout as they always do. Anything after the first campaign is just as bad, there seems to be nowhere for casual or new players to go to relax / learn in this game. In the end it's either you figure it out, struggle through pain and torture before figuring it out, or give up entirely. I'm sad it's this way as I love the concept of the game. However, if you love an arms rush and don't mind being punished for not being on the same skill level as most other players, it's a fantastic game and I would recommend it.

Onto the real review, I never thought I'd be writing a negative review about this game. I, (probably) like yourself, have been considering this game for years because of how fun it looks to play from watching YouTube and streams. Let this be a warning - The main aspect of the game, the PvP, is an arms race to 3 end-game weapon combos. So much so most players will ignore all other weapons and race to get to the 3 weapons first. It is extremely hard to get your foot in the door, If you manage to then you'll have a great time! You'll be able to keep pace with most of the player base and things will feel balanced. If however you're too slow you're almost guaranteed death, repeatedly, which only leads to frustration which only hurts your performance more.

However, let's start with the good. The game is very stylized, its appearance is unique and unmistakable. The physics engine is well-made and allows for some pretty crazy shenanigans. The construction mechanics are very different and fun to play with, there's a lot of room for creativity which is sadly underutilized in the main aspect of the game (PvP) but I'll touch more on that later. The construction mechanics are very deep, watching how the bend under stress revealing weak points from previous build mistakes or damage is impressive no matter which side you're on. And of course, it's immensely satisfying to cut off large portions of your enemy, or cause them to explode directly. 
The competitive scene is huge, watching closely matched players go head to head is insanely fun and the games always feel close.

Moving on let's talk PvP. Since there's no skill-based matchmaking it's all about luck. I spent over 10 hours in PvP trying to make it work, I tried various strategies, various builds, but none of them mattered. There's an extreme meta at the moment and the devs seem to ignore it by saying ""The weaker weapons are to be used earlier and slowly be replaced as you climb the tech trees."" Sadly I disagree with this as if anyone watches competitive players they'll never use weapons outside of the meta unless they're trying to do something funny for a video, or are reliant on teammates following the meta and taking aggression while they meme around. The only exclusion to this is machine guns for anti air, and snipers for punishing build order mistakes. The only other time I've ever seen additional weapons being used seriously is in the pro leagues, and it's all about extremely early aggression, so once again it's a rush and comes down to player speed in construction. To be honest this strategy is so much more painful than the normal meta weapons race as by the time you start taking hits you'll have so little economy you're basically doomed and likely won't have enough resources as you put everything in tech trees to unlock the meta weapons as per usual. The issue is you as a new or even mediocre player can't replicate the strategy because you're simply not as fast as the pro league players.
What about all the other weapons? Surely they can be of some use no matter the meta. If you as a slower, newer player, attempt to use any other weapons than the meta ones you're putting yourself and your team behind, even more so since the enemy team likely knows how to defend against them while getting their own meta weapons up. The meta weapons are as follows; cannon spam, cannon howitzer combo, fire laser and standard laser combo. If you're not using one of these either your teammates are doing so, allowing you to do something interesting for once, or you straight up aren't going to win. Without proper matchmaking it's nearly impossible to hone your skills and build faster as you'll almost always be getting pummeled before you're even close to ready.

Well, how about the singleplayer then?
The first campaign was decent, there's a few levels that are downright awful, taking over 10 attempts (mind you each attempt can be upwards of 10-15 minutes) just to die shy of your goal. But then comes the second campaign, on the second level is where I gave up. It has you starting out in a very small base with little to no resources going up against 3 enemy AI forts that have tons of resources ready to go. I tried this mission over 20 times over various days and never got close. It's as if the devs expected their hyper competitive playerbase to come down and stomp the AI in the campaigns. There is a difficulty slider which you'd think would help with this issue, but it really doesn't seem that way. I played on medium which is required to get the first wave of achievements. For most games I pick medium when entering them for the first time as I'm there for some challenge as that's the only way you'll ever improve. With those ideas in mind, the second campaign is severely unbalanced. Within minutes I'm being pummeled by cannon fire from 3 bases and am so focused on staying alive I can never get weapons out to counterfire as the enemy just upgrades more and more until I'm gone. -- The one time I almost beat the level was by filling the front of my base with snipers and sniping as many of their guns out when they opened doors, which worked for a while on the first base and allowed me to field a meta weapon but by the time I finished off the first I was very damaged and now the other two had clear lines of sight and rapidly blew away my snipers with their meta weapons. Upon asking the community about that campaign it sounds like most of the levels require that strategy, of using snipers to counter weapons the entire time while slowly building yourself up. Why? I came to the campaign to escape the sweaty-ness of multiplayer and have some casual gameplay but it's far from it.

In the end all I did was hurt how I view the game and videos made of it. Going back and watching YouTube of this game all I see are people getting slaughtered by the same 3 meta tactics. I see people like myself who never stood a chance against experienced players, who are going to suffer through loss after loss for the possibility of getting good, but more than likely will fall off early and give up the game. Hopefully, I'll forget the last 24 hours I've put into playing Forts so I can enjoy watching content of the game again. Either way since steam (shockingly) denied my refund request, maybe someday I'll finally get fast enough after throwing my head against the wall for enough hours.

Where many RTS titles fall into tried-and-true formulas, Forts innovates. Its unique emphasis on construction, combined with a detailed and responsive physics engine, adds depth to each strategic decision. The way structures respond to damage, stress, or even poor design choices is consistent and realistic. There's something immensely satisfying about leveraging the game's physics to craft the perfect strategy, only to watch your opponent's base react precisely as you'd expect when you put your plan into action.

Of course, while the game doesn’t natively support voice chat, pairing it with platforms like Discord elevates the entire experience. With my friends, our shared reactions to cannon attacks and structural collapses have led to countless amazing moments. It’s not just about the game itself, but the communal experience it facilitates.

All in all, if you're seeking a unique RTS that challenges conventional design and rewards creativity, Forts deserves your attention. It promises both challenge and charm in equal measure. Highly recommended!",1695267024,1695267024,True,39,2,0.784264445304870605,0,True,False,False

DIFFICULTY-

easy
normal ✔
hard
insane

Somewhat difficult learning curve. recommend playing and working up to winning hard matches at around 6 or 7 min's, against the AI in skirmish before you try to play multiplayer. you don't have to listen to me, but i do recommend some practice before multiplayer


MUSIC-

bad
okay
good
great✔
amazing

the winning music seems very rewarding. 


FUN FACTOR-

meh
good
great
incredible✔

the music is great when you win, you feel rewarded by it, and omg the Reactor explosion is just so pleasing. its a lil mushroom cloud, and its sosososososo SO satisfying.


COMMUNITY-

very nice, unless you use mods, some people get salty but the community is very nice, and helpful. watch youtubers like incursus, blitz, or baronvongames. recommended incursus, he is very talented and you can pick up some tips.


PRICE-

free
underpriced
affordable✔
bit too pricey
overpriced
outrageously expensive
with all of the things about this game makes it a wonderful game for just $15.

DLCS-

i think earthwork needs to make them a bit pricey because all of them are under $10 each so, for moonshot, and high seas, its about 35 bucks for the full game w/ dlcs. the pro HUD is nice but not special, but 35 bucks for all dlcs and the game is awesome. some games such as stellaris are about $100+ for the game and all DLC's. i highly recommend this game


GRAPHICS-

bad
good
great✔
awesome

pc requirements-

can play on my samsung smart fridge. 
weak computer
average windows 8-11✔
gaming pc
overpriced gaming pc

the 2 factors above are great. the amount of graphics it has, only needing a regular computer is outstanding (it is 2D)
i have only about 8GB ram (windows 10) and this game only eats 1GB (1068MB) of my ram, hardly any on the disk.


STORAGE NEEDED.
very little✔
little
medium
large
80+ GB

only need about 3GB. what more is there needed to say.
OVERALL REVIEW-


ease of play.
fun, rewarding, great time passer
engaging
nice community
affordable.

10/10 in my book. please buy this if you have some spare money and need a new game to play, if you love destruction.

I would say one of the only downsides are there is a small lack of weapons in the base game without add-ons or mods along with the campaign having an even larger lack of weapons. Its sort of player preference whether the heavily limited weapons in the campaign are a feature tat make it more difficult or wasted potential. the multiplayer is very fun with mods to flesh out the gameplay and add a variety of new weapons to play around with whilst battling your friends. So overall it is still an amazing game with very good  multiplayer and I would recommend you get it as soon as you can.,1690075137,1690075137,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Сначала я играл в Moonshot и вначале в самом забил на неё. Потом я играл в High Seas и на 2-ой миссии 2-ой главы я забил. Т. к. там боты просто сразу строят пушку, которая за один выстрел сносит мне пол базы а у самолётов бомбы вообще урона не наносят. Отдельно хочу пожаловаться на систему добычи ресурсов. В оригинале было идеально сбалансированная система. +4 минерала от шахты (6 от улучш.) и где-то 80 энергии от пропеллеров.

TEP 1
Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.

STEP 2
Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.

STEP 3
While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.

STEP 4
Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.

STEP 5
Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.

STEP 6
Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.

STEP 7
Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.

STEP 8
Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.

STEP 9
Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.

STEP 10
Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.

STEP 11
Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.

STEP 12
Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.

STEP 13
Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.

STEP 14
Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.

STEP 15
Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.

STEP 16
Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.

STEP 17
Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.

STEP 18
Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.

STEP 19
Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick",1652916267,1689277050,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

After some advice from YouTube, I could keep up well with better players, and build complex marvels such as particle accelerators. I did not finish the moonshot DLC campaign, I did not feel interested enough in the story to play-through something I considered much less entertaining than multiplayer. Lobbies when I was starting out were plentiful and had much variety along with a very welcoming community.

I am a single dad to my son, who is now 10 years old. My son recently started playing Forts.
In less than a week he has already played over 8 hours.

It was awful for me because it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son.
Because he was always with his friends or watching YouTube videos.

So I decided to create a Steam account to play with my son. I started playing, but it was my first time playing a video game since the 90s, so I was pretty lost. I asked my son for help and we spent a few hours playing the game together.
I enjoyed it, as it was the best time I had with my son since my wife died. Playing video games reminded me that there is fun in everything, and it brought me and my son back together, and now we actually spend time together outside of the house.",1686587592,1686587592,True,131,7,0.67090153694152832,0,True,False,False

The DLC campaign is rly good increses difficulty by alot and is way less on a Clock each mission. 
Since the Game itselfe doesn't rly help in fast buildorder or how to build strong structures, the Multiplayer is absolutely unplayable for new players.
In ranked, long story short, there is basicly an Build Order and if u don't know that build order it's over in 2-3 min. Not much strategy to it.

Multiplayer is either: experienced player's whipe the floor with beginner's or u don't even get that far since u get kicked from all 3 joinable lobbys for beeing a noob.
Overall the Community is not at all friendly to beginner's.

Player Hosted Lobby's, therefore 200 and way more Ping isn't unusual.

Play it if u want a bit of a strategy game and if u want to do all the Bonus objectives u can sink about 20h in singleplayer, but only if u have the DLC.",1683553397,1683617104,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

If you are a player that likes to be under constant stress, always spaming the repair button or the extinguish fire button because everything catches fire spontaneously then this game is for you. I felt more frustrated than enjoyed by this game, always caring about building the first so you dont get obliterated, always feeling that you are not fast enough and that you are going to loose, always making up the mistakes that the building placement and planning do (because build planning and structures are kinda bad) and an endless list of things that this game has that always put your mind into constant stress.
The multiplayer part of it is also kinda bad, servers always have some kind of issue and the few u have to play are constantly over 4000 ping. 
I bought this game and i will not say that i regretted my buy but i dont enjoy that much as others i got for much less money
The only thing you want to do when you buy and play this game is racing and being the one who gets the superduperobliterating weapons so you are not the one who is always repairing, on fire or destroyed the first. There is no other game mechanics, just building insanely fast, spamming buttons and grinding to be the first one on everything because if you get there 0.01 miliseconds late you are already destroyed. 
There are more bad important things to have in mind but the main ones are said. Best of luck to you if you buy this game

On the surface, I believe Forts would be best described, as real time Worms combined with RTS and physics-based base building. Aside from proper build orders, success in Forts depends on good aim, and an ability to construct a stable base that can both tank the incoming damage, and will not collapse under the weight of the weapons.

Do NOT listen to people claiming that the game hinges on a race towards heavy weapons. The game offers a lot of different tactics, utilizing a wide array of weapons, and the heavy weapons rush is only one of the tactics available (and can actually be easily countered). The game almost feels like fast-paced chess in this regard.
Cannons can be countered by dense defensive layers of struts, or choked by early game aggression.
Dense woodspam can be countered by Buzzsaws (Moonshot DLC).
Buzzsaws and lasers can be countered by armour or energy shields.
Energy shields can be neutralized by EMP launcher and swarm missiles. Both can be countered by anti-air weapons.
And the sniper has the potential of countering just about anything, depending on aim.

There's just so many options that the game never gets stale and maintains the ability to surprise. And that's all before even mentioning mods...

The multitude of creative tactics is best demonstrated by the periodic tournaments ran by the community and presented on video platforms (youtube, twitch).

Single player is a mixed bag, although still very much enjoyable. Campaign is fun, and at times plays like a puzzle solving game.

Unfortunately, this is marred by the awful AI. It is very crude and at times unfun against. The bot is unable to make any decisions in regards to building, and will always build the same pre-scripted fort, never improvises, always does the same thing. Once you saw an AI fort once on a given map, you saw it all. You can repeatedly shoot the same weapon spot with an armour-piercing sniper, and are guaranteed that the bot will keep placing this weapon in that spot [b]always[/b], every single game. Granted, the game has the capability to hold multiple bot fort designs for a given map (and you can even design your own), however this feature is rarely explored, and poorly explained.

On the other hand - to compensate for its general stupidity - the bot has been given an ability to cheat. [b]It can see through walls and always knows where your weapons are[/b]. There's no point in concealing your weapons and devices, as simply not placing a door to protect the weapon (something that is an acceptable tactic against a real human player) makes it guaranteed to be sniped. Using the Phantom commander against the AI is completely pointless. This - coupled with the godly aim of the bot, as well as its inability to understand and play the capture the point mode, makes AI matches a subpar experience, and at times frustrating even.

With all that said, I highly encourage you to play this gem. Never before have I had so much fun with a multiplayer game as when I've played Forts with my friends.

Just need to add - I highly recommend getting the Moonshot DLC. It is pretty much essential in multiplayer. That said, the game allows you to access the DLC content without owning it, as long as you play in a multiplayer lobby hosted by someone who does own the DLC.",1658585127,1681190289,True,4,0,0.552171945571899414,0,True,False,False

That said, my experience is that the online play outside of the top 50-100 players is mostly goofing around without a hint of competitive play.  The upside to this is that if you want to play a highly competitive  game(provided  you  can find other like-minded players online) you certainly can.  Additionally if you want to mess arround, maybe add mods and watch the pretty explosions, that's  an  easy thing to accomplish.  Unfortunately the game is pretty shallow so that's where the options end for this.   

All that said the gameplay loop can be pretty fun for a while, online play and mods can extend that while for a bit.  Compared to more complex RTS games it may leave something to be desired for someone used to them, but I also think the simplicity of this game makes it much more accessible to the casual player as it only takes a few games to figure out the build orders and mechanics of the game.  I would strongly suggest picking up the moonshot and high seas dlc with the base game if you decide to buy, as if the game with the dlc feels pretty shallow after a bit, the base game on it's own is significantly more so.

I played quite a bit when I first got it.  Now much later on I still load it up and play once every few months.  The devs for this game are still actively supporting it which I think is cool.(you can even see them replying to my whining about an issue I found and promising a fix which as far as I can tell they delivered on)  All in all I believe it's worth the $20 or whatever I paid for the game and dlc combined(on sale of course)

TL;DR: Decent RTS with simple learning curve, mostly casual games  and mods.  It's fun for a while before getting old.  Worth buying dlc if buying game in first place.  Still has active dev support.  Would buy again.",1671650775,1677429248,True,0,0,0.497911989688873291,0,True,False,False

The normal campaign (the one about oil) is nice and steady as it shows you the strategies and styles of fighting... but then I tried the Moonshot campaign... That thing is hard - it really holds nothing back.
This game is fun alone or with friends, and Is would highly recommend it to anyone who does not mind redoing a level once or twice because they built too much or were beaten by the AI.
My only 2 cons about this game, however petty they might seem, are:
1: This game cannot be played on Mac. I got around this by using NVIDIA's GeForce Now, though i did not pay the rather unfair prices, so my session lengths are confined to one hour - Really Annoying.
2: Pricing: though I feel this game is well worth whatever price they throw, it may not be a good option for many people as to get any really good weaponry, you need to buy the DLCs - More money. I would recommend, to those whom the pricing may become a problem for, to buy around the holidays. I, personally saved about 80% on this game - Really good sales.

Some features of the control scheme are a bit unusual, but there's everything you could ever need, from building hotkeys to control groups and a bunch of practical hotkeys.

The campaign is fun to play, not too hard and the story is well written, funny and satirical.

Multiplayer works really well, too. No noticable bugs or crashes so far. There's a bit of room for cheesy tactics, nothing that kills the fun too hard, tho.",1672433600,1672433600,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Has an extremly steep learning curve tho.
This leads to fairly toxic new players who insult you for doing absoluly anything faster/better then them.
Weapons are quiet balanced and commanders too.
(Have your own oppinion about spook)
But scattershot is not ok in his balance.
Giving plus 2 projectiles to buzzaws is...well...unfair.
It pierces trough doubbel boxed and crossbraced howitzer defences that would normaly require 2 buzzaws.
Also it can get absolutly illegal hitbox shot via the added 65 percent spread.
For exampel cut right over woodpam and then somehow into one of the holding nodes.
(Will normally not reach to rip it off but destabilize it)
The aktiv 20mms are also problematic,they deal massiv damage to background bracing and YEET the tinydoors from cannons and howitzers.
Also 20mms build very quickly and are cheaper than cannons,so theyr easily replacabel if doorsniped.
(An option to balance this would be to increase the time needed to charge the aktiv by a fair bit)
Then theres the doubbel shot sniper which YEETS lasers.
(And its also very consisten because the aktiv charges very fast)
All that in addition to very hard to destroy shields and (basicly) auto aim on aktiv makes the commander unfun to play against.
(And please dont recommend me going for tanky commanders then, even if this worked you dont know which commander your going against in the next ranked match most of the time)
The campains are fun and sometimes challenging.
Mod support is great and theres a bunch of diffrent maps,so the game is basicly infinitly replayabel.
Servers would be a good idea tho, its quit annoying playing with 1600 ping in ranked when competing versus a player from a far away country.
The community is quiet often aktiv (like scattershot haha) and sometimes welcoming to new players.
10/10 game would recommend.

I'll make a disclaimer here saying that I loved Worms as a kid.

Onto the review: This game combines ideas from strategy RTS, Worms and Poly Bridge. It has physics based base building with connectors and tiles like Poly Bridge. Inside of those bases you have a Reactor which you must protect. You do that by killing the enemy player (or AI), before they do the same to you.

Unlike Worms there is no turn-based combat, thus this game strongly rewards high APM. This coupled with the fact that there is resource management is what characterizes it as being akin to an RTS.

This comes with its own issues, as it introduces a higher skill floor and ceiling when playing against other people. Should you plan to only play this with a friend, this won't matter as you will have a blast either way. Should you plan to play this alone against others, be aware that there is a ""right"" way to play this game. There is a meta.

All of that being said, it's a very fun game, and I'd recommend it for anyone looking for a fun time with friends.",1668022661,1668022661,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The tutorial section is annoying long, turns off core mechanics, and doesn't even bother to teach you important features like pressing E to re-fire or assigning groups with Crtl+Num.

The game isn't too hard but is rather way too tedious to learn through in-game means like playing the campaign. Not to mention the fact that most lobbies run DLC which basically doubles the content in the game per added DLC and you can't learn it in-game without buying the DLC yourself.

A friend and I set out on the task of seeing if we could break Adamantium from the Well Defended mod, and it took a whole lot of tries (the infinite damage weapons didn't work) but we figured out that by attaching negative gravity materials we could stretch it until it broke after like 20 minutes of attaching. Great times.

I'm not big on the singleplayer/online anonymous version of this game, it's fine and keeps me entertained for a round or two, but the depth is in multiplayer with friends I think. Even then, requires a specific few friends to consistently have fun with this game. But if you fit that bill, I recommend.

but if you play it. To play. The building makes no sense. Probably have to look a a guide. and everyone is a fucking retard sometimes. The campaign is boring and gives objectives that HAVE to be based on replayablity
BUT
Need you to replay and get stars to pass
AND WORST OF ALL
is fucking boring.'


So I played Skirmish. And was very bored. Cause its the same. Build what you think. Its goign to break. idk how to build. well. Whatever just make something and spam at enemy.
And then. I made snipers. And mortars and I tried to overwhelm machine guns. Like the campaign.
Then i tried to space it out like the campaign
Then i tried to snipe it out. Like the campaign. I need to draw the fire. And then snipe.. and it worked
and i got a clear shot to their base. And i fired their mortars...
And it was cool
Then they shotgun rocketed me and I went 
""I am not waiting to do all that just to guess at what the game wants me to do again""

Engage me earlier please


its that thing
Amazing idea. That's why i BOUGHT IT YOU FUCKING... 
BUT.. shit execution.
mainly cause your campaign doesn't teach the basic of ""how to build"" really well
And if I can't build how can i focus on killing the enemy.

Should have just had a tutorial. And then left the player to battle AIs from scratch by making their own choices. None of this Oil Bullshit jokes. 
The campaign should have been AI getting increasingly tougher. In tactics . In showing how much depth your gameplay can support. not this bullshit.
but if that was the case your campaign would probably be 6 missions or something. And everything would be ""but i can cheese it.. THE SAME. Without any thought ... So why bother with new enemies"" 


killed ai in skirmish for a feel.
the cannon animations and nuke are amazing 
so how the fuck does it feel like i did nothing like it was a no brain mindless spam thing ?

Its ok if I have to work out how to defeat an enemy. Because that's the fun. When everything is doing its job

its NOT OK. If I have to work out what the fuck the fun is supposed to be. WHen im supposed to have fun. IF i am supposed to have fun atall or its a scam OR what kind of fun so I know whether its for me or not or im mising something. 
Especially when you know how to win but not why its fun.. Or why it has a point.

Because that's what players do ""Sure i can defeat it. But that's so brain dead I just never want to do it. Let's find something that will be a FUN way to defeat it"" 

but the problem is the player goes ""Ok so what is a fun way"" *goes through a tree search of everything possible in the game* *makes combinations of things and tries to put it in a fun way*
ok... there is nothing

Ironically if they took out the ""Physics"" from the game i'd become better.
Just forts weapons. and resource decisions. ...Which mostly boils down to. ""I need armour and weapons , which do I choose first... OFC armour. What idiot choose weapons just to get blown by snipers""",1660849877,1660917591,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

On the technical level it works fine, it doesn't  feels at all like an unfinished game although there could be some improvement here and there.
For instance it is a little annoying to find the right lobby for you: the game lacks a matchmaking system and it doesn't let you see the game options before you enter a lobby.

Game-play wise it gives me mixed feeling: I find it visually very compelling, bombarding my foes and seeing my shots  break their base feels at the same time evocative and intuitive, it perfectly convey the idea of a fight to me.
On the other hand i am often disappointed by the repetitiveness of many matches. There are indeed many structural elements which limit the strategic dept of the game; let me point out a few of them.
1) the average game length is 10-15 minutes.The game is indeed very fast paced and requires a great ability at micromanaging.This doesn't leave room for thinking and adapting you're plan. 
2)there is no depth, literally.The 2 dimension limitation is worsened even further by the small distance by which you are allowed to move in most maps. Little space=little options
3)the game is unforgiving , many games finishes with the first shot fired, and in general there won't be a come back from the loosing player.Aggressive strategies are usually favoured. This is somewhat discouraging if you are trying a new strategy.Also there are no ""secondary objectives"" , you never have to decide your priority target(there always is only one);this results again in a lower depth.
4)the general small number of variables affecting each game, and the small time you have to think, forces you to always use the same layout for your fort, further reducing the number of variable. I also must mention that there are not that many viable options for how to build your fort. The only thing you really have to decide is what weapon do you want to use(which is at least something).
5)The game is balanced for competitive 1v1, most of the game you'll find are casual 4v4.Many weapons looses relevance in 4v4, and in general your actions will be diluted inside your team's, to the point you don't even understand if you are playing well or not.
In non competitive 1v1 many options looses relevance because the players do not have the proper micro skill.


Despite all that if you dig trough all this and reach the bottom of Pandora's box you will find some hope for this game to achieve greatness in the form of a sandbox. The devs have made it extremely easy to exchange custom made maps and also custom made mods.This could potentially bring an infinite number of options to the game. Unfortunately most modded  games are either too messed up to be playable or too close to the original game to be note worthy.There are exceptions and i manage to find occasionally some balanced games which get me thinking on new creative ways to play.


I also should mention that there are 2 dlcs (which you are generously allowed to play even without buying).The dlcs are good and definitely improve the game.


Last and least i'd like to address the campaign: it's nice but it's not the reason why you want to buy the game,

Instead of having a team of worms that you can move around, you build a base in a quasi RTS style where you are making room to put in upgrade buildings and armor it up, then adding weapon units.  Then comes the worms-like part where you use those weapon emplacements to take out the enemy fort.  Once you've taken out the reactor or reactors depending on the map, the game is over and you win.  
Unless you got blown up first.  
There are also hero units too.  Some are more helpful than others, but it does make playing with different heroes selected more interesting due to the abilities, both passive and activated.
There is also a lot of workshop items to try.  The modding community seems to have thought up a lot of really cool stuff.",1657169422,1657169422,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

    I should mention beforehand that I typically enjoy this game but find myself complaining or blaming the game by the end of it all. Every man has their breaking point; the following is the result of my breaking point, when I lost a match I shouldn't have and immediately opened the store page to write a NASTY review. Again I like this game but man it feels unbalanced.

    This game has two GAPING flaws (GAPING) that ruin this game for me, those two being the doodoo micromanagement and exponential failure loop.

    In terms of the doodoo micromanagement, it takes form whenever your structures are destroyed because what follows is a fast-paced rebuilding spree that is NOT fun. This involves rebuilding your structures as they were before and ensuring the new structures will actually be compatible with devices and weapons-- both of which taking time away from launching a counter-attack.
    This is ANNOYING (!!) and it's entirely because devices and weapons require strict placement and planning, meaning your structures MUST be flat and they must NOT be sloped. This isn't fun and is in direct opposition with the physics engine, which sometimes allows for chaotic architecture that serves as a detriment. How cool would it be to have this Frankenstein base make an epic comeback?
    A wicked solution would be separating unit rotation and positioning entirely. This removes the strategy that comes with planning a base but the result is far better.

    The next GAPING (GAPING) issue is the EXPONENTIAL FAILURE LOOP™!! This is a term I coined (that's right..) for two systems in Forts that reward losing with more losing. There could be more, and probably are, but these two are the perpetrators I recall being the most anti-fun.
            - Repairing damaged structures drains metal per second. Damaged structures are the result of being attacked, so being attacked results in losing materials that could be spent building devices and weapons or launching a counter-attack. This is a penalty for losing. Why? :_(
            - The previously mentioned problem also applies here, in that time is wasted when rebuilding after being attacked. Time wasted with sucky building is the result of being attacked, so being attacked results in wasted time that could be spent doing yada yada... This is a penalty for losing. Why? :__(

    There was also this common complaint that most games devolve into a ""race to the big guns,"" but recent hours proved this wasn't the case. I'm assuming the developers fixed this, so GOOD ON THEM. Another issue that can ruin games and MUST be fixed is the unreliable anti-air, in which sometimes my machine-guns/mini-guns/shotguns do nothing to counter air attacks. In my 40 hours of playing I cannot for the life of all creatures on this Earth figure out what causes this, which says something about the game maybe.

    I'll go ahead and list my favorite aspects to this game while I'm at it.
            - The physics engine is great fun.
            - Mods are nice. Glad support is here.
            - I love when strategy is utilized in this game, like timing sniper shots, faking out anti-air, or even using mini-guns to decimate enemy units.
            - Naturally this game is real satisfying. It's always nice using the big cannon or plasma beam to shred through enemy structures like CURD hahaha. There's also some fun to suffering and catastrophic failure, but erm not if you feel it was unjustified.
            - Aesthetics are nice. I enjoy the visuals and music, and the art style is particularly fantastic.

    Ultimately I DO enjoy this game but it's a frustrating experience that could be so much more. Whether the fun is worth the pain is your call boss.",1589053119,1651292837,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly the penis is more iconic with it's long thick stem and the head being an it's head with a design resembling a mushroom which, being one of the first lifeforms on the planet even preceding plants and barely changing over the millions of years it has existed shows that the penis's design is greay but, the penis makes the mushroom's design even better by taking the head of it and making it more aerodynamic which, gives it the ability to bulldoze through everything and everyone. The penis is a sign of masterfully crafted excellence, the ballsack on the other hand is just a bunch of organs haphazardly thrown together into a skin sack.

Secondly the human body spends way more resources on the penis than it ever spends on the ballsack. The human body specially pumps penis full of blood but, the might of the penis's might is so unparalleled that it uses up all of the body's resources if used for long stretches of time. The penis is only activated on a special occasion; the ballsack just hangs around.

Thirdly the penis has many imitators because it's a beautifully crafted device, as they say: ""Imitation is the best form of flattery."" The ballsack having barely any imitators to speak of is a sign of its inferior design. The mighty penis is the one to start many great businesses and an entire industry not the ballsack.

And finally the feeling of sucking a penis Is a feeling of pure ecstasy, nothing will ever beat the feeling of sucking on a big meaty penis. As soon as the penis hits your mouth it envelopes and overpowers you with its mere presence, lightly twitching in your mouth to show that it needs to be taken care of and that your only responsibility at the moment is to suck on it. The ballsack is a plaything the penis is to be taken seriously.

what i like is the style of this game, you build a fort and arm it with weapons.
but nothing comes without downsides, once you play long enough then it kinda gets boring because of the repetitiveness that the game has.
one change i would make is to add more options for upgrades and some more construction materials in the game
so in the end this is a pretty good game.   would recommend when on sale

It's got a campaign along with another DLC campaign and the missions are fun with interesting and difficult challenges. The game has a pretty good AI for battling against as well as a bunch of different maps. You shoot weapons at the enemy fort(s) to attempt to destroy their reactor and thus disconnect their fort from power, possibly winning you the game. The vanilla game is fun, but the best part is the mods. There are built in modifications as well as tons of player based ones. I personally would recommend the ""Fortships: Conquer the Skies"" Mod as it allows for airships and adds some fun weapons to not only deal with them, but also to put on them.

When I wanted to make a game review, I thought “what is the most underrated yet universal and good game I know”? Now I am here talking to air, because I’m not known at all (just some random guy).

There’s a tournament every month! Want to just build amazing places to use in a fight? Your welcome! (We even have Star Wars). Want to make a modded mess? Try combining BFC and well defended! Want to watch creators make videos on this game? Well say hello to Synergy and InsurgencyGaming! The list goes on and on, there is just so much things you can do here, il probably hit the word limit on a review trying to point them all out! Forts, is a game, that is so good, it is as infinite as the Juanita like Minecraft, Tetris and all others, but, not a lot of people know about it… not a lot of people sit in a Discord call after school and go “hey let’s do a game in Forts”… this game, deserves a lot, and if you still think “this random guy probably dose not know what he’s talking about”, then I have nothing more to say then just, look it for yourself.",1645562586,1645562586,True,28,0,0.764720618724822998,0,True,False,False

This game's Dev's are extremely active and are always making changes/bugfixes/improvement. Their lives revolve around this game, and they spend that time well. They always bring new content for players to enjoy, for example: the Moonshot dlc, the new Commander Rebalance, and the new Pro HUD. They've put a lot of work into this game, and they make sure to show it. This game is easy to mod, you can make your own custom campaign's, and you can even make maps for the game too, they've really made it easy for the community to make something out of this game. I just want to thank these Dev's for all of their work that they've done over the years. The only things that I would change is updating the main trailer as it's still stuck before TOG even came out, and fixing ranked.  Other than that this game is the best game I've ever played, truly.

Inconsistent damage, inconsistent physics,  inconsistent collision, hell, half the time it just ignores hits and pretends they didn't happen.
A good portion of the design is also pretty bad, making it pretty difficult to figure out how to make some menus actually work in the way you want to.

It's really fuckin fun though. The inconsistency adds a wild element to the gameplay which means that even the best of players can get ganked by the worst of failures on the game's part. It's pretty satisfying to launch like 70 missiles at your friend's base as once.

The campaigns are really just tutorials for the game mechanics but that's fine because the gameplay is great. If you can I would recommend the Moonshot DLC as it adds portals, and some new weapons, however the portals are the star of the show. After some practice you can design laser concentrators, gravity powered particle accelerators (but they accelerate cannon shells), and entire walls that will reflect almost any attack.

Yes
After 47 hours (at the time of writing this) I have vastly enjoyed the game

Graphics: Although its Art Style is not as complex nor aesthetic as other games it isn't bad.

Gameplay: Addicting, fun, and many strategies along with Steam Workshop compatibility makes infinite replayability possible. There is also a campaign, multiplayer, sandbox, and even built-in map editor.

Required specs to run: Overall, singleplayer requires very little processing power compared to most games on steam. The only instances of lag I have found is when you launch it, mods, multiplayer strain, internet connection slowing down, and thats about it.

They also struggle hard at community management. Most lobbies are super toxic, hosts will ragequit after losing canceling the whole game, and the report does nothing.

The amount of flexibility the combat has solely due to the wacky physics design and the building system is astronomical. Want to use weak cannons to one shot someone? Use the physics to aim them straight up and bombard the enemy with mach 20 accelerated shots due to gravity. What about catapult the enemy base into the sky? Use howitzers (dlc required, but you can play with a host who has it and use the stuff for free). Want to just constantly annoy people and laugh as they call you obscenities in chat? Use an ungodly amount of upgraded snipers and machine guns to constantly destroy their weapons and pelt their core.

This game is a realy cool stratagy physics game that is not hard to learn, heck, I just got on today and a new player had almost skill as I had after playing for years. It was like his 3rd game.

Pros:
+Active developers with contests with the community + competitions if those are your thing
+Level Editor that is easy to use if you watch a video and learn the commands
+Mutators to keep matches fresh with many options
+Commanders that keep things fresh and give you a strategy going in.
+Replays are saved after every game (view-able as game finishes), if that's your thing.

Cons?:
-I am sure there are 'better' designs for fort structure/progression that eventually will be the way to go as you play but that's learning the game, not really a con to get good.

BUY the Moonshot DLC, it adds portals and weapons, and only the host requires the dlc for all to use in a match. Buzzsaws are the way to go as a tip if you do buy the DLC.",1636950199,1636950199,True,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0,True,False,False

Aiming the guns is an exercise in frustration - its possibly the worst aiming system of any game I have played. And the UI - its a nightmare - pan around, snap back, pan forward, snap to something else, fire a weapon, zoom in somewhere else - absolutely impossible to control the screen and viewport. Unless you enjoy using a mouse to type in essays, stay away from this user interface. 

If i could put this in the trash, I would.

This game could be great, but its terrible because of a few things that just make it annoying rather than fun. 

First, the physics around wall building is annoying. Everything bounces, and just when you're trying to drop something in that confined spot, it smacks into a wall and boom, there goes your wall...again. Try attaching two walls with cross braces, and they bounce in and out of scope (distance) making it luck if you manage to pin those two long braces together. 

Next up is firing arcs - i completely hate these. You have to play part of the game in close to select  your firing unit and get it to fire (you have to click in a very specific arc, in real time), but you are trying to hit something far away so you are constantly zooming in and out to try to figure out the arc. It just makes it more of a mouse zoom wheel challenge than a fun experience. 

And lastly are the machine guns. I've read a ton of articles on taking out missiles with gunners, but upgrade, don't upgrade -- its irrelevant -- they don't autofire. And so you try to take them out manually, but by the time you see the missiles heading toward you, you frantically click your control group, then find the mouse, then position it into the firing arc, and watch as your blast doors crawl open... just in time to see all the missiles impact your base. Its just plain ridiculous. 

I really wanted to like this game, and enjoy building and RTS games more than any other genre, but its just completely frustrating and not fun.

I don't have a super high-end rig, so maybe that's just me, but it seems to have a lot of stuttering.  Also, the map creation is not intuitive at all.  I have all kinds of problems with it.  I've gotten the devs to answer some of my questions about the map editor and some of the things they've told me haven't worked either.  It's not great.  It needs to be brought down and made more accessible.

I love the gameplay.  I really want more of my friends to get this game so that I can play it with them.  It has a sort of ""Battleship"" feel to it.  I can't speak to the community because I haven't played it online.  I have heard rage quitting is a big problem and that server connectivity is also an issue.

+Building a fort is tons of fun.
+Tons of weapons. Machine guns that can be upgraded into miniguns, snipers that can be upgraded into AP snipers, incendiary mortars that can be upgraded into heavy mortars and the two most fun weapons: The cannon and the laser beam. These things are the last weapons you can build in a match, they take a long time to build, cost a lot of resources,
firing them costs a lot too just like building them does and they take a long time to reload but fuck me they hit like a dumpster truck.
+3 factions. Basically America, Russia and China.
+You can use the weapons yourself. You don't just place them and watch them fire at each other. You have to take control of a weapon, aim it and fire it yourself and firing some of the bigger guns, firing the mortars using angles and speed, firing the snipers and hitting someone hiding behind a metal door its just really fun. The only weapon that can do its own thing
automatically is the machine gun. If you wanna shoot at the enemy you take control of the machine gun and shoot it. If you don't touch the machine guns and just let them do their own thing then, if they can, they will shoot at incoming mortar shells or swarm missiles. Having a wall of automatic machine guns that just blow up every incoming mortar shell is so cool to see.
+You can group 3 weapons and fire them all at once. Firing 3 mortars at once or firing 3 miniguns at once is fun. Firing 3 cannons at once is an incredible feeling.
+3 campaings with around 9 missions each. The first camping is the Americans its basically a training. The 2nd campaing is the Russians and the last campaing is the Chinese. The missions get harder and longer as you progress through the game. There are different areas too from the Middle East to Europe and lastly to Siberia. 3 factions, 3 campaings, 3 regions with 3 missions for each region.
+The destruction in this game is perfect. Seeing a fort crumble in on itself is so much fun. Finding a weak spot or repeatedly shooting the same area over and over again to create a weak spot and then destroying that last single piece on the enemy fort that is holding the entire structure together and watching it all fall apart is so cool to see. Of course the same happens to you too.

-I feel like the training missions could be better. The game teached me basically everything except how to build a stable, future-proof fort. Which is a really important part of this game building forts. I had to learn this myself with trial and error and i still have no clue how to make a future proof fort. I can make somewhat stable forts but none of them can be improved if you do try to change something and improve the fort then the entire building will collapse in on itself. I'm just a bad architect i guess.
-The game does get boring after a while.

If you are interested in this game then wait for a discount and then buy it. Its a fun game.",1632533396,1632533396,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

But the way behavior in lobbies is handled is just too painful, one will spend more time leaving toxic lobbies or randomly getting kicked upon joining than actually playing.

All these mods either a couple of clicks away for a new install or one click away in-game.

The gameplay of forts mainly consists of an arms race to get weapons to take out your opponent. There is an awful lot of variety when it comes to strategies that you can opt for and from what I've seen facing other people it really just depends on how you enjoy playing the game.

There is a quite a large learning curve on the game which I really enjoyed going through. Although I'm still not close to the skill level of a lot of players you could easily see how each game you start to develop your own strategies with building, weapon choice, etc.

--- Community ---
There's quite a large modding community for the game. From adding new weapons, new building materials and new maps there is plenty of additional content to keep you entertained after you feel you are finished with the base game. 

--- Worth The Price ---
At the time of review the price is: £10.99
Worth the price? Yes

--- SCORE ---
7 / 10

Pros:
Great variety of content and strategies

You are rushed to build a fort as fast as possible that any fine fort building structure is an afterthought.   The UI seems to be purposely be terrible to allow for skilled players to excel.  The selecting targets, and aiming tools are laughably bad.  Being rushed to place weapons in your base gets frustrating when the game decides to not allow you to do things for no obvious reasons.  You want to put a machine gunner on the tower, well there's not enough room.  You build enough room and suddenly the gunner is not allowed there for some reason you don't even know.  Too late, you lose the game because MECHANICS ARE BAD!!  Learn to play around the glitchy mechanics and ""git gud scrub!""

EDIT:  Well damn, I watched a youtube video and I was playing the game wrong.  Do I want to bother figuring out how to play this game?  According to the steam global achievements, I am a top 30% of the player base.  Only 16% have done more than me.  So, being between 15-30% of the best players in this game and not even knowing what I'm doing...  That kinda means a lot.  

Some notes on basic things you(and I) need to learn before enjoying this game:

#1)  Youtube player was building entier boxes instantly, during my play I was only building single wood planks at a time.  You should learn how to drag and drop instant build fort boxes.

#2)  Youtube player was instantly putting out fires that spread over 30+ wood fires in a wide area.  Learn the command to instantly put out all fires.",1623718224,1623719424,False,2,0,0.5,1,True,False,False

I haven't even been able to pull off all the training scenarios, which are way harder than the campaign. The game requires good ability in aiming and ressource management to face against the dangers of someone just as strong as you are. 

Now if I've scared you, Its pretty understandable, but here's the twist of my review: Though I love the challenge, I'm not a competitive player. I have always met people weaker and stronger than I, in a pretty balanced fashion, so becoming a crazed-forts-man is not 100% needed to enjoy the game, but that will to get better is needed. Aside from this, If you need help, asking through the chat (""~""button) will always get you answers. 
Conclusion: its a hard game, so you better get ready to get obliterated from time to time, but don't go thinking you need to be god tier to enjoy the game. (I do recommend trying for yourself first and refund it if it doesn't fit your needs). With that said, I wish you all a great day of oxygen, birds and uh...coolness...

Ps: Since one game lasts around 20 minutes, some people might rush you to get ready. In such times, stay confident, do what you think you gotta do. If they kick you, no problem, get into another server. I have let that kind of behaviour discourage me from playing great games, so I'm making this last paragraph for the more sensible people out there.",1622425574,1622425574,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

For people who do enioy this genre, the game is unique, attractive, has excellent audio including the sound tracks, in-game audio queues and general quality of sounds. Most importantly, the gameplay is, like previously mentioned, unique, in depth, and extremely enjoyable. The amount of tactics you will learn while playing, and the different strategies you can adopt allows this game to be fully personalized by the user or fully skill based by the meta player. Controls are simple and fast, game runs well, and there are very few frustrating aspects of the game in regards to quality of life settings, gameplay mechanics, and controls.

My  only complaint is the lack of hotkeys (that I am aware of) that would make a game so based on speed and timing much easier",1621961749,1621961749,True,9,1,0.616714537143707275,0,True,False,False

If the controls are uncomfortable for you like they were for me you can go to the options in the main menu and Change the hotkeys (For example the hot key for delete is the delete key and that did't feel right so i changed it to F.)

For a game that was made before 2010 it's very fun and i would recommend it, though it can be challenging at some points.(Take from a person who played for 100+ hours) In the end when you get paired up with the right people it fun and 10/10 great game that doesn't require a high end PC to play.

I never usually played games based around campaign because I always loved to play a game MY way. But this game changed all that. In this wonderful game, you can create your own base and destroy the enemy. But what makes it so fun for me, personally, is the fact that you can build your base any way you want. It's not like most games where you have to follow a specific blueprint, or such and such. The way the creators implement a way of playing a campaign while ALSO letting you be free to build it YOUR way. I had so much fun with this game, that I played for 3 hours in one sitting. This game is so incredibly addictive. If you love: Building, Strategy, Big guns, and cartoon-y art style, Then this game fits all of your preferences PERFECTLY. I was quite skeptical when buying this game as I thought it would be linear, while letting you place guns, and that's about it. But I luckily was so incredibly surprised by the gorgeous art style and gameplay. Not only that, but it even has IT'S OWN SANDBOX! Where you can design bases, and plan out strategies for certain levels! Overall, this game might not be for you. Which is fine, but to me, this game hits every sweet spot i have for video games.

The game requires that you work with your team constructing a ""Fort"" or even several of your own, and arming it with weapons and defensive measures to try and destroy the enemy's ""Reactor"", the main core of a Fort.
Weapons include Machine Guns, Heavy Artillery, and Cannons, along with an entire host of other things to tear the enemy apart with.
Forts supports mods that add an entirely new level of depth to the game including things like Flying Forts, Endo's Arsenal, among others that can give the game mountains of re-play value.

While it does have an enjoyable campaign the main reason I, and probably most that buy this, bought the game to play mutiplayer. However the multiplayer experience in this game is incredibly disheartening for a new player. The number of people still playing is quite low and you have to wait for lobbies to play in. This has a flip side of meaning the usual people that still do play tend to be veterans that have played for a long time. This causes a new player to have to join games full of people that can just play loads better then them. That coupled with the very poor attitude of the people I have seen made every single game produce anxiety.

For example; in my recent games once I was kicked mid game for what I can only assume was building too slowly, once I was insulted for asking for help on how to build something, and not once but four times I was kicked between games for not playing well enough. And the few times I was let to play again I feel I was then specifically targeted by the enemy team to die first because I was new.

I love the premise of this game, I really do. The game itself is fantastic. But I missed when playing would have been incredible. Now it's a huge slog of wait 5-15 mins for a game where I know I'm going to have no chance and likely either get insulted by people that hate me for not being as good as them or just outright kicked with no word. I could get past loosing a bunch of matches no problem if there were more people playing, but I can't get past how anxious I feel in lobbies when I do finally get in one. If you're an rts vet that could learn quickly this might still actually still be worth a try but if you're a casual player that just stumbled across this or came here from watching Incursus play this isn't likely going to be a fun time.",1619139549,1619139549,False,133,6,0.721782088279724121,13,True,False,False

It's a game you have to spend time on before you actually start playing, it does have a ""Campaign"" which is essentially a very long tutorial but I'd say the best way to learn is to get into a group of friends or people of similar skill level and just fool around for a couple matches.

It's also a game that relies on Hosting instead of dedicated servers which can have it's own issues.

I'd only really advise you try to get into it if you got a group of friends to play it with, I don't advise going at it Solo, by this time in the games lifetime it's mainly kept alive by diehard players or youtubers/streamers that have built their channels around it that will stomp you into the ground, and god help you if you drag them down with your nooby inability. 

There are ""Noob games"" which pop up every now and then but about half the time those are just games people have made to abuse people that have no idea what their doing.

I have played a bit and it is great. It is intuitive enough that you can get into a match with a friend who has barely played and pretty much go from zero. Fast-paced and dynamic, a lucky hit will turn the tables in a second and give you a somewhat balanced game.

Forts is a strategy based game with physics and like the whole shazam and yes of course i recommend you get this game as it will really engage your senses and give you a sense of strategy compared to other games where its much more guns out and shoot every single thing in sight, in this game you actually have to think where the shot will impact your opponent and what long lasting impact will it have. If you are someone who wants quick short rounds and going in with no strategy you can still play this game, just you have to learn to adapt to this game and the environment you play in.

My final statement would be, if your in to strategy, and in to bullying people if they rush mortars then just get the game, I recommend this and i hope you guys can play this game and enjoy it as much as i do i guess.

There are absolutely no limits to how you play-- well there might be one-- don't lose your core. Forts introduces a type of RTS that very few games have, where your strategy solely depends on how you like to play. Some people like to rush and get weapons out early, and others like to play the late game. And another astounding thing is that there is always a counter for each of the weapons. No matter what you rush, your opponent can have the direct opposite and shut you down. It is really amazing how much thought goes into how to build and structure your base. Honestly the game is amazing.

One major thing that I've noticed is that the devs are always working on the game, whether that be a commander update, or an entire forts competition. The game is constantly getting better, and I love to see that.",1608149226,1608149417,True,26,2,0.724125862121582031,0,True,False,False

Forts has been even more balanced than ever with the new commander updates which revamped most commanders, making Pinchfist (a rush commander) not the default choice for 1v1s and 2v2s anymore, and each commander (except that poor bastard Moonshine) more fun to play. Also real kind for the devs not to make 'Moonshot DLC' exclusive lobbies. (please don't get any ideas)

As a whole, Forts has never been in a better state; a more vibrant community, balanced weapons, and a decent learning curve for newer players to join (not everyone is a tryhard). Here are some good and bad things I feel exist as of this post:

Positive:
-(Ridiculously) High skill ceiling

-Matchmaking is quick, compared to 2 years ago;

-Game feels more balanced 

-Moonshot DLC is well worth its price, for all the new content added

-Wide variety of content from the Workshop to spice up gameplay

-Great to play with friends

-Pinchfist


Negative: (bit of nitpicky stuff here)
-The original campaign: 
As a whole, I feel that it is a decent tutorial to the game, but it does get somewhat stale in comparison with moonshot. Still, that is to be expected from the on-release campaign of OG forts. 

The bigger issue I feel exists with it, is that firstly, it doesn't introduce new players to commanders; a huge driving force in Multiplayer. Secondly, its objective-based approach is rarely applicational to Multiplayer. 

The heart and soul of Forts lies in its multiplayer, no doubt, and new players fresh form the campaign might be worse off in lobbies, as there is no guiding force for them, except for 'bash your opponent with da big gun'.

From a story standpoint, the campaign is great, and the dialogue keeps it entertaining, but its negatives might overshadow the true gold of the game; Multiplayer.

-No in-game menu options (let me control the audio whilst in a match ffs)

-Report system is kinda wack (needs fixing)

-Player names with question marks and lists of numbers: Probably from another country where the language isn't supported by Forts. Tbh you can't really fix this one. If yall see a dude with this kind of name, except not to speak the same language (or understand them at all)

-Moonshine.

Overall, I give WW3 Simulator 10 out of 10 Howitzers. It's a great game once you really get into it, and will definitely entertain you through quarantine. The sole issue I have with it is its original campaign, but that's the only reasonable issue to point out. And Moonshine.

Weapons are creative and fun, the devs regularly balance the meta, and the commanders can be used for great potential. I love this game, and i think if you like RTS/Strategy games, you will love it too. The mod support for the game is also AWESOME, and the pro scene is crazy.

Thanks devs for giving me this fun.

The singleplayer is there and some of the missions are infuriating, however the multiplayer is where you will probably spend most of your time. This is mostly because their is no ""AI"" or variation of how bot's play. They have a set ""build order"" and will always do the exact same thing every time. The AI will also completely break and stop building when their base ""deforms"" from damage too much.

The multiplayer is... well it's solidified itself into a more or less diehard fanbase. There's no better description than ""Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of games"". That's the multiplayer of this game.

There's also the saying that ""Host only cares about his win"" because most Lobby Hosts will virtually never address team imbalance if they win. Only ""new-ish"" players will sometimes host lobbies and care about more than just winning.

Mods just make it exponentially worse because they will add a bunch of interesting things but they will also inevitably add things that are inherently unbalance or just blatantly overpowered. And players will flock to said weapons because ""Fun"" doesn't win games the same way as ""One-Hit-Kills"" or ""No Counter"" weapons do. 

What makes it worse is that generally speaking the people who host modded lobbies typically already know exactly what they are going to do. And alot of the time that just means they are going to do something they believe is going to win fast or easily.

I wouldn't recommend this game necessarily unless you have a group of friends to play it with and it's really cheap.",1599066593,1601993640,False,0,0,0.496774196624755859,0,True,False,False

I started playing this game on the free multiplayer weekend. Love at first sight.
After a solid 3 hours i bought the game and i dont regret it. Its so much fun!  

Basically you build a fort and have it cut in half by a lazer, disconnecting it from the ledge ur hanging off of, causing your base to fall and blow up. You remind yourself next game to put up some beam shields. New game starts, and you do place those shields. next thing you know, lazer shoots and the beam shields deflect it BACK AT THEIR BASE, cutting it in half and causing them to fall to their doom. I win without firing a shot ;)

And then theres that occasional moment when you whole base topples over because you built it to tall and your foundation was trash. and then the base lands on your teamate's build, causing that one to blow up too. He wasn't to happy about that.

10/10 would build a base just to have it blow up again!",1528761232,1600901459,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

The base game without DLC, is fun, but gets repetitive relatively quickly
The DLC adds some more cool mechanics/weapons
The MODS make it fun!!!

Yes, the community is what made the base game even more fun, and adds life to the multiplayer games.

The mods range from fun, to crazy, such as flying forts, modded armor, and weapons, that have moddified stats, looks, and other funny/fun bits.

Overallafter playing about 15+ multiplayer matches and halfway done with the singleplayer campaign, I have to say its worth getting.

The DLC is shared among other players if one of them has it, mods and maps are super easy to download, and update (on their own)

Fun, easy game, which at times can become a click fest, other times, a tactical marvel....within reason...

It would be nice if the game would be a bit more complex/strategic though....some modded maps make it gun, other times the same rinse and repeat build order at the start of a match gets tiresome.

Edit in response to the developer comment: It was criticism. Yeah I swore but I'd hardly consider the F word abusive language and worthy of a ban warning.

Good stuff: Very easy to learn, is a lot of fun, there are endless amounts of mods giving you endless amounts of things to do,game is very well optimised, works good on low end devices like mine.

Bad stuff: For the love of god, after launching the game, don't try to instantly go to multiplayer.The game is very easy to learn but very hard to master and the game is mostly based on experience rather than learning so I recommend play with bots and make your own tactics then fight against others.

With both the base game, and the DLC, there is also the limitless steam workshop. Once I got bored with the base weapons and maps, I quickly found some popular mods and my whole game was changed. So, final view; If you like RTS games, and you want to have a nice, fun game with explosion, this game is for you.

The Developers have done an amazing job balancing weapons and are quick to listen to user complaints.  With a super nice Discord community more than willing to show tons of tips and tricks, I could not recommend this game more.
