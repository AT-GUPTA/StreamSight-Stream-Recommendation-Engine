I found that I wanted to give support and purchase a few things to show it.  The outfits for each of the Angels are nice, some very classy, others . . .  I have a really adorable Bunny Brigade going on. <.<

I am only half way into the story, I really desire to know what will happen, which makes me find time to play for an a hour or two.  I wish that I could do that every day, there is more than enough to do and aid others in the RL in the Legion that we join.  There are many helpful tips and pages that are in the game for those that take a little time to explore and read eaverything.

The only things that I find against this game, is that all of a sudden a free game turns into a $60+ from all the extra things that are available.  Given that I found it worth, it just caught me quick.
  The other thing is, at a certain point I have difficult times just because I didn't do a correct player set up, and waiting for me to upgrade my Angels to higher grade and need to grind a bit to buy the right things for it, in game.  Now I enjoy the challenge, most may find this part . . . frustrating.",1678327221,1678327221,True,1,0,0,0,True,True,False

I personally find the game entertaining and i'm loving it, I love the fact that their is plenty of content for someone who is looking for active game-play, while also having a idle AFK mechanic. :)",1671178081,1671178081,True,1,0,0.495309561491012573,0,True,True,False
