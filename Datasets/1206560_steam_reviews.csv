A virtual sandbox where I could create my own worlds, shape destinies, and escape the mundanity of reality. Little did I know that the captivating allure of World Box would unravel the fabric of my family, leaving me with a haunting emptiness that no virtual realm could fill.

As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, World Box became more than just a game; it became an addiction. The vibrant laughter that once echoed through our home was replaced by the deafening silence of a father engrossed in his virtual sanctuary. My wife, Sarah, and our children, Emily and Michael, began to fade into the background as I delved deeper into the pixelated landscapes I meticulously crafted.

At first, I dismissed their concerns, attributing my newfound passion to stress relief and the need for a temporary escape. However, as the world within the screen became my reality, the lines between the two blurred, and I failed to see the toll it was taking on my family. The bedtime stories, weekend outings, and cherished family traditions became relics of the past as World Box consumed my every waking moment.

Sarah's pleas for connection fell on deaf ears, and the once-strong bonds within our family eroded like sand slipping through my virtual fingertips. One day, as I was lost in the intricacies of my digital creations, I realized the depth of my negligence. Sarah had made the heart-wrenching decision to leave, taking Emily and Michael with her.

The game that once promised an escape became the catalyst for my isolation, tearing apart the very foundation of my family. World Box had granted me control over fictional realms, but in the process, I lost the most precious world of all – the one within the walls of my own home.

But Other Than That

 The main argument is that game does not have enough content for what the price is. I say, for one, most people who leave negative reviews don't play for more than 7 hours and sometimes near 24, while people who leave a positive review have played for 6, 10, 19, or 200 hours. The people who leave bad reviews should play the game more to actually see everything a few times so an accurate judgement, I know about the 2 hour refund period but your review is more valid if you play longer, and it's still in early access, you getting this game is to give constructive criticism, say what features you'ed like to be in the game, and not say it needs more content when you could help it get more content for your and others enjoyment.",1694580955,1707176514,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

- I don't care, I'm having a baby!


Hundred and five miles an hour,

you believe that?


Reese, you just passed the hospital!




- The baby's coming, he's coming now!

- All right, all right, hold on.


- Okay, but I think he might be stuck.

- Grab onto something. Ready?


One, two, three!


It's a baby boy.


I'm happy that Waffle House

was okay with me coming here...


to talk to y'all about

my day-to-day.


And, y'all, that's pretty much,

in a shell...


what it's like to manage

a Waffle House.


Ma'am, I don't know what else

you want me to say to them.


And I'm also gonna need to know

where your commode's at.


Okay, let's give him a round

of applause. Thank you.


Okay, next up is Ricky Bobby.

Ricky, is your father here?




No, ma'am.

I haven't seen my daddy in years.


But my mama say he's out

racing cars...


and, well, dipping his wick

in anything that moves.


Okay, kids, that's enough.

We're gonna move on to Brennan.


Don't pay them no mind, Ricky.


Thanks, Cal. Shake and Bake.

You'll be my best friend forever.


His job is like as a prison guard.


Excuse me, darling.

I'm Reese Bobby.


I'm here for career day

with my son, Ricky.


- Dad!

- Hey there, boy!


Man, you got big. How long's it been?

Three, four months?


- Ten years.

- Ten years?


Man, I gotta lay off the peyote.


Mr. Bobby,

there's no smoking in here.


It's all right, I'm a volunteer fireman.


Okay, I am a semi-professional

racecar driver...


and an amateur tattoo artist.


And the first thing you gotta learn

if you're gonna be a racecar driver...


is you don't listen to losers...


like your know-it-all teacher here.

Okay, I think that's enough.


Your teacher wants you to go slow,

and she's wrong...


because it's the fastest who gets paid

and it's the fastest who gets laid.


Oh, yeah.

You know what I'm talking about.


You people are in the wrong

on this one!


So in the wrong!


This is egregious,

do you hear me? Egregious!


We were cellmates together, Andy.

You got payback coming!


Dad!


Don't listen to these people, Ricky.

You're a winner.


You got the gift. Always remember,

if you ain't first, you're last.


If you ain't first, you're last.


- See you when you're grown up.

- Dad! Come back, Dad!


It's a hot one here in Talladega...


and this crowd of over 180,000

is enjoying one heck of a day.


Yo, Terry. Terry, we got the caution.

Bring it in for a pit. Let's work on it.


All right, fellas, let's go.


Looking good. Yes, come on.


Keep it up, baby.


- All right, way to go.

- Go, way to go.


Nice jack work, Ricky.


Hey, Shake and Bake, Cal.


- Shake and Bake!

- Terry, it's all on you, bro. You go.


Go, baby, go.

Wait, what are you doing?


- I gotta take a piss.

- Go, go, go!


It doesn't matter, Lucius.

We're in last place. Relax.


Jeez, I gotta go take a whiz.

Get off my ass.


You see,

this is what I'm talking about.


That's why this group right here

is the laughingstock of NASCAR.


Face it, we suck.


It's not always bad to be in last place.

Here's some things we can focus on:


One, we tried hard.

And two, we're still dear friends.


Glenn, shut up.


I see Terry.

He's having a chicken sandwich.


Hey, fellas! These are really good.

You should try one.


That place actually makes

a nice sauce.


Let me eat this,

then I gotta make a phone call...


then I'm coming back, all right?

This is the bottom line.


If we don't get that car

back on the track...


our sponsors are gonna

shit a chicken.


Now, is there anyone out there

who wants to go fast? Anybody?


I wanna go fast.


Hey, get him a suit. Hurry up,

make it snappy. Let's go.


- Hustle up, hustle up.

- Hey, man!


Remember that time when we got kicked out of

biology for playing with Matchbox cars?


- Yeah!

- Who's retarded now?


- Yeah.

- Hey, what are you doing after this?


- After the race?

- Yeah.


I don't know, but it feels like

we're wasting a lot of time.


No, I know, I know.

I'm just excited, man!


- Yeah, I know. Yeah.

- Hey! I love you!


- What?

- Nothing.


Shake and Bake! Get some!


You're my best friend!

You're my best friend!


- Okay, then!

- I'm in there with you!


- I gotta get going!

- Go, go!


- Yeah!

- That's Ricky, baby!


That's my boy, Ricky!


Hey, Ricky,

just remember one thing:


If you wreck that car,

that's 200 grand out of your pocket...


so let's take it nice and slow, okay?


With all due respect, Lucius,

I'm gonna do some driving.


Excuse me, coming through.


Apparently, we've got a situation for

the Laughing Clown, number 26 car.


Terry Cheveaux is refusing to drive.

One of his crew members...


has taken the wheel.


Hey, just wanted to share a little piece

of personal information with you.


I got a chubby right now...


because this is one of the most

awesome experiences of my life...


because I'm getting to

drive a racecar!


I can't believe it! Oh, my God!


Wow, that was cool.


Come on, come on.


The big story from Talladega:


Little-known jack-man Ricky Bobby

places third in the Dennit machine.


Ricky, first of all,

where did you learn to drive like that?


In a car.

Car handle really good. Yeah.


Can you speak up, Ricky?


A car.

It handled real good.


So, what do you think, Mr. Dennit?

He sure can drive.


He's got guts.

Dennit Racing needs a racer like him.


Come on, Dad.

He's just a stupid cowboy.


Look how bad he is

in that interview.


Junior, driving has got nothing

to do with interviews.


I just wish to hell you had

a little more stupid cowboy in you.


I felt like I was on a spaceship and...


I'm not sure

what to do with my hands.


Be good to hold them down

by your side.


We're really happy

with what was going on.


And at the end of the day, you know,

you gotta be happy.


- What did you say his name was again?

- His name is Ricky. Ricky Bobby.


Ricky Bobby?

He's got two first names.


Whatever his name is,

let's get him over here.


Everything ended up fine.


Yeah, okay, everything was fine.

Thanks, thanks. Great job in the car.


Ricky Bobby, a force to be

reckoned with, possibly...


in the near future.


Ricky Bobby with yet another

impressive win.


He is dominating NAS CAR.


First or last, baby, you know it!


I've never seen a driver who

wants to win more than this guy.


I could get used to

this winning thing!


Dennit Racing Incorporated

has decided to field an additional car.


And, at the urging of Ricky Bobby...


who's been like a son to me,

only better...


I'm naming Cal Naughton Jr.

As the driver.


All right.


- Cal Naughton.

- Hey...


we just want to say to all

you other drivers out there...


if you smell a delicious,

crispy smell after the race...


it's not your tailpipe,

it's a little bit...


of shake...


And then bake.


Shake and Bake!


- That's our nickname.

- Get used to hearing it.


And Ricky Bobby wins...


with Cal Naughton Jr.

Finishing second.


- Yeah!

- Hey, man!


- Shake...

- And bake!


Hey, driver! Drive these.


Please be 18.


You want to make this out

to Charlotte?


Hey, excuse me, Ricky.


- Hey, Dale.

- Hey, can I get your autograph?


- Sure. Who do I make this out to?

- It's for me. I think you're awesome.


- Don't tell the other drivers.

- I'm not gonna tell anyone.


I'll see you out there.


Absolutely, ma'am,

I'd love to sign your baby.


You're not gonna wanna wash

that forehead.


- That's right, Powerade's number one.

- Not just for hydration, for vitamin.


No, it's me,

it's me, Susan, your assistant.


Gotta watch it when I get into

autograph mode.


I know, I'm sorry. It's my fault,

I shouldn't have been standing.


I'm Ricky Bobby.

Christmas is right around the corner...


and what better gift

to give a loved one...


than the Jackhawk 9000?


Available at Wal-Mart.


When you work on

your mysterious lady-part stuff...


you should have the right tools too.

Such a world will not be boring after playing. There will be more fun for players to observe.
The mechanism by which I imagine the virus operates is divided into three aspects: infectivity, lethality and complexity. Infectivity is the probability that the virus infects the surrounding organisms, lethality is the speed of blood loss of the virus, complexity is the difficulty of the virus intelligent organisms to study the cure, in addition, you can also specify the infectious group such as children, adults, the elderly or animals, you can also specify the transmission route, than people eat diseased meat infection, air infection, sexual infection and so on.",1706488651,1706488651,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Worldbox isn't messing around when it calls itself a god simulator, because you can be as hands-on or hands-off as you please with this game.  I ran this one for two days straight in the background, only to find the world I left with an assortment of races became dominated by elves waging their own world war. Whilst playing hands-on, can easily feel like messing around with disasters in SimCity. But the most satisfying experience comes from allowing you're world's denizens the freedom to explore their own free will and seeing the world they create for themselves.
Speaking of denizens...  You have Humans, Elves, Dwarves and Orks to choose from as well all manner or animals to choose from, along with a host of supernatural menaces to indirectly spice things up.  Otherwise, you can roll up those godly sleeves unleashing blessings, curses and a craptonne of plagues to choose from...  Should you feel the need to indulge in such things.

Other than that I feel like it's on the right track. I feel as though animals don't like to stay in their biome, which is a little annoying sometimes. Idk if I have to set alliances between kingdoms but it seems no matter what I do, one faction kills every thing in the world and populates only one area. My last critique is to make the large maps larger. I would like to be able to create a more full scale world. There's not enough space for multiple clans without them being stacked on one and other to immediately start fighting. A really great game otherwise.

1- The map is too narrow, it should be expanded.
2- The number of living things is low, it should be increased.
3- We cannot intervene in the events that occur automatically over the ages in the game. Since it's God Simulator, we should be able to. If I want, I should be able to stop the acid rain that starts at that moment.
4- When I click on the individuals of the races, there should be an option where I can kill them if I want or fill their health bars.
5- The shapes and sizes of the icons we use when creating the world are very inadequate. These should also be expanded along with Maple.

I am especially in favor of increasing the number of races and creatures and expanding the map. However, the limits of freedom should also be expanded. These are the features I have noticed so far that can increase the playability of the game for longer hours. After spending some more time with the game, I'll add it if there's something that catches my attention.

Tavsiyeler: 

1- Map çok dar, genişletilmeli.
2- Canlı sayısı az, artırılmalı. 
3- Oyunda, çağlarda otomatik olarak gelişen olaylara müdahale edemiyoruz. Madem God Simulator, edebilmeliyiz. Canım isterse o an başlayan asit yağmurunu durdurabilmeliyim. 
4- Irkların bireylerinin üzerine tıkladığımda, onları istersem öldürebileceğim istersem can barlarını doldurabileceğim bir seçenek olmalı. 
5- Dünya yaratırken kullandığımız ikonların şekilleri ve boyutları çok yetersiz. Maple birlikte bunlar da genişletilmeli. 

Özellikle ırk ve canlı sayısının artırılması, haritanın genişletilmesi taraftarıyım. Bununla birlikte özgürlüklerin sınırı da genişletilmeli. Bunlar şu ana dek farkettiğim, oyunun daha uzun saatler oynanabilirliğini artırabilecek özellikler.

The most exciting thing to do is to make a town and blow it up, because that's as much as you can do, the rest is based on the races, you cannot control them as much and they do whatever they want.

Don't get me wrong, I love the game and it's very unique, but there is just, too little to do in it. 

I will do another review when the game updates...

I recommend to wait for it to be full access since there is not much to do at the moment, and there are only 5-7 achievements.

Edit: More updates were up and its now a bit more randomised and lively, kings and leaders can now make decisions on their own and stuff",1642889632,1702948705,False,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Altough once you get through a number civiliizations (let's say 30+ hours of gaming time) you start to see the simplicity of the AI and the replaybility gets hampered. 
Luckily  the dev seems to be planning on adding new races and other content. 

I think 20 bucks is a little steep for the current phase, but you are buying it for a lifetime, and the updates come steadily although somewhat slow.
I'm excited about where this will go, the game has been in development for quite some time, this has got me wondering if maybe the dev should try and get some assistance. 
I think this could be very big if the development speeds up.. Spend money to make money they say.

Great potential, fun for some casual play, do not expect mind-blowing replayability yet until the patches get sped up.

Very enjoyable and able to Create my own content while watching the world advance. My will shall be done, here on earth as it is in heaven. I enjoy watching them expand and tackle any challenge I throw at them. I enjoy trying to start an zombie Apocalypse which changes the balance of world power. I like how the ruins of the previous civilization is left behind waiting to be tear down by other civilizations or new ones. The ruins of old civilization actually is one of the best features. I like seeing other civilizations move in and build around them or knock them down to make room to build. One of the statue was left standing from the previous human kingdom that ruled over the entire planet before the orcs took over. I allowed humanity to rule all over earth and advance in peace covering the entire globe. Then they fell from the plague, rebellions, and zombies. Orcs moved in with what ever that was left of humanity. Nothing but ancient human ruins all across the globe. I just added the elves. The Human Civilization is coming to an end from greed and power. They need to redeem themselves to me their god lol.

Update: weeeelllll Never mind on them proving themselves to me. As I was writing the review, the orks wiped out what was left  of them. they were on this island isolated from the main land. I didn't know the game doesn't pause when hitting the window key to get to the desktop screen lol. The only thing left of the human civilization are the ruins and marvelous statues.

Some things I don't like. One of them is the advancement stops at medieval era. Nothing else beyond that. I don't like the fact that there is no fog of war. Everybody already knows where everybody is at. Battles happens to quickly to where it feels like its on fast mode. There is no identification on the advancement progress of each civilization. I don't like the size of the map. Seems too small. I would like to add more civs and expand the world.Everything is too close.

Pretty much, if you want a game that has unlimited options to play with it, this is it. The game is a Pixel Game though being very well entertaining, through recent updates, I would say it gets updates of about 1 update per 3 months. Or more depending on the people who have played for a longer period of time than I have, this game also runs very smoothly (depending on the PC you have) and will be a very good play if you have some time to cut. This game also lets you play with a ton of animals and mythological creatures. From sea turtles to dragons you have very good options with what you want to play with. But this game does also have some spice to it.

Humans, Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves, very good. They are the only species that can populate and have cities, and you can get me started on the Ages/Eras, the Ages are very well done, there is a total of 10 Ages/Eras. Age of: Hope, Sun, Dark, Tears, Moon, Chaos, Enchantment, Ice, Ash, and Despair. But, Mods... Mods in particular (the unofficial editing of a game which you can download onto the main game) are very hard to get, they get completely wiped from little kids because you need discord. And discord needs to verify your age to see if you are at least 16+, so this terminates Mods for the little kids who play the game... But I would like to make my final verdict before this review turns into a whole document.

Its a Pixel Game, different and unique options to play, different sets of Age/Eras, Fictional Game. My Final Verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I see no reason why you won't purchase this game.",1700808243,1700808243,True,3,0,0.519418179988861084,0,True,False,True

The core gameplay loop is simple: you create a world to your liking with different biomes, resources, dangers, animals or evil wizards. Where you place and create islands, continents or volcanoes is entirely up to you. After you have completed your world, you can unleash up to 4 different races on it (orcs, humans, elves and dwarves), who will immediately start building settlements, harvesting resources and taking care of dangers (if they'll survive whatever the world had in store for them).

From here on it's mostly just watch and wait as civilizations will develop over time, research technologies, plunder, expand, found religions or rebel against the king and secede. In the end, you don't have to participate as a god unless you want to help a group or simply use your destructive powers to bring death and chaos to the world.

All in all, a good game to simply relax and observe. Unfortunately the workshop support is only for maps so far, I hope we get some decent official mod support.",1639176996,1700729392,True,1,0,0.518518567085266113,0,True,False,True

This game lets you put 1 or many races down and interact as little or as much as you feel necessary. Most of the possible races come from mods admittedly, which are very supported by the creators. 

Heck even as it currently is the price is pretty good for how fun this can be and if their discord is anything to go by there is only more in store.

I CANNOT recommend this game enough. Buy it and at the very least you will get your moneys worth in pure entertainment either in the base vanilla version or through the mods other people have put out for this game.",1700184502,1700184502,True,1,0,0,0,True,False,True

Ingredients:

1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter
2. 1/2 cup white sugar
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar
4. 1/4 cup water
5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
6. 1 pinch salt
7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced
8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie

Directions:

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).
2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.
3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.
4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.
5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",1700138490,1700138490,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

I put a massive land border of mountains to separate it and put new Orcs there. That area became a safe haven for humans to bounce back (yes they killed the Orcs again) after a zombie apocalypse nearly killed off everyone on the continent (twice).

That zombie apocalypse started after punishing another kingdom for their part in killing off the Orcs, by uprooting them from their home island. So i plagued the island where they built one of their villages with Biomass, with a few zombies to help kill them off... only for one of the infected to escape onto mainland. After trying to fix my mistake shining divine light over every reach of the entire continent, I left humanity to fend for itself for the next 1400 years.

That kingdom, the Realm of the Sha, fended off zombies as the sole kingdom for 500 years, gradually claiming more land before a rebellion, the Realm of the Kos, split the kingdom into two. 200 years later, the Realm of the Kos would finish off the Sha, unwittingly triggering a wave of zombie infections which almost destroyed all life on the continent. The safe haven I built for humanity, which became a village with 3 town halls and a population of nearly 1000, was dismantled by the zombies.

Miraculously, after being whittled down to 160 villagers, they slowly began reclaiming the continent. By the 1500s, all other cultures were wiped out, and the Realm of the Kos repopulated the continent. By the 1800s, the zombie apocalypse had been completely wiped out, and humanity thrived again.

Worldbox, huh? I've battled demons, fought the God Hand, and even had my arm bitten off, but this... this is a whole new level of bizarre. Let's dive in and see if this world-building adventure can make me laugh harder than Griffith's so-called ""dream.""

The graphics are like a pixelated version of Griffith's dream – shiny, pretty, and completely detached from reality. It's like witnessing Griffith's ascension to godhood in 8-bit glory. Can we add a pixelated Behelit for some extra flair? No? Okay, moving on.

The controls are easier to master than trying to grasp the depths of Griffith's manipulative schemes. It's a point-and-click adventure that even a one-armed, one-eyed swordsman could handle. You'll feel like a real Hawk of Light, minus the hawk.

In Worldbox, you become the divine hand that shapes civilizations, like how Griffith shaped the Band of the Hawk. The difference is, you don't need to betray anyone to create your dream world here. So, be a better leader than Griffith, and maybe your flock won't hate you.

But wait, there's more! If you want to have some Berserk fun, try recreating the Eclipse event – with cute little pixelated Apostles and everything! Just remember, unlike Griffith, you don't have to sacrifice your comrades – you can actually be a decent overlord.

In conclusion, Worldbox is a quirky world-building game that lets you play creator instead of sacrificing your friends for your dream. So, get your virtual God Hand ready and shape a world even more surprising than Griffith's fall from grace.

I awoke from my slumber six thousand years later to find all the humans were extinct. The elves had committed genocide. All the human cities had been destroyed and reduced to dust. Their lives, their monuments, their way of life deleted from history.

Worldbox, the God Simulator, offers players the unique experience of wielding omnipotent powers to shape and influence a world of their own creation. Developed by Maxim Karpenko, this indie gem provides a sandbox for players to unleash their inner deity and craft their own epic narratives. In this in-depth review, we'll delve into the various aspects that make Worldbox an enchanting and captivating god game.

Graphics and Art Style (8/10):
Worldbox boasts a pixel art style that, while minimalistic, is surprisingly charming and expressive. The game's visuals, which might seem rudimentary at first glance, progressively reveal their intricate beauty as you delve into the game's mechanics and world-building capabilities. The aesthetic choice contributes to the game's unique character and allows the player's imagination to fill in the gaps, making the pixel art a perfect canvas for your divine creations.

Gameplay (9/10):
At its core, Worldbox is about divine intervention and the power to create, shape, and destroy. The game allows you to place and control various life forms, such as humans, animals, and mythological creatures, and influence their development. You can create a world teeming with civilizations, guiding their evolution from primitive tribes to advanced empires. The level of detail is astonishing, with factors like temperature, terrain, and the availability of resources playing a significant role in the growth of your creations.

The ability to customize your world is a key feature, letting you sculpt the land, set the weather, and even introduce magic into your domain. The freedom to create and experiment is vast, making each playthrough unique. This sandbox nature ensures that no two games are ever alike, and the game's replayability is a testament to its depth and complexity.

The AI-driven interactions between the inhabitants of your world add another layer of depth to the gameplay. Watching your citizens form societies, wage wars, and develop alliances is fascinating, as the world you've created takes on a life of its own.

Audio (7/10):
The sound design in Worldbox is simple but effective. The game's serene and atmospheric music complements the meditative nature of world-building, and the sound effects, while not overly impressive, do a decent job of immersing you in your divine realm. It's worth noting that sound design is not a primary focus of the game, and the simplicity of the audio serves to highlight the importance of the gameplay and creativity.

Replayability (10/10):
The true magic of Worldbox lies in its replayability. Every game session allows you to experiment with different scenarios, shaping the world in countless ways. Whether you prefer to be a benevolent deity, fostering peace and prosperity, or a malevolent force, sowing chaos and destruction, the game accommodates your choices. It's a testament to the game's depth that you can play for hours on end without ever growing tired of its possibilities.

Community and Mods (9/10):
Worldbox benefits greatly from a dedicated modding community, which continually expands the game's possibilities. There's a plethora of user-generated content available, from new creatures and buildings to gameplay tweaks and enhancements. This extends the game's life even further, as it's not just the developer but also the community that contributes to the evolution of the game.

Overall (9/10):
Worldbox - God Simulator is a creative masterpiece that taps into the desire to wield godlike powers and craft unique, evolving worlds. It's an engrossing and deeply satisfying experience, offering an impressive level of control over the destinies of your digital denizens. With its evolving features, mod support, and limitless replayability, Worldbox is a must-play for fans of sandbox and simulation games, as well as anyone who's ever wondered what it's like to be a divine creator. Dive in and let your godly imagination run wild in this pixelated universe.",1698867178,1698867178,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

These things make every event feel so much more personal as you watch these people survive events as one inevitably rises to rule the others as the others die along the way.  Worldbox understands this and has done a better job with it than almost any ""God Game"" has in the past ~15 years.

1. make a feature that make a kingdom never do war.
2. add a custom trait that you can bend your will on, but to make it fair you can only get it when you have all traits.
3. add different types of cures, and make the necromancer able to add the different types of cures.
4. add new types of tiles: like dense forest tiles, ect
5. add the world tree, and make elves gain a boost when near it.
6. add a mana/magic stat and add traits for it.
7. make people able to give and remove items and the enchants on them.
8. make more sizes for placing stuff down.

That is all the ideas i have for now, please place yours in the Comments. :)

CREATIVE MAP MAKING
Get creative and make a map or two or three or 20.   I like how water fills when you dig out land areas (think Dwarf Fortress)

TRY THE MOBILE VERSION FREE
The game is a mobile game (which you can try for free btw).   
However, I found the PC/Steam version of this game a lot more enjoyable to explore. 

Highly recommended.  Hopefully they add bridges.

To answer my own question: The amount of dynamics in the civilizations makes looking at your created worlds like watching fish in an aquarium. They constantly grow, split up, fight each other, found new villages, destroy others, get hit by disasters... Involuntarily you become invested, in the story of a person, a city maybe, a country. Maybe a kingdom makes its last stand on a beautiful island and from that point on, this island will always have a place in your heart. Maybe a random dude manages to kill a fire wizard terrorizing the whole world and rises up to become king - or dies in the next orc attack. A war is turned because the overwhelmingly large aggressor has multiple revolutions which allows the Alliance of Light to rebuild and finally defend. Maybe the last dwarven village, one that has existed since the beginning of time, falls victim to the armies of the immortal elven overlord, ushering in a millenium of elven domination on that continent - ended only by the combined efforts of multiple human kingdoms, united against a common foe. 

All of these are just single sentences taken from stories that happened on one or the other world of mine - stories I will not forget for a long time and the reason why this game is so brilliant.",1696274747,1696274747,True,1,0,0.516129076480865479,0,True,False,True

IN the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.

And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.

And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.

And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.

And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.

And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.

And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.

And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after is kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.

And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

And the evening and the morning were the third day.

And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:

And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.

And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.

And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.

And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.

And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.

And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.

And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.

And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.

And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.

And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.

And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.

And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.

And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is the upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.

And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.

And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.

It just lacks dynamics. Also Im a big fan of live-action  strategy games so a lot more options to let kingdoms interact with each other would be cool too.

Another problem with the game is that there’s not much content to it, it’s not this super fun torture simulator that all the YouTubers make it out to seem because they already did it all, there’s not much experimentation to be had either, yes creating an entire weird wacky world that looks stupid and giving all the inhabitants crazy stupid traits is fun but only for a while. The game just doesn’t have that flair nor abundance of content that it should have. Watching a little colony of humans grow then destroying and killing them just gets stale and there isn’t much else you can do other than build up a colony then watch it burn. Overall the game is overpriced not enough content little experimental capabilities and a stale gameplay loop, I wouldn’t buy this if I were you.

The game has evolved enormously since its inception: from the graphics to the world generation, not forgetting the sound, the addition of biomes, new creatures and more extensive customisation of the settings.

But I can understand that this game isn't for everyone, mainly because it's a god game with no scenario or difficulty, so if that's what you're interested in, it's probably not for you.

The price is also a bit high for what the game is at the moment, I'd go for 10, 12 or even 15 euros, but no more.

One of the game's strong points is that it has a rather active and inventive community, which makes it possible to find interesting worlds or worlds representing specific regions of the world.

I'd say that you shouldn't forget that the game is in beta, but it's progressing at a satisfactory pace, but it's still possible to get bored fairly quickly. Personally, I play the game from time to time when I have a new idea, want to pass the time or when there's a new update.

A word of advice: if you buy the game, type hamburger in the options menu for a while, and you'll have access to a whole range of possibilities.",1692305734,1692305734,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Its a fun and fairly diverse game that is kind of goofy but not annoyingly random. There are a few aspects that give you a slight realistic sim vibe although it is mostly simplistic. Some moderate to minor complaints: The A.I. can be very stupid. The path finding for units can be very poor (For example on an Earth Map USA could be attacking Russia and they'd load up their soldiers in Alaska then drop them off in Spain to walk all the way across Eurasia). The diplomacy can be very very dumb. I'll use Earth again as an example. Brazil will randomly ally with like Australia which is useless because obviously if a larger country near them declares war on them then Australia isnt going to do shit until the war is already lost. Still a fun game and with mods to add new cool things and to fill in gaps within the game design it can become even better.,1689645811,1689645811,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

First I would add some crossbows, muskets, and basic firearms, next I would add horses, carriages, and maybe war ships that can participate in battles/wars and lastly maybe you should add some new biomes to fit different styles/situations of the game. Other than those requests I would give this game a 9/10, If you haven't played this game yet DO IT. It is well worth its cost and I hope to see more great things added to this awesome package that is one of the best indie/early access games I've played recently on Steam.

I played the game on mobile way back and thought I'd really wish for a better ability to chronicle the world and it's beings and create a history that you can look back on. The game is still basically the same in that reapect, leaving me wanting, but is filled with a ton of new features that just feel like fluff and don't feel like they add much meaning to the game.

If you just like making impermanent stuff, and/or destroying it, this is for you!

If you are like me and would want something to show for your work in the end, I can't really recommend this, although with a few changes it could be a lovely game.",1688796781,1688796781,False,2,0,0.489690721035003662,0,True,False,True

I greatly enjoy watching my little world progress. I spend quite a lot of time making maps, often generating random maps several times until I get one that I like, and greatly enjoy watching my little world progress.

I've played iOS for quite a while, almost to completion (and purchased the Premium semi-recently, though even the limited functions available for free still allows for a full experience), but I also bought the desktop version because despite the mobile version being much cheaper than desktop, you miss a lot of the community and modding experience with mobile, especially iOS, due to Apple's ""safeguarding"" (jail), and the higher processing capacity of computers allows for bigger worlds.

Firstly, the game grants me unlimited creativity and freedom. I can become an all-powerful deity, shaping and controlling an entire world. From terrain and creatures to the development of civilizations, I can mold every detail according to my own will. This freedom of creativity brings me immense joy and satisfaction, with infinite possibilities each time I start the game.

Secondly, the game's simulation system is remarkably well-executed. Creatures and civilizations have their own behaviors and interactions within the game. I can observe the communication between creatures, the growth of civilizations, and the outbreak of wars. This realistic simulation system breathes life into the entire world, where every decision and action has an impact, making me feel like I truly shape an organic ecosystem.

Additionally, the game's graphical style is simple yet charming. While not highly realistic, the game employs a delightful pixel art style that exudes a unique charm. Furthermore, the interface design is intuitive and straightforward, allowing me to easily explore and navigate the game world.

Overall, ""Worldbox"" allows me to become a mighty creator, shaping a world entirely of my own. The unlimited creativity, engaging simulation system, and captivating graphical style make this game an unforgettable experience. If you enjoy sandbox games and exploring boundless possibilities, I highly recommend ""Worldbox"" to you, as it will undoubtedly provide endless fun and unleash your creativity.",1650250046,1687770587,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,True

Watched a lot of let's play videos on world box and from what I've seen of the mods maybe the creators can consider making them official utilities and such.

Add to it the fact that the map size could be much larger but due to compatibility with other platforms besides desktop, they don't have options that support this, and it ends up being fun for a little while but after that you've done it, there's nothing really else to do.

The baseline is essentially, place down kingdoms, they form up, kill eachother. Events happen. You can play god for a bit and it's fun to do wacky shit, but once you've done that you've done everything and there's no space to create insanely creative large maps and kingdoms that could really offer up and provide an enjoyable experience. If you're a fan of games that you play for a period of time and then drop never to play again, this is a good game for that.

A god simulator that doesn't really give you the freedom of a true god.

Everything in this game is quite fun and fine, shaping landscapes, creating life... except 3 features i have always wanted to see:

1) to create some ""main characters"".

By that, i mean the ability to make someone really special and unique, i know there are traits you can give them, buff you can drop on them, but none of that can truly make someone invincible.
Let's say: i want to create a human hero, who is ""the protagonist of the story"", undefeated in battles, irreplacable part of his faction's strength and its last hope. Currently simply not possible. Being able to freeze and modify a npc's stat would be a solution to this problem. Giving someone HP that never depletes, or insanely high ATK etc...

2) randomness

Have you ever tried using the earthquake to create land and sea? Or used that land ant to create island on an empty ocean? Then you probably noticed that too, the shape and pattern is always the same. The earthquake raised or lowers the terrain by same 2 or 3 fissure shaped forms, do it a few times and you will immediately start to notice it. Put 2 land ants not too far from each other, have them start to create landmass at same time, you will see too, same pattern exactly.

3) god hands use the tile you want it to use
Sometimes i create land using godhands, but it draw terrain i don't want it to create, so half of the time i have to create a god hand, see what it creates, and then pause the game just to kill it again.


Overall, a decent ""afk"" game. You set the stage, you put actors on it, and let them do their thing. Every civilization follows the same general technological developement, the ever repeating cycle of peace and war. You can mingle with all that but it gets boring fast. After that, it's just like having your own ant colony.

And i just took at look at the price, it costs the same as games such as project zomboid. That takes the cake for me, changing thumb up to thumb down now. The price/content ratio definitely cannot compete with games like project zomboid.",1680933562,1686458862,False,2,0,0.54356849193572998,8,True,False,True

So this game is basically you making some kingdoms, starting a cruel war between between them, bombing the crap out of the kingdoms, untill you hit that depressing song which makes you rethink life. You end the war, and rebuild the holes and destruction you made, since it's you who's the bad guy.
And then, repeat. 

The game is simply said so amazing, you create, destroy and rebuild the world you're in charge of.
The community is amazing, and the maps people make are amazing.

From Simple English Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants.

The grasses include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae. This family is also called Gramineae. The family also include some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[1] These three families are not closely related but all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a common life-style.

The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatching thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales.

Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[2] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).

Evolution of grass
Grasses include some of the most versatile plant life-forms. They became widespread toward the end of the Cretaceous. Fossilized dinosaur dung (coprolites) have been found containing grass phytoliths (silica stones inside grass leaves).[3] Grasses have adapted to conditions in lush rain forests, dry deserts, cold mountains and even intertidal habitats, and are now the most widespread plant type. Grass is a valuable source of food and energy for many animals.[4]

Grass and people
Lawn grass is often planted on sports fields and in the area around a building. Sometimes chemicals and water is used to help lawns to grow.

People have used grasses for a long time. People eat parts of grasses. Corn, wheat, barley, oats, rice and millet are cereals, common grains whose seeds are used for food and to make alcohol such as beer.

Sugar comes from sugar cane, which is also a plant in the grass family. People have grown grasses as food for farm animals for about 4,000 years. People use bamboo to build houses, fences, furniture and other things. Grass plants can also be used as fuel, to cover roofs, and to weave baskets.

Language
In English, the word ""grass"" appears in several phrases. For example:

""The grass is always greener on the other side"" means ""people are never happy with what they have and want something else"".
""Don't let the grass grow under your feet"" means ""Do something"".
""A snake in the grass"" is about a person that will not be honest and will trick others.
All flesh is grass: Old Testament book of Isaiah, chapter 40, verses 6–8. A very true observation of the present-day ecology. See the Miocene for the ecological relevance.
Grass is a slang term for cannabis (pot, weed, or marijuana).

How the game works

The game is probably similar to John Connway's game of life. Having simple sets of rules will lead to a difficult to predict and complex outcome.

Main progression system in the game is traits. You farm out traits by inspecting individuals and hovering over the respective traits.

The Good

Breadth of different choices and interactions:
- There are many choices that you can make to affect the entire ecosystem
Chill and relaxing:
- just watch things happen. Great if you're a people observer
Well optimised:
- The game runs very smoothly with large amount of entities and groups executing different actions and making different decisions
Wars are reasonable:
- Countries and races don't start wars without reasons. They usually start it because they need resources. Finite resources lead to war.
Great modding community:
- The modding community puts out high quality mods
High replayability:
- You can sink hours into this game if you can appreciate how things run

The Bad

Awful mod support:
- the game constantly break community mods with mini updates that adds no new content
lack of depth:
- ships don't indicate in their inventory what goods they are transporting. They only seem to show troops being transported. This could potentially mean that ships going in / out of cities to other cities only serves the purpose of visuals, rather than mechanics.
- no proper fresh/salt water systems. Spawn a small number of ppl in desert surrounded by mountains and somehow they can survive without water
- limited technology system. 
  - Your cities improve over time but they don't gain modern weapon or super strong magic. Staffs and small mages from cities exists but they can never be a 1 vs 100.
  - No improved defenses against invading ships, only watch towers with arrows. Where are cannons or magic artillery?
  - No flying ships? 
lack of interaction between God (the player) and cities
- Interaction is always one-way. I do things, they react to the changes. They are unable to communicate with me
- Cities, races and individuals that religious don't pray to me (the god) and ask for wishes or make offerings
lack of minute/micro details:
- Trespassing territories does not incurr hatred / wanting to start war
- cannot configure races to be stronger/weaker
- cannot configure towns/cities to be stronger/weaker
- Disproportionate amount of troops to villagers ratio. There are always around 40% of the population being professional soldiers. This is completely unrealistic. Country leaders being militaristic doesn't affect this ratio and that trait only affects how ""war-mongering"" they are. 
- thin islands lots of resources but are ignored. These islands are too small for settlements but have resources. This is because there are no gatherer/adventurers that will swim across / travel via ship to these islands
Tedious to farm traits:
- You have to inspect every individual and hover over the trait. Why can't it be made less tedious by having it automatically unlock whenever an individual gains the trait?",1685479014,1685479014,True,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0,True,False,True

It's not a bad game but it's so not worth the price. The steam price is twice as expensive as mobile premium with no extra content. The game overall severely lacks content, and the existing mechanics seem unpolished and rushed (even though it's evident upon seeing the update history that the development cycle is very very slow). No steam workshop either and you have to get mods from another third-party website. Afaik the game also never participates in sales for some reason. 

Some people might still enjoy the game but i think for most people, it'll be disappointing. I suggest buying it's premium on mobile or waiting to see if it ever participates in a sale. I'll edit this if the game gets more developed and I'm convinced to buy it again.",1685104082,1685104253,False,0,0,0.476190477609634399,1,True,False,True

Many other games in this genre fail in the vein of creativity and freedom, yet you will find little boredom when you recreate the Black Death, whilst forcing humanity to fight a dragon and hundreds of demons. The community is tight-knit and has produced a number of useful, interesting, and simply fun mods. Maps are plentiful, some based on real world areas, others completely original designs.

The base game has a wonderful mix of fantasy details, such as dwarves, orcs, elves (all of which, along with humans, are civilized, meaning they can create countries), and the aforementioned dragons. It also contains many diplomatic and geopolitical features, such as alliances, wars, and more. There is great potential for world building and storytelling through random names and details for tools and weapons, and random cultures that each have a different level of technological development.

Maybe if the game was ten dollars or so I would recommend it, but twenty dollars seems like a lot when I hardly see myself spending twenty hours on this game in a short amount of time, and that is only if you follow the one dollar for one hour of fun rule.

Also, the content does get kind of stale after a while. It was really cool to have god powers at first, but after a couple of play throughs, things start to repeat themselves.

The game's steep price tag doesn't match its value, considering the limited gameplay depth and lack of complexity. It feels like a mobile game ported over to PC, failing to deliver a satisfying, full-fledged god simulation experience.

I like seeing how the AI carries out their plans for rebellions and war, and how the clans and kingdoms change over time.

You can make a kingdom, watch them grow and expand, and then watch them fight another kingdom. There's alot of options of destructions too if you just want to watch the world burn. However, I do think its a bit overpriced for the amount of content you get, but with future updates hopefully more ways to interact with the kingdoms gets added.

I think it's just the nature of how you can watch empires grow, inspire events, and basically change whatever you want. It's the kind of game I can just leave on in the background, with the time sped up, and just see how things evolve. Super fun laid back game and a rather original concept.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more",1683692763,1683692763,True,0,0,0.416666656732559204,0,True,False,True

Despite being developed by only one person (or so I've heard), updates and new content are infrequent, making the game feel stagnant and boring after only a short amount of time.

Furthermore, the refund policy is incredibly strict for an early access game. While I understand Steam's refund policy (as you can see from my profile, I am a Steam power user), I strongly believe that it should be less strict for early access games, especially considering that they are not fully developed games. In the case of this particular game, refunds are being rejected even if you've played the game for just above the 2-hour limit. This is unacceptable for an early access game, where bugs and issues are expected.

Additionally, every update breaks most mods, rendering them useless and making it hard to enjoy the game with any added content. It's worth noting that most existing mods have not been updated and many of them are no longer maintained. This is an issue, even in the context of an early access game, and it further limits the replay value of this game.

Given the current state of the game, I cannot recommend it at its current price. A reasonable price point for this game would be around $5 to $7.50. However, even at this lower price, I would advise potential buyers to approach this game with caution and lower expectations, perhaps waiting for the early access to end.",1682478062,1682478062,False,12,3,0.539113283157348633,0,True,False,True
