+ Cool setting - Chinese Medieval

- Optimization (especially on steamdeck)
- Polish overall
- Graphic design is just off on the U.I. Hire a graphic designer for like 2 Months and it will increase the quality of the game by a HUGE margin...
- Voice Acting only in Chinese - If you want to cater to EU and US Market you just need to tailor the product for that.

On this game, even after patch 1.08 came out, many of the still relevant issues have not been fixed.

Pros:

1)  Not Dynasty warriors like.  When playing against certain bosses, you actually have to have some strategy.
2)  Graphics are good.  The environment looks nice, with good tessellation, and also character models are well made.  It's nice not to see 'cartoonish' like graphics in a ROTK type of game for once.
3)  Lots of different equipment for different type of builds to make.
4)  Does not require a lot of VRAM.  My system typically shows around 4700-5500mb VRAM usage.


Cons:

1)  Performance
A.  Fps can range from 100+ all the down to the 20s within just a few seconds.  While fighting in the open field, I can get 90-100 fps, but the moment I go to the wooded areas, where the trees become transparent so that player can still be seen, my fps can easily drop down to the 20s.
B)  Severe micro stuttering occurs almost every time horses are used.  The map does not matter.  Gameplay can be smooth, but once horses are summoned, the issues commence.  While fraps may say 70 fps, still about twice a second I will get severe stuttering, and it can last for the rest of the map.  It is over whelming.
C)  Changing maps can sometimes take several minutes.  I will be honest, the majority of the time it will only take about 20-30 seconds to load a new map, but on multiple occasions, it has taken several minutes.  There have been a couple times where I thought the game had frozen because it took over four minutes to load a new map.
D)  No type of tutorial to aid in things like forging, the Furnace, assigning skills on foot and horseback.  After several days I figured out that If you have skills assigned on horse to use with a bow, you can not use those skills once you switch to spear or sword even though you are still on horse.   Spear, sword, and bow skills on horse can only be used on horse while you are switched to those weapons.  Each category has its on skill slot section.  I have no sword skills,  but I can't mix, spear and bow skills, and have them assigned on the same screen.
E)  Randomly changes weapons even when I haven't pressed a button.
F)  On the bottom right of the screen. the fix button, and the operation method button are permanently on the screen.  So many times they're popped up even though I didn't intentionally click them.  I did click them, but it was on accident each time.  When you are fighting, and these interruptions pop up, they can cause serious frustration.
G)  While it says English, I would say less than half of the game is English.  While some of the npc, may not be vital to game play, yet when I have to choose options, or choose a horse skill assignment, I want to know what I'm doing.  Plus I'm paying for the game which says 'English.'
H)  There are some reusable character models used over and over again.   Lol, like the black smith...
I)  Sometimes entire buildings will disappear and not comeback if you go behind them and then leave.


Other suggestions

1)  Please have an option to have three or four equipment builds saved.  I want to have a build saved for bosses that have high pierce rate and skill haste, another for regular combat that has high attack and skill break, and another that has high stamina to explore.  I don't want to have to go through and spend several minutes finding, and then assigning a new build every time I change situations.  Fenyx, Immortal Rising has it so that you can pre-save builds, and once you go to the character screen, you click on 'build 2' and it changes to that build, or which ever one you choose.
2)  I want there to be an option to enable or disable the ability to use the mouse to activate skills, items, or click on the companion.  On the left of the screen, if you click on the companion, their status menu pops up.  So many times I've accidentally used items, skills, or opened up the annoying companion screen.  PLEASE give us the OPTION to enable or disable this.

My thoughts.  Even though I listed a lot of negatives, I really do like the game, but sometimes I want to turn it off because of these issues.  I believe this game has huge potential, and I look forward to new content ""IF"" these issues can get fixed.  I understand it is a new game, but that's why you delay the game for a few weeks so that you can get some things worked out.  I just don't want them to pull a Nier Automata and put out a DLC when performance issues haven't been addressed.

It's a top down ARPG hack and slash with a decent skill tree for your spear, bow and sword. The loot system and drops are decent as well as I have a some purple gear, gold gear and a red bow. I think the tiers of weapons and gear start from white, green, blue, purple, gold then red as the highest and obviously you do not get them straight away but as you get to a certain level, then you start seeing the higher tier drops.

I am liking the simplistic game play and as I am not Chinese, majority of the main story is written/translated into English. When you explore around town and talk to random NPC's, that is when it tends to have some weird written text/dialogue or it's still in Chinese which shouldn't matter anyways imo.

I would say to give this game a go for the price as you cannot expect too much. The reason why we game is to enjoy the story or game play or what ever people like about a game as it is something to do to pass our time.

The main gripe about this game is that I am sick of these loading screens each time you go to an area. Since the campaign is apparently around 30 hours and the maps are small at times, its like a loading screen, then you go into a house, chat for a moment or a few minutes, then head back outside with another loading screen. So it's literally loading screens galore each time you go into an area which is doing my head at the moment after 20+ hours..

There were some bugs where I could not progress but that is why I do multiple manual saves like 5-10 minutes apart from each other and plus with a recent update, there is a fix icon on the bottom right of the game that loads to a previous save and fixes the issue when you cannot progress/go into another area.

Had some massive frame drops when huge armies are in the map and/or on the screen, sometimes the game would feel like it's stuttering as in when you are running or riding the horse, it will pull you back a bit. So you just reload to a save or it would eventually go away when you go to another map/area.

I did enjoy the game besides the countless loading screens which towards the end get frustrating but I would still recommend the game for the price as it's like Dynasty Warriors and Darksiders Genesis had a baby.",1705883954,1706419610,True,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0,True,False,False

I loved the talent tree's option of completely resetting and respecing at any point in the game, switiching the style of combat whenever i feel like. either focussing on one weapon, e.g. spear, (and on higher levels two weapons) completely maxing out its potential or making a mix which includes multiple weapons.
There did seem to be a bias towards spear in the game however, since this talent tree has more skill options and more additional talent benefits than others. maybe because the other trees arent unlocked until higher level, which is okay but it would be nice to have a more expanded sword spec similar to spear spec for example. But then the game would need to be longer since some of its talents arent unlocked until high levels and leaves you with little playtime before the game is finished

however, throughout the game i thought that it felt unfinished.
The gear crafting is not utilised to its potential and could be skipped completely, not having missed anything since the best rewards come from boss fights.
It would be good if you get enough of the crafting materials when you're at the required level to craft them so you could use them for some levels before getting an upgrade, but for me this hardly ever happened and that one time i did craft a rather good item it got replaced by an item that dropped of of a boss two levels later.
Also, the chance on stat rolls when crafting an item would be a good addition if i could spen more time in the game. Now it seems like there are elements of RPG games included in a game that finishes as soon as the story line is done. Which is not bad but gives me too little time to spend on crafting to actually enjoy it or feel its rewarding enough to spend time on.

Additionally, the crafting of potions could be negated since you could buy or loot all the potions you needed. maybe not the max levels you could craft, but they seemed unncessary whilst playing on normal mode.

it felt like both crafting of gear and potions was an option that did not add much to the game. It would be great it there would be a genuine 'need' for me to invest time into crafting if it would give me gear that is actually an upgrade for quite a while.

I did actually get a lot of red quality crafting recipe's that would have been good upgrades but I was never able to craft all of these because I was missing one ingredient (Mythical water i believe) that I had a hard time finding ways to farm (i only found it in one spot in the game) so i could create these items. And since you need it for all high end items, i was unfortunately only able to create one piece. 

Also, these items were level 70 items and i completed the game at level 73, which means you dont really get to have a long time benefit of these crafted items. And honestly, the last boss is rather easy on normal so i did not feel i missed good gear to help me beat the boss.

similarly, on normal difficulty I've never felt the need to use buff food. which is sad because i think it can add a lot to a game (even on normal difficulty). 

I had to get used to gear not having any esthetic value, since your looks get 'updated' the higher level you are and are not based on the gear you loot. Which is a nice change to what other games generally do and was intrigued by this new experience. However, after level 40, if im right, you dont get any more updates on gear, which i frankly found very dissapointing. I would have loved to get bigger spears the higher level i got. a better looking bow and sword etc. especially since all my enemies and companions seem to have these awesome weapons and gear. another reason the game felt unfinished, because why would you stop getting better looking gear after hitting level 40 when you're half way through the storyline? Even ore so because you play a character that gets a more central role in the wars between the clans and ranks up to general, which would correspond with better looking gear (next to the sicker looking skills you get from the talents)

either i missed a lot or the game failed to explain certain things.
for example the  Eight Trigrams Furnace. I never got to use this to craft items 
It could be that its simple to use, i just never figured out how to use it and missed a guide in the game that explained it to me, or even introduce it rather than it just being an option that pops up at the blacksmith vendor, other than 'place the mats in the right order'.

additionally, the dialogue scenes could be smoothed out a bit more. a lot of the times the dialogue has stopped but the game seems to wait for something before moving on which slows down the flow of the game.

Lastly, the translation bugs or a lot of the times having no translation at all and only seeing characters made it hard to follow the storyline, so i have no feedback on the story and narrative part of the game.

maybe a lot of critical comments above but that's because I feel its just not a finished product (or it is, if you remove the crafting of items and update the gear aesthetics after level 40). I really enjoyed it for the combat even though it's rather easy on normal difficulty (i started on normal because i have no prior experience of these kind of combat games). And maybe playing on higher difficulty would fix some of the crafting points i mentioned above, i dont know.",1706267936,1706396721,False,1,0,0,0,True,False,False

游戏的本身质量是可以的，并没有很多人说的那么不堪，有问题可能是其他。。。
举个例子：我本来想做个2077，无奈手头只有CS的模型，然后做了雏形，进行测评后一片骂声，说战斗手感稀烂，还很卡顿。然后我慌了，拼命的优化战斗，时间资金都耗费进去了，其他原本的很多想法没了。那么问题来了，再怎么优化战斗，玩家还是只能玩出CS的感觉，不会觉得好玩。
我玩赵云传整体感受，不是在打人，就是去打人的路上，偶尔带了几个人，有点稀薄的女主剧情。那么这个游戏的爽点在哪呢，玩家们想掏钱的欲望在哪里呢，打斗？都被人喷上天了。这个游戏的唯一玩法—打斗都和天命奇御类似，能有什么打击感。再加上优化差，还有卡顿，已经被主流玩家宣判死刑，那些主流玩家，那些金主爸爸们谁手里没有法环只狼仁王。我曾向周围人推荐过，有人就说过，玩这，为什么不去玩只狼了。为什么B站有UP赤裸裸骑脸输出，很明显刻意抹黑，还有很多人呼应，因为游戏的打斗机制，就是没有市场的。
看到从主创的随笔中看到后期还要改进打斗手感。真心建议，优化要卡顿不能有，手感还是算了吧。改来改去，到头来很可能还是那句 2024年，就这！！！
主创们现在一定要理清思路，知道在有限的时间里面和资金中需要做什么。做什么才有成效。当务之急，是给游戏新鲜血液。也就是提高可玩性。不要给新玩家们一种这游戏只有打斗的感觉。
抛开战斗，这游戏是有很多优点的，要做的扬长避短。
游戏的剧情很不错，首先赶紧将后续剧情的补完，剧情要丰富，也要有自由度。让玩家多自主选择，不要当摄像头，适当剧情杀，不要搞什么“两心相隔”。让玩家真的有化身赵子龙纵横三国大地，兴复汉室，实现丞相夙愿，我主沉浮的代入感。江山要打女主也不能少，现在回忆当初赵云传1老实讲印象最深刻的还是赵云和貂蝉的一二事，要懂情怀。女主的剧情一定不能马虎。
游戏中同伴系统也是一大特色，队友养成也是一大特点，完全可以作为亮点。很多RPG游戏能带队友能上战场，能带妹子上战场吗，不能。而我不光能，还能带三个。建议后面游戏队友常驻，培养才有意义
很多本该有点，失去的东西要补回来，其他也不一一多言，最后的最后，主创们需要对自己有信心，我们都也很努力，我们并不差，越在这个时候越要信心，越要有方向。什么叫如果还有后续，是一定要有后续。这样才不会失去市场，失去热度，失去喜爱玩家的支持，失去观望玩家的兴趣，失去本该是属于赵云传的玩家。不要说什么小团体，技术差，环境差，这个社会不同情弱者。我就很喜欢游戏里夏侯兰的一句话，乱世需下猛药，我要的不是合格的游戏，而是爆款，是破圈的佳作。

This game has just came out the week I'm writing this, many of the issues are currently being worked on, such as the Not taking any damage when using your skills. Glad that was fixed. But here are the Pros and Cons so far.

Gameplay: If you are a fan of games like Diablo/ Titan Quest but want something more fluid and Dynasty Warriors-esk then Zhao Yun is great. I am loving the fast paced action battles with great skills to use (I am currently in Chapter two and have not been on a horse yet). The dodge and block mechanics are very friendly. I don't usually play these faster paced style games but for Zhao Yun I thought I'd give it a try and I'm not disappointed. The Inventory system is generous with how much you can carry which I love. The shops seem little light with what I can buy but I'm sure that will change as I get further in the game and head to war. 

Language: So this is the big issue I have with the game so far. Though playing in the English setting, much of the game is still in Mandarin. Specifically all the tutorial screenshots that are shown are not in English and I can see a lot of people not wanting to put up with that. I myself am just using Baidu Translate App on my phone and taking a photo to translate and I can read everything. So if you are ok doing that for the tutorials then you will be fine. 

Story: If you are aware of the History or Story of either Romance of the Three Kingdoms or Dynasty Warriors you know where/ when the game will take place. I appreciate the build up of the story. You are still young and learning at the beginning, giving the story a well paced adventure. I haven't gone onto a battlefield yet but I am really looking forward to it. The characters you meet are fun and engaging. Each are given their own personality and story to be followed.

What I'm waiting on: There are a few things I am looking forward to the devs updating. More English translations would be great, especially in the important sections like Tutorials. There is currently a save glitch where you can't overwrite a save. That is tough to deal with but will be fixed i'm sure. 

This is an early draft and I will update my review as I go more into the story. I will say this game is currently recommended and the price is currently a steal.",1705969121,1705969121,True,5,0,0.565217375755310059,0,True,False,False

游戏总体而言还是能看到些诚意的，毕竟大量的剧情文本和中文配音感觉还不错。

不过说起游戏画面和操作，就不得不说几句，都2024年了，这个游戏还是走的多少年前原版的老套路，即使重制了，也没做到起码的使用目前最近（或者说是流行）的游戏技术。别扭的操作和打击感倒是继承了老作品的一贯感觉，这让最近在玩最新波斯王子的我感觉很不适应。玩游戏我用了XBOX手柄，配合震动感觉还凑合，但是抛去手柄用键鼠的话，手感真的很稀烂。是不是击中敌人是要看他们是不是少血，看中招后反应基本很难判定。不要说新的暗黑破坏神了，基本连和老的一些2.5D动作游戏相比都差很多。

A solid B-Quality game, plays like top down Dynasty Warriors. Recommend if you're a fan of three kingdoms and chinese martial arts. Dialogue and things are decently written, but you must be fully fluent in mandarin to understand it.

Pros
-Light RPG Features, not overly complicated
-Combat is simplistic but hack n slash is all good and fun
-Spears are cool, underrepresented in games
-Riding horses with spears are even cooler, plus you get to level up your horses, manage different horses and buy gear for them
-Horse combat is properly fleshed out with skills and movesets
-Spear/Bow/Sword + Horseback Spear/Bow/Sword, a total of 6 unique styles
-You get companions but so far they seem kinda useless and is a half-baked system, but they look nice and cool though, and you can equip them with gear (though you lose them soon anyways as companions change)

Cons
-Not great graphics (like mobile game level), but didn't expect it anyways
-If you're not a fan of three kingdoms history, there's little reason to play this game as its a generic hack n slash
-Not properly translated, but intuitive enough to pick up anyways
-Some optimizations and framerate issues during some missions (like probably only accounts for 5% of the game)

Don't go in expecting a masterpiece and you'll have fun.

Overall verdict: Despite being quite a simplistic game, the game doesn't overreach with content, so far from my experience there is no side quests - which i particularly enjoy because you're just focused on reliving Zhao Yun's life story rather than get bogged down with god forbid - a bunch of distracting side quests. There's some typical RPG systems such as horse management, gearing, gear enchantment, all great to have and not bloated with a bunch of useless extra systems.

For the price, I'd say its worth it to try out. On a dollar per hour basis I think it's well worth it",1705573701,1705747841,True,115,5,0.874001741409301758,5,True,False,False

没有过多的解谜难题，很多关卡都是很直接了当，不会太烧脑（对我这些老玩家来说很好），玩的时候很轻松，把体验专注在打怪和剧情上也是一种享受。培养系统不会太复杂，除了八卦炉不知道要怎么合之外，其他玩法一看就懂。

目前只玩到第四章，希望后面至少有10章左右。整体来说，8分吧。缺点就是过图读条太慢了，枪法派系太少，需要优化一下，单机游戏比我原神读条还慢就说不过去了。不过这价位来说，值了。

*更新，玩到第8章了，除了师傅给的武器，一个像样点的都找不到，也不知道怎么打造。画质，故事，配音已经不错了，建议把参考侠客风云传的养成，武学套路太少了。你要让人家玩的爽，至少你可以弄一套武学+武器养成，然后攻略几个女主。现在你用枪打完一遍，都不想用剑还是弓来二刷了。",1705717589,1705743694,True,1,0,0.481036067008972168,0,True,False,False

* Camera roll or like the ability to zoom in and out. To appreciate the character more and have full POV of the char and surrounding.

* Full subtitle with both playable character and npc, maybe even in the intro of the game if that is possible, with the songs and musics too. Because we all know Chinese has a mix of Poetry with their songs which is really awesome.

* Character equipped item appearance, with the option to hide/allow the headwear/headgear, and yes I own the other cosmetic through the dlc and might request a dragon companion too for future dlc.

* The big pause when having conversation with the quest/npcs. (When they're done with their chatter the chat box is still up for a few more sec unable to skip it fully.)

* Chat box where I can back read and check the NPC chatters, Loots, Exp, Coins, Dmg done and receive. (With adjustable opacity)

The game is a fantastic blend of western action loot rpgs and eastern storytelling. It is well crafted with well developed characters and story lines. the combat is enjoyable with a well balanced and quite deep skill tree.
each weapon type feels that it has a use in the gameplay mechanics without anyone type overshadowing the rest.
The graphics although not state of the art are quite refined and complement the world design and the story.
As for the translation of the story from chinese to english I feel that they managed to express all the nuances of the original text to the english one.
The only thing that  detracts from a more enjoyable experience is that I feel that the developers in trying to adhere to the release date they rushed the game and left almost all the flavor text and a lot of random lines from the main dialog in chinese. Another thing is that all the tutorials are left in Chinese. The same for a lot of tooltips.
I believe that if the had delayed the game a few more months to give time to the translators to do their job more properly the game with be perfect.

Story line is very typical, but writing is AMAZING. I kind of suspect they used some AI chat bot based on the performance of mechanic design team and art team of the game.

Game style: Lost Ark. Lots of move sets are copied from Glavior, Dead Eye (not sure. the archer i mean), and Paladin from Lost Ark.

Art: Straight ripoff of Total War：Three Kingdom. They even copied some of the icons from TW. Unless they were part of the art design in TW team, shame on them.

Pleasantly surprised, there's a few english translations missing in the tutorial but the subtitles and dialogue in general seem pretty good.

Graphics are pretty decent, fighting is responsive and smooth, there's been a few good bosses already and there's a pretty hefty looking skill tree and no shortage of loot (particularly chests that are semi-hidden around the levels.)

Bit of a warning I picked the middle difficulty and it's been a cakewalk so far but it's pretty hard to judge from just the first section, considering starting again on hard since I don't think I can change difficulty?
