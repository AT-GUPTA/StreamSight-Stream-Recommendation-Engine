[h1]Review:[/h1]
[h2]Your enjoyment of this game will depend on your experience with rhythm games.[/h2]
I will be writing this as a Touhou fan + casual rhythm game player (Mostly played Hard/Extra on old Danmaku Kagura)

Unless you purchased the unlock DLC, you will most likely be playing through story mode to unlock everything. In this case, just playing Story Mode in Easy/Normal is OK.

However, if you are trying to 100% Story Mode and unlock all the cards and characters, you HAVE to play Hard difficulty or Lunatic, and Hard/Lunatic is 6K instead of 4K. For people who can only hit 4K, this can be a big hit to motivation, as it may not be possible to unlock your favorite character/card.

[h2]Huge difficulty difference between Normal -> Hard (4K -> 6K):[/h2]
Easy and Normal is 4K (4-key, or 4 lanes), while Hard/Lunatic is 6K (6-key, or 6 lanes)

If there is an Easy/Normal version of 6K for beginners to get started and practice or Hard/Lunatic versions of 4K, that would be great, but as of this writing (25-2-2024), there is none.

As mentioned before, [b]there are characters/cards which can only be unlocked at Hard[/b] (at minimum, so 6K is required, no compromise), so please take this into consideration if you're a casual player.

[h2]Danmaku Stages:[/h2]
This mechanic is very unique, where you will use your left hand to play the rhythm game (A, S, D, F), and your right hand (Arrow Keys) to move your character for danmaku battles.

It's very fun at the simpler stages where there is only two lanes, but on stages where there are 4 lanes, there are reviews saying people will just randomly push all 4 keys instead, which I do not think is very enjoyable.

Also, the scoring in danmaku stages are extremely strict, and requires lots of min-maxing due to the lack of polish.

[h2]Overall:[/h2]
If you love Touhou and just want to play the music as a standalone rhythm game, then you can get this, even if it feels like around 50% of the content will be locked due to skill level. 

However, at present, I cannot recommend this game to my friends or other players unless they are huge fans of Touhou and/or are extremely good in rhythm games.",1708870984,1708879540,False,8,0,0.609377264976501465,0,True,False,False

It's definitely not the best designed game, for example I find the descision to make normal and easy 4k quite baffling. I played the game mostly on hard, and while I struggled reading some stuff due to skill issue, it was always my fault. 

The story is pretty good, even if the translation is slightly scuffed (It's certainly not ""Hades"" lol where did that name even come from). It's styled like a mix of visual and less visual novel part, and it reads... fine I guess. Also the ending is very sweet (I'm not spoiling it).

Within mere weeks of release they have added quite a lot of QoL features, which is very much appreciated. Adding stuff like quick setup on scroll speed. It's improved my experience quite a bit, escpecially for songs like ""sayonara. arigatou"" (I think it's called that), where the max reading speed was 400bpm, which is too slow for some players. 

Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys both rhythm games and touhou, however it's harder to recommend this game, especially compared to something like DJ max respect, It's still a 6k game after all (with pretty tight timing windows).",1708702024,1708702024,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False
2190220,159041389,76561198001916123,302,10,397,397,329,1708735380,"So to preface this, Rhythm Games are probably the genre I have the most experience with. My main game currently is SDVX, but I've played mobile rhythm games, desktop, and arcade. So I'm going into this game with a lot of experience.

I'd also like to say I pretty much exclusively play this game on Lunatic and exclusively the rhythm game, I'm not a fan of the danmaku mode, so I'll refrain from talking about that. 

The Good
- The songlist is phenomenal. Truly some amazing bangers in here. Would like to see more underground circles though, like SEVENTH HEAVEN MAXION and such. But still I love the songs chosen here.
- The charts. Genuinely, I probably like 90% of the charts in this game, even Unknown X. It seems like they got actually experienced charters to work on this game, so seriously love it there.
- The timing window. I am a fan of timing windows like this. Not insanely strict (looking at you, IIDX), but strict enough to where you need to actually get the hang of the timing window. After some hours playing, my accuracies went from 84% all the way to 91+, it just took some practice.
- The ability to not need to interact with the danmaku mode if you don't want to. I am a huuuuuge fan of this! I'm not into the danmaku mode, so I just don't play it. I don't know of the extent of this in the story mode, but if you don't like the danmaku mode you don't need to interface with it.

The cons may seem like a lot, but they're all minor and not really too bad for me. Just a forewarning.

The Bad (There might be some biases as there are some issues I am experiencing I am putting here. So take those specific issues with a grain of salt)
- I run this game through a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, and I am getting some weird moments where the audio stutters, and in bad cases the game does as well. I'm not sure if this is just me (as I use an interface, these have been known to cause issues with rhythm game audio drivers), but maybe it's worth the team look into this.
- Map offsets. This one's a minor gripe, as I never really noticed my accuracy shifting from map to map often. But I do notice in some maps the offsets are not as precise as they are in other maps. I have seen other people talk about this, it hasn't affected me much but worth pointing out.
- The UI, primarily around the story. When there is text discussing the situation, it looks a bit unpolished and could use improvement there.
- Actually I'd also like to say the story itself feels a bit boring because it's primarily text dump with a few art pieces here and there. If the entire game was in the style of small text with the characters (like after you perform a prayer), I would rate this higher.
- Score and Grades. I don't understand ... what the heck the grades mean? I know they're based on the score but what's the score based on? I feel like grades should be entirely based on my accuracy. Make me work for an SS. I have been getting SS's on nearly every song and I'm not that good of a player. I feel like SS should be for like 99%+, or maybe 95% since the accuracy is tight. 

I'm in love with this game, and the good outweigh the cons heavily since the good is all of the core of a rhythm game (minus the score, but there IS an accuracy result so that nearly makes up for it)

I haven't purchased any of the packs yet, but I will have to do that. I hope more music will come out in the future!

small issues:
-i didnt find a way to have a fixed scrollspeed for every single beatmap, making it so that i have to change the speed for each beatmap independently, 
-if you play a map that has a mission locking the speed of a map at a certain speed, this locked speed will be saved for the next time you play that map.
-Some people like the story aspect in a rythm game, some people dont, i first was reading it but after a while found it a bit repetitive and wanted to skip it but there is no skip button so it ends in me spam clicking for multiple minutes.

bug category:
-the pause menu in danmaku mode is far from perfect, blue score and red power pickups are not affected by pausing the game, same as some projectiles, i suspect that if the enemy that shot the projectile is dead then the projectile wont be affected by the pause anymore (and yes it causes damage to the player even in pause).
-the achievement asking for you to have all of the mitama cards didnt complete for me despite having a 100% collection, i suspect it is because the last one i got are from the shop in the village and not earned in battle, there is therefore no way for me to get this achievement anymore except resetting my save.

Aside of that, the game is very good, musics/arts are excellent and the gameplay feels good and responsive which are the most important parts of a rythm game. The art especially is something that was put a lot of effort into with some Live2D models that were implemented and almost every card having animation in the gallery mode.
enjoyed it a lot though i would say to wait for fixes/update or also wait for the game to be at a lower price if i had to fully recommend it in it's current state.",1708427752,1708427752,True,0,0,0.499390959739685059,0,True,False,False

Call me a hopeless whale if you want; there [i]are[/i] standards that can't be ignored on a $30 rhythm game when the Steam competition includes Respect V's regular $10 sale prices, EZ2ON hitting DanKagu's price range on sale, Muse Dash's ridiculously skewed content:price ratio, and Sixtar Gate, a similarly budget indie rhythm game that tries its best to carve its own identity. MD and Sixtar include a minority of Touhou songs nowadays while also staying within DanKagu's price range. If you only want to occasionally play a Touhou song in your rhythm game, please give some thought as to whether you still want to pay for DanKagu over other options on Steam.

DanKagu had [url=camp-fire.jp/projects/view/623672]a crowdfunding campaign that hit 193m yen compared to its 15m yen goal.[/url] Yet, it doesn't feel like this funding was put to good use. DanKagu is marred with a glaring lack of common VSRG features/QoL, horrid design decisions rendering the game outright hostile to players without 6K expertise, and an overall feeling of cheapness. At best, DanKagu is a passable VSRG; at worst, DanKagu's only draw compared to other Steam rhythm games is a strictly Touhou songlist.

It's been noted that DanKagu has a [b]±16ms[/b] timing window for Perfect judgement. These judgements alongside recent FAST/SLOW indicators are positioned below the judge line, and there's no option to move them anywhere above the judge line as is standard with many VSRGs. A recent stream with beatMARIO has shown they can be moved up there just fine for Kagura stages; hopefully this is pushed ASAP while trying to fight with the game's inconsistant sync.
Speaking of sync, the offsync is a Timing slider ranging from -50 and +50. Not ±50ms, just ""-50 and +50"". What does this actually mean? I have no idea given I haven't needed to adjust it on my 144hz monitor; but judging from other reviews, even a few ticks have a drastic effect on the game's broken sync.

If DanKagu raked in 193m yen through crowdfunding, where did all of it go? It certainly wasn't spent on making the planned 102 DLC songs free at launch with the base game's 68 (+ U.N. Owen Was Hero?) given the original mobage already had those songs, and this Steam release of DanKagu is clearly pulling the original's Mitama card art and cheap character Live2D. I'll never know whether that money went into song licensing or actually developing/fixing this game.
$30 is also [i]not[/i] cheap with the base game's paltry ~69 songs. This price tag feels like it was meant to pay for licensing and re-used Mitama card art. At least the DLCs have better value, being $14 for around 25-26 songs each, or potentially less through Digital Deluxe; but given the game's current state, I'd rather not bite without knowing which songs will make the cut.

So, with a timing window about as strict as IIDX, DanKagu should be a difficult game that still tries to capture casual players into the rhythm game sphere, right? Nope. See, while DanKagu songs consist of Easy, Normal, Hard, and Lunatic difficulties, Easy and Normal charts are 4K while Hard and Lunatic are 6K. This means the easiest 6K charts have ratings that would be in-line with the ""hardest"" 4K charts...except even Re: Unknown X's Normal 21 doesn't come close to matching some songs' Hard charts in density or complexity. This difficulty design rears its head in certain story mode stages that outright lock you to only Hard or Lunatic excepting, again, Re: Unknown X, which is magically given an exception because you'd otherwise have to contend with its final boss-level charts. All of this makes DanKagu an awful introductory experience into 6K, and a monotonous slog through boring charts if an experienced 4K player refuses to learn 6K just for this game.
Then suppose someone that already has 6K expertise picks up DanKagu. Leaving aside Re: Unknown X Lunatic, many Lunatic charts have questionable charting when coupled with the game's timing windows and sync issues. Failing that, the charts stick so close to fundamentals without spicing things up in any interesting fashion the way even low-end Respect V SCs and mid-range EZ2ON charts do.

This also ties into the broken balance of story mode's Kagura stages: there is little to no practical incentive to play a Lunatic chart to satisfy any given missions as all Hard charts can fulfill their conditions just fine (or Normal if 6K expertise is lacking; again, see above) and do not run into nearly as much risk of failing judge count missions or nuking your rank from a few misses. There's only personal satisfaction to be found with using a Lunatic chart at that point, but if story results don't count towards to Free Mode records and can't be reasonably ranked against others doing the same thing, what's the point of risking another retry on the same annoying stage gimmicks? This also doesn't account for constant Mitama card swapping to counter blue story mode stages using the same song you just played a couple minutes ago...
Danmaku stages are a complete failure in execution. Sure, it has been done with ONGEKI, but that game also finds a reasonable compromise in mixing rhythm and shmup gameplay; and when this is ONGEKI's only gameplan, it better play well. In contrast, DanKagu stages are a great way to become cross-eyed as you try to focus on both the shmup proper and 2/4 lanes of rhythm game at the extreme opposite sides of the screen. You'll end up just grinding out a specific Mitama card to nuke the bosses ASAP and nullify the rest of the shmup part, or you ignore the rhythm part after hitting full power...except when certain missions force you to juggle both lest the boss heals, or when you [i]don't[/i] want the boss downed while you're trying to generate point items from spamming bombs! Thanks a lot Hijiri.

The unvoiced story proper is slightly charming at best, patronizing at worst. Mommy Reimu goes to a Ephemeral village in Gensokyo's wasteland that's fixated on a bad lesson, forcefully lectures them on how that's wrong after getting a Sand Sorrow Sickness flashback, then leaves. Later, Marisa goes to that location to look for Reimu in a restored Gensokyo but only comes across Gensokyo residents inheriting Reimu's lesson to an extreme before leaving with a gift.
Lather, rinse, repeat 12 more times.
Most of the charm in these VN segments come from the CGs on Marisa's side or the scenarios themselves, ranging from Aunn breakdancing to break away from old traditions, Marisa ordering around the SDM residents who inexplicably converted the mansion into a hotel and slap her with a 1-star review as she leaves for being an awful guest, or Murasa preparing an apology/reflection letter in advance to give to Hijiri when the former crashes into Marisa to minimize wasting time on a lecture for both parties. Otherwise, Reimu's sections outright read like a book on social-emotional learning for children.

Lastly, the English translation is shoddy at parts despite being otherwise serviceable. ""Yuuhei Sateraito""? ""Hades"" for the Netherworld? I would just write off the translation if all of it was blatantly machine translated, then move on. I can't help but feel this is awfully in-line with the game's lack of polish.

For what it's worth, Unknown X is steadily improving the game; for example, a recent update implemented game-wide target scroll speed, and Mitama Cards search now looks for effect text. But regardless of the roadmap, DanKagu is just not worth spending $30 on as a pure rhythm game unless you're a Touhou fanatic with 6K expertise. It's doubtful a chart editor will fix the game's core problems given the inevitability of hyper-focusing on 4K in an attempt to fix its glass ceiling.",1708322165,1708322941,False,20,0,0.680875837802886963,0,True,False,False

(Many of which might be completely absent by the time you read this review) I'd give it an 8/10, could potentially become a 9 or even 10 with enough polish. If you really like touhou and like rhythm games, I'd definitely recommend it. But if you're a hardcore rhythm person who absolutely cant stand when the implementation isn't completely spotless, maybe not.

This review is going to be long, since a lot of it is responding directly to other criticism I've seen.

Since gameplay is the most contentious part of this game, I'll start with that first. To put it simply: the game is fun to play. The songs are engaging and have good charts, and I've spent 70 hours so far doing my best to master them, despite not being the biggest fan of the genre.

  The game launched in a... Somewhat rough state, As a novice to the genre, there were features lacking that I didn't miss, because I wasn't aware they were something necessary. But, people are right that things like a fast/slow indicator and automatic note timing adjustment were things that should've been in the game to begin with.

But, those things are in the game now. Saw what you will about what should've been included to begin with, I firmly believe that if Devs make necessary adjustments and listen to feedback, they deserve more chances- which is why I think most of the negative reviews that focus around these issues should really be reconsidered (Not that I think that'll happen...) And, there's still a laundry list of other fixes they have in the works- on a game that I honestly thought was fine to begin with!

If you don't want developers to abandon projects the moment they launch in a rough state, then you owe it to give this game another chance after a couple months of fixes, if you've already written it off.

Some of the decisions in the story mode are... Unusual, owing themselves to this game's equally unusual development out of a mobile gacha game. But, I don't think they're entirely without merit. I think a lot of the issues people have with the systems in story mode is owed to a more general lack of explanation about the game's systems, which is another issue that steps have already been taken to help. The story mode focuses around clearing missions with challenges to unlock cards featuring beautiful touhou art, with effects that modify the missions and help make those challenges easier.

This system itself isn't bad, and I felt compelled to try and collect most of them just by the art alone. Admittedly a lot of the card effects aren't super useful, but I've heard this system being compared to Smash Bros Ultimate world of light, and I truthfully think it's better implemented than that. Some of the challenges are poorly implemented or frustrating, and I wish some of the cards had less generic effects. But those are minor criticisms. I'd much prefer this implementation, where the art still has gameplay effects, instead of having them tucked away only in a gallery somewhere or not implemented at all.

Difficulty balancing can be an issue- the jump from Normal to Hard (4 lanes vs 6) and Hard to Lunatic (Tons more inputs at the same time with one hand) are massive jumps in difficulty, so if you struggle with overcoming big walls in difficulty that might be worth considering. But, when I increased my scroll speed and practiced for a bit, I was able to overcome the normal-hard barrier, so it's definitely possible- and was very satisfying when I did. It's worth noting that lunatic tracks feature some inputs that may be legitimately impossible on certain controllers, so if you're both a high level player and a controller player, that might be worth considering.

As for the story, it's... Serviceable. This game can't compare to the knockout home run something like Mystia's Izakaya offers in that department, but to be honest after experiencing touhou fanwork after touhou fanwork that uses horrible characterization. even a story that only does an alright job starts seeming great. I don't think any characters are terribly misrepresented, and although the story isn't super compelling, it does have fun beats that are enjoyable, especially if you're a fan of the two central characters (Reimu and Marisa)

The story actually does a really good job in an aspect many touhou fangames don't, and that's character representation. Touhou has an absolutely massive cast, which makes it a little disappointing when games instead choose to focus entirely on the same characters every time. Even if they aren't key players, just seeing a lot of more niche characters in story CGs or represented with songs and sprites makes me happy.

I do think that the story should be completely skippable for people who don't care for it, especially since a lot of songs are locked behind encountering them in story mode. So, if having to mash enter for a bit to skip past it if you really don't care for it is a dealbreaker, there's that.

For presentation, the UI is definitely clunky. I'm of the mindset that UI is important, and a great UI can actually offer a lot to a game, and should be applauded. But I also think that so long as UI is functional, its not too big of an issue- and it is functional. 

Beyond that, the art is fantastic (Although the live 2d implementation can be a bit weird in the song sprites) and the music choice is superb. An excellent balance of different genres, artists, characters... And, there's the original touhou tracks in here which I really appreciate, since not having them in something like spell bubble really bummed me out.

For price versus content, I think it's fine. Not exactly a steal like some other games (Mystia's Izakaya, my beloved...) But, if you complete the story mode and practice some songs, you'll get your money's worth. It's not egregious like some people make it out to be, especially in a genre that gouges your money sometimes. Compared to spell bubble, a 60$ full price game that arguably had less content... It's amazing.

The DLC is another issue, but I don't mind the day 1 song pack too much. Licensed music is... Expensive, which is why this genre, and especially its DLC often tends to be so overpriced. If you don't want this entire game to just be songs from the touhou games themselves, I don't think 1 piece of day 1 DLC is really an issue. And the DLC is priced well enough... Comparing it to song packs from most other rhythm games, its actually better value than most.

So yeah, I'd recommend this game.

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a bit of a rhythm game enthusiast and have drawn my line in the sand on what I look for in games like these and things I can or cannot overlook.

First of all a good rhythm game should have good rhythm game features. Dankagu simply does not. For a VSRG with relatively tight judgement windows, setting up the timing is an abysmal experience. The game does not give specific information on how early/late your hits are aside from showing up the number of how many hits were early/late. All you can do is then adjust your timing by some arbitrary amount and then see how you compare to your previous attempt. Key word is ""arbitrary amount"" as the timing configuration is a slider that goes from -50 to +50. What does this mean? Nobody knows. It doesn't seem like it's milliseconds as even changing it by 1-2 units feels way more significant than it should if you were simply adjusting it by 1-2ms. So it turns into this trial and error as you try and land yourself on that sweetspot.

The ABSOLUTE worst part of this is that the songs themselves do not seem to be consistently timed from the get go. What this means is that you might need -5 for one song, but +5 for another to hit somewhat consistently on beat. What the actual heck. It feels like whoever timed these charts just kinda eyeballed to be somewhere in the ballpark of ""on beat"" but for a game that, again, has somewhat strict timing judgements, this is simply not good enough. Having a per-song override would resolve this to some extent as the player could eventually time all of their songs themselves, but even that is missing from this game. This is by far the biggest painpoint of this game to me personally and it's really disappointing to see this game come out at this, somewhat steep pricetag, alongside with four day 1 DLCs and fail such a fundamental aspect of being a bare minimum rhythm game.

Another pain-in-the-ass genius idea that this game had is to make scroll speed BPM synced, and while you're able to change the multiplier and make it faster or slower according to your needs, you always need to do it on a song-by-song basis (since the BPM differs between songs = different scroll speed). Thankfully, for this, there IS a per-song override where it seems to save your setting, so once you configure it for any given song, you shouldn't have to change it every time you play that song again, but still, why can't we just have a toggle that lets us choose a single scroll speed value that applies to all the songs in the game? Ridiculous.

Other than that, the game just feels very cheap in its presentation, UI design and graphical assets. The little live2d illustrations of the characters that show up during gameplay are super jaggy and painful to look at. Story mode is super stretched out with massive amounts of text with a lack of consistency in how the story is told, with certain parts being just pure text, full-on book novel mode where character lines are marked by """" and the rest is some kind of narrator providing additional flavor to the situation, but it's inconsistent and sometimes what feels like it should be character lines aren't properly marked so you may think it's the narrator speaking, but then it doesn't make sense, so it has to be the character, so it becomes a headache-inducing stream of words that is hard to make sense of. Not to mention there seems to be a bug where some of the text lines get shown multiple times so you just end up reading the same thing over and over again until you realize the game has bugged out and UGH this is so painful. Some parts are acted by little live2d sprites of the various characters, which admittedly are somewhat charming and serve way better in providing clarity in the writing and story telling, but even these scenes aren't immunte to bugs. It seems that everytime some kind of effect gets added for additional impact, like screenshake or the character sprite jumping up in joy, these effects get stuck and just start looping until the scene changes. So you end up with a constantly shaking screen with character spazzing out. It's impossible to take this story seriously with that kind of garbage happening all the time and again, looking at the pricetag of this product, it's incredibly disappointing that this is the level of quality and polish that we get.

Danmaku mode is hilariously bad, I'm not even gonna go into detail, because it has to be some kind of sick joke that it exists in the first place, well played devs, good one.

I did mention that I managed to have a ""decent enough"" time and that was when I went into the Free Play mode and just started playing the songs ignoring the story progression and all the other crap. There's a great variety of Touhou arrangements to be had here and I really cannot complain much aside from the fact that over half of these songs came packaged in four 14 Euro DLCs in a product that is already priced at a steep base price of 29 euros. Songs are nice and some of the charts are genuinely fun. Another thing that pleasantly surprised me is that hitsounds feel very responsive and tactile making this probably the only VSRG where I can actually leave them on and don't mind them.

That being said, there is no way this game is worth the price of admission at its time. Developers did release a development roadmap where it seems like they're looking to address some of the issues I've outlined, but we'll see if they make good on their word. Right now this is a ridiculously bad offering and unless you're a complete Touhou junkie like I am, you're better off playing pretty much any other VSRG on Steam over this catastrophe.",1708174124,1708174124,False,29,0,0.719616472721099854,0,True,False,False

The story and artwork was cute, the boss battles were also quite cool (however when you defeat the boss they just.. sit there on the stage? I hope this gets changed at some point because it's not very fun just waiting there doing nothing until the song ends, it would have been a better option to at least continue attacking the boss to increase your score even if you've depleted all of it's lives.)

The repetition of the same songs in one area made it quite boring. The whole game itself just wasn't very interesting, and for the price it is I expected a lot more songs as well. Most songs that were originally in the free mobile game are available as 'DLC' here.. for an extreme price per pack. If this game was around £8 then it would make more sense.

The art in the entire game is amazing (the Mitama Cards especially).
DLC packs contain a ton of songs, half the price of the base game seems a little steep but personally I found it worth with the amount of songs you get comparatively.

- NO MORE GACHA/LIVE SERVICE LET'S GOOOOO.

- The songs selection is fantastic, some of the best song variety in any rhythm game. I thought this of the mobile version too.

- The art for the cards and jackets is fantastic. This, too, is something I thought with the mobile game.

- The gallery feature is something I adore. The simple fact we have a dedicated place for all the assets implemented in both the mobile game and the pc version for the future to come is super awesome.

- I really enjoy seeing so many characters and their little in-game animations. Renko and Maribel's animations are particularly adorable.

- A lot of the challenges are rather simplistic, but looking for the right card to counter the gimmicks and the right attribute to score high is kinda fun.

- The charting, at least in my experience playing Hard and low difficulty Lunatic charts, is really solid.
To name a few examples:

~ My Awaited won't Come's Lunatic chart is really fun to play, it has a lot of unique sections and rhythms, plus the last thrills are a very unique speed test.

~ The Murasa song's Lunatic chart is funky and bouncy, it fits the songs well.

~ snow amber's Lunatic chart masterfully uses the differently colored lanes to represent each vocalist/character, ending in a sequence of double taps that's both really entertaining to pull off and thematically fitting.

~ Hanipaganda's Lunatic chart is really unique for its constant use of triplets.

 I've heard some complaints that some of the higher level Lunatic charts are overcharted, but I'm not yet at that level of skill to properly judge.

[h3]With all of that said, there are also a few things I'm not the biggest fan of, for example:[/h3]

- I dislike how 3 of the 4 DLC do not have a revealed song list.

- The Danmaku Stages are a multitasking mess, and there are a lot of repeated Stages just with only a few more notes. The execution is really rough.

- I also share the opinion a lot of people have that this game has a problem of big difficulty spikes, mostly between Normal and Hard, but sometimes you see it in Hard and Lunatic (see: U.N. Owen was Hero?, Braking The Silence or an stoirm). 2 difficulties being 4k while the other 2 are 6k certainly doesn't help.

- I am not a fan of how this game relies on grinding to unlock songs (including DLC!!!). The game also follows the steps of DJMAX and Project Diva by adding an ""unlock everything"" DLC, which is kind of a dick move tbh.

- The narrative is beyond formulaic, you could even say you have to read the exact same scenario like 12 times. There's barely any new info each time, if any, so most of it feels pointless. The story is rather childish as well.

- The ending was kinda anticlimactic.

Now, moving on to:

[h1]Things I want to see addressed in future updates[/h1]

There are a few things that were promised for the future, so I won't include them (like note skins or customizable UI...):

- Scrolling speed being dependant on BPM is one of the dumbest thing I've ever seen in any rhythm game. I don't know how it is coded in the game, but, judging by the in-game UI, it seems that it uses a formula that uses the bpm and a multiplier to generate the scrolling speed value. I'm not sure how easy it'd be to implement, but it'd be nice if we could just pick the final speed value manually or if the bpm number in the formula was fixed (i.e. 150).

- It'd be helpful if we got a message for when scrolling speeds are going to change. A simple ""speed up/down"" message would suffice, similar to Cytus 2.

- Night Flight Believer scrolling speed changes are terrible. Please remove/rechart that section.

- It'd be nice if we could see our accuracy on the song selection screen alongside Score and Rank (outside of details).

- It'd help if we could label Mitama Cards as favorites and then filter them.

- It'd be nice if we had the option to make the lanes less wide, or even move it to the sides instead of being stuck in the center.

- I would want to be able to pick any heroine for Free Mode. I am aware not all of them can be used in the Danmaku Stages, but I really wish there was a way to pick any heroine of your choosing there.

- I would like the Groove Gauge to be adjusted. It increases and decreases very quickly, which means that you can fill it up just by playing a quarter of the song and missing a few notes means that you're already failing the stage. It should be more like Taiko no Tatsujin's or Groove Coaster's, where you have to fight to fill the gauge and missing a few notes doesn't put you in the red immediately.

- The judgement timings are currently very awkward. I don't know if it's a skill issue on my part, but sometimes I think I'm doing well only to be hit by a random Great all of a sudden. I think making the windows a little more lax should make the experience more consistent.

- It'd be nice if bullets were above your sprite instead of the other way around, because, as it currently stands, when bullets are very close to you you can't see them.

- I'm not a fan of the gradient effect whenever you hit a normal note. A more pronounced effect on the judgement line (i.e. like a sparkling circle) would look better imo. Let it be customizable, please.

- The translation is serviceable for the most part, however it needs to be revised because there are a few mistranslations here and there.

- Speaking of translations, PLEASE make an attempt to localize the title of several of the songs included in the game. A lot of the currently available songs have generally accepted translations in the fanbase and there are a lot of people willing to provide their own translations if necessary. Anything would be better than simply romanizing them.

- I'd like the Gallery to be expanded so we can see the backgrounds in more detail. Since the lanes aren't transparent anymore, we can't really appreciate them while playing.

- It'd be nice if the charter for each song could be credited in the song presentantion screen.

[h1]Nico's Strange Wishlist[/h1]

These are things that the game doesn't *need*, but I still personally wish to see (if possible):

- I hope all of the characters that didn't make it into the original game get at least 1 song in Phantasia Lost. I know a lot of them show up in the Story Mode, but I wish this doesn't mean they're discarded for the future.

- A 4k mode!!!
I am aware that the charting team isn't very big, but I still wish there will eventually be a 4k mode alongside the standard 6k. It'd be good for variety and pleasing all kinds of players.

- WHERE ARE THE CHIBIS!!! AND THE LIVE2D SPRITES!!!
The Gallery is one of my favorite inclusions in this version of the game, so I hope there will eventually be a way to see all of the chibis and Live2D sprites in the Heroine screen.

- Speaking of chibis, I know that this game focuses more on the Story Mode rather than the pet simulator aspect of the phone game, but I still would like to see the return of the locations and decorations where we could see the chibis hanging out. Maybe in the form of an optional post-game feature.

- It'd be cool if we could get thematic layouts/note skins. I know customization and note skins are on the way, but I'm talking about, for example, a layout themed around EoSD, or a note skin themed around the animal spirits, stuff like that. Similar to how DJMAX does it.

- Online vs mode!!!
This is the most insane request, and I will not complain if it never happens, however the whole being able to pick a character thing and the fact Danmaku Kagura is presented as a sort of rhythmic battle makes me think a simple scoring Vs Mode would work well.

Aside from the story line of the game which it does gives you a vibe of what's bringing in within story mode.

It'll take the required time for yourself to learn the beginning phases of this game yet in progress you'll be mastering the mechanics and enjoy the game overall.

2190220,158210026,76561198833327449,0,1,25,0,25,1707487043,"I really loved this game when it was on mobile, bar the gacha section of course, and I was excited to hear that the mobile game was finally going to be able to be played in English with this, but I lost hyped for it around the week of it's release and it ended up being some kind of sign. 

When I booted up the game there was no audio at all, and I looked over it thinking ""Oh this is like background information, I guess it doesn't NEED music or anything, then the first song started up and I found out that no audio was working for me, though it seemed to work for most other people, I saw other people bringing it up in the discussion forum, but I noticed they didn't mention a bug about the audio not working for some people in their bug fixing announcement, and after the update, and the audio still doesn't seem to work, which is pretty much makes this game unplayable, especially since it's a rhythm game. 

 Other than that major bug, I really hate that the game has locked some of the songs that were available on the mobile version behind DLC 1. Meaning without discount you'd be spending $30 USD for a game that less songs than it had.  If the DLC was just new songs to be added to the list, I wouldn't be complaining since that's reasonable. Additionally about the DLC, I am also not the biggest fan of the fact people who bought the Deluxe version pretty much ended up overpaying for what was the original mobile game for the next few months because of the DLC's coming in waves, which luckily for me I chose to stick to just the base version.

 I don't mind DLC waves shown that Mystia's Izakaya did that and I really love that game, but I just think that the deluxe pack that including the DLC's that wouldn't drop til months in the future just made people overspend for the game. 

Additionally, I haven't had a chance to try out the Danmaku stages yet, but according to some of my other friends who were able to play it, the controls for it is ""wonky"".

Additionally additionally, i'm very confused on the fact that the game on start up has a ""New Game"" and ""Continue"" option,  it feels like a very weird design choice that only makes me think more that this game is just a visual novel game with a mandatory Rhythm game section that was half assed and a Touhou coat of paint to get that sort of ""niche community"" hype, which also doesn't have voice acting at all, which IIRC the original version had voice acting, if not full voice acting then it at least gave the 2hu's SOME voice. 

It just feels like a failed successor to a game that I enjoyed playing to just kill some time on. This just isn't the rhythm game for me. 

2/10 - 
If you're a Touhou fan that just wants to play a game with great Touhou covers, i'd recommend Touhou Mystia's Izakaya. it even has a pseudo rhythm section in the game that's expanded in a DLC. Additionally in terms of money, you can get the game AND all DLC's for pretty close price to the base game of this.",1707804825,1707804825,False,3,0,0.482889741659164429,0,True,False,False

It's cool to have a Touhou Rhythm Game in its entirety that's not locked to a phone. The Touhou aspects of the game are very charming. It's cool to have a card of say, Dream Sumireko as she appears in Violet Detector. I love the song choices, and am also having fun with the charts. This is the game that's finally getting me to learn six lane play. I also liked the story mode and campaign a lot, and found myself going back to complete missions. BUT, there are a lot of problems with this game that prevent it from truly being one of the all time greats. Surprisingly, it's not a lack of content. I was actually satisfied with that. Instead, it's this:

-This game has HORRIBLE tutorials. Players don't know that there's a rock paper scissors system for cards, or that you aren't supposed to do all the missions of the campaign at once because this information is either not taught, or is hidden behind an overly long help screen that gives too much information at once. I think this is why a lot of people don't like the campaign: the game does a horrible job teaching its mechanics.
-There is no constant BPM setting or average (although the BPM of a song itself and the speed you change it to is listed). You can set a modifier for speed, but this is relative to the speed of every song in the game rather than a BPM for notes. So, you have to go through and modify the BPM for every note individually.
-The game has quite a few bugs. For example, I unlocked some achievements, but the game only checks for achievements when you hit the quit button. So when my game crashed, some of my achievements didn't save.
-The UI feels very mobile oriented still, so it's easiest to navigate with a mouse. This isn't non-functional, but it does feel very amateurish.
-There's quite a few translation quirks. The story revolves around the original Gacha Game's end of service, but this isn't translated over as the original talking point for it was a pun. There's also a few instances where objectives are reversed due to the shaky translation.
-While not a problem itself, I really hope the Bond Conversations from the mobile game get added in (those little convos between Touhou characters ala Fire Emblem supports).
-Not within the game itself, but I personally dislike the ""Unlock All Songs"" DLC a ton. You unlock songs through story mode already, so you're just playing to pay less of the game. This should've been a cheat code rather than something players have to pay for.

The devs have put out a roadmap of things they're going to fix, and they did put out a pretty significant patch Day 2. I'm happy this game will get better, but I also think it's completely understandable if you want to wait for a patch to iron out all the issues. That being said though, I still really enjoyed the game, and was happy with the $27 I spent on it.",1707780569,1707780569,True,2,0,0.523201823234558105,0,True,False,False

It was supposedly fairly well received at first (I wouldn't know firsthand, as I don't think it came to European playstores where I could have gotten it) but unlucrative in the end, so it died like that other one, Touhou Cannonball. It's somewhat amusing that the Touhou mobile game with the lowest production value is the only one able to survive. Lost Word is not the game we need, but what we deserve...
Touhou Danmaku Kagura Phantasia Lost is somewhat of a reimagining of that original mobile game with a new storyline and thankfully: Not a live-service that can die unless Steam itself died I guess. The scenario is very fitting and eerily meta, as it seems like Gensokyo had already crumbled into a sandy apocalypse, like it's the Gensokyo of a discontinued mobile game. The story is fairly appealing at first and not badly written, but falls into the trap of being very formulaic in its 10 or so episodes. The payoff that I won't reveal is also a little lacking, though the final boss's level was quite good.
Gameplay wise, there's Kagura stages and Danmaku stages. Kagura are notesheets that you play like Guitar Hero, etc. Since I have been a superfan and collector of Doujin music, I had a lot of fun playing these. You'll have many of the evergreens, ranging from joke songs like Cirno's Perfect Math Class to serious pieces of rock like Kishida Kyoudan & The Akeboshi Rockets - Brilliant Star Rocket. Even if I didn't care about the gameplay, the title would be worth having for the songs alone. The best discovery that I had never even heard of before playing this was Breaking the Silence by Get in the Ring.
Danmaku stages are a scrolling shooter that's very simplistic compared to the official Touhou games. You have to survive over the song's duration and complete missions for additional rewards. Defeating the boss in time may not actually be among those missions, which feels like a failure at first, but one must look past and adapt. While dodging bullets, there's still the occasional note to hit for points as you would in the Kagura stages. The blend of these gameplay elements is a little strange and overwhelming, but you'll get over it once you figure out that you hit the notes only for points and fanciness. you won't lose if you miss them. Overall, I enjoyed that mode too.
There are also RPG elements to the game in the form of Mitama Cards. This is actually the aspect of this title that feels the most influenced by mobile games, but it's not executed badly. I've yet to max out a card's level, but I wouldn't say it's especially grindy. Even a card that you haven't greatly leveled up can be helpful in passing a level if its trait matches the situation and side missions. Plus, it seems in free play mode, your current card will always be considered max level.",1707752308,1707752829,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

Firstly, the English translation is a bit rough. While this isn't a game killer, it leads to some aspects of the main campaign not being super clear, both in the story and in the missions required to fully clear different levels (for instance, sometimes a mission will say ""fewer"" when it means ""greater."")

Secondly, if you played the original Danmaku Kagura on Mobile Devices, you need to be aware that this is fundamentally a very different game despite using a lot of the same assets.

-The game has no voice acting, unlike its predecessor, though this is easily forgiven when you consider budgeting. A bit disappointing, but again not game breaking.

-A fair chunk of the original Dankagu's song list is currently missing, and will likely only come later in the paid DLC. This sucks for obvious reasons, but given I paid 60 USD for the base game plus all the DLC packs, I'm more or less fine with it given that's industry standard price. Others may NOT be fine with that however, especially if you are a longtime Touhou fan, as Touhou games have a tendency to run fairly cheap comparatively.

-The gameplay itself is considerably different in a number of ways. Overall, I personally see this as mostly positive with a few major drawbacks. The main Kagura mode is a lot more standardized now, and requires less extreme movements from the player compared to the mobile version, (which is good given when playing mobile, it felt like my phone would slide all over if I didn't put it on something to keep it in place.) The Danmaku mode has seen a total overhaul as well, and feels a lot less tacked on than it was in the mobile version imo, having gameplay more reminiscent of an actual bullet hell with rhythmic elements. These all sound like huge wins over the mobile version on paper, and in practice they sort of are...but also sort of aren't. For one thing, there's only four difficulties for each song in this game compared to the original Dankagu's five. This shouldn't be too bad, but the jump between Normal mode and Hard mode is simply too jarring, as the game suddenly goes from being a 4 key game to being a 6 key game, and there aren't really any precautions taken to help ease the player into the more complicated gameplay. If you're experienced with 6 key games already then it's all good, but if you're not then Easy and Normal are kinda hard to break away from, and it doesn't help that some of the stages in the main story mode outright FORCE you to play on Hard or higher. I have also heard from some other reviews that the game as it is doesn't take well to higher difficulties anyway, not being the best at handling a high volume of inputs. I have no expertise on this matter, as when I get to the higher difficulties here I frankly just tend to just mash until I find a winning strategy, but it's very concerning when a lot of the more challenging stages and difficulties in this game fundamentally rely on perfection. As for the Danmaku mode, while the gameplay is generally a very large step up from what it was in the mobile game, the rhythm part of the game being off to the far sides of the screen will absolutely trip you up if you can't adjust to recognizing color through your peripherals and reacting in turn. There's also less characters to play with general, which is disappointing, but also understandable given this game puts a lot more emphasis on the individual abilities of each character, compared to its mobile-bound predecessor where every character more or less equated to a skin of a basic template. Overall there's positives and negatives to be found here, but absolutely do NOT go into this expecting it to be 1 to 1 with original Dankagu, or even close to it for that matter, because it's not. 

-The game doesn't blend the main story mode and the free play mode super well together. You can either play through the main story to unlock songs, or use dream drops that you gain from clearing songs/stages to unlock songs without the need for Story mode (or you can pop an extra three bucks for the unlock dlc but lmao no.) The Story Mode may also not appeal to everyone, though I enjoyed it quite a bit myself, seeing it takes a much more dramatic, drawn-out VN-styled approach compared to your usual simple Touhou plot, and having it feel more or less necessary to really get into the actual rhythm parts of this rhythm game isn't fantastic. Additionally, the way in which you're meant to fill out your collections of unlocked characters and song jackets is incredibly unclear. Any character or song you come across in the main Story Mode unlocks in your collections pretty much immediately upon giving em a go, but that doesn't account for DLC, which does NOT appear in the Story Mode as far as I can tell and only appears in Free Play. So while the DLC characters and jackets evidently ARE included in the in-game gallery/collections, there's no discernable way of actually UNLOCKING them for viewing, and the game does not clear this up at all.

With how specific and long-winded I've been with my criticisms here, you might think ""wow he really doesn't like this game,"" but no, I LOVE this game, and that's exactly why I'm so critical. Despite everything, it still has the style and music that's won my heart over for so many years, it still has a very solid structure as a game both in gameplay and general progression, and it's still a game that I can easily pick up and revisit any time I want some rhythm fun after having cleared the main story. There's some very glaring issues here, and I don't want to understate that, but it's also not enough to dissuade me from calling this a must have for Touhou fans and Rhythm gamers. Just be aware of what it is you're purchasing when you purchase this game, and hopefully you'll enjoy it just as much as I have.",1707659031,1707659031,True,0,0,0,0,True,False,False

I hate to say it, but this game needs the gacha, or a new system, to supplement that gaping hole we have now. Currently, the game is fine as it is; however, there is a severe lack of motivation to play the story mode.

   The Danmaku gamemode is honestly very bad in its current state without proper cards, which you could get from a bit of grinding the gacha in the mobile version. while also complicating it more than it used to be, the gamemode itself is not as bad as I thought it would be; however, it isn't very good either. The story itself seems pretty generic and uninteresting at the current time, and I don't really think it would be worth completing. Who knows?

   The only part of the game I am playing as of now is the free mode, and although some people criticize the need to grind for songs, I find it very mild compared to other rhythm games I have played, and I do not see a need for it to be changed. Regarding the number of songs and difficulty, I would have to say that if I were not an avid rhythm game player, it would be a nightmare. The difficulties can vary drastically, even for a multi-key game. I haven't touched the lower levels; however, the higher-ranked levels vary drastically in difficulty and seem rather inconsistent.

   All of this is stacked onto the very limited number of songs we have currently; if I did not buy the most expensive bundle, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME! There is too little for the base price and very limited content. I hope we will be getting updates and consistent ones at that, but unless you get this game for $15 or less, I would say it's a waste of money. Hopefully, in the future, I can change my opinion of the game, but as of now, it is not worth it for basically anyone.",1707629832,1707629832,False,2,0,0,0,True,False,False

Glad this game rose from the ashes of its fallen mobile predecessor, but... It's rough around the edges, especially for an experienced rhythm gamer. I also wasn't expecting 3 of the 4 DLC songpacks to be ""coming soon!"" placeholders. (I'm fine with songpack DLC for a rhythm game, but this is basically an a la carte season pass, which feels... awkward?)

[h2]tl;dr[/h2]
Check back in [strike]a year[/strike] a few months from now for QoL improvements.

[h2]Issues[/h2]
- Lanes feel way too wide in fullscreen, and the default noteskin certainly doesn't help! (more are supposedly on the way, though)
- Scroll speed is based on song BPM, not a fixed rate. This means [b]you'll be setting a different speed modifier for every song[/b] (or at least, a different one for 130 BPM songs vs 200 BPM songs). At least there's a live preview on the global/song options screen! ...But the preview is a lot smaller than the actual gameplay screen, so it's not terribly useful for gauging whether something is too fast or too slow.
- [b]Cannot adjust scroll speed mid-song[/b], which especially hurts when you consider that you have to fine-tune it on a per-song basis.
- [b]No way to preview/test your sync offset[/b] aside from manually playing, and you don't really get any units of measurement to work with like frames or milliseconds, just ""number feel good"" vs ""number feel bad"".
- [strike][b]No early/late (or fast/slow) indicators[/b], which makes the previous offset adjustment complaint hurt that much more. (The dev roadmap does say there'll be tap accuracy info coming later on, which helps, but this only applies to the results screen, not mid-song.)[/strike] (they added this a couple of days after release, hell yeah)
- [b][i]☢ CAUTION!![/i] ☢ Charting is NOT controller friendly on Lunatic![/b] Lots of heavy usage of 1+3/4+6 chords, which would require holding dpad left+right (or square+circle) at the same time. Not a problem for keyboard players, but worth keeping in mind if you're a controller main.

[h2]Small Tech Nitpicks[/h2]
[i](these don't make the game entirely unusable, but they're still kinda annoying)[/i]
- When the game loses focus, it basically becomes suspended in time (no animations play/progress, the ""are you sure you want to erase your save?"" prompt doesn't count down, etc)
- Also, when the game loses focus, it doesn't seem to update its location in the alt-tab list, so it gets buried a few slots back? 
- The resolution list is pretty barebones. For example, it doesn't have 2560x1440, it just jumps right from 1080p to 4K. (...and resolution doesn't even matter for borderless windowed, but it's still configurable)
- Keyboard icons are WAY too close to their text labels in the UI, while controller button icons seem to be spaced okay.
- Some awkward English word choices in the UI (""Item 1"" and ""Item 2"" for the sub-menus underneath Kagura and Danmaku settings, when ""Page 1"" and ""Page 2"" would sound much more natural)",1707350603,1707608871,False,119,1,0.841458022594451904,0,True,False,False

- The voice acting (that the original got) is gone here.
- There are no online leaderboards.
- The Danamku mechanic is more complicated than it was originally. Not only that you have to move left and right, dodging the opponent's danmaku, and shoot your opponent. But you also have to do some Kagura, WHILE you're doing all of that.
- Unlike the original version, there isn't an option to customize and decorate the locations... Customizing and Decorating the locations in Gensokyo was one of my favorite things to do in Danmaku Kagura, and it's a shame that it didn't return here.
- That low chance of making the characters have a party somewhere and got drunk, and you'll be able to get free stuff from them at that point from the original game? I believe that will never happen here...

There are more than a few things I think the game could have done better though, so in no particular order:
[list]
    [*]The groove gauge (sort of a life/win condition meter) drains way to fast in my opinion. More than any other rhythm game, I could be on track for a B or A rank, but suddenly at the end I miss a few notes, and the game considers I failed the stage, it's honestly really frustrating (yes I know, ""skill issue"").
    [*]Normal difficulty is also only played with 4 keys instead of the 6 keys you play in hard difficulty. This isn't necessarily bad... but the difficulties can be soo vastly different. For me, a lot of the normal difficulty can be boring, but the hard difficulty can also be too difficult (even though there is also a lunatic difficulty). So really, I think there should have been 5 difficulties, because the difficulty spike for many of them seem a bit much.
    [*]Note speed is also at a static amount unless you manually adjust it. In most rhythm games, the note speed would be a dynamic amount that scales with the song's bpm. Because it is static, on a high bpm song, all the notes will be very close together, very overwhelming and almost unreadable, unless you adjust that speed yourself. In general the notes can also be hard to read.
    [*]The danmaku stages are fun, interesting, but messy. The thing that sticks out the most though is that if you kill the boss early, they sort of just sit there in the middle of the screen not doing anything for the rest of the song... meaning you will also be sitting there doing very minimal as well. I think it would be better if the boss kept fighting until the end of the song, where they explode if their health is zero, and any damage dealt after their health is drained would go towards an ""overkill"" bonus. Or something like that, really anything would be better than just sitting there doing nothing lol.
    [*]The hitbox for your playable character can be very vague during danmaku stages, would love a way to see the hitbox.
    [*]Some other things in the game can also be quite unclear, such as unlocking characters, certain missions with quotas you can't track...
    [*]I wish there was a quicker/automatic way to select an optimal mitama card for whatever stage you're playing. Especially since some stages penalise you for using certain types of cards or have gimmicks you might want to reduce the effects of, you are incentivised to switch, but having to scroll through all the cards is a bit of a tiresome.
    [*]The story is very repetitive, intentionally so, and it still has some great moments, but after a while I just start skimming over anything to do with the ephemerals in the story.
[/list]

There are some other minor things as well, but the game is still getting updates, including some that should solve some of these issues, and overall if you're a big touhou or rhythm game fan, I'd still recommend the game lmao",1707451085,1707452081,True,2,0,0.536921143531799316,0,True,False,False

There's a good lineup and the DLC is much more fairly priced than the other aforementioned licensed rhythm game option.

What I do know about is rhythm games, and this game is fantastic.  Awesome button mashing rhythm gaming with an awesome anime style music soundtrack that is incredible.  Levels of difficulty are there for the hardcore enthusiasts, however there's a lack of leaderboards which is a bit disappointing.  Hopefully this is something that will be implemented in future updates.  The only other complaint I have is the scoring system for songs in the ""campaign"" of the game.  You have to level up your character cards in order to obtain a higher score.  With a level 1 card, you'll be lucky to earn a B rank on a song with a full combo, however the scoring system within the ""Free Play"" area is done normally where you can obtain score based on your actual skill level.  Regardless of the scoring issues, this game is well worth it if you're into the genre.  Will be picking up every song pack that gets released.

I noticed this thing after playing few songs, even though I have a global setting at 1.7

[*]No early/late indicators and bizarre judgement
Excludes the cases of skill issue, I have no idea how many notes I've hit too early or too late, and it can be difficult for players who aim for AB (All Brilliant) even FP (Frame perfect)

[*]Unknown amount of score to reach certain score rank

The new pc version takes aspects from the original mobile one, but also leaves some out. The mobile version had 5 difficulties per song while this version now only has 4. This wouldn't be so much of a problem except for the fact that with this change, the jump between difficulties has also changed. Easy and Normal mode feature 4 key maps while the Hard and Lunatic feature 6, which changes the game entirely. This also has the adverse effect of making the difficulty ratings misleading because in almost all cases, a song with a Normal difficulty of 17 is easier than a song with a Hard difficulty of 16. The scoring system is the same as it was in the mobile version where you would start out only able to achieve a C rating at best but you would slowly build up your cards and characters to allow you to reach SS ranks. However, this system worked in the mobile version due to the nature of gacha in it. You would get on, do a bit of daily grinding, maybe do some pulls with what you've saved up and get that feeling of progression. Phantasia Lost forgoes the gacha system in exchange for story challenge stages. The game is thus in a weird spot where you are incentivised to grind in order to reach high scores and complete challenges, but also lacks the incentive to do just that. The gacha system works because you are brought back day after day with a feeling of accomplishment from getting just ever slightly stronger but when the progress is just vomited out at you with no restraint and no daily pull, it feels more like a chore even though the gacha grind is designed to be a chore itself. Moving on to the challenge stages, they tend to be either one of two things: a mild difficulty increase through requiring you to be a bit more precise and absolute hellish torture that prevents you from seeing anything or forces your notes to fall so fast you're basically playing it with them fully invisible. Speaking of that, The game also suffers from another problem not present in the former mobile version: the note fall speed. As with most rhythm games like this, you are allowed to change the fall speed of the notes, however in Phantasia Lost, this speed is inconsistent between songs as it appears to base itself off of the current bpm of the song. Additionally, when the bpm changes mid-song, so does the fall speed. This was a feature of the original Danmaku Kagura, however it is more pronounced here in Phantasia Lost and is ultimately more jarring due to the previously stated fall speed issue. Phantasia Lost seems to be designed for more hardcore rhythm game players with little in store for the more casual market the original aimed for. In some more positive light, the danmaku mode for Phantasia Lost feels better than it did on the original mobile version, however it comes with the downside of adding a mini rhythm game to it that keeps shifting your focus from the attacks on the screen to the poorly placed note lanes on the outer sides of the screen. Don't get me wrong, I like this addition, it's jus unfortunate that with the current interface for it, its more of a distraction than a fun gameplay feature. All in all, I think the most pressing issue is the fact that due to the difficulty jump added in with the shift to pc, there isn't very much room or incentive for people to grow and play the harder difficulties, which is a shame considering they all tend to have well designed and fun beatmaps. If you don't have the prior skills to start this game playing from Hard mode at the beginning, you probably will never play anything other than Normal mode. The difficulty curve was well balanced on mobile, but with the new Phantasia Lost system, it appears to have become a difficulty wall, with hardcore players on one side and new, casual, and experienced ones on the other.",1707398169,1707398169,False,20,2,0.638277053833007813,0,True,False,False

As it is, the current game have major flaws and it greatly impacts the gameplay experience.

Even though it is rhythm game, the offset ever slowly drifts into fasts and snaps into its original timings after it drifts enough. This causes the player to get less than perfect judgements like GREATs or even combo break.

In addition to this, the game also cannot handle fast inputs, and this is especially evident on very high level charts. The game would delay any inputs it could not handle, and it would then affect the player's judgement in-game. PERFECTs can be downgraded into 1 or more judgement down even when timed well and with proper hardware. In the most difficult chart of the game, proper timings can result in MISSes due to this delay.

Outside these, the gameplay can still be an ok experience, and listening to Touhou musics on itself is a treat.",1707371926,1707371926,False,23,1,0.638462424278259277,0,True,False,False

The musical variety is strong, the varying gameplay styles provide an interesting change of pace and novel twist on the basic six key formula, the presentation is surprisingly elaborate in ways it didn't really have to be and there's plenty of Content, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I think the charting expresses the character of its songs fairly well, in terms of difficulty I would say it peaks a fair bit lower than something like DJMax and certainly EZ2On, but that's also fine since the story mode hurls a bunch of gimmicks at you to increase the challenge. This will probably be divisive because I love my gimmick readings whereas others apparently find them to be an instant turnoff because they are cowards, but whatever floats ones boat.

probably my biggest two issues are that the UI for team management is cluttered and awful due to being borne of gacha games and gacha game UI design is made to be bad on purpose and it's clear the team haven't really kicked the habit since leaving that space and the fact the scroll speed adopts the DDR system where it's based on a multiplier of the song's BPM so you need to perform mental math for every single song individually to figure out your multiplier. I'll live, but it's burdensome and kind of bizarre to see in a modern music game, the last game I saw that did that was DJMax Respect's initial Steam release which was like four years ago or something. Still, that was eventually patched to something more Normal so there's hope for this here too.

Two different types of stages:
Kagura stages which are typical music game stages on a 6 button layout, easy/normal only use 4, hard/lunatic use 6 
Danmaku stages which are either 2 or 4 lanes you hit notes with one hand and use arrow keys to move a heroine while dodging. they have no difficulty options.

You have a neat story mode with various stages you can unlock songs for play in a free play mode. songs can also be unlocked via ingame currency. danmaku stages are not playable via free play.

Game has four difficulty modes, Easy Normal Hard and Lunatic. Easy and Normal are exclusively 4K modes, while Hard and Lunatic are 6k. The jump between the difficulties is quite harsh, at least for me who loves 4k but never really played 6k in his spare time. Meaning if you like 4k you will be put to sleep by most songs on Normal, while sweat and fail a lot on Hard.

The scoring system itself is very punishing. The judgement is harsh and game really wants you to rack up those combos. The points themselves reflect the rank you obtain at the end of the song, however the ranking doesnt scale with the difficulty. So far i can barely obtain B rank if i full combo a song on normal. The setup (character + card) change how the song is played, but with the judgement being harsh the increased note window is your best bet until you grind more. 

There is missions on each song, let you unlock more powerful cards for characters (who seem relatively easy to unlock most of the time, not all though). These cards improve their abilities in danmaku mode, or improve your score/make scoring easier/negate some effects of gimmick stages.

Danmaku itself is interesting. Its difficult not because of bullet patterns but because you also have to play a rhytm game while dodging bullets. Im not sure how it works yet, but i can relatively easily clear stages. Not saying i can defeat the bosses though, these are bullet sponges you're often meant to grind towards. 

Overall it seems like a fun game. A decent selection of songs, some questionable choices for DLCs though (some tracks from main series games and fighters are behind DLC, kinda expected them to be in the main game but guessing ZUN doesnt have enough money still). Base game is quite pricey, but it seems to have enough content to justify it. DLCs though, i'd wait for a sale.",1707336528,1707349053,True,13,0,0.677923381328582764,0,True,False,False

The base game version there's a lot of songs to play e all graphics are pretty good. 

The game there's some game modes like Danmaku. This game mode is a mix of Touhou danmaku and rythm games, I never have seen this before and it's so fun to play.

I really was impressed with the variety of songs in this game, there's a lot of doujin circles with different level of popularity, it's literally impossible you don't like of some song. 

Unfortunelly this game there's a lot of DLCs, but expand a lot the songs you can play and really worth it. The price of game (including all dlc) isn't cheap in my country, but I was saving money for this momment and worth each cent.

I have played similar bullet hell games that simply have game overs if you die. But however with that out of the way let me say my stance now.

Story Mode:
I'm currently working on trying to 100% Chapter 1, However, there is something i've noticed. First things first, the score system for Story Mode is VERY HARSH, buffing the requirements for each rank by a lot when compared to Free Play. I get it's because of you needing to build a strong team but seriously, in the early game, this makes quite a few Stars impossible to get until later on, for example getting A Rank on 15 of World 1, Plus on Hakurei Shrine 03, there is NOTHING that tells you HOW you get the 3rd STAR! Like, if you're going to add more than 2 stars, AT LEAST give us a hint for the 3rd star!

Free Play:
Now, Free play is where the true rhythm game format shines. It removes the harsh score system story mode has and allows you to play through every song. Only issue is, it only shows the Kagura (Rhythm Mode) Stages and NOT the Danmaku (Bullet Hell) stages. I do not know if you'll unlock them after you COMPLETE Story Mode but I'll update this once I find out.

Honestly, to be fair, for a game that only released today, it is a very good game that brings together Rhythm games and TOUHOU + It's bullet hell gimmick with it's distinct Danmaku Stages. At my current stage, I do not know if you can unlock the Danmaku Stages in free play nor if there's a way to do them on Harder Difficulties than the default one Story Mode gives you.

while this is a port of the mobile game- theres way too many changes for it to be all that comparable to it (originally 7k now 6k, type of notes changed due to it.. not being touch screen lmao, no HP in rhythm game mode, danmaku mode being completely different, etc).. I played the original, and would say i prefer it purely bc i prefer mobile rhythm games, but this is a pretty fun pc rhythm game. combining stat raising alongside a decent story is.. kind of not that common for non-gacha rhythm games, i dont think i know of one off the top of my head. adding danmaku to that is definitely pretty unique- there are other boss fight styled rhythm games, but i dont believe any others have actual danmaku in them. I personally find the danmaku stages extremely overwhelming, but thats just a skill issue. even if you struggle with rhythm games, it lets you play the stages in any difficulty mode you want, so its (relatively) beginner friendly.
all in all if your a rhythm game fan, i recommend trying it out purely due to how unique the gameplay is.

Anyways, review: Its great! Its a very simple 6 key mania game. I personally suck at it bc im not used to 6 fingers playing a rhythm game (I usually play mobile rhythm games thats why). But i enjoyed this game a while ago and I still enjoy it now!! Can't wait for more songs to be added (please add Bloody Devotion I BEG).
